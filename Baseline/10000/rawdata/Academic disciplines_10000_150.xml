'''''A Time for Singing''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with music by [[John Morris (composer)|John Morris]], lyrics by [[Gerald Freedman]] and John Morris, and a book by Freedman and Morris. The work was based on [[Richard Llewellyn]]'s novel of a Welsh mining village, ''[[How Green Was My Valley]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gilvey, John Anthony. ''Before the Parade Passes By: Gower Champion and the Glorious American Musical.'' Page 155. St. Martin's Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The show takes place in the memory of Protestant minister David Griffith, recalling conflict within the Morgan family over the possible formation of a miners' union within the village, and the romance between Griffith himself and Angharad of the Morgans, who ultimately marries the mine owner instead.
The show starred [[Ivor Emmanuel]] (as David Griffith), [[Tessie O'Shea]], [[Shani Wallis]] and [[Laurence Naismith]]. 

The original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production began a series of ten previews at [[The Broadway Theatre]] on May 12, 1966, and opened officially on May 21, 1966, running for a total of only 41 performances. It closed on June 25, 1966.

An [[Alexander H. Cohen]] production, it has been called "probably the best musical he ever produced."&lt;ref name="Mandelbaum"/&gt; Cohen used an "extravagant publicity machine" to bring attention to the show, with the first 100 ticket buyers receiving "folding chairs and a picnic lunch catered by the Brasserie restaurant."&lt;ref name="Mandelbaum"/&gt; 
Ken Mandelbaum argued that ''A Time for Singing'' pointed the way to later grand musicals like ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' and ''[[Grand Hotel (musical)|Grand Hotel]]'' in both its staging and its music, which was "richer and more serious" than other shows of the period, with a "cinematic fluidity and continuous movement" that later became common in 1980s musicals.&lt;ref name="Mandelbaum"&gt;Mandelbaum, Ken. ''Not Since Carrie: Forty Years of Broadway Musical Flops.'' Pages 298-299. St. Martin's Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theatre Historian [[Gerald Bordman]], however, acknowledged the musical's "fine choral singing" but stated that 
the music the singers were given was drab and did little to enhance the grim story of the Morgan family's tribulations".&lt;ref&gt;Bordman, Gerald (2001). ''American Musical Theater: A Chronicle''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513074-X}}, p. 705&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bing Crosby]] recorded two songs from ''A Time for Singing'' for [[Reprise Records]] on May 9, 1966, with the [[John_Keating_(musician)|Johnny Keating]] Orchestra and Chorus: "Far From Home" and "How Green Was My Valley." They were released as a single.&lt;ref name="Crosby"&gt;Bing Crosby Discography. http://www.jazzdiscography.com/Artists/Crosby/crosby1c.html&lt;/ref&gt; Stereo versions of the songs were released in 2010.&lt;ref name="Crosby2"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/So-Rare-Treasures-Crosby-Archive/dp/B003FXXNTE&lt;/ref&gt; A remastered CD of the original Broadway cast recording was issued in a limited edition by producer Bruce Kimmel on his Kritzerland label on April 3, 2013.

'''Air barriers''' control air leakage into and out of the [[building envelope]]. Air barrier products may take several forms: 

*Mechanically-attached [[membrane]]s, also known as [[housewrap]]s, usually a [[polyethylene]]-fiber or spun-bonded [[polyolefin]], such as [[Tyvek]] is a generally accepted moisture barrier and an air barrier ([[ASTM]] E2178).
*Self-adhered membranes, which are typically also a water-resistant barrier and a vapor barrier
*Fluid-applied membranes, such as heavy-bodied paints or coatings including [[polymer]]ic based and asphaltic based materials
*Closed-cell medium density spray-applied [[polyurethane]] foam, which typically provides insulation as well
*Some open-cell spray-applied [[polyurethane]] foam that are of high density
*Boardstock, which includes 12&amp;nbsp;mm plywood or OSB, 25&amp;nbsp;mm extruded polystyrene, etc.

Air barriers are divided into air barrier materials, air barrier accessories, air barrier components, air barrier assemblies and air barrier systems.

'''Air barrier materials''' – Building materials that are designed and constructed to provide the principal plane of airtightness through an environmental separator, which has an air permeance rate no greater than 0.02 L/(s•m²) at a pressure difference of 75 [[pascal (unit)|Pa]] when tested in accordance with [[ASTM]] E 2178.  Air barrier materials meet the requirements of the CAN/ULC S741 Air Barrier Material Specification.  The air barrier materials are typically the "big" pieces of material used in an air barrier assembly.

'''Air barrier accessories''' – Products designated to maintain air tightness between air barrier materials, assemblies and components, to fasten them to the structure of the building, or both (e.g., sealants, tapes, backer rods, transition membranes, nails/washers, ties, clips, staples, strapping, primers) and which has an air permeance rate no greater than 0.02 L/(s•m²) at a pressure difference of 75 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] when tested in accordance with [[ASTM]] E 2178.  Air barrier components are used to connect and seal air barrier materials and/or air barrier assemblies together.

'''Air barrier components''' – Pre-manufactured elements such as windows, doors and service elements that are installed in the environmental separator and sealed by air barrier accessories and which have an air leakage rate no greater than 0.20 L/(s•m²) at a pressure difference of 75 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] when tested in accordance with [[ASTM]] E 2357.

'''Air barrier assemblies''' – Combinations of air barrier materials and air barrier accessories that are designated and designed within the environmental separator to act as a continuous barrier to the movement of air through the environmental separator and which has an air leakage rate no greater than 0.20 L/(s•m²) at a pressure difference of 75 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] when tested in accordance with [[ASTM]] E 2357.

'''Air barrier systems''' – Combinations of air barrier assemblies and air barrier components, connected by air barrier accessories, that are designed to provide a continuous barrier to the movement of air through an environmental separator, which has an air leakage rate no greater than 2.00 L/(s•m²) at a pressure difference of 75 Pa when tested in accordance with ASTM E 779 or CAN/CGSB 149.10 or CAN/CGSB 149.15.

== Air barriers and water vapor ==
Some air barriers may be [[water vapor]] permeable, while others perform the function of a vapour barrier. This is because water fits through narrower pores than the other main constituents of air, [[oxygen]](O2) and [[nitrogen]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. &lt;!-- Here's a great explanation by [[User:Jayron32]], from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=252561510 : For atoms and molecules, they aren't all going to line up, they are constantly tumbling and twisting, so its not the SMALLEST dimension that matters, it's the LARGEST dimension.  In the case of dioxygen, the longest dimension is larger than that of water vapor.  Doing a quick search, the O-H bond length in water vapor is expected to be about 95 picometers, and in dioxygen its 121 picometers.  Likewise, the atomic radius of hydrogen is 25 picometers and the atomic radius of oxygen is 60 pm.  I know that these are not truly additive, but doing a [[fermi calculation]] or [[spherical cow]] type approximation should at least show that the O=O size in dioxygen (60+121+60 = 241) is much larger than the O-H size in water (25+95+60 = 180).  It turns out that at these scales, [[molar mass]] is as good of a first approximation to molecular volume as any; one generally only considers that when judging the "size" of a molecule; and under that test, dioxygen (32) is much larger than water (18). --&gt;

==Activities==
AICE maintains a database that containing joint U.S.-Israel activities.  The database includes recipients of grants from the [[Binational Science Foundation]] (BSF), the Binational Agricultural Research and Development Foundation (BARD) and the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation (BIRD).&lt;ref name=about-aice/&gt; Its Economic Partnership Databank contains information on more than 10,000 U.S. companies doing business in or with Israel. To address the critical need to develop new scholars and place established Israel scholars on campus, AICE has created the Israel Scholar Development Fund (ISDF). Some of their other major projects include bringing Israeli professors to teach Israel-related courses on U.S campuses, supporting visiting Israeli scholars teaching in the US.

===Visiting Israeli Professors (VIPs)===
AICE fellowship program, "Schusterman Visiting Israeli Professors",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel |url=http://www.schusterman.org/interests/israel/schusterman-visiting-israel-professors |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140510224508/http://www.schusterman.org/interests/israel/schusterman-visiting-israel-professors |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 May 2014 |work=Charles &amp; Lynn Schusterman Family Foundation |accessdate=10 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; brings Israeli academics to American campuses&lt;ref name="haaretz.com 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=The year BDS became the number one concern for American Jews | website=haaretz.com | date=December 27, 2014 | url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium-1.633972 | access-date=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to ensure that expertise in the field will continue to be available from Israel while expanding within the United States. Visiting Israeli professors come from the Israeli universities [[Hebrew University]], [[University of Haifa]], [[Tel Aviv University]], [[Ben Gurion University]], and [[Bar Ilan University]]. In 2008, AICE financially assisted 29 Israelis (26 professors and three postdoctoral fellows) offering 70 courses in 27 universities throughout the United States and a further 11 graduate fellows and two postdoctoral research fellows. In the 2014-15 academic year, AICE reportedly selected 20 VIPs.&lt;ref&gt;https://israbib.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/fvipus1314/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berlin School of Library and Information Science''' at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt Universität zu Berlin]] (in German, "'''Institut für Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft'''") offers study programmes at three levels: bachelors, masters (both a standard program and a postgraduate distant learning program), and doctoral. It is the only institute in Germany with a doctoral programme and the right to award doctorates. Research methods are also an integral part of the pre-doctoral curriculum.

The Berlin School is part of a growing [[list of i-schools]] devoted to the study of information as a discipline. It is one of two members in Germany and the only one in the iCaucus group.

==History==

The Berlin School traces its roots back to the early 20th century. It was closed for a time during the Nazi era. After [[German reunification]] in 1990, the two library programs at the [[Free University of Berlin]] and at [[Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin]] were combined. During the initial years of the 21st century the university had to decide whether to close the school or to transform it. The university decided on transformation and set about gathering the financial resources to make that happen.

In the past the School had offered a quality but fundamentally conventional German library program with a strong emphasis on history and the practical skills necessary to be effective in an entry-level position at a German library. The goal in 2006 became the creation of an internationally competitive “iSchool” on the explicit model of the School of Information at the University of Michigan. It was strengthened with the addition of Peter Schirmbacher and Michael Seadle as new professors at the highest (W3) rank. Schirmbacher brought a wealth of successful digital projects with him and Seadle brought experience with comparable projects plus US connections. Other new faculty included Stefan Gradmann (2008-2013) and Vivien Petras, both of whom led important parts of the Europeana project. Konrad Umlauf completes the spectrum as an expert on public libraries and library management.

Key elements of this transformation included a curriculum with significantly more emphasis on the digital future and the skills necessary to function within that environment. The curriculum put strong emphasis on research and research methods, partly because the Berlin School is the only library and information program at a research-oriented university in Germany, and partly because problem solving in the digital environment inherently involves research. The research emphasis was  also intended to distinguish Humboldt's program from those of the “universities of applied sciences” (''Fachhochschule'').&lt;ref&gt;Seadle, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berlin Library Science Colloquium==
The Berlin Library Science Colloquium ("Berlin Bibliothekswissenschaftliches Kolloquium", BBK). offers during each semester a range of international speakers on current topics of information science, innovative projects and library and information science research. Most presentations (either in English or German) are available as recordings from the BBK-Website .&lt;ref&gt;BBK, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Below are only some of the national and international projects in which the Berlin School plays a significant role. For a full list of projects, see: http://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/forschung/forschungsprojekte


'''Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana'''&lt;ref&gt;DM2E Project, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; (2012-2015) aims to technically enable as many content providers as possible to integrate their content into Europeana. 

'''re3data.org''' [[Registry_of_Research_Data_Repositories|registry of research data repositories]] (2012-2014) &lt;ref&gt;re3data.org (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
The goal of re3data.org is to create a global registry of research data repositories from different academic disciplines. re3data.org presents repositories for the permanent storage and access of data sets to researchers, funding bodies, publishers and scholarly institutions. In the course of this mission re3data.org aims to promote a culture of sharing, increased access and better visibility of research data.

'''LuKII''' ([[LOCKSS]] und KOPAL Infrastruktur und Interoperabilität) (2009-2012) was a project sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.&lt;ref&gt;LuKII, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The project proposes interoperability between the open-source elements of two existing archiving systems (LOCKSS and KOPAL) in order to combine cost-effective bitstream preservation with an established tool for usability maintenance and format migration.
The German National Library was a partner on LuKII.

'''IUWIS''' (Infrastruktur Urheberrecht für Wissenschaft und Bildung) (2009-2011) is also project sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.&lt;ref&gt;IUWIS, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It offers information and discussion opportunities about copyright for research and education, and aims both as the producers of copyright-protected information as well as users. The University of Constance was a partner on IUWIS.

==Building &amp; Location==

The School's home is a 1903 building by architects [[Cremer &amp; Wolffenstein|Wilhelm Cremer und Richard Wolffenstein]] and can be found Dorotheenstraße 26, directly across from the historic Main Building or Hauptgebäude of the university.&lt;ref&gt;IBI, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fluid dynamics]], a '''blast wave''' is the increased pressure and flow resulting from the deposition of a large amount of energy in a small, very localised volume. The flow field can be approximated as a lead [[shock wave]], followed by a self-similar subsonic flow field. In simpler terms, a blast wave is an area of pressure expanding supersonically outward from an explosive core. It has a leading shock front of compressed gases. The blast wave is followed by a blast wind of [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]], which sucks items back in towards the center. The blast wave is harmful especially when one is very close to the center or at a location of constructive interference. High explosives that [[detonation|detonate]] generate blast waves.

==Sources==
High-order explosives (HE) are more powerful than low-order explosives (LE). HE [[Detonation|detonate]] to produce a defining supersonic over-pressurization shock wave. Several sources of HE include [[trinitrotoluene]], [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]], [[Semtex]], [[nitroglycerin]], and ammonium nitrate fuel oil ([[ANFO]]). LE [[Deflagration|deflagrate]] to create a subsonic explosion and lack HE’s over-pressurization wave. Sources of LE include pipe bombs, gunpowder, and most pure petroleum-based incendiary bombs such as Molotov cocktails or aircraft improvised as guided missiles. HE and LE induce different injury patterns. Only HE produce true blast waves.

==History==
The classic flow solution—the so-called "similarity solution"—was independently devised by [[John von Neumann]]&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, John von, "The point source solution," ''John von Neumann. Collected Works,'' edited by A. J. Taub, Vol. 6 [Elmsford, N.Y.: Permagon Press, 1963], pages 219 - 237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bethe,H.A., et al, BLAST WAVE, Los Alamos Report LA-2000, Ch. 2, (1947).

&lt;/ref&gt; during [[World War II]]. After the war, the similarity solution was published by three other authors—[[L. I. Sedov]],&lt;ref&gt;Sedov, L. I., "Propagation of strong shock waves,"  ''Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics'', Vol. 10, pages 241 - 250 (1946).&lt;/ref&gt; R.

I. Taylor'', [Cambridge, England:  Cambridge University Press, 1996], pages 202 - 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early theoretical work more than 50 years ago, both theoretical and experimental studies of blast waves have been ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey JM. 53 years of blast wave research, a personal history. 21st International Symposium on Military and Blast, Israel, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinehart EJ, et al.

==Characteristics and properties==
[[Image:Friedlander waveform.jpg|300px|left | thumb | A Friedlander waveform is the simplest form of a blast wave.]]

The simplest form of a blast wave has been described and termed the Friedlander waveform.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey JM. THE SHAPE OF THE BLAST WAVE: STUDIES OF THE FRIEDLANDER EQUATION. Presented at the 21st International Symposium on Military Aspects of Blast and Shock, Israel 2010 [http://www.blastanalysis.com/WordDocuments/MABS21/Dewey%20Presentation%20%2323.ppt read online]&lt;/ref&gt;  It occurs when a high explosive [[Detonation|detonates]] in a free field, that is, with no surfaces nearby with which it can interact.
Blast waves have properties predicted by the [[Wave#Physical properties|physics of waves]]. For example, they can [[Diffraction|diffract]] through a narrow opening, and [[Refraction|refract]] as they pass through materials. Like light or sound waves, when a blast wave reaches a boundary between two materials, part of it is transmitted, part of it is absorbed, and part of it is reflected. The [[Acoustic impedance|impedances]] of the two materials determine how much of each occurs.

The equation for a Friedlander waveform describes the pressure of the blast wave as a function of time:

:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=P_se^{-\frac{t}{t^*}}\left(1-\frac{t}{t^*}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

where P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the peak pressure and t* is the time at which the pressure first crosses the horizontal axis (before the negative phase).

Blast waves will wrap around objects and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Remmenikov AM. Modelling blast loads on buildings in complex city geometries. Computers and Structures, 2005, 83(27), 2197-2205. [http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1359&amp;context=engpapers&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22Analysis%20blast%20loads%20buildings.%22 read online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, persons or objects behind a large building are not necessarily protected from a blast that starts on the opposite side of the building. Scientists use sophisticated mathematical models to predict how objects will respond to a blast in order to design effective barriers and safer buildings.&lt;ref&gt;for example,Cullis IG. Blast waves and how they interact with structures. J.R. Army Med Corps 147:16-26, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mach stem formation===
[[Image:Mach effect sequence.svg|250px|right| thumb | A blast wave reflecting from a surface and forming a mach stem.]] Mach stem formation occurs when a blast wave reflects off the ground and the reflection catches up with the original shock front, therefore creating a high pressure zone that extends from the ground up to a certain point called the triple point at the edge of the blast wave. Anything in this area experiences peak pressures that can be several times higher than the peak pressure of the original shock front.

===Constructive and destructive interference===
[[Image:Constructive interference.svg|250px|left | thumb | An example of constructive interference.]] In physics, interference is the meeting of two correlated waves and either increasing or lowering the net amplitude, depending on whether it is constructive or destructive interference. If a crest of a wave meets a crest of another wave at the same point then the crests interfere constructively and the resultant crest wave amplitude is increased; forming a much more powerful wave than either of the beginning waves. Similarly two troughs make a trough of increased amplitude. If a crest of a wave meets a trough of another wave then they interfere destructively, and the overall amplitude is decreased; thus making a wave that is much smaller than either of the parent waves.

The formation of a mach stem is one example of constructive interference. Whenever a blast wave reflects off of a surface, such as a building wall or the inside of a vehicle, different reflected waves can interact with each other to cause an increase in pressure at a certain point (constructive interference) or a decrease (destructive interference). In this way the interaction of blast waves is similar to that of sound waves or water waves.

==Damage==

Blast waves cause damage by a combination of the significant compression of the air in front of the wave (forming a [[shock front]]) and the subsequent wind that follows.&lt;ref&gt;Neff M. A visual model for blast waves and fracture. Master's Thesis, University of Toronto, Canada, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A blast wave travels faster than the speed of sound and the passage of the shock wave usually lasts only a few milliseconds. Like other types of explosions, a blast wave can also cause damage to things and people by the blast wind, debris, and fires. The original explosion will send out fragments that travel very fast. Debris and sometimes even people can get swept up into a blast wave, causing more injuries such as penetrating wounds, impalement, broken bones, or even death. The blast wind is the area of low pressure that causes debris and fragments to actually rush back towards the original explosions. The blast wave can also cause fires or even secondary explosions by a combination of the high temperatures that result from detonation and the physical destruction of fuel-containing objects.

==Applications==

===Bombs===
In response to an inquiry from the British [[MAUD Committee]], G. I. Taylor estimated the amount of energy that would be released by the explosion of an atomic bomb in air.  He postulated that for an idealized point source of energy, the spatial distributions of the flow variables would have the same form during a given time interval, the variables differing only in scale.  (Thus the name of the "similarity solution.")  This hypothesis allowed the partial differential equations in terms of r (the radius of the blast wave) and t (time) to be transformed into an ordinary differential equation in terms of the similarity variable  &lt;math&gt;\frac{r^{5}\rho_{o}}{t^{2}E}&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_{o}&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the air and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the energy that's released by the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Discussion of similarity solutions, including G. I. Taylor's:
[[Buckingham Pi theorem]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derivation of G. I. Taylor's similarity solution:
http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/people/codoban/PHY138/Mechanics/dimensional.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussion of G. I. Taylor's research, including his similarity solution:
http://www.deas.harvard.edu/brenner/taylor/physic_today/taylor.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  This result allowed G. I. Taylor to estimate the yield of the first atomic explosion in New Mexico in 1945 using only photographs of the blast, which had been published in newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;  The yield of the explosion was determined by using the equation:  &lt;math&gt;E = \left(\frac{\rho_{o}}{t^2}\right)\left(\frac{r}{C}\right)^5&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless constant that is a function of the ratio of the specific heat of air at constant pressure to the specific heat of air at constant volume. The value of C is also affected by radiative losses, but for air, values of C of 1.00-1.10 generally give reasonable results. In 1950, G. I. Taylor published two articles in which he revealed the yield E of the first atomic explosion,&lt;ref name=taylor_1950/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor_1950a/&gt; which had previously been classified and whose publication therefore caused a great to-do.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

While nuclear explosions are among the clearest examples of the destructive power of blast waves, blast waves generated by exploding conventional bombs and other weapons made from high explosives have been used as weapons of war due to their effectiveness at creating polytraumatic injury.  During World War II and the U.S.’s involvement in the Vietnam War, [[blast lung]] was a common and often deadly injury.  Improvements in vehicular and personal protective equipment have helped to reduce the incidence of blast lung.  However, as soldiers are better protected from penetrating injury and surviving previously lethal exposures, limb injuries, eye and ear injuries, and traumatic brain injuries have become more prevalent.

===Effects of blast loads on buildings===
Structural behaviour during an explosion depends entirely on the materials used in the construction of the building. Upon hitting the face of a building, the shock front from an explosion is instantly reflected. This impact with the structure imparts momentum to exterior components of the building. The associated kinetic energy of the moving components must be absorbed or dissipated in order for them to survive. Generally, this is achieved by converting the kinetic energy of the moving component to strain energy in resisting elements.&lt;ref name="Dusenberry"&gt;Dusenberry, Donald. 'Handbook for Blast Resistant Design of Buildings', 2010, pages 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically the resisting elements, such as windows, building facades and support columns fail, causing partial damage through to progressive collapse of the building.

===Astronomy ===
The so-called '''Sedov-Taylor''' solution {{see above|Bombs|mid=y}} has become useful in [[astrophysics]]. For example, it can be applied to quantify an estimate for the outcome from [[supernova]]-explosions. The Sedov-Taylor expansion is also known as the 'Blast Wave' phase, which is an adiabatic expansion phase in the life cycle of supernova. The temperature of the material in a supernova shell decreases with time, but the internal energy of the material is always 72% of E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the initial energy released. This is helpful for astrophysicists interested in predicting the behavior of supernova remnants.

===Research===

Blast waves are generated in research environments using explosive or compressed-gas driven [[shock tube]]s in an effort to replicate the environment of a military conflict to better understand the physics of blasts and injuries that may result, and to develop better protection against blast exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Rinehart, Dr. E. J., Henny, Dr. R. W., Thomsen, J. M., Duray, J. P.  DTRA Weapons Effects Testing: A Thirty Year Perspective. Applied Research and Associates, Shock Physics Division&lt;/ref&gt; Blast waves are directed against structures (such as vehicles),&lt;ref&gt;for example, Bauman, R. A., Ling, G., Tong, L., Januszkiewicz, A., Agoston, D., Delanerolle, N., Kim, Y., Ritzel, D., Bell, R., Ecklund, J., Armonda, R., Bandak, F., Parks, S. An Introductory Characterization of a Combat-Casualty-Care Relevant Swine Model of Closed Head Injury Resulting from Exposure to Explosive Blast. Journal of Neurotrauma, June 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; materials, and biological specimens&lt;ref&gt;Cernak, I. The importance of systematic response in the pathobiology of blast-induced Neurotrauma. Frontiers in Neurology December, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or surrogates.  High-speed [[pressure sensor]]s and/or [[high speed camera]]s are often used to quantify the response to blast exposure.  Anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs or [[crash test dummy|test dummies]]) initially developed for the automotive industry are being used, sometimes with added instrumentation, to estimate the human response to blast events.  For examples, personnel in vehicles and personnel on demining teams have been simulated using these ATDs.&lt;ref&gt;Makris, A. Nerenberg, J., Dionne, J. P., Bass, C. R., Chichester. Reduction of Blast Induced Head Acceleration in the Field of Anti-Personnel Mine Clearance. Med-Eng Systems Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with experiments, complex mathematical models have been made of the interaction of blast waves with inanimate and biological structures.&lt;ref&gt;for example, Stuhmiller JH. Mathematical Modeling in Support of Military Operational Medicine Final Report J3150.01-06-306 prepared for the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Fort Detrick, Maryland 21702-5012 OMB No. 0704-0188, July, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Validated models are useful for "what if" experiments – predictions of outcomes for different scenarios.  Depending on the system being modeled, it can be difficult to have accurate input parameters (for example, the material properties of a rate-sensitive material at blast rates of loading).  Lack of experimental validation severely limits the usefulness of any numerical model.

U.S. Government Printing Office, 1979. {{ISSN|1946-4975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="definition2"&gt;SAE J689: Cancelled AUG 2009 Curbstone Clearance, Approach, Departure, and Ramp Breakover Angles--Passenger Car and Light Truck&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="definition3"&gt;SAE J1100 NOV 2009 Motor Vehicle Dimensions&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is contingent upon the wheels being in continuous contact with the supporting surface(s). Breakover angle may also be referred to as "break-over angle" or "break over angle." Breakover angle is different from [[ground clearance]] in that ground clearance is the shortest distance between the ground and lowest point on the vehicle.

==Relevance==
[[Image:MUTCD W10-5.svg|100px|thumb|right|[[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|MUTCD]] warning sign for a [[Level  crossing|low-ground-clearance crossing]]]]
Breakover angle is a relevant performance metric in many common vehicle scenarios, including:
* [[Off-roading]].
* Loading a vehicle onto a higher surface with a ramp.
* Going over raised [[Level crossing|railroad crossings]].
* Going over [[speed bump]]s
* Going over [[linkspan]]s

If a vehicle drives over a breakover angle larger than what it is capable of clearing, the vehicle will contact the apex of the angle, which will quite likely prevent the vehicle from continuing any further in its direction of travel, possibly even completely immobilizing the vehicle.

==Calculation==
Assuming no tire deflection, and assuming an ideal breakover angle scenario (two flat surfaces coming to a point, a vehicle with the lowest point of the chassis located at its midsection, etc.), an ''approximation'' for the breakover angle of a vehicle can be calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\text{breakover angle}_{approximate} = 2 \cdot \arctan\left(\frac{2 \cdot \text{ground clearance}}{\text{wheelbase}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Chairlift_bullwheel.jpg|thumb|A chairlift's return bullwheel]]

A '''bullwheel''' or '''bull wheel''' is a large [[wheel]] on which a [[rope]] turns, such as in a [[chairlift]]. In that application, the bullwheel that is attached to the [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]] is called the drive bullwheel, and the other is the return bullwheel.

Originally, ''bullwheel'' was an [[oil field]] term applied to the large wheel that turns the drum upon which the drilling line is wound in [[percussion drilling]].

The bullwheel began use in [[farm implements]] with the [[reaper]].  The term described the traveling wheel, traction wheel, drive wheel, or harvester wheel. The bullwheel powered all the moving parts of these farm machines including the reciprocating knives, reel, rake, and self binder.  The bullwheel's outer surface provided traction against the ground and turned when the draft animals or [[tractor]] pulled the implement forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Celtic studies''' or '''Celtology''' is the academic discipline occupied with the study of any sort of cultural output relating to the [[Celts|Celtic]] people. This ranges from linguistics, literature and art history, archaeology and history, the focus lying on the study of the various [[Celtic languages]], living and extinct.&lt;ref name=Wiley&gt;Wiley, ""Celtic studies, early history of the field" (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The primary areas of focus are the six Celtic languages currently in use: [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Breton language|Breton]].

As a university subject, it is taught at a number of universities, most of them in Ireland, the United Kingdom, or France, but also in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Poland, Austria and the Netherlands.

==History (16th–19th century)==
Written studies of the Celts, their cultures and their languages go back to [[classical antiquity|classical]] Greek and Latin accounts, possibly beginning with [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]] in the 6th century BC&lt;ref name=Wiley /&gt; and best known through such authors as [[Polybius]], [[Posidonius]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Strabo]]. Modern Celtic studies originated in the 16th and 17th centuries, when many of these classical authors were rediscovered, published and translated.&lt;ref name=Wiley /&gt;

Academic interest in Celtic languages grew out of comparative and historical linguistics, which was itself established at the end of the 18th century. In the 16th century, [[George Buchanan]] studied the [[Goidelic languages]]. The first major breakthrough in Celtic linguistics came with the publication of ''Archaeologia Britannica'' (1707) by the Welsh scholar [[Edward Lhuyd]], who was the first to recognise that Gaulish, [[British language (Celtic)|British]] and Irish belong to the same language family.&lt;ref name=Wiley /&gt; He also published an English version of a study by [[Paul-Yves Pezron]] of [[Gaulish]].

In 1767 [[James Parsons (physician)|James Parsons]] published his study ''The Remains of Japhet, being historical enquiries into the affinity and origins of the European languages''. He compared a 1000-word lexicon of Irish and Welsh and concluded that they were originally the same, then comparing the numerals in many other languages.

The second big leap forwards was made when the Englishman [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] postulated that [[Sanskrit]], Greek, Latin and many other languages including "the Celtic" derived from a common ancestral language. This hypothesis, published in ''The Sanscrit Language'' (1786), would later be hailed as the discovery of the [[Indo-European language family]], from which grew the field of [[Indo-European studies]].&lt;ref name=Wiley /&gt; The Celtic languages were definitively linked to the Indo-European family over the course of the 19th century.

Although Jones' trail-blazing hypothesis inspired numerous linguistic studies, of which Celtic languages were a part, it was not until [[Johann Kaspar Zeuss]]'s monumental ''Grammatica Celtica'' (volume 1, 1851; volume 2, 1853) that any truly significant progress was made.&lt;ref name=Wiley /&gt; Written in [[Latin]], the work draws on the earliest [[Old Irish]], [[Middle Welsh]] and other Celtic [[primary source]]s to construct a comparative grammar, which was the first to lay out a firm basis for Celtic linguistics.&lt;ref name=Wiley /&gt; Among other achievements, Zeuss was able to crack{{clarify|date=January 2017}} the Old Irish verb.

==Celtic studies in the German-speaking world and the Netherlands==
German Celtic studies (''Keltologie'') is seen by many as having been established by Johann Kaspar Zeuss (1806–1856) (see above). In 1847, he was appointed professor of [[linguistics]] at the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich|University of Munich]]. Until the middle of the 19th century, Celtic studies progressed largely as a subfield of linguistics. [[Franz Bopp]] (1791–1867) carried out further studies in [[comparative linguistics]] to link the [[Celtic languages]] to the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. He is credited with having finally proven Celtic to be a branch of the Indo-European language family. From 1821 to 1864, he served as a professor of oriental literature and general linguistics in Berlin.

In 1896, [[Kuno Meyer]] and Ludwig Christian Stern founded the ''[[Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie]]'' (ZCP), the first academic journal solely devoted to aspects of Celtic languages and literature, and still in existence today.&lt;ref&gt;Busse, "''Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie''." In ''Celtic Culture'', ed. Koch: p. 1823&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the century, significant contributions were made by the Orientalist [[Ernst Windisch]] (1844–1918). He held a chair in [[Sanskrit]] at the [[University of Leipzig]]; but he is best remembered for his numerous publications in the field of Celtic studies. In 1901, the Orientalist and Celtologist [[Heinrich Zimmer (Celticist)|Heinrich Zimmer]] (1851–1910) was made professor of Celtic languages at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin, the first position of its kind in Germany. He was followed in 1911 by [[Kuno Meyer]] (1858–1919), who, in addition to numerous publications in the field, was active in the Irish independence movement.

Perhaps the most important German-speaking Celticist is the Swiss scholar [[Rudolf Thurneysen]] (1857–1940). A student of Windisch and Zimmer, Thurneysen was appointed to the chair of comparative linguistics at the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1887; he succeeded to the equivalent chair at the [[University of Bonn]] in 1913. His notability arises from his work on [[Old Irish]]. For his masterwork, ''Handbuch des Altirischen'' ("Handbook of Old Irish", 1909), translated into English as ''A Grammar of Old Irish'', he located and analysed a multitude of Old Irish manuscripts. His work is considered as the basis for all succeeding studies of Old Irish.

In 1920, [[Julius Pokorny]] (1887–1970) was appointed to the chair of Celtic languages at [[Frederick William University|Friedrich Wilhelm University]], Berlin. Despite his support for German nationalism and Catholic faith, he was forced out of his position by the [[Nazis]] on account of his Jewish ancestry. He subsequently emigrated to Switzerland but returned to Germany in 1955 to teach at [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]]. In Berlin, he was succeeded in 1937 by [[:de:Ludwig Mühlhausen]], a devout Nazi.

After World War II, German Celtic studies took place predominantly in West Germany and Austria. Studies in the field continued at Freiburg, Bonn, [[Marburg]], [[Hamburg]] as well as [[Innsbruck]]; however an independent professorship in Celtic studies has not been instituted anywhere. In this period, [[Hans Hartmann]], Heinrich Wagner and [[Wolfgang Meid]] made notable contributions to the scientific understanding of the boundaries of the Celtic language area and the location of the homeland of the Celtic peoples. The Berlin chair in Celtic languages has not been occupied since 1966.

Today, Celtic studies is only taught at a handful of German universities, including those of Bonn,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keltologie.uni-bonn.de Celtic Studies at the University of Bonn] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Trier|Trier]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-trier.de/index.php?id=23039 Celtic Studies] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of Mannheim|Mannheim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.george-broderick.de Current Courses] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fask.uni-mainz.de/inst/ssc/ssc.html Scottish Studies Centre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003071616/http://www.fask.uni-mainz.de/inst/ssc/ssc.html |date=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Philipps University of Marburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-marburg.de/studium/studgang/ki/ki10sprawikel-mag-pr.pdf Celtic Studies prospectus] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also taught at the [[University of Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univie.ac.at/keltologie Celtic Studies] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Marburg, Vienna and Bonn maintain formal programs of study, but even then usually as a subsection of comparative or general linguistics. Only Marburg offers an M.A. course specifically in Celtic Studies. No Celtic studies research has taken place in the former centres of Freiburg, Hamburg or Berlin since the 1990s. The last remaining chair in Celtic studies, that at [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], was abolished in 1997.

The only Chair of Celtic studies in Continental Europe is at [[Utrecht University]] (in the Netherlands).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uu.nl/bachelors/keltische-talen-en-cultuur Keltische talen en cultuur] (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000915110244/http://www.let.uu.nl/keltisch/ Celtic languages and culture]&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1923, when Celtic studies were added to the Chair of Germanic studies on the special request of its new professor [[A. G. van Hamel]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Schneiders, "[http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn5/hamel Hamel, Anton Gerard van (1886-1945)]." ''Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland'' 5 (Den Haag 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celtic studies in Ireland and Britain==
Celtic studies are taught in universities in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland (see below). These studies cover language, history, archaeology and art. In addition, Celtic languages are taught to a greater or lesser extent in schools in Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall and the Isle of Man in addition to extramural courses in each Celtic language.

A notable research project is the [[Celtic Inscribed Stones Project]] (CISP), which has made details of the many inscriptions in Britain available online. Work has also been carried out on the Celtic influence on the English language and on the Celtic elements in the place names of England. Books and publications on aspects of Celtic studies are numerous, a notable one being that of [[Kenneth H. Jackson]] on ''Language and History in Early Britain''. This included chapters on all the types of Insular Celtic, including [[Pictish language|Pictish]]. Several journals on Celtic studies are published including ''[[Celtica (journal)|Celtica]]'' and ''[[Studia Celtica]]''.

Sir [[John Rhys]] became the first Professor of Celtic Studies at Oxford in 1874. [[Henry Jenner]]  was the initiator of the revival of Cornish and the founding of the [[Cornish Gorseth]] while [[Robert Morton Nance]] founded the [[Federation of Old Cornwall Societies|Old Cornwall Society]]. The [[Institute of Cornish Studies]] enables academic study and teaching in Cornish studies.

The University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh &amp; Celtic Studies runs the Ancient Britain and the Atlantic Zone Project,&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wales.ac.uk/en/CentreforAdvancedWelshCelticStudies/ResearchProjects/CurrentProjects/AncientBritainandtheAtlanticZone/IntroductiontotheProject.aspx |title=Ancient Britain and the Atlantic Zone Project |accessdate=11 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708015044/http://www.wales.ac.uk/en/CentreforAdvancedWelshCelticStudies/ResearchProjects/CurrentProjects/AncientBritainandtheAtlanticZone/IntroductiontotheProject.aspx |archivedate=8 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose Senior Fellow and Project Leader is Professor [[John T.

The last International Congress of Celtic Studies (XIV) was held at the University of Maynooth, in August 2011.

Fourteen universities in the United Kingdom have Celtic Studies departments and courses, the top five rated as of 2017 are; (1) Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic at [[University of Cambridge]] (2) Welsh and Celtic Studies at [[Bangor University]] (3) Welsh and Celtic Studies at [[Cardiff University]] (4) [https://www.gla.ac.uk/subjects/celticgaelic/ Celtic and Gaelic] at [[University of Glasgow]] (5) Irish and Celtic Studies at [[Queen's University, Belfast]].

==Celtic studies in North America==
While Celtic studies programs in Canada are not as widespread as they are in Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and England, several universities offer some Celtic studies courses, while only two universities offers a full B.A. as well as graduate courses. [[St. Michael's College, Toronto|St. Michael's College]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and [[St. Francis Xavier University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stfx.ca/faculties/arts/celtic_studies/ Celtic Studies].&lt;/ref&gt;  offers the only B.A. of its kind in Canada with a dual focus on Celtic literature and history, while the [[Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies]] at the [[University of Toronto]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.utoronto.ca/stmikes/celticstudies Celtic Studies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427094324/http://www.utoronto.ca/stmikes/celticstudies |date=April 27, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; offers courses at a graduate level through their Centre for Medieval Studies, along with [[St. Francis Xavier University]].

Other Canadian universities which offer courses in Celtic, Scottish or Irish studies include [[Cape Breton University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbu.ca/cbu/_main/default_main.asp?topic=programs&amp;id=celtic_studies&amp;menu=School%20of%20Arts%20and%20Community%20Studies Celtic Studies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927072846/http://www.cbu.ca/cbu/_main/default_main.asp?topic=programs&amp;id=celtic_studies&amp;menu=School%20of%20Arts%20and%20Community%20Studies |date=September 27, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Mary's University, Halifax]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smu.ca/academic/arts/irish|title=Saint Mary's University - Irish Studies - Home|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Fraser University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/scottish/|title=Centre for Scottish Studies - Simon Fraser University|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Guelph]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/scottish/|title=Centre for Scottish Studies|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernlanguages.uottawa.ca/celtic.html|title=Research - Department of Modern Languages and Literatures - University of Ottawa|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[Harvard University]] is notable for their Doctorate program in Celtic studies.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~celtic Department of Celtic Languages and Literatures].&lt;/ref&gt; Celtic studies are also offered at the universities of [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Milwaukee|Wisconsin-Milwaukee]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ Center for Celtic Studies].&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of California, Berkeley|California, Berkeley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ls.berkeley.edu/dept/celtic/ Celtic Studies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504114750/http://ls.berkeley.edu/dept/celtic/ |date=May 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[University of California, Los Angeles|California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/celtic/ Celtic Studies].&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Bard College]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bard.edu/academics/programs/programs.php?id=964490&amp;pid=770 Irish and Celtic Studies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209082337/http://www.bard.edu/academics/programs/programs.php?id=964490&amp;pid=770 |date=December 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others, &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.irishcentral.com/culture/education/the-definitive-list-of-irish-studies-programs-united-states-and-canada| date=June 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [https://study.com/gaelic_studies_schools.html]&lt;/ref&gt; including programs in which a student may minor, like at the [[College of Charleston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofc.edu/academics/majorsandminors/irish-american-studies.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celtic studies in France==
In 1804, the [[Académie celtique|Académie Celtique]] was founded with the goal of unearthing the [[Gaul|Gallic]] past of the French people. France also produced the first [[academic journal]] devoted to Celtic studies, ''[[Revue Celtique]]''. ''Revue Celtique'' was first published in 1870 in Paris and continued until the death of its last editor, [[Joseph Loth]], in 1934. After that point it was continued under the name ''[[Études Celtiques]]''. 

The [[University of Western Brittany]] (Brest) offers a two-year, an international European-Union certified Master’s degree course entitled “Celtic languages and Cultures in Contact”. It is part of the [[Centre for Breton and Celtic Research]] (CRBC). Thanks to its partnerships with the [[Ulster University]] (Coleraine), the [[University College Dublin]] and the [[Aberystwyth University]],  this Master’s degree programme is one of a few in the world to offer students the possibility of learning all of the medieval and modern Celtic languages and cultures. Given that students come from around the world, nearly all classes are taught through English and those which are not have English-language supports. The last semester of the second year will be spent abroad at a partner institution in one of the Celtic countries. 

Closely linked to this MA programme, the [[University of Western Brittany]] organizes an intensive two-week Summer School in Breton Language and Cultural Heritage Studies every year in June. This Summer School is also sponsored by the Centre for Breton and Celtic Research (CRBC) and welcomes scholars from around the world with an interest in the Celtic (and minority) languages and cultures to study Breton, the least known of the living Celtic languages.  It is a little-known fact that, next to Welsh, Breton is the most widely spoken Celtic language nowadays. As with the MA programme, all the language classes are taught through the medium of English providing participants with an excellent opportunity to study the only Celtic language to have survived on the continent of Europe.

'''Certified wood''' and paper products come from responsibly managed forests – as defined by a particular standard. With third-party forest certification, an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 Metafore Forest Certification Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
'''Forest certification''' programs typically require that forest management practices conform to existing laws. Other basic requirements or characteristics of forest certification programs include:

Basic requirements of credible forest certification programs include:
* Protection of biodiversity, species at risk and wildlife habitat; sustainable harvest levels; protection of water quality; and prompt regeneration (e.g., replanting and reforestation).
* Third-party certification audits performed by accredited certification bodies.
* Publicly available certification audit summaries.
* Multi-stakeholder involvement in a standards development process.
* Complaints and appeals process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stateforesters.org/files/2008.Forest%20Certification.pdf National Association of State Foresters Policy Statement 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Today there are more than 50 certification programs worldwide &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Sustainable_Forests/Third_Party_Forest_Certification.pdf Third-Party Forest Certification in British Columbia]&lt;/ref&gt; addressing the many types of forests and tenures around the world. The two largest international forest certification programs are the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) and the [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] (PEFC).

The PEFC is the largest certification framework in terms of forest area, with approximately two-thirds of the total certified area. The FSC program is the fastest growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 115] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-party forest certification was pioneered in the early 1990s by the FSC, a collaboration between [[Environmental organizations|environmental]] [[Non-governmental organizations|NGOs]], forest product companies and social interests. Competing systems quickly emerged throughout the world. Some commentators, including [[Jared Diamond]], have suggested that many competing standards were set up by logging companies specifically aiming to confuse consumers with less rigorously enforced but similarly named competing standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== United States and Canada ===

In the United States and Canada, there are a number of forest certification programs. Three of these programs are endorsed by the PEFC. They are the [[American Tree Farm System]] (ATFS), the [[Canadian Standards Association]]’s [[Sustainable Forest Management Standard]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa-international.org/product_areas/forest_products_marking/ CSA International Forest Products Marking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019030053/http://www.csa-international.org/product_areas/forest_products_marking/ |date=2011-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sustainable Forestry Initiative]] (SFI) Program. ATFS is applicable only in the United States; the Canadian Standards Association SFM Standard is applicable only in Canada. SFI is applicable to both the United States and Canada. The FSC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsccanada.org/forestmanagementstd.htm Forest Stewardship Council Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fscus.org FSC United States]&lt;/ref&gt; program is applied throughout North America. SFI is the world’s largest regional forest certification program in terms of total certified forest area[1].

The [[National Association of State Foresters]] in the USA passed a resolution in 2008 that supports ''all'' of the forest certification systems used in the USA and recognized the value of their differences: “... the ATFS, FSC, and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability.... No certification program can credibly claim to be ‘best’, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility. Forest ecosystems are complex and a simplistic ‘one size fits all’ approach to certification cannot address all sustainability needs.”.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;[http://stateforesters.org/files/2008.Forest%20Certification.pdf Forest Certification as it Contributes to Sustainable Forestry]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Council of Forest Ministers]] issued a statement in 2008 on forest certification standards in Canada, which said: “In Canada, each jurisdiction’s forest laws, policies and administrative requirements comprise an {{sic|hide=y|over-|arching}} framework that fully characterizes what sustainable forest management (SFM) means in that jurisdiction, and what actions may take place on public and/or private forest land. Governments in Canada support third-party forest certification as a tool to demonstrate the rigor of Canada’s forest management laws, and to document the country’s world-class sustainable forest management record. The forest management standards of the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the FSC and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) are all used in Canada. Governments in Canada accept that these standards demonstrate, and promote the sustainability of forest management practices in Canada.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccfm.org/pdf/CCFM_Statement_FRandEN.pdf#page=2 Canadian Council of Forest Ministers Statement on Forest Certification Standards in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chain-of-custody certification==

Chain of Custody certification tracks the certified material through the production process – from the forest to the consumer, including all successive stages of processing, transformation, manufacturing and distribution. It also provides evidence that certified material in a certified product originates from certified forests.

The United Nations reports that between January 2009 and May 2010, the total number of PEFC and FSC chain-of-custody certificates issued worldwide increased by 88% for a total of 23,717 certificates (this does not include SFI certificates).&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 118] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future expansion==

Forest certification is a voluntary process. About 10% of the world’s forest under at least one certification program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 113] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers that choose to buy certified products are supporting land managers, land owners and forest product companies that have made a commitment to meeting the standards of forest certification.

Third-party forest certification is a useful tool for those seeking to purchase paper and wood products that come from forests that are well-managed and use materials that are legally harvested. Incorporating third-party certification into forest product buying practices can be a centerpiece for responsible wood and paper purchasing policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values, thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 Metafore]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009-2010 United Nations Market Review reported that companies that produced or traded in certified forest products often had a market advantage during the 2008-2009 recession because, in a buyers’ market, buyers could be more selective in choosing their sources of supply. The report cites four demand drivers for certification:&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 114] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paper, publishing, printing and packaging – commitments to increase the use of responsible paper sources by large publishers such as Time Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeinc.com/community/sustainability.php Time Inc. Sustainability Report 2009-2010 page 10]&lt;/ref&gt; has probably been the most significant factor driving growth in forest and chain-of-custody certification.
* Green public procurement – governments such as the UK and the Netherlands have adopted green timber procurement policies, including recognition of FSC and PEFC endorsed programs. An example is the UK’s Central Point of Expertise on Timber (set up by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and operated by ProForest).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpet.org.uk/evidence-of-compliance/category-a-evidence/introduction Central Point of Expertise on Timber]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Green building – standards for green building incentivize and reward the use of certified wood products.
*Illegal logging – new legislation designed to minimize the risk of illegal wood entering supply chains such as the amended Lacey Act in the United States has created a strong incentive to demand independently certified wood that can address illegal logging concerns.

The World Resources Institute, in partnership with the Environmental Investigation Agency, released a fact sheet designed to answer some of the frequently asked questions about the Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to ban commerce in illegally sourced plants and their products—including timber, wood, and paper products. The fact sheet says forest certification is a very good approach for demonstrating due care by showing government and customers that a company has taken proactive steps to eliminate illegal wood or plant material from its supply chain. Certification does not relieve importers of the requirement to submit appropriate import declaration information to U.S. government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/stories/2009/12/fact-sheet-are-you-ready-lacey-act World Resources Institute fact sheet Are You Ready for the Lacey Act?]&lt;/ref&gt;

A character who stands as a representative of a particular [[Social class|class]] or group of people is known as a type.&lt;ref name=b265&gt;Baldick (2001, 265).&lt;/ref&gt; Types include both [[stock character]]s and those that are more fully [[individual]]ised.&lt;ref name=b265/&gt; The characters in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1891) and [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[Miss Julie]]'' (1888), for example, are representative of specific positions in the [[social relation]]s of class and [[gender]], such that the [[Conflict (narrative)|conflicts]] between the characters reveal [[Ideology|ideological]] conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 35).&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 41).&lt;/ref&gt; The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions (proairetic, [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]], [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Proxemics|proxemic]]) that it forms with the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Elam (2002, 133).&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often [[Mimesis|miming]] shifts in society and its ideas about human [[individual]]ity, [[self-determination]], and the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs and Fowler (2006, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
In [[fiction writing]], authors create dynamic characters by many methods.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Sometimes characters are conjured up from imagination; in other instances, they are created by amplifying the character trait of a real person into a new fictional creation, or are created from scratch as a matter of expediency.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt;

==Types==

===Round vs. flat=== &lt;!-- Characterization links here. --&gt;
In his book ''Aspects of the Novel'', [[E. M. Forster]] defined two basic types of characters, their qualities, functions, and importance for the development of the novel: '''flat''' characters and '''round''' characters.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Michael J|author2=Patrick D. Murphy|title=Essentials of the theory of fiction|publisher=Duke University Press, 1996|edition=2|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8223-1823-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat characters are two-dimensional, in that they are relatively uncomplicated. By contrast, round characters are complex figures with many different characteristics, that undergo development, sometimes sufficiently to surprise the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=E.M.|title=Aspects of the Novel|year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Sue]]s are characters mainly appearing in [[fan fiction]]. They are virtually devoid of flaws,&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lucy Bennett, Paul Booth|title=Seeing Fans: Representations of Fandom in Media and Popular Culture|isbn =1501318470|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] USA|year=2016|page=160|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydwuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore considered flat characters.

===Dynamic vs. static===
'''Dynamic''' characters are those that change over the course of the story, while '''static''' characters remain the same throughout. An example of a popular static character in literature is [[Sherlock Holmes]]; an example of a dynamic character in literature is [[Ebenezer Scrooge]].

===Regular, recurring and guest characters===
In television, a regular, main or ongoing character is a character who appears in all or a majority of episodes, or in a significant chain of episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;The TV Writer's Workbook: A Creative Approach To Television Scripts [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YeCet_B_-IC&amp;pg=PA40 p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular characters may be both core and secondary ones. 

A [[recurring character]] often and frequently appears from time to time during the series' run.&lt;ref name="Crafty"&gt;{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=Alex |title=Crafty TV Writing: Thinking Inside the Box |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year= 2006 |isbn=0-8050-8028-7 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring characters often play major roles in more than one episode, sometimes being the main focus.

A guest character is one which acts only in a few episodes or scenes. Unlike regular characters, the guest ones do not need to be carefully incorporated into the storyline with all its ramifications: they create a piece of drama and then disappear without consequences to the narrative structure, unlike core characters, for which any significant conflict must be traced during a considerable time, which is often seen as an unjustified waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Greg M. Smith, ''Beautiful TV: The Art and Argument of Ally McBeal'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA147 p. 147]&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be a continuing or recurring guest character.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a guest character may gain popularity and turn into a regular one.&lt;ref&gt;David Kukoff, ''Vault Guide to Television Writing Careers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=T9zj0AqB6bUC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical analysis==
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

In the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE), the [[Greek philosophy|Classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] deduces that character (''[[ethos]]'') is one of six qualitative parts of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] and one of the three objects that it [[Mimesis|represents]] (1450a12).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8). Aristotle defines the six qualitative elements of tragedy as "plot, character, diction, reasoning, spectacle and song" (1450a10); the three objects are plot (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]''), character (''[[ethos]]''), and reasoning (''[[dianoia]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; He understands character not to denote a fictional person, but the quality of the person acting in the story and reacting to its situations (1450a5).&lt;ref name=j984&gt;Janko (1987, 9, 84).&lt;/ref&gt; He defines character as "that which reveals [[Decision making|decision]], of whatever sort" (1450b8).&lt;ref name=j984/&gt; It is possible, therefore, to have stories that do not contain "characters" in Aristotle's sense of the word, since character necessarily involves making the [[Ethics|ethical]] dispositions of those performing the action clear.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle writes: "Again, without action a tragedy cannot exist, but without characters it may. For the tragedies of most recent [poets] lack character, and in general there are many such poets" (1450a24-25); see Janko (1987, 9, 86).&lt;/ref&gt; If, in speeches, the speaker "decides or avoids nothing at all", then those speeches "do not have character" (1450b9—11).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 9).&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle argues for the primacy of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'') over character (''[[ethos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34) and Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the most important of these is the structure of the incidents. For (i) tragedy is a representation not of human beings but of action and life. Happiness and unhappiness lie in action, and the end [of life] is a sort of action, not a quality; people are of a certain sort according to their characters, but happy or the opposite according to their actions. So [the actors] do not act in order to represent the characters, but they include the characters for the sake of their actions" (1450a15-23).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aristotle suggests that works were distinguished in the first instance according to the nature of the person who created them: "the grander people represented fine actions, i.e. those of fine persons" by producing "hymns and praise-poems", while "ordinary people represented those of inferior ones" by "composing invectives" (1448b20—1449a5).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 5). This distinction, Aristotle argues, arises from two causes that are natural and common to all humans—the delight taken in experiencing representations and the way in which we learn through imitation (1448b4—19); see Janko (1987, 4—5).&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, a distinction between the individuals represented in tragedy and in comedy arose: tragedy, along with [[epic poetry]], is "a representation of serious people" (1449b9—10), while [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] is "a representation of people who are rather inferior" (1449a32—33).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 6—7). Aristotle specifies that comedy does not represent all kinds of ugliness and vice, but only that which is laughable (1449a32—1449a37).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Tractatus coislinianus]]'' (which may or may not be by Aristotle), [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is defined as involving three types of characters: the [[buffoon]] (''[[bômolochus]]''), the [[Irony|ironist]] (''[[eirôn]]''), and the [[imposter]] or boaster (''[[alazôn]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; All three are central to [[Aristophanes]]' "[[old comedy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 170).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] comic playwright [[Plautus]] wrote his plays two centuries later, the use of characters to define dramatic [[genre]]s was well established.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 22).&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]'' begins with a [[prologue]] in which [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] claims that since the play contains kings and gods, it cannot be a comedy and must be a [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amphritruo'', line 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chaîne opératoire''' ([[French language|French]] for “operational chain” or “operational sequence”) is a term used throughout anthropological discourse, but is most commonly used in [[archaeology]] and [[sociocultural anthropology]]. It functions as a methodological tool for analysing the technical processes and [[Social actions|social acts]] involved in the step-by-step [[Handicraft|production]], use, and eventual disposal of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], such as [[lithic reduction]] (the making of [[stone tool]]s) or [[pottery]].&lt;ref name=oxford_def&gt;{{cite web |title=Chaîne opératoire, definition from Answers.com |author=Timothy Darvill |date=2002|accessdate=2011-10-22 |work=Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] and [[Answers.com]] |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/cha-ne-op-ratoire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 'chaîne opératoire' approach to lithic analysis |author=Roger Grace |year=1997 |accessdate=2011-10-22 |work=Stone Age Reference Collection |publisher=Institute of Archaeology, [[University of Oslo]], [[Norway]] |url=http://www3.hf.uio.no/sarc/iakh/lithic/opchainpaper.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225054001/http://www3.hf.uio.no/sarc/iakh/lithic/opchainpaper.html |archivedate=2011-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gosselain1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gosselain |first1=Oliver |year=1992 |title=Technology and Style: Potters and Pottery Among Bafia of Cameroon |journal=Man |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=559–586 |jstor=2803929 |doi=10.2307/2803929}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of technology as the science of human activities was first proposed by [[French people|French]] [[archaeologist]], [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], and later by the [[History of science|historian of science]], André-Georges Haudricourt.&lt;ref name=oxford_def/&gt;&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soressi |first1=Marie |last2=Geneste |first2=Jean-Michel |year=2011 |title=Special Issue: Reduction Sequence, ''Chaîne Opératoire'', and Other Methods: The Epistemologies of Different Approaches to Lithic Analysis; The History and Efficacy of the ''Chaîne Opératoire'' Approach to Lithic Analysis: Studying Techniques to Reveal Past Societies in an Evolutionary Perspective |journal=PaleoAnthropology |page=336 |doi=10.4207/PA.2011.ART63 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 8, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Both were students of [[Marcel Mauss]] who had earlier recognised that societies could be understood through its techniques by virtue of the fact that operational sequences are steps organised according to an internal logic specific to a society.&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coupaye_440&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coupaye |first1=Ludovic |year=2009 |title=Ways of Enchanting: Chaînes Opératoires and Yam Cultivation in Nyamikum Village, Maprik, Papua New Guinea |journal=Journal of Material Culture |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=440 |doi=10.1177/1359183509345945}}&lt;!--|accessdate=January 28, 2013 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The chaîne opératoire was born out of the need to explicitly describe the methodology of [[lithic analysis]] in archaeological scholarship. It allows archaeologists to reconstruct the techniques used and the chronological ordering of the different steps required to produce an artifact.&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336/&gt; By understanding the processes and construction of tools, archaeologists can better determine the evolution of tool technology and the development of ancient cultures and lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;Forestier H, Zeitoun V, Winayalai C and Métais C 2013. The open-air site of Huai Hin (Northwestern Thailand): Chronological perspectives for the Hoabinhian. Comptes Rendus Palevol 12(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
Artifact analysis has undergone several changes throughout its history, shifting from an orientation as a natural science of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] humans to a social and cultural anthropology of the production techniques of prehistoric societies.&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336/&gt; From this perspective, a chaîne opératoire can be understood as a [[Social artifact|social product]], as it calls for an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] approach to artifact analysis (the integration of associated disciplines: [[archaeology]], [[sociocultural anthropology]], [[biological anthropology]], and [[anthropological linguistics]]), which offers a multidimensional view of a society, and demonstrates how chaînes opératoires cannot operate independently of the society that produces it.&lt;ref name=Gosselain1/&gt; Consequently, the study of the technique - or chaîne opératoire - enables one to better understand not only the society in which the technique originated, but also the social context, actions, and [[cognition]] that accompanied the production of an object.&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336/&gt; 

==Criticism of chaîne opératoire==

Critics of chaîne opératoire argue that it is subjective because it is based upon the analyst's personal experience and intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monnier|first1=Gilliane F.|last2=Missal|first2=Kele|title=Another Mousterian Debate? Bordian facies, chaîne opératoire technocomplexes, and patterns of lithic variability in the western European Middle and Upper Pleistocene|journal=Quaternary International|date=November 2014|volume=350|pages=59–83|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2014.06.053}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They further claim that it is not a replicable or quantifiable approach to data collection. A second objection is that chaîne opératoire claims to be able to identify the intentions and goals of prehistoric knappers, including the "desired endproducts" of knapping sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar‐Yosef|first1=Ofer|last2=Van Peer|first2=Philip|title=The Chaîne Opératoire Approach in Middle Paleolithic Archaeology|journal=Current Anthropology|date=February 2009|volume=50|issue=1|pages=103–131|doi=10.1086/592234|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2960197/Bar-Yosef_ChaineOperatoireApproach.pdf?sequence=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, what archaeologists select from an assemblage as 'end products' may not match what people in the past thought worthwhile to select for transport and subsequent use elsewhere in the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turq|first1=Alain|last2=Roebroeks|first2=Wil|last3=Bourguignon|first3=Laurence|last4=Faivre|first4=Jean-Philippe|title=The fragmented character of Middle Palaeolithic stone tool technology|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=November 2013|volume=65|issue=5|pages=641–655|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.07.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third major problem with the chaîne opératoire approach is that there is severe inconsistency in the application of definitions by lithic analysts. For example, since the publication of Boëda's definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boëda|first1=Eric|title=Le débitage Discoïde et le débitage Levallois récurrent centripète|journal=Bulletin de la Société Préhistorique Française,|date=1993|volume=90|page=392–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; of six nondisassociable criteria for Discoidal debitage,  numerous variants have been proposed, and many authors have argued for the presence of Levallois concept even when those six criteria were not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Draily|first1=C.|title=La Grotte Walou à Trooz (Belgique): Fouilles de 1996 à 2004 L'Archéologie.

The '''circumscription theory''' is a  theory of the role of warfare in [[state formation]] in [[political anthropology]], created by anthropologist [[Robert L. Carneiro|Robert Carneiro]]. The theory has been summarized in one sentence by Schacht: “In areas of circumscribed agricultural land, population pressure led to warfare that resulted in the evolution of the state”.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Robert M., “Circumscription Theory: A Critical Review,” American Behavioral Scientist, vol. 31, no. 4, pp. 439, March/April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graber, Robert B., and Paul Roscoe, “Introduction: Circumscription and the Evolution of Society,” American Behavioral Scientist, vol. 31, no. 4, pp. 406, March/April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The more circumscribed is an agricultural area, Carneiro argues, the sooner it politically unifies.

==Outline of the theory==

The theory begins with some assumptions. Warfare usually disperses people rather than uniting them. Environmental circumscription occurs when an area of productive agricultural land is surrounded by a less productive area such as the mountains, desert, or sea. Application of [[extensive agriculture]] would bring severely diminishing returns.

If there is no environmental circumscription, then losers in a war can migrate out from the region and settle somewhere else. If there is environmental circumscription, then losers in warfare are forced to submit to their conquerors, because migration is not an option and the populations of the conquered and conqueror are united. The new state organization strives to alleviate the population pressure by increasing the productive capacity of agricultural land through, for instance, more intensive cultivation using irrigation.

==Primary and secondary state development==

''Primary state development'' occurred in the six original states of the Nile Valley, Peru, Mesoamerican, Yellow River Valley China, Indus River Valley, and Mesopotamia. ''Secondary state development'' occurred in states that developed from contact with already existing states. Primary state development occurred in areas with environmental circumscription.

The presumption, under the Carneiro Hypothesis, is that agricultural intensification, and the social coordination and coercion necessary to achieve this end was a result of warfare in which vanquished populations could not disperse; the coercive coordination necessary for increased production of surplus is, under Carneiro's hypothesis, a causal factor in the origins of the State.  For example, the mountainous river valleys of Peru which descend to the Pacific coast were severely environmentally circumscribed. Amazonian populations could always disperse and maintain sparse contact with other, potentially hostile, neighbors, whereas Andean coastal populations could not.

==Criticism==

Carneiro's theory has been criticized by the Dutch "early state school" emerging in the 1970s around cultural anthropologist [[Henri J. M. Claessen|Henri J.M. Claessen]], on the ground that considerable contrary evidence can be found to Carneiro's theory. There are also cases of circumscribed environments and violent cultures which have failed to develop states, for example in the narrow highland valleys of interior Papua New Guinea, or the north west Pacific coastlines of North America.  Also for example, the formation of some early states in East Africa, Sri Lanka, and Polynesia do not easily fit with Carneiro's model. Hence Claessen's school developed a "complex interaction model" to explain early state formation, in which factors such as ecology, social and demographic structures, economic conditions, conflicts, and ideology become aligned in ways which favour state organisation.&lt;ref&gt;For some other criticisms see, e.g., [https://www.academia.edu/30911274/Circumscription_Theory_of_the_Origins_of_the_State_A_Cross-Cultural_Re-Analysis Circumscription Theory of the Origins of the State: A Cross-Cultural Re-Analysis. ''Cliodynamics'' 7/2 (2016): 187–203].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later development and revision==

The theory has since been applied to many other contexts, with some arguing it can be applied globally.&lt;ref&gt;One of the leading experts on [[world-systems theory]], [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]], noted in 1990 that the circumscription theory is applicable for the global system. "World State Formation: Historical Processes and Emergent Necessity," California: Institute for research on World System, working paper 1, 1990, http://irows.ucr.edu/papers/irows1.txxt&lt;/ref&gt; Carneiro has since also revised his theory in various ways. He has argued that population ''concentration'' can act as a lower level impetus for tribal conflict than geographic circumscription. He has also argued that, in addition to the necessities of conquest, a more important reason for creation of chiefdoms was the rise of war chiefs who use their military loyalists to [[coup d'etat|take over a group of villages]] and become [[Paramount chief|paramount chiefs]].&lt;ref name="Car2012"&gt;Carneiro, Robert. 2012.

The City of [[Oakland, California]], adopted a [[Zero waste|Zero Waste Strategic Plan]] in 2006, detailing a road map for the City to follow toward the implementation of a Zero Waste System by 2020.  As stated in a City Resolution, introduced by then Mayor [[Jerry Brown]], Zero Waste principles:

:"[P] romote the highest and best use of materials to eliminate [[waste]] and [[pollution]], emphasizing a closed-loop system of production and consumption, moving in logical increments toward the goal of zero waste through the core principles of":
:# Improving [[reuse]]/[[recycling]] of [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life products]] and materials to ensure their highest and best use;
:# Pursuing design strategies to minimize product hazards and lifestyles that limit consumption; and
:# Using [[waste disposal]] operations to improve the [[economy]] and develop the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution 79774, Adopting a zero waste goal by 2020|url=http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/13137.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023133100/http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/13137.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 23, 2006|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero Waste systems can be traced back to chemist Paul Palmer who developed and coined the concept in the 1970s (in Oakland, CA) in order to find a way to reuse the vast amount of [[chemical]]s produced by the [[electronics industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer|first=P|title=History of zero waste institute.|url=http://zerowasteinstitute.org/?page_id=202|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, cities like Oakland are adopting Zero Waste Systems to create a process that redirects all end-of-life products toward future applications in the marketplace, rather than to a [[landfill]].&lt;ref name="Zero Waste Alliance"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zero Waste Alliance|title=What is Waste?|url=http://www.zerowaste.org/case.htm#what_is|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oakland's Zero Waste Strategic Plan==

The city of Oakland's Zero Waste Strategic Plan set out in 2006 to reduce the annual tons of waste directed toward landfills from 400,000 tons to 40,000 annually by 2020. Chiefly, the city aimed to create comprehensive systems that transfer end-of-life products back into the economy. The City's Strategic Plan is based on five strategies that include recycling but also [[Product design|product]] and [[system design]] changes and policy revisions, as follows:
# Expand and Improve Local and Regional Recycling and Composting
#* Greater engagement with the general public and particularly the business community is necessary, requiring the development of additional recovery services and initiatives, for example, to support businesses that utilize the [[Port of Oakland]] and produce [[construction]] and [[demolition]] materials.
# Develop and Adopt New Rules and Incentives to Reduce Waste Disposal
#* Create stronger [[incentive]]s to “reward reuse, repair, and reduced consumption” to replace the present incentive to use landfills.
# Preserve Land for Sustainable Development and Green Industry Infrastructure
#* Expand industrial land for businesses that manufacture and make use of materials traditionally discarded. Create partnerships with StopWaste.Org, and East Bay Economic Alliance toward the development of policies that attract such businesses.
# Advocate for Manufacturer Responsibility for Product Waste, Ban Problem Materials
#* Adopt [[California]]’s [[Extended producer responsibility|Extended Producer Responsibility]] (EPR) created to require businesses to assume the responsibility for any environmental impacts resulting from their products (throughout the product’s life cycle).
# Educate, Promote and Advocate a Zero Waste Sustainability Agenda
#* Since only 15% of Oakland homes [[compost]], and 67% of waste continues to be produced by industries, stronger, though positive, messaging about Zero Waste and [[sustainability]] should be circulated and tailored for different audiences, situations and locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan|url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca/groups/pwa/documents/policy/oak025986.pdf|accessdate=March 6, 2011}} pp. 11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abiding by the system advocated by Zero Waste International Alliance, Oakland’s Zero Waste System follows “natural cycles, where all outputs are simply an input for another process.”  Moreover, Zero Waste systems place the “highest priority on conserving resources and retaining their form and function without burning, burying, or otherwise destroying their form and function. “  This calls for “eliminating discharges to land, water or air that harm natural systems,” as well as, “preventing rather than managing, waste and pollution, and recommitting to the priority ordering of the [[waste reduction]] hierarchy: first reduce consumption; next, reuse what is left; and finally, recycle anything that is no longer usable and landfill any residual.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan}} p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakland's Zero Waste System also examines each management of goods in accordance with specific criteria, such as:
* “Customer Benefits,” such as opportunities for residents and businesses to reduce [[greenhouse gas]]es and access to recycling services.
* “Economic Development,” such as the creation of jobs and the development of a range of employment opportunities within organizations that process, manufacture or sell “discards-based” businesses.
* “Financial,” such as cost to city and ratepayers, as well as pricing that incentivizes waste reduction and promotes recycling.
* “Innovation,” such as methods that allow for system upgrades and evolution over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution adopting evaluative criteria for assessing [[solid waste management]] system designs responsive to the zero waste by 2020 goal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==
In 2006, Oakland residents surpassed the state mandate of diverting 50% landfill waste from 580,000 to 400,000 tons, yet progress toward greater waste reduction was slowing down.  Meanwhile, consumption of materials and products continued to grow. Widespread evidence indicated that every stage of production, transportation, use and disposal of materials and products negatively impacted [[ecosystem]]s, the [[climate]], [[public health]] and [[biodiversity]]. The quantity of toxic materials in the disposal process was increasing and Oakland was struggling to maintain cost effective [[waste management]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan, p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakland's system of waste reduction in 2006 allowed businesses to determine how their products would be designed and packaged, without regulation. This practice left the [[consumer]]s and [[local government]]s to bear the burden of disposing of material goods. Zero Waste Systems, on the other hand, call for businesses to develop not only recyclable [[packaging]] and product designs, but designs that could have endless new uses and applications. The Zero Waste System, therefore, offered Oakland an ambitious strategy to address waste and inefficiencies endemic to the City's structure, economy and practices.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Causes/sources of excess waste ==
We commonly think of waste as garbage, or refuse; anything that becomes useless or a byproduct. In other words, waste has countless physical sources. Zero Waste Alliance  (2011) describes waste in this way:

:"In our industrial society waste results from the inefficient use of any resource and includes activities and products that generate by-products with no clear use, no [[market value]], or hazardous properties and by-products that decrease their potential value.  Waste takes many different forms: from solid and hazardous waste to wastes in energy and material use; wastes in manufacturing and administrative activities and wastes of [[human resources]].&lt;ref name="Zero Waste Alliance"/&gt;

When Oakland adopted its Zero Waste Strategic Plan in 2006, the actual 400,000 tons of waste consisted of the following:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
|Yard Trimmings || 9%
|-
|Food Waste || 12%
|-
|Clean Wood &amp; Other Organics || 9%
|-
|Metals || 6%
|-
|Glass || 1%
|-
|Plastic || 5%
|-
|Paper || 19%
|-
|Concrete, Asphalt, Roofing || 6%
|-
|Non-recyclables || 33%
|-
| || 100%
|}	

Oakland categorized the source of waste by the individual or group that submitted the waste to the City for disposal in landfills, (1) Non-residential or commercial sources and (2) Residential, including single family or multi-family sources.  At the time, 67% of waste was generated by non-residential sources, and residents produced 33%. Of this non-residential group, 30% was being hauled to landfills by entities over which the City had minimal control (those that haul their own garbage to the landfill), such as [[Cal Trans]], [[AC Transit]], [[BART]] and independent contractors. Of the 400,000 tons of material transferred to landfills, 67% could be recycled using city operations already established. Regional recovery and diversion options existed in 2006 for paper, glass, metals, plastics, yard trimmings, food, clean wood, [[concrete]], [[asphalt]], and [[Roofing material|roofing]]. The City recognized that it could minimize the transfer of these materials with additional focus on improving separation of materials, messaging to businesses regarding diversion and recycling options and stronger incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan, p. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and historical underpinnings==

The need for [[incentive]]s touches upon the social and historical forces that have led to excessive waste production.  As scholars, historians, environmentalists, and even politicians have increasingly asserted, the American [[economic system]] has long prioritized [[economic growth]] over preserving the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gore|first=A.|title=Earth in the balance: Ecology and the human spirit|year=2006|publisher=Rodale|location=New York|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach has often put nature at the bottom of our hierarchy of importance. As Porritt contends in Capitalism as if the World Matters, corporations focused on growth have not been held accountable for damages they cause to the environment; which has created very little incentive for industries to concern themselves with sustainability or [[environmental protection]]. With profit and growth as the ultimate goal, businesses have sought out the cheapest resources and environments lacking regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Porritt|first=J.|title=Capitalism as if the world matters|year=2005|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately environmental concerns didn’t come to the forefront until the 1970s when [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a series of pro-environment policy changes in response to a wave of environmental passion flaring across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vig|first=N.|title=Environmental policy: New directions for the twenty-first century|year=2010|publisher=CQ Press|location=Washington|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, while policies have led to environmental progress in some areas, such as in [[air quality]], governments have had a harder time implementing programs that regulate [[groundwater]] [[contaminant]]s. Meanwhile, landfills continue to contaminate ground and [[drinking water]] around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vig|title=Environmental policy: New directions for the twenty-first century|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, as late as 2006, the City of Oakland offered incentives for businesses to haul garbage to a landfill, rather than consider reuse and recycling options. Additionally, Oakland recognized in 2006 that a lack of [[service provider]]s for recycling and recovery efforts had prevented progress toward environmentally sustainable solutions. Also, the City had never set aside land needed for reuse and recycling business materials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, incentives and the marketplace were working against the City's environmental concerns. In fact, most product consumption serves to undermine a Zero Waste Policy because of the inherent negative “externalities,” or those factors outside the market transaction, which are not accounting for in the cost of producing and consuming an item. Historically, prices for [[toy]]s, [[watch]]es, [[car]]s, etc., have not covered the costs associated with disposing or recycling these items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salzman|first=J.|title=Environmental law and policy|year=2010|publisher=Thomson Reuters/Foundation Press|location=New York|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Oakland will remedy this flaw in the system by working toward shifting the responsibility of material disposal to the manufacturer instead of the government or the consumer. Further, rather than apply the [[tax base]] toward cleanup of contaminated landfills, the Zero Waste system will use the tax base to invest in recycling, composting and reuse facilities, called “Resource Recovery Parks.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Adopting a zero waste goal by 2020. Attachment A: Zero Waste Economy|url=http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/12914.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023133237/http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/12914.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 23, 2006|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of policy==

Oakland's Zero Waste Policy evolved out of a series of mandates originating with the [[California Integrated Waste Management Board|California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989]], which required every city and county in California to reduce their solid waste disposal amounts by 50% by year 2000. Soon after, in 1990, the Alameda County Waste Reduction and Recycling Initiative Charter Amendment (Measure D) mandated a 75% reduction in waste disposal countywide, allowing the Alameda County Source Reduction and Recycling Board to set a deadline for the goal. This board set 2010 as the deadline date. In 2002, the City of Oakland advocated for this goal by adopting a 75% reduction waste goal through Resolution 77500. This resolution called upon the Environmental Service Division of the City of Oakland's Public Works Agency to identify strategies to accomplish this goal. The City also amended the Oakland Municipal Code to establish requirements for construction and demolition [[debris]] waste reduction in 2002 through Ordinance #612253.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Marking another milestone in the evolution toward Zero Waste, [[San Francisco]] hosted the United Nations World Environment meeting of 2005, bringing together mayors across the country for a strategy session on waste disposal. Governor Jerry Brown's Sustainability Director at the time, Randy Hayes, played a pivotal role in Oakland's participation in the Accords and in creating momentum supporting Zero Waste systems within the Mayor's office. Brown signed the United Nations [[World Environment Day]] Urban Environmental Accords, pledging that Oakland would implement 21 action steps toward sustainability, which included a Zero Waste Goal. This accord meeting and related efforts spurred Oakland in 2006 to adopt a Zero Waste Strategic Plan, calling for 90% reduction in annual tons sent to landfills by 2020.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==Policy tools==

What policies are aiding Oakland's in advancing toward Zero Waste? Oakland's Zero Waste Economy document, created in 2006, presents a multifaceted approach that incorporates prescriptive regulation, incentive-based or financial payments, penalties, and capacity policy tools directing the City toward a more “environmentally and economically sustainable system where resources are kept in the production cycle”, as described below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution 79774, Adopting a zero waste goal by 2020. Attachment A: Zero Waste Economy.|url=http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/12914.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023133237/http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/12914.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 23, 2006|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescriptive regulations or those that mandate actions allowed by law, also known as “[[command and control regulation]]”:
*	Ban toxic products from landfills or [[incinerator]]s.
*	Prohibit sale of “unnecessarily toxic or polluting products.”
Financial Penalties, or those tools designed to mitigate environmental harm by charging the offending party [[tax]]es or [[fee]]s:
*	Require that the manufacturer be held financially responsible for the product's end-cycle.
Incentive-based actions or financial payment encourage behavior by subsidizing certain actions or methods:
*	Build incentives for product designers to develop packaging with the use of non-toxic materials and opt for designs that promote reuse, recycle, or composting.
*	Create incentives for businesses to abide by environmental and [[Worker protection laws|worker protection]] standards, rather than choose the least expensive production methods and hiring workers outside the [[United States]].
*	Establish financial incentives for businesses and residents to recycle more and create less waste. (Federal tax subsidies at the time provided financial incentives to industries that make products from virgin materials).
*	Build incentives for consumers to voice their interest in non-toxic, reusable, and recyclable products by only purchasing items that meet these standards.
[[Persuasion]] techniques offer soft approaches urging behavior to change by distributing or publicizing information about the environmental issue.
*	Require [[distributor]]s and [[retailer]]s to become education centers to inform consumers about proper disposal and work with manufacturers to build reusable packaging and [[crate]]s and reduce any packaging where possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salzman|first=J.|title=Environmental law and policy|pages=47–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status in 2011==

Oakland is no longer measuring progress in terms of diversion rates, which allows credits for recycling, [[population]] and economic factors, but evaluates waste reduction more ambitiously, in terms of total disposal tonnage.  The 90% reduction rate it seeks by 2020 will require Oakland to double the waste reduction it had achieved over the past 15 years.  After 2002, when the City adopted the 75% reduction rate goal, Oakland's Public Works Agency realized that the systems that enabled Oakland to reach a 50% reduction rate would not be sufficient for Oakland to reach a 75% reduction rate. Hence, improving the systems has been a primary focus since 2006, which are outlined in Strategies #2 and #4 of the Strategic Plan. These strategies aim to build an end to incentives to continue disposing in landfills, instead calling for [[manufacturer]]s to take responsibility for the products and their materials through the entire duration of product [[Product lifecycle (engineering)|life cycles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan, p. 3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 	

One third of the materials that were winding up at city landfills in 2002 did not have recovery possibilities, leaving landfills as the only option. Much of this had to do with factors outside of the City's control, for reaching the 75% reduction rate would require changes at the state and/or federal level where manufacturing decisions are made. In fact, within the Zero Waste Strategic Plan, strategies 4 and 5 largely depend on behaviors and regulations outside municipal boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan, p. 3-4, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 	
	
This realization led the City toward a stronger [[advocacy]] role, beginning when Jerry Brown was governor in 2002. Since that time, Oakland has been working with numerous regulatory and implementing agencies to advance legislation favoring system changes that allow for a Zero Waste goal to be achieved, including (to name a few):
*	The [[Association of Bay Area Governments]]
*	East Bay Development Alliance
*	[[Californians Against Waste]]
*	Berkeley Ecology Center
*	Product Policy Institute
*	National Recycling Coalition
*	[[Greenaction for Health and Environmental Justice|Greenaction for Heath and Environmental Justice]]

Oakland also worked in a national group to  develop a [http://captoolkit.wikispaces.com/ Zero Waste Toolkit] designed to aid governments in implementing an Energy &amp; Climate Action Plan (ECAP) for the reduction of greenhouse gases through materials management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gagliardi|first=M.|title=Materials Management Approaches for State and County Government|url=http://captoolkit.wikispaces.com|accessdate=April 28, 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, while advocating for systemic changes at the state and regional level, the City recognized a need for assistance in implementing system changes at the local level. In 2009, Oakland's Public Works Agency entered into contract with R3 Consulting for support with [[system analysis]], planning and implementation of Oakland's Zero Waste Strategic Plan. R3 Consulting was chosen as the most highly experienced agency in [[system design]] for municipal governments, having formerly completed projects with the Cities of [[Dublin, California|Dublin]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and [[Los Angeles]], as well as with StopWaste.org. R3's work plan was split into two phases with an estimated project end date in 2011, including:

* Phase 1—Assessing and testing models and Zero Waste system designs to identify best options.
* Phase 2—Implement selected system design options by supporting City staff in building work plans for “collection, processing, transfer, and disposal of discarded products and materials.”

According to Oakland's Public Works Agency Web site (April, 2011), Oakland has steadily advanced its progress toward Zero Waste in recent years. Residents have reduced their landfill disposal by 27% since 2000, down to approximately 100,000 tons, bringing the City markedly closer to its goal of minimizing waste to 40,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Oakland recycles|url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/PWA/o/FE/s/GAR/index.htm|accessdate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakland residents have played an important role in moving the City toward Zero Waste. Indeed, the “empowered consumer” is critical in the Zero Waste Economy. In our society, all systems circle back to money and sales (Gore, 2006).  Using their buying-power, consumers can tell industries that products must be non-toxic, reusable, recyclable or compostable or they will stay on the shelf. Following this directive, manufacturers and products designers will ultimately have no choice but to create or distribute sustainable products that drive the economy toward a [[paradigm]] that views production cycles as they do in nature, where “waste” is repurposed in the cycle of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution 79774, Adopting a zero waste goal by 2020.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8073">A '''closet drama''' is a [[play (theatre)|play]] that is not intended to be performed onstage, but read by a solitary reader or sometimes out loud in a small group. The contrast between closet drama and classic ‘stage’ dramas dates back to the late eighteenth century. Although non-performative in nature, closet drama is "a quite legitimate product of literary art." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25106077|title = The Legitimacy of the Closet-Drama|journal = The North American Review|volume = 187|issue = 627|pages = 213–223|last1 = Matthews|first1 = Brander|year = 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
== Definition ==
A closet drama (or closet play) is a [[play (theatre)|play]] created primarily for reading, rather than production. Closet dramas are traditionally defined in narrower terms as belonging to a genre of dramatic writing unconcerned with stage technique. Stageability is only one aspect of closet drama: historically, [[playwright]]s might choose the genre of 'closet' dramatic writing to avoid [[censorship]] of their works, for example in the case of political tragedies. Closet drama has also been used as a mode of dramatic writing for those without access to the commercial playhouse, and in this context has become closely associated with early modern women's writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-5|[4]]] Closet dramas were published in manuscript form, including ''dramatis personae'' and elaborate stage directions, allowing readers to imagine the text as if it was being performed.[[Closet drama#cite note-6|[5]]] This created an "unusually tight fusion between book and reader as it endeavours to stimulate the theatrical imagination." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The playwrights did not have to worry about the pressure to impress an audience due to their audience being who they chose. Thus, it was considered to be a freeing style of writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-:1-2|[1]]]

Marta Straznicky describes the form as "part of a larger cultural matrix in which closed spaces, selective interpretive communities, and political dissent are aligned." &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Privacy, playreading, and women's closet drama, 1500-1700|last=Straznicky|first=Marta|publisher=Cambridge University Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-521-84124-5|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Print is the crucial factor behind closet dramas: "a play that is not intended for commercial performance can nevertheless cross between private playreading and the public sphere" through this medium.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Women in closet drama ==
In the early modern period, women writers who were unable to ‘use their voice’ in public were able to emphasize their opinions using the form of closet drama. This outlet for communication provided women with the ability to "engage in political discourse without exposing her views to an indiscriminate public," &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; since they could choose to restrict their readership. However, women's writing could be influenced by societal pressures and occurrences.

[[Margaret Lucas Cavendish]], author of fourteen folio volumes,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  explored writing closet dramas during her exile and became one of the most well known women playwrights due to her interest in philosophical nature. [[Closet drama#cite note-:0-1|[1]]] Although living in relative oppression, women dealt with the risks of public shame and rejection in the effort to have their writing recognized.

Other notable women involved in closet drama include [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]], [[Jane Lumley, Baroness Lumley|Jane Lumley]], and [[Elizabeth Cary, Viscountess Falkland|Elizabeth Cary]].

==History==
The philosophical [[dialogue]]s of ancient Greek and Roman writers such as [[Plato]] (see [[Socratic dialogue]]) were written in the form of conversations between "characters" and are in this respect similar to closet drama, many of which feature little action but are often rich in philosophical rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1998|title=Recent Studies in Closet Dramas|jstor=43447570|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume=28|issue=1|pages=142–160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[Friedrich von Schlegel]], many have argued that the [[tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Seneca the Younger]] in the first century AD were written to be recited at small parties rather than performed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1994|title=Profane Stoical Paradoxes': 'The Tragedie of Mariam' and Sidnean Closet Drama|jstor=43447747|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume= 24|issue=1|pages=104–134|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that theory has become widely pervasive in the history of theater, there is no evidence to support the contention that his plays were intended to be read or recited at small gatherings of the wealthy. The emperor [[Nero]], a pupil of Seneca, may have performed in some of them. Some of the drama of the [[Middle Ages]] was of the closet-drama type, such as the drama of [[Hrosvit|Hroswitha of Gandersheim]] and [[Medieval debate poetry|debate poems]] in quasi-dramatic form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Elizabethan and Jacobean ===
[[Fulke Greville]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|Sir William Alexander]], and [[Mary Sidney]] wrote closet dramas in the age of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Randall, Dale J. B. ''Winter Fruit: English Drama 1642&amp;#x2013;1660.'' Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1642 and 1660, the English government banned public performance. During this time, playreading became a "substitute" for playgoing. Thus, playwrights were moved to take on "propagandist aims" against parliament and topics beyond the theatre in their writing, meaning reading such work could be considered a revolutionary act. However, playwrights could write in relative security, protected by the anonymous means of print. [[Thomas Killigrew]] is an example of a stage playwright who turned to closet drama when his plays could no longer be produced during this period; he was in exile from England during the [[English Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kennedy, Dennis. ''Theatre &amp; Performance''. Oxford University Press, 2003 p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660, some authors continued to favour closet drama, proving that the form "served a cultural function distinct from that of commercial drama." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;[[John Milton]]'s play ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', written in 1671, is an example of [[early modern]] drama never intended for the stage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nineteenth century ===
Several closet dramas in [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse]] were written in Europe after 1800; these plays were by and large inspired by classical models.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''[[Faust, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Faust, Part 2]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], among the most acclaimed pieces in the history of [[German literature]], were written as closet dramas, though both plays have been frequently staged. [[Lord Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and [[Alexander Pushkin]] devoted much time to the closet drama.

The popularity of closet drama at this time was both a sign of, and a reaction to, the decline of the verse [[tragedy]] on the European stage in the 1800s. Popular tastes in theater were shifting toward [[melodrama]] and [[comedy]] and there was little commercial appeal in staging verse tragedies (though [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Robert Browning]], and others wrote verse dramas that were staged in commercial theaters). Playwrights who wanted to write verse tragedy had to resign themselves to writing for readers, rather than actors and audiences. Nineteenth-century closet drama became a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theater and performance.

The '''Cytodeme''' is the total assembly of organisms that use an identical suite of chromosomes to carry their genes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The term was first printed in the 1950s in a book by Heslop-Harrison.&lt;ref name="Heslop-Harrison"&gt;Heslop-Harrison,1953.''New Concepts in Flowering Plant Taxonomy'' Heineman, London&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the ''Deme Terminology''&lt;ref name="Gilmour &amp; Gregor"&gt;Gilmour &amp; Gregor, 1939. "Demes:a suggested new terminology" ''Nature, London'' '''144''':333-334&lt;/ref&gt; - he continued ''"cytodeme, a population differing in some distinctive cytological feature from others."'' In most cases the suite is composed of several pairs of [[homologous chromosome]]s with or without a pair of [[sex chromosome]]s. Since the only acceptable proof of the identity ([[homology (biology)|homology]]) of chromosomes lies in their ability to pair fully from end to end during [[meiosis]] it follows that:

#In asexual taxa membership of a cytodeme can only be presumed on such evidence as visual similarity of chromosomal ideotype, but never proved.
#In sexual taxa all of the members of one cytodeme are fully intercompatible (within the limits of sex and other genetical constraints like self-incompatibility mechanisms) yielding the fertile progeny which proves their membership.

As a general rule for most species all of its members are of the same cytodeme excepting only the infrequent [[aneuploid]] aberrants. However some species are known to include several chromosome races which must necessarily belong to different cytodemes. Although it is not intrinsic in the formal definition it is a matter of common observation that members of different cytodemes are essentially cross-incompatible and any hybrids that do arise are usually highly infertile.

==Significance==
The current surgance of interest in cytodemes stems from the realisation that membership of the cytodeme is not necessarily restricted to the members of one species: frequently two or more species are in fact of the same cytodeme. Although fully intercompatible and yielding fertile hybrids when they do cross these species never or rarely cross-breed in the natural environment because they are spatially isolated, geographically and/or ecologically. Typically the species involved are members of the same genus. There are now a substantial number of cases in which two or more species of the same cytodeme are clearly different and even in different genera. Thus all five [[diploid]] species recognised in the genus ''[[Brassicella]]'' and both species recognised in the genus ''[[Hutera]]'' (7spp. in total) are in the same cytodeme.&lt;ref name="Harberd"&gt;Harberd,1972. "A contribution to the cyto-taxonomy of ''Brassica''(Cruciferae) and its allies." ''Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society''.'''65''':1-23&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most extreme case on record concerns the wild grass, [[teosinte]], ''[[Euchlaena mexicana]]'' and the strikingly different Maize, or Indian Corn, ''[[Zea mays]]'', both 2n=20, fully interfertile and yielding fertile [[hybrid (genetics)|hybrids]].&lt;ref name="Beadle"&gt;Beadle, 1980. "The Ancestry of Corn". ''Scientific American'','''242''':112-119&lt;/ref&gt; There is perhaps a remote possibility that two such very different species could have evolved independently from distinct sources and converged in their chromosomal ideotype until they became members of the same cytodeme (including the capacity to cross-breed). It is more likely, though, that the cytodeme arose first complete with its suite of chromosomes and breeding patterns all intact and then, remaining constant in its fundamentals, it diversified into species sometimes so different as to merit generic distinction. Thus, in what may be termed the ''cytodeme adjunct'' to Darwinian theory, evolution becomes a two-stage process - first, the establishment of distinct cytodemes reproductively isolated both from one another and from all previously existing cytodemes; second, diversification within cytodeme to yield taxonomically recognisable (but not reproductively isolated) species.

Whereas the second stage is [[Natural Selection]] as expounded by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]],&lt;ref name="Darwin"&gt;Darwin,1859.''On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection''. John Murray, London&lt;/ref&gt; the first stage is not necessarily Darwinian{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. In the special case of [[polyploidy]] it is known that the first stage is not Darwinian. Doubling the chromosome number of the [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]] hybrid between two diploid cytodemes yields an [[allotetraploid]] which is both fertile within its bounds and essentially incompatible with all previous life forms.

As yet no mechanism is known which could account for the origin of new diploid cytodemes - nor is there any proof that there are any diploid cytodemes of recent origin. Indeed, the evidence is that cytodemes are remarkably long lived. Presumably the ''[[Platanus]]'' cytodeme existed on [[Pangaea]] before that land fragmented. The present day forms of ''Platanus'' - ''[[Platanus orientalis|P. orientalis]]'' in Europe and ''[[Platanus occidentalis|P. occidentalis]]'' in America - are fully intercompatible when brought together artificially in Botanic Gardens yielding fertile hybrids like the London plane,&lt;ref name="Santamour"&gt;Santamour, 1972. "Interspecific hybrids in ''Platanus''." ''Forest Science''.'''18''':236-239.&lt;/ref&gt; establishing not only that they are in the same cytodeme as one another but also that they are both in the same cytodeme as their common ancestor of approximately 200 million years ago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6135">{{Expand German|Tanzverbot|date=November 2012}}
'''Dancing bans''' are legal or religious prohibitions against dancing, which have been applied at various times in various jurisdictions around the world. Even more controversial than recreational or artistic dancing have been sexually suggestive forms such as [[lap dancing]], [[topless dancing]], and [[rave]] dancing.

==Legal bans==
''Tanzverbot'' is the German term for "dancing ban". In Germany and Switzerland, dancing on some holidays is banned by most [[German states|state]] or [[Swiss cantons|canton]] governments. These occasions are certain [[Christianity|Christian]] and secular holidays aimed at mourning or contemplation, such as [[Good Friday]], [[All Saints' Day]] (from its association with [[All Souls' Day]] practices) or memorial days like [[Volkstrauertag]]. The German and Swiss dancing bans prohibit public parties, but not dancing in one's private residence.

Until 1999, an ordinance in [[Pound, Virginia]] required that dance hall permits not be granted "to anyone who is not a proper person, nor to a person who is not a person of good moral character". After community opposition to granting him a permit, a lawsuit by William Elam, owner of the Golden Pine restaurant, resulted in the ordinance being struck down as unconstitutionally vague and infringing on free expression protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. A replacement ordinance drafted more narrowly prompted a 2001 lawsuit from Elam, though the restaurant later went out of business after revocation of its alcohol license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/identity/dance_pound.htm|title=Pound, Virginia Bans Dancing?|accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/z/gpine.htm|title=Part 2: ABC revokes Golden Pine restaurant's license to sell alcohol|accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1926, the [[New York City Cabaret Law]] has prohibited dancing in all spaces open to the public that sell food and/or drink with the exception of those who obtain a cabaret license. This law was still enforced until it was repealed in 2017. 

Between 1985 and 2002, a [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] law called the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]] enacted strict legal requirements for those wishing to have dancing by youth under the age of 21, effectively banning events that would feature young people dancing.

===Historic bans===
From the 1830s to 1950s, [[play party (U.S. traditional)|play parties]] became popular as a means to circumvent restrictions on dancing.

The events of the [[Footloose (1984 film)|1984 film ''Footloose'']] were inspired by a dancing ban in the heavily [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] town of [[Elmore City, Oklahoma]], which lasted until 1980.
==Religious bans==
===Christianity===
Various Christian groups believe that dancing is either inherently sinful or that certain forms of dancing could lead to sinful thoughts or activities, and thus proscribe it either in general or during religious services. These include some adherents of [[Mennonite]], [[Hutterite]], [[Baptist]], [[Seventh-day Adventist]], and [[Holiness movement]] sects. [[Jehovah's Witness]]es disfavor events where there might be sexually suggestive dancing or excessive drinking of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defendingjehovahswitnesses.blogspot.com/2012/01/how-do-jehovahs-witnesses-view-dancing.html|title=How Do Jehovah's Witnesses View Dancing?|accessdate=2012-11-17|date=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Church of the Nazarene]] recommends against "All forms of dancing that detract from spiritual growth and break down proper moral inhibitions and reserve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf|title=Manual|page=51|year=2005–2009|author=Church of the Nazarene|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302214359/http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian churches determine doctrine locally and may be non-denominational, and these vary on their stances on social dancing.

In contrast, some strains of [[Charismatic Christianity]] practice rituals in which the [[Holy Spirit]] is believed to cause spontaneous dancing, among other behaviors. [[Mormonism]] has embraced social dancing to some degree since its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5654 |contribution= Dance |pages= 354-355 |last= Jacobson |first= Phyllis C. |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H |editor-link= Daniel H. Ludlow |year= 1992 |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |location= New York |publisher= [[Macmillan Publishing]] |isbn= 0-02-879602-0 |oclc= 24502140 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Islam===
In Islam, [[Salafists]] and [[Wahhabis]] consider dancing in general to be ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-08-31/news/33500441_1_music-and-dance-couples-dances-anti-dance|date=2012-08-31|title=Does Islam ban dancing and music?|agency=Slate|author=Brian Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Islamic and [[Orthodox Jewish]] traditions prohibit contact between men and women in public (especially those not married to each other), and thus in these societies men and women either dance separately or not at all.

In contrast, [[Sufism]] encourages dancing, for example [[Sufi whirling]] and dancing to celebrate [[Mela Chiraghan]]. This has resulted in conflict in areas influenced by the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/07/pakistani-festival-dancer_n_183960.html|accessdate=2012-11-17|date=2009-05-08|title=Pakistani Festival Dancers Banned By Religious Group|author=Stuart Whatley|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2011}}
'''Dyson's eternal intelligence''' concept (the '''Dyson Scenario'''), proposed by [[Freeman Dyson]] in 1979, 
proposes a means by which an [[immortality|immortal]] society of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligent]] beings in an [[open universe]]
may escape the prospect of [[Heat death of the universe|heat death]] by extending [[subjective time]] to infinity even though expending only a finite amount of energy.

[[Bremermann's limit]] can be invoked to deduce that the amount of time to perform a computation on 1 bit is inversely proportional to the change in energy in the system.  As a result, the amount of computations that can be performed grows logarithmically over time.  Therefore, any arbitrary amount of computation can be performed in a finite, albeit exponentially growing, time span. 

The intelligent beings would begin by storing a finite amount of energy. They then use half (or any fraction) of this energy to power their thought. When the energy gradient created by unleashing this fraction of the stored fuel was exhausted, the beings would enter a state of zero-energy-consumption until the universe cooled. Once the universe had cooled sufficiently, half of the remaining half (one quarter of the original energy) of the intelligent beings' fuel reserves would once again be released, powering a brief period of thought once more. This would continue, with smaller and smaller amounts of energy being released. As the universe cooled, the thoughts would be slower and slower, but there would still be an infinite number of them.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, [http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Omega/dyson.txt "Time without end: Physics and biology in an open universe,"] ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', Vol. 51, Issue 3 (July 1979), pp. 447-460; {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447}}. See also [http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447 here] and [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979RvMP...51..447D here.][[Freeman Dyson]], ''Disturbing the Universe'', 1979, {{ISBN|0-06-011108-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1998 it was discovered that the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating rather than decelerating due to a positive [[cosmological constant]], implying that any two regions of the universe will eventually become permanently separated from one another.

[[Frank J. Tipler]] has cited Dyson's writings, and specifically his writings on the  eternal intelligence, as a major influence on his own highly controversial [[Omega Point]] theory.&lt;ref&gt; Audio interview with Frank Tipler- White Gardenia interview with Frank Tipler, December 2015 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMkp1kZN5n4&amp;t=26s &lt;/ref&gt;
Tipler's theory differs from Dyson's theory on several key points, most notable of which is that Dyson's eternal intelligence presupposes an open universe while Tipler's Omega Point presupposes a closed/ contracting universe.  Both theories will be invalidated if the observed universal  expansion continues to accelerate.&lt;ref&gt;Q&amp;A with Frank Tipler http://turingchurch.com/2012/09/26/interview-with-frank-j-tipler-nov-2002/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecphonesis''' ({{lang-el|ἐκφώνησις}}) is an emotional, exclamatory phrase ([[wikt:exclamation|exclamation]]) used in poetry, drama, or song. It is a [[rhetorical device]] that originated in ancient literature.

A Latin example is [[O tempora o mores!|"O tempora! O mores!"]] ("Oh, the times! Oh, the morals!"). A modern example is "Young man!" from the song [[Y.M.C.A. (song)|YMCA]] by the [[Village People]].

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] used ecphonesis in “[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]:” &lt;blockquote&gt;"Almighty God!--no, no! They heard!--they suspected!--they knew!--they were making a mockery of my horror!--this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now--again!--hark! louder! louder! louder! louder! "'Villains!' I shrieked, 'dissemble no more! I admit the deed!--tear up the planks! here, here!--It is the beating of his hideous heart!'"&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other examples of ecphonesis include when Homer Simpson said "No! No-no-no-no-no-no! Well, yes." during ''The Simpsons'' episode "Homer The Heretic,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homer The Heretic|url=http://simpsons-scripts.wikidot.com/homer-the-heretic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when the Scarecrow said "Oh joy! Rapture! I got a brain!" in ''The Wizard of Oz.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wizard of Oz (1939) Quotes|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/quotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Trump]] has used the expressions "Sad!" and "Wrong!" without elaboration throughout his 2016 presidential campaign.

== In Eastern Orthodox Liturgy ==
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] many prayers are recited silently by the priest who "speaks to God face-to-face" according to St. [[Symeon of Thessaloniki]].  However, the closing words of such prayers are usually chanted aloud, especially at the closing of an [[ectenia|ectenia (litany)]], and those closing words are called an '''ecphonesis'''.

''Examples:''

* In the [[anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora]] (eucharistic prayer), the prayer following the [[sanctus]] is said silently by the priest but its ending, the [[Words of Institution]], are intoned in a loud voice.
* During most [[ectenia]]s the priest silently recites a prayer up to its last line and then, when the ectenia has concluded, he chants aloud that last line.

'''''Emigre''''' ({{ISSN|1045-3717}}) was a graphic design magazine published by [[Emigre (type foundry)|Emigre Graphics]] between 1984 and 2005; it was first published in 1984 in [[San Francisco, California]], United States. Art-directed by [[Rudy VanderLans]] using fonts designed by his wife, [[Zuzana Licko]], ''Emigre'' was one of the first publications to use [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers and had a large influence on graphic designers moving into [[desktop publishing]] (DTP). Its variety of layouts, use of guest designers, and opinionated articles also had an effect on other design publications.

The focus of ''Emigre'' was both redundant and wandering — both positive qualities as a journal produced by a tight and evolving group of designers and writers with Vanderlans at the center. Vanderlans was typically editor, though guest-editors also appeared ([[Gail Swanlund]], Anne Burdick, Andrew Blauvelt) and the work/writing of Zuzana Licko and [[Jeffery Keedy]] reappeared throughout the magazine's history.

The magazine began in 1984 with a focus on the [[émigré]]. The first eight issues were concerned with boundaries, international culture, travel accounts and alienation (as the issues' titles suggest). The first eight issues also incorporated a dynamic aesthetic that caught the attention of designers and led to the next stage in the magazine's evolution.

Beginning with Issue 9 — devoted to the art of [[Vaughan Oliver]] at [[4AD]] — the magazine explored design in itself, devoting issues to [[Cranbrook Educational Community|Cranbrook]], the [[Macintosh]], type design and individual graphic designers. In two issues in 1992 and 1993, the magazine chronicled the work of [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] and [[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]].

Increasingly, ''Emigre'' became a platform for essays and writings on design. This aspect of ''Emigre'' came to the forefront with issues in 1994 and the magazine changed its format in 1995 from its oversized layout to a text-friendlier format that debuted with Issue 33. The magazine retained this character through Issue 59 in 2001.

Emigre then took a sharp turn with four re-formatted issues in 2001 and 2002 that included one DVD ("Catfish," an experimental documentary film on the work of designer and performance artist Elliott Earls) and three compact discs (featuring the music of [[Honey Barbara]], [[The Grassy Knoll (band)|The Grassy Knoll]] and Scenic.

In its fifth and final incarnation, the last six issues of ''Emigre'' were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]] as small softcover books. The last issue, The End, was published in 2005.

==Formats==
The magazine changed formats several times: it was originally published quarterly in a large format where each page measures 285&amp;nbsp;mm x 425&amp;nbsp;mm (slightly shorter than 11" x 17" or US ledger/tabloid size); starting with issue 33, each page was about 8.5" x 11" (US letter size); it changed into a multimedia format (a booklet where each page was 133&amp;nbsp;mm x 210&amp;nbsp;mm, plus a [[CD]] or [[DVD]]) starting with issue 60; and finally, starting with issue 64, the magazine became a book format, published semi-annually, where each page measured 133&amp;nbsp;mm x 210&amp;nbsp;mm. The issues in the book format were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]].

The '''epoxyeicosatrienoic acids''' or '''EETs''' are signaling molecules formed within various types of cells by the metabolism of [[arachidonic acid]] by a specific subset of [[Cytochrome P450]] enzymes termed cytochrome P450 [[epoxygenase]]s.&lt;ref name=boron108&gt;{{cite book | first = Walter F. | last = Boron | name-list-format = vanc | title = Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approach | publisher = Elsevier/Saunders | year = 2003 | page = 108 | isbn = 1-4160-2328-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These [[nonclassic eicosanoid]]s are generally short-lived, being rapidly converted from epoxides to less active or inactive dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acids (diHETrEs) by a widely distributed cellular enzyme, [[Soluble epoxide hydrolase]] (sEH), also termed Epoxide hydrolase 2.  The EETs consequently function as transiently acting, short-range [[hormone]]s; that is, they work locally to regulate the function of the cells that produce them (i.e. they are [[Autocrine signalling|autocrine]] agents) or of nearby cells (i.e. they are [[Paracrine signalling|paracrine]] agents). The EETs have been most studied in animal models where they show the ability to lower blood pressure possibly by '''a)''' stimulating arterial [[Vasodilator|vasorelaxation]] and '''b)''' inhibiting the kidney's retention of salts and water to decrease intravascular blood volume.  In these models, EETs prevent arterial occlusive diseases such as [[heart attack]]s and [[brain stroke]]s not only by their anti-hypertension action but possibly also by their [[anti-inflammatory]] effects on blood vessels, their inhibition of platelet activation and thereby blood clotting, and/or their promotion of [[Fibrinolysis|pro-fibrinolytic]] removal of blood clots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spector AA, Fang X, Snyder GD, Weintraub NL | title = Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs): metabolism and biochemical function | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–90 | date = Jan 2004 | pmid = 14636671 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-7827(03)00049-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to their effects on the heart, the EETs are often termed cardio-protective. Beyond these cardiovascular actions that may prevent various [[cardiovascular diseases]], studies have implicated the EETs in the pathological growth of certain types of cancer and in the physiological and possibly pathological perception of [[neuropathic pain]].  While studies to date imply that the EETs, EET-forming epoxygenases, and EET-inactivating sEH can be manipulated to control a wide range of human diseases, clinical studies have yet to prove this.  Determination of the role of the EETS in human diseases is made particularly difficult because of the large number of EET-forming epoxygenases, large number of epoxygenase substrates other than arachidonic acid, and the large number of activities, some of which may be pathological or injurious, that the EETs possess.&lt;ref name="Front Pharmacol 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tacconelli S, Patrignani P | title = Inside epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and cardiovascular disease | journal = Frontiers in Pharmacology | volume = 5 | pages = 239 | pmid = 25426071 | doi = 10.3389/fphar.2014.00239 | pmc=4226225 | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
EETS are [[epoxide]] eicosatrienoic acid metabolites of [[arachidonic acid]] (a straight chain [[Eicosatetraenoic acid]], [[omega-6 fatty acid]]).  Arachidonic acid has 4 cis [[double bond]]s (see [[Cis–trans isomerism]] which are abbreviated with the notation ''Z'' in the IUPAC [[Chemical nomenclature]] used here. These double bonds are located between carbons 5-6, 8-9, 11-12, and 14-15; arachidonic acid is therefore 5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid. Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases attack these double bonds to form their respective eicosatrienoic acid epoxide regioisomers (see [[Structural isomer]], section on position isomerism (regioisomerism)) viz., 5,6-EET (i.e. 5,6-epoxy-8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid), 8,9-EET (i.e. 5,6-epoxy-8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid), 11,12-EET (i.e. 11,12-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid), or, as drawn in the attached figure, 14,15-EET (i.e. 14,15-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid). The enzymes generally form both ''R''/''S'' [[enantiomers]] at each former double bond position; for example, cytochrome P450 epoxidases metabolize arachidonic acid to a mixture of 14''R'',15''S''-EET and 14''S'',15''R''-EET.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spector AA, Kim HY | title = Cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 356–65 | date = Apr 2015 | pmid = 25093613 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.07.020 | pmc=4314516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of enzymes is distributed broadly throughout bacteria, [[archaea]], fungi, plants, animals, and even viruses (see [[Cytochrome P450]]).  The superfamily comprises more than 11,000 genes categorized into 1,000 families. Humans have 57 putatively active CYP genes and 58 CYP [[pseudogenes]]; only a relatively few of the active CYP genes code for EET-forming epoxygenases, i.e. protein enzymes with the capacity to attach atomic oxygen (see [[Allotropes of oxygen#Atomic oxygen]]) to the carbon-carbon double bonds of unsaturated long chain fatty acids such as arachidonic acid.&lt;ref name="Pharmacol Ther 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shahabi P, Siest G, Meyer UA, Visvikis-Siest S | title = Human cytochrome P450 epoxygenases: variability in expression and role in inflammation-related disorders | journal = Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | volume = 144 | issue = 2 | pages = 134–61 | date = Nov 2014 | pmid = 24882266 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2014.05.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fleming I | title = The pharmacology of the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase/soluble epoxide hydrolase axis in the vasculature and cardiovascular disease | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 1106–40 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25244930 | doi = 10.1124/pr.113.007781 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CYP epoxygenases fall into several subfamilies including CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP2E, CYP2J, and within the CYP3A sub family, [[CYP3A4]]; in humans, [[CYP2C8]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C19]], [[CYP2J2]], and possibly [[CYP2S1]] [[isoforms]] are the main producers of EETs although [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C18]], [[CYP3A4]], [[CYP4A11]], [[CYP4F8]], and [[CYP4F12]] are capable of producing the EETs and may do so in certain tissues.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pharmacol Ther 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Panigrahy D, Greene ER, Pozzi A, Wang DW, Zeldin DC | title = EET signaling in cancer | journal = Cancer Metastasis Reviews | volume = 30 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 525–40 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22009066 | pmc = 3804913 | doi = 10.1007/s10555-011-9315-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12675279|year=2003|author1=Ayajiki|first1=K|title=Mediation of arachidonic acid metabolite(s) produced by endothelial cytochrome P-450 3A4 in monkey arterial relaxation|journal=Hypertension Research|volume=26|issue=3|pages=237–43|last2=Fujioka|first2=H|last3=Toda|first3=N|last4=Okada|first4=S|last5=Minamiyama|first5=Y|last6=Imaoka|first6=S|last7=Funae|first7=Y|last8=Watanabe|first8=S|last9=Nakamura|first9=A|last10=Okamura|first10=T|doi=10.1291/hypres.26.237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CYP epoxygenases can epoxidize any of the double bounds in arachidonic acid but most of them are relatively selective in that they make appreciable amounts of only one or two EETs with 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET accounting for 67%-80% of the product made by the cited CYP epoxidases as well as the main EETs made by mammalian tissues.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  CYP2C9, CYP2JP, and possibly the more recently characterized CYP2S1 appear to be the main produces of the EETs in humans with CYPP2C9 being the main EET producer in vascular endothelial cells and CYP2JP being highly expressed (although less catalytically active than CYP2C) in heart muscle, kidneys, pancreas, lung, and brain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang L, Mäki-Petäjä K, Cheriyan J, McEniery C, Wilkinson IB | title = The role of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in the cardiovascular system | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–44 | date = Jul 2015 | pmid = 25655310 | pmc = 4500322 | doi = 10.1111/bcp.12603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CYP2S1 is expressed in [[macrophages]], liver, lung, intestine, and spleen and is abundant in human and mouse [[atherosclerosis]] (i.e. [[Atheroma]]) plaques as well as inflamed tonsils.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
 
ETEs are commonly produced by the stimulation of specific cell types.  The stimulation causes arachidonic acid to be released from the ''sn-2'' position of cellular [[phospholipid]]s through the action of  [[Phospholipase A2]]-type enzymes and subsequent attack of the released arachidonic acid by a CYP epoxidase.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  In a typical example of this mechanism, [[bradykinin]] or [[acetylcholine]] acting through their respective [[Bradykinin receptor B2]] and [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1]] or [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3]] stimulate vascular endothelial cells to make and release EETs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The CYP epoxygenases, similar to essentially all CYP450 enzymes, are involved in the metabolism of diverse [[xenobiotics]] and natural compounds.  Since many of these same compounds also induce increases in the levels of the epoxygenases, CYP oxygenase levels and consequently EET levels in humans vary widely and are highly dependent on their recent consumption history.&lt;ref name="Pharmacol Ther 2014"/&gt;

==Metabolism of EETs==
In cells, the EETs are rapidly metabolized by a cytosolic [[soluble epoxide hydrolase]] (sEH) which adds water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) across the epoxide to form their corresponding [[Vicinal (chemistry)]] [[diol]] dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (diHETrEs or DHETs), i.e. sEH converts 14,15-ETE to 14,15-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (14,15-diHETrE), 11,12-ETE to 11,12-diHETrE, 8,9-ETE to 8,9-diHETrE, and 5,6-ETE to 5,6-diHETrE.&lt;ref name="Gene p 10"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris TR, Hammock BD | title = Soluble epoxide hydrolase: gene structure, expression and deletion | journal = Gene | volume = 526 | issue = 2 | pages = 61–74 | date = Sep 2013 | pmid = 23701967 | pmc = 3733540 | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The product diHETrEs, like their epoxy precursors, are [[enantiomer]] mixtures; for instance, sEH converts 14,15-ETE to a mixture of 14(''S''),15(''R'')-diHETrE and  14(''R''),15(''S'')-diHETrE.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  However, 5,6-EET is a relatively poor substrate for sEH and in cells is more rapidly metabolized by [[cyclooxygenase-2]] to form 5,6-epoxy-prostaglandin F1α.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frömel T, Fleming I | title = Whatever happened to the epoxyeicosatrienoic Acid-like endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor?

==Clinical significance==

===Regulation of blood pressure===
With respect to the regulation of blood pressure as well as the kidneys' regulation of salt and water absorption (which contributes to blood pressure regulation), EETS are counterpoises to another CYP-derived arachidonic acid metabolite, [[20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]] (20-HETE).  In humans, the major CYPs making 20-HETE are [[CYP4A11]], [[CYP4F2]], and [[CYP4F3]]. In animal models, 20-HETE raises blood pressure by contracting arteries and stimulating the kidney to reabsorb salt and water to increase the intravascular volume (see [[20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]]). EETs have the opposite effects. They are one type of [[Endothelium-Derived Hyperpolarizing Factor]], i.e. a substance and/or electrical signal synthesized or generated in and released from the vascular endothelium that hyperpolarize nearby vascular smooth muscle cells.  This causes these cells to relax and thereby lowers blood pressure. In animal (primarily rodent) models, EETs dilate smaller sized resistance arteries involved in causing hypertension as well as cardiac and renal arteries.  They cause smooth muscle hyperpolarization by opening vascular smooth muscle [[large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels]], opening certain vascular smooth muscle [[transient receptor potential channels]], or facilitating the movement of excitatory signals through [[gap junctions]] between endothelium and smooth muscles or between smooth muscles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The actual mechanism(s) involved in these EET-induced effects have not been fully elucidated although some studies implicate EET binding to an unidentified [[Cell surface receptor]] and/or [[Gs protein]]-linked [[G protein–coupled receptor]] to initiate the signal pathway(s) leading to the cited channel and gap junction changes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; With respect to the kidney, studies in rodents find that 20-HETE increases sodium and water reabsorption while the EETs, which are made in the proximal tubules and cortical collecting ducts, reduce sodium ion and water transport at both sites by inhibiting kidney [[Sodium–hydrogen antiporter]] (i.e. Na+/H+ exchanger) and/or [[Epithelial sodium channel]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fan F, Muroya Y, Roman RJ | title = Cytochrome P450 eicosanoids in hypertension and renal disease | journal = Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–46 | date = Jan 2015 | pmid = 25427230 | doi = 10.1097/MNH.0000000000000088 | pmc=4260681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mice lacking either of the EET-producing Cyp2c44 or Cyp4ac44 genes (by [[gene knockout]]) develop hypertension when fed high sodium or high potassium diets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; These and large number of other studies included in the cited references implicate the EETs in the control of at least certain forms of hypertension in rodents.

In humans, vascular endothelium production of EETs involves mainly CYP2C9 and numerous indirect studies have implicated CYP epoxygenase, possibly CYP2C9, in producing a product which causes vasodilation. These studies find that selective (but not entirely specific) CYP epoxygenase-inhibiting drugs reduce human vasodilation responses elicited by the vasodilators [[bradykinin]], [[acetylcholine]], and [[methacholine]]; this suggests that these vasodilators operate by stimulation the production of EETs.  Human studies also find that Caucasian but not African American subjects who have the Lys55Arg [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] variant in the polyunsaturated fatty epoxide-inactivating enzyme, sEH, express hyperactive sEH and show reduced vasodilation responses to bradykinin. Other studies find that women with [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]] and subjects with [[Renovascular hypertension]] exhibit low plasma ETE levels.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Finally, 11,12-EET has been shown to relax the internal mammary artery in women, indicating that at least this EET has direct vasodilating actions in humans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; On the other hand, several studies in humans with [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] in CYP epxoygenase genes have given negative or confusing results.

While many of the cited studies suggest that one or more of the EETs released by vascular endothelial cells are responsible for the actions of the vasodilators and that deficiencies in EET production or excessive EET inactivation by sEH underlie certain types of hypertension in humans, they are not conclusive.  They do not exclude a possibility that other polyunsaturated fatty acid epoxides such as those derived from eicosatetraenoic, docosatetraenoic, or linoleic acids made by CYP2C9 or other CYP epoxygenases (see [[epoxygenase]]) contribute in small or large part to vasodilation responses and by this action promote blood flow to tissues and function in lowering high blood pressures.  Furthermore, the genetic studies conducted to date on SNP variants do not give strong support for an antihypertensive role for the EETs or EET-forming epoxygenases in humans.  Recently developed drugs which are metabolically stable analogs of the EETs and thereby mimic the EETs actions or, alternatively of drugs which inhibit sEH and thereby increase EET levels are in the [[Pre-clinical development]] stage for treating human hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellien J, Joannides R | title = Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid pathway in human health and diseases | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 188–96 | date = Mar 2013 | pmid = 23011468 | doi = 10.1097/FJC.0b013e318273b007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing for their usefulness in treating human hypertension is made difficult because of: '''1)''' the large number of CYP epoxygenases along with their differing tissue distributions and sensitivities to drug inhibitors; '''2)''' the diversity of EETs made by the CYP epoxygenases, some of which differ in activities; '''3)''' the diversity of fatty acid substrates metabolized by the CYP epoxygenases some of which are converted to epoxides (e.g. the epoxide metabolites of linoleic, docosahexaenoic, eicosapentaenoic acids) with have different activities than the EETs or may even be overtly toxic to humans (see [[Coronaric acid]]); '''4)''' the sEH-derived dihydroxy metabolites of the EETs some of which have potent vasodilating effects in the certain vascular networks in rodents and therefore potentially in humans; and '''5)''' the non-specificity and side effects of the latter drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konkel A, Schunck WH | title = Role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the bioactivation of polyunsaturated fatty acids | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1814 | issue = 1 | pages = 210–22 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 20869469 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.09.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellien J, Joannides R | title = Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid pathway in human health and diseases | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 188–96 | date = Mar 2013 | pmid = 23011468 | doi = 10.1097/FJC.0b013e318273b007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lazaar AL, Yang L, Boardley RL, Goyal NS, Robertson J, Baldwin SJ, Newby DE, Wilkinson IB, Tal-Singer R, Mayer RJ, Cheriyan J | title = Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and adverse event profile of GSK2256294, a novel soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | date = Dec 2015 | pmid = 26620151 | doi = 10.1111/bcp.12855 | volume=81 | pages=971–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As indicated on the ClinicalTrials.gov web site, a [[National Institutes of Health]]-sponsored clinical trial entitled "Evaluation of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase (s-EH) Inhibitor in Patients With Mild to Moderate Hypertension and Impaired Glucose Tolerance" has not been completed or reported on although started in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00847899|Evaluation of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase (s-EH) Inhibitor in Patients With Mild to Moderate Hypertension and Impaired Glucose Tolerance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart disease===
As indicated elsewhere on this page, EETs inhibit inflammation, inhibit [[blood clot]] formation, inhibit [[platelet]] activation, dilate blood vessels including the [[coronary arteries]], reduce certain types of [[hypertension]], stimulate the survival of vascular endothelial and cardiac muscle cells by inhibiting [[apoptosis]], promote blood vessel growth (i.e. [[angiogenesis]]), and stimulate smooth muscle cell migration; these activities may protect the heart. Indeed, studies on in vivo animal and in vitro animal and human cell model systems indicate that the ETEs reduce [[infarct]] (i.e. injured tissue) size, reduce cardiac arrhythmias, and improve the strength of left ventricle contraction immediately after blockade of coronary artery blood flow in animal models of ischemia-[[reperfusion injury]]; EETs also reduce the size of heart enlargement that occurs long after these experiment-induced injuries.&lt;ref name="J Mol Cell Cardiol 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oni-Orisan A, Alsaleh N, Lee CR, Seubert JM | title = Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and cardioprotection: the road to translation | journal = Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology | volume = 74 | pages = 199–208 | date = Sep 2014 | pmid = 24893205 | doi = 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.016 | pmc=4115045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans with established [[coronary artery disease]] have higher levels of plasma EETs and higher ratios of 14,15-EET to 14,15-diHETrE (14,15-diHETrE is the less active or inactive metabolite 14,15-EET). This suggests that the EETs serve a protective role in this setting and that these plasma  changes were a result of a reduction in cardiac sEH activity.  Furthermore, [[coronary artery disease]] patients who had lower levels of EETs/14,15-di-ETE ratios exhibited evidence of a poorer prognosis based on the presence of poor prognostic indicators, cigarette smoking, obesity, old age, and elevation in inflammation markers.&lt;ref name="Front Pharmacol 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Mol Cell Cardiol 2014"/&gt;

===Strokes and seizures===
Indirect studies in animal models suggest that EETs have protective effects in [[stroke]]s (i.e. cerbrovasular accidents).  Thus, sEH inhibitors and sEH-[[Gene knockout]] have been shown to reduce the damage to brain that occurs in several different models of [[ischemic stroke]]; this protective effect appears due to a reduction in systemic blood pressure and maintenance of blood flow to ischemic areas of the brain by arteriole dilation as a presumed consequence of inhibiting the degradation of EETs (and/or other fatty acid epoxides).&lt;ref name="Huang H 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang H, Al-Shabrawey M, Wang MH | title = Cyclooxygenase- and cytochrome P450-derived eicosanoids in stroke | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 122 | pages = 45–53 | date = Jan 2016 | pmid = 26747234 | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2015.12.007 | pmc = 4779674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  sEH-gene knockout mice were also protected from that brain damage that followed induced-[[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]; this protective effect appeared due to a reduction in cerebral edema which was also presumable due to the prolongation of EET half-lives.&lt;ref name="Huang H 2015"/&gt; 14,15-EET levels have been shown to be elevated in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of humans suffering subarachnoid hemorrhage.&lt;ref name="Huang H 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siler DA, Berlow YA, Kukino A, Davis CM, Nelson JW, Grafe MR, Ono H, Cetas JS, Pike M, Alkayed NJ | title = Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase in Hydrocephalus, Cerebral Edema, and Vascular Inflammation After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage | journal = Stroke: A Journal of Cerebral Circulation | volume = 46 | issue = 7 | pages = 1916–22 | date = Jul 2015 | pmid = 25991416 | doi = 10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.008560 | pmc=4480190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

sEH inhibitors and gene knockout also reduce the number and severity of [[Epileptic seizure]]s in several animal models; this effect is presumed due to the actions of EETs (and other epoxide fatty acids) in reducing cerebral blood flow changes, and reducing neuron production of [[Neuroactive steroid]]s, reducing neuroinflammation,&lt;ref name="Huang H 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hung YW, Hung SW, Wu YC, Wong LK, Lai MT, Shih YH, Lee TS, Lin YY | title = Soluble epoxide hydrolase activity regulates inflammatory responses and seizure generation in two mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy | journal = Brain, Behavior, and Immunity | volume = 43 | pages = 118–29 | date = Jan 2015 | pmid = 25135858 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbi.2014.07.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portal hypertension===
Portal hypertension or hypertension in the venous [[hepatic portal system]] of blood flow is defined as an increase in portal pressure above normal values of 10 [[Millimeter of mercury]].&lt;ref name="pmid26072731"/&gt; It is a serious, sometimes life-threatening complication of various diseases such as liver [[cirrhosis]], [[liver fibrosis]], massive [[Fatty liver]], [[portal vein thrombosis]], liver [[schistosomiasis]], massive liver involvement in [[miliary tuberculosis]] or [[sarcoidosis]], and obstruction of the venous circuit at any level between liver and right heart (see [[Portal hypertension]]).  Vascular contraction in the portal system is mediated by several agents: [[nitric oxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[prostacyclin]] I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor]]s (EDHFs). EDHFs include [[endothelin]], [[angiotensin II]], [[thromboxane A2]], certain [[leukotriene]]s, and the EETs.  In portal hypertension, portal vein endothelium appears to be dysfunctional in that it overproduces EDHFs.&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sacerdoti D, Mania D, Jiang H, Pesce P, Gaiani S, Gatta A, Bolognesi M | title = Increased EETs participate in peripheral endothelial dysfunction of cirrhosis | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 98 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 129–32 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22245571 | pmc = 4547526 | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2011.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EETs, particularly 11,12-EET, have a quite different effect on the [[Liver sinusoid]]al veins than on arteries of the [[systemic circulation]]: they constrict the sinusoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sacerdoti D, Gatta A, McGiff JC | title = Role of cytochrome P450-dependent arachidonic acid metabolites in liver physiology and pathophysiology | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 72 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 51–71 | date = Oct 2003 | pmid = 14626496 | doi=10.1016/s1098-8823(03)00077-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Levels of EETs in the plasma and liver of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension are reportedly elevated compared to normal subjects.&lt;ref name="pmid26072731"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21856435"/&gt;  These and other findings have led to the proposal that portal endothelium-derived EETs, perhaps acting in cooperation with another EDHF, endothelin, contribute to portal hypertension.&lt;ref name="pmid26072731"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21856435"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sacerdoti D, Jiang H, Gaiani S, McGiff JC, Gatta A, Bolognesi M | title = 11,12-EET increases porto-sinusoidal resistance and may play a role in endothelial dysfunction of portal hypertension | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 96 | issue = 1-4 | pages = 72–5 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21856435 | pmc = 4540347 | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2011.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer ===

The forced over-expression of CYP2J2 in or the addition of an EET to cultured human Tca-8113 oral squamous cancer cells, lung cancer [[A549 cell]]s and [[NCL-H446]] cells, [[HepG2]] liver cancer cells, [[LS-174]] colon cancer cells, [[SiHa]] uterine cervix cancer cells, [[U251]] [[glioblastoma]] cancer cells, [[ScaBER]] urinary bladder cancer cells, and [[K562]] [[erythroleukemia]] and [[HL-60]] [[promyelocyte]] leukemic blood cancer cells caused an increase in their survival and proliferation.&lt;ref name="pmid15930289"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  
Putative inhibitors of CYP2J2 inhibit the growth in culture of several human cancer cell lines that express relatively high levels of CYP2J2 viz., Tca-8113 cells, [[HeLa]] uterine cervix cell lines, [[A549 (cell line)|A549]] cells, [[MDA-MB-435]] breast cells, and [[HepG2]] cells but they had no significant inhibitory effects on two cell lines that expressed little or no CYP2J2.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
A putative inhibitor of CYPJ2 also inhibited the growth of human [[K562]] erythroleukemia in a [[Severe combined immunodeficiency (non-human)#mice|mice]] model as well as the growth of mouse el4 lymphoma cells in mice that were forced to overexpress CYP2J2 cells in their vascular epithelium.  
Forced expression of CYP2J2 also enhanced, while forced inhibition of its expression (using [[Small interfering RNA]]) reduced, the survival, growth, and metastasis of  [[MDA-MB-231]] human breast carcinoma cells in the mouse model and likewise enhanced or reduced, respectively, the survival and growth of these cells in culture.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  
Further studies found that the expression of CYP2J2 was in increased in the malignant cells, relative to the nearby normal cells, in the following specimens taken from humans suffering [[squamous-cell carcinoma]] and [[adenocarcinoma]] types of [[esophageal cancer]] and [[lung cancer]], [[small cell lung carcinoma]], [[breast cancer]], [[stomach cancer]], [[liver cancer]], and [[colon adenocarcinoma]]; 
this CYP was also highly expressed in the malignant cells of patients with acute leukemia, chronic leukemia, and lymphoma.&lt;ref name="Adv Drug Deliv Rev 2011"&gt;

A. | last3 = Wang | first3 = D. W. | doi = 10.1016/j.addr.2011.03.006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  
As a group, patients with these cancers exhibited increased levels of EETs in their urine and blood samples.&lt;ref name="Adv Drug Deliv Rev 2011"/&gt;
  
Studies of the CYP epoxygenases have not been restricted to the CYP2J subfamily. 
Reduction in the expression of CYP3A4 or CYP2C using small interfering RNA inhibits the growth of cultured [[MCF7]], [[T47D]], and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells; in these studies 14,15-EET stimulated the proliferation of cultured [[MCF7]] cells, reduction in the expression of CYP3A4 by small interference RNA methods, inhibited these cells from proliferating, and 14,15-ETE reversed the effect of CYP3A4 interference; 
in other studies, the forced overexpression of CYP3A4 stimulated the growth of human liver cancer ([[hepatoma]]) cell line, Hep3 .&lt;ref name="pmid22009066"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  
In human breast cancer, not only CYP2J2 but also CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 levels appear elevated while sEH levels appear reduced in malignant compared to nearby normal tissues; associated with this finding, the levels of 14,15-EET as well as the levels of 14,15-EET plus 14,15-dihydroxy-EET were significantly elevated in the cancerous compared to noncancerous cells and the levels of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 proteins correlated positively and sEH levels correlated negatively with the tumor cells rate of proliferation as accessed by their [[Ki67]] levels while CYP2J2 levels correlated positively with poorer prognosis as predicted tumor histological grade and tumor size.&lt;ref name="Adv Pharmacol 2015"&gt;{{cite book |pmid=26233908 |year=2015 |vauthors=Chen C, Wang DW |veditors=Hardwick JP |title=Cytochrome P450 Function and Pharmacological Roles in Inflammation and Cancer |volume=74 |pages=193–221 |doi=10.1016/bs.apha.2015.04.005 |chapter=Cytochrome P450-CYP2 Family-Epoxygenase Role in Inflammation and Cancer |series=Advances in Pharmacology |isbn=9780128031193}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The cited findings suggest that various CYP epoxygenases along with the epoxide metabolites which they make promote the growth and spread of diverse types of cancer in animals and humans.  Their effects may reflect the ability of the epoxide metabolites to stimulate the proliferation and survival of the target cancer cells but perhaps also to stimulate these cells to trigger new capillary formation (see [[angiogenesis#Tumor angiogenesis]]), invade new tissues, and [[metastasize]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22009066"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adv Pharmacol 2015" /&gt;

A series of drugs derived from [[Terfenadine]] have been shown to inhibit CYP2J2 and to suppress the proliferation and cause the [[apoptosis]] of various types of human cancer cell lines in culture as well as in animal models.&lt;ref name="Adv Pharmacol 2015"/&gt; However, clinical studies targeting CYP epoxygenases and EETs and to successfully suppress cancer in humans have not been reported.

===Inflammation===
In vitro and animal model studies indicate that the EETs possess [[anti-inflammatory]] activity that is directed toward reducing, resolving, and limiting the damage caused by inflammation.  Most of these studies have focused on circulating [[leukocytes]], blood vessel endothelium, and the occlusion of blood vessels due to pathological blood clotting. EETs '''a)''' inhibit vascular endothelial cells from expressing [[Cell adhesion molecule]]s such as [[VCAM-1]], [[ICAM-1]], and [[E-selectin]] thereby limiting circulating [[leukocytes]] from adhering to blood vessel endothelium and migrating across this endothelium into tissues; '''2)''' inhibit the expression and activity of [[cyclooxygenase-2]] in blood [[monocytes]] thereby reducing their production of pro-inflammatory metabolites of arachidonic acid such as [[prostaglandin E2]]; '''3)''' inhibit platelet aggregation thereby reducing [[thrombus]] (i.e. blood clot) formation; '''4)''' promote [[fibrinolysis]] thereby dissolving blood clots; and '''5)''' inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation thereby reducing blood vessel [[hypertrophy]] and narrowing.&lt;ref name="Front Pharmacol 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomson SJ, Askari A, Bishop-Bailey D | title = Anti-inflammatory effects of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids | journal = International Journal of Vascular Medicine | volume = 2012 | pages = 605101 | pmid = 22848834 | doi = 10.1155/2012/605101 | pmc=3405717 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and kidney disease===
EETs, pharmacological inhibition of sEH, and/or inhibition of sEH expression enhance insulin actions on animal tissues in vitro and have protective effects in ameliorating insulin resistance as well as many of the neurological and kidney complications of diabetes in various animal models of diabetes; the studies suggest that the EETs have beneficial effects in [[Type I diabetes]] as well as [[Type II diabetes]].&lt;ref name = "pmid26621325"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = He J, Wang C, Zhu Y, Ai D | title = Soluble epoxide hydrolase: A potential target for metabolic diseases | journal = Journal of Diabetes | date = Dec 2015 | pmid = 26621325 | doi = 10.1111/1753-0407.12358 | volume=8 | pages=305–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These interventions also gave beneficial results in animal models of [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]] and certain types inflammation-related kidney diseases including chronic kidney disease, renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, and [[polycystic kidney disease]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sacerdoti D, Gatta A, McGiff JC | title = Role of cytochrome P450-dependent arachidonic acid metabolites in liver physiology and pathophysiology | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 72 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 51–71 | date = Oct 2003 | pmid = 14626496 | doi=10.1016/s1098-8823(03)00077-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "pmid26621325" /&gt;  The protective role of EETs in these animal model diseases may reflect, at least in part, their anti-inflammatory actions.&lt;ref name = "pmid26621325" /&gt;

===Pain===
EETs have been shown to have anti-hyperalgesic and pain-relieving activity in several animal models of pain including [[Nociception]] resulting from tissue injury, [[inflammation]], and [[Peripheral neuropathy]] (also see [[Neuropathic pain]]) including pain secondary to experimentally induced [[Diabetes]] in mice.&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22280237"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pillarisetti S, Khanna I | title = Targeting soluble epoxide hydrolase for inflammation and pain - an overview of pharmacology and the inhibitors | journal = Inflammation &amp; Allergy Drug Targets | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–58 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22280237 | doi = 10.2174/187152812800392823}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "pmid26621325" /&gt;  The epoxides of omega-3 fatty acids appear far stronger and more involved in the relief of pain than the EETs (see [[epoxydocosapentaenoic acid]]).&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"/&gt;

The '''ericoid mycorrhiza''' is a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship formed between members of the plant family [[Ericaceae]] and several lineages of [[mycorrhizal]] fungi. This [[symbiosis]] represents an important adaptation to acidic and nutrient poor soils that species in the Ericaceae typically inhabit,&lt;ref&gt;Cairney, J. W. G. and A. A. Meharg. 2003. Ericoid mycorrhiza: a partnership that exploits harsh edaphic conditions. European Journal of Soil Science 54: 735–740. doi:10.1046/j.1351-0754.2003.0555.x.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[boreal forest]]s, [[bog]]s, and [[heathland]]s. Molecular clock estimates suggest that the symbiosis originated approximately 140 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Cullings, K. W. 1996. Single phylogenetic origin of ericoid mycorrhizae within the Ericaceae. Canadian Journal of Botany 74: 1896-1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and function==
Ericoid mycorrhizas are characterized by fungal coils that form in the epidermal cells of the fine hair roots of ericaceous species.&lt;ref name=SmithAndRead&gt;Smith, S. E. and D. J. Read. 2008. Mycorrhizal Symbiosis, Third Edition. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi establish loose hyphal networks around the outside of hair roots, from which they penetrate the walls of cortical cells to form intracellular coils that can densely pack individual plant cells.&lt;ref name=SmithAndRead /&gt; However, the fungi do not penetrate plasma membranes of plant cells. Evidence suggests that coils only function for a period of a few weeks before the plant cell and fungal hyphae begin to degrade.&lt;ref name=SmithAndRead /&gt;

The coil is the site where fungi exchange nutrients obtained from the soil for carbohydrates fixed through [[photosynthesis]] by the plant. Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi have been shown to have enzymatic capabilities to breakdown complex organic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;Cairney, J. W. G., and R. M. Burke.1998. Extracellular enzyme activities of the ericoid mycorrhizal endophyte Hymenoscyphus ericae (Read) Korf &amp; Kernan: their likely roles in decomposition of dead plant tissue in soil. Plant and Soil 205: 181-192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Read2&gt;Read, D. J., J. R. Leake, and J. Perez-Moreno. 2004. Mycorrhizal fungi as drivers of ecosystem processes in heathland and boreal forest biomes. Canadian Journal of Botany 82: 1243-1263.&lt;/ref&gt; This may allow some ericoid mycorrhizal fungi to act as [[saprotrophs]]. However, the primary function of these enzymatic capabilities is likely to access organic forms of nutrients, such as nitrogen, whose mineralized forms are in very limiting quantities in habitats typically occupied by ericaceous plants.&lt;ref name=Read2 /&gt;

The majority of research with ericoid mycorrhizal fungal physiology and function has focused on fungal isolates morphologically identified as ''Rhizoscyphus ericae'', in the [[Ascomycota]] order [[Helotiales]],&lt;ref name=SmithAndRead /&gt; now known to be a ''[[Pezoloma]]'' species.&lt;ref name=Baral&gt;Baral HO and Berbee L.

Some studies have also shown that fungal communities colonizing ericoid roots can lack specificity for different species of ericoid plant, suggesting that at least some of these fungi have a broad host range.&lt;ref name = K /&gt;&lt;ref name = Walker /&gt;

==Economic significance==
Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi form symbioses with several crop and ornamental species, such as blueberries, cranberries and ''Rhododendron''. Inoculation with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi can influence plant growth and nutrient uptake.&lt;ref&gt;Scagel, C. F. 2005 Inoculation with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi alters fertilizer use of highbush blueberry cultivars. HortScience 40: 786-794.&lt;/ref&gt; However, much less agricultural and horticultural research has been conducted with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi relative to [[arbuscular mycorrhizal]] and [[ectomycorrhizal]] fungi.

[[File:WLANL - MicheleLovesArt - Joods Historisch Museum - Levensboom glas in lood - Eli Content (Midden).jpg|thumb|''Tree of Life'' by [[Eli Content]] at the [[Joods Historisch Museum]]. The [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]], or {{transl|he|Etz haChayim}} ({{lang|he|עץ החיים}}) in Hebrew, is a mystical symbol used in the Kabbalah of esoteric Judaism to describe the path to [[HaShem]] and the manner in which He created the world {{lang|la|ex nihilo}} (out of nothing).]]
{{wiktionary}}

'''{{lang|la|Ex nihilo}}''' is a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "out of [[nothing]]". It often appears in conjunction with the concept of [[Creationism|creation]], as in {{lang|la|creatio ex nihilo}}, meaning "creation out of nothing", chiefly in philosophical or [[theological]] contexts, but it also occurs in other fields.

In theology, the common phrase {{lang|la|creatio ex nihilo}} ({{Literal translation|"creation out of nothing"|lk=on}}), contrasts with {{lang|la|creatio ex materia}} (creation out of some pre-existent, eternal matter) and {{lang|la|creatio ex deo}} (creation out of the [[being]] of [[God]]). {{lang|la|Creatio continua}} is the ongoing divine creation.

The phrase {{lang|la|ex nihilo}} also appears in the classical philosophical formulation {{lang|la|[[ex nihilo nihil fit]]}}, which means "out of nothing comes nothing".

When used outside of [[religious]] or [[metaphysical]] contexts, {{lang|la|ex nihilo}} also refers to something coming from nothing. For example, in a conversation, one might call a topic "{{lang|la|ex nihilo}}" if it bears no relation to the previous topic of discussion.

==History==
[[Ancient Near Eastern mythologies]] and classical creation myths in [[Greek mythology]] envisioned the creation of the world as resulting from the actions of a god or gods upon already-existing primeval matter, known as ''[[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Rubio, "Time Before Time: Primeval Narratives in Early Mesopotamian Literature"; in ''Time and History in the Ancient Near East: Proceedings of the 56th Recontre Assyriologique Internationale at Barcelona, 26–30 July 2010'', ed. L. Feliu et al.; Winona Lake, Indiana: Eisenbrauns, 2013; {{ISBN|978-1-57506-255-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early conflation of Greek philosophy with the [[Genesis creation narrative|narratives]] in the Hebrew Bible came from [[Philo of Alexandria]] (d.{{nbsp}}AD{{nbsp}}50), writing in the context of [[Hellenistic Judaism]]. Philo equated the Hebrew [[creator deity]], [[Yahweh]], with [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[primum movens]]'' (First Cause)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yonge, Charles Duke (1854) |title=Appendices A Treatise Concerning the World (1): But what can be worse than this, or more calculated to display the want of true nobility existing in the soul, than the notion of causes in general being secondary and created causes, combined with an ignorance of the one first cause, the uncreated God, the Creator of the universe, who for these and innumerable other reasons is most excellent, reasons which because of their magnitude human intellect is unable to apprehend?"

Bohn |url=http://cornerstonepublications.org/Philo |publisher=Cornerstonepublications.org |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928224539/http://cornerstonepublications.org/Philo/ |archivedate=2015-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato Laws Book X, Public Domain-Project Gutenberg. "ATHENIAN: Then I suppose that I must repeat the singular argument of those who manufacture the soul according to their own impious notions; they affirm that which is the first cause of the generation and destruction of all things, to be not first, but last, and that which is last to be first, and hence they have fallen into error about the true nature of the Gods… Then we must say that self-motion being the origin of all motions, and the first which arises among things at rest as well as among things in motion, is the eldest and mightiest principle of change, and that which is changed by another and yet moves other is second."&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to prove that the Jews had held [[monotheistic]] views even before the Greeks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} However, this was still within the context of creation from pre-existing materials (i.e., "moving" or "changing" a material substratum.)

The classical tradition of creation from chaos first came under question in [[Hellenistic philosophy]] (on ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' grounds), which developed the idea that the primum movens must have created the world out of nothing.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Theologians debate whether the Bible itself teaches creation ''ex nihilo''. Traditional interpreters&lt;ref&gt;
Collins, C. John, ''Genesis 1-4: A Linguistic, Literary, and Theological Commentary'' (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&amp;R Publishing, 2006), 50ff.
&lt;/ref&gt; argue on grammatical and syntactical grounds that this is the meaning of {{bibleref2|Genesis|1:1}}, which is commonly rendered: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." They find further support for this view in New Testament passages such as [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 11:3—"By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible" and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 4:11, "For you [God] created all things, and by your will they existed and were created." However, other interpreters&lt;ref&gt;

|quote= If we look into the early Christian sources, it becomes apparent that the thesis of ''creatio ex nihilo'' in its full and proper sense, as an ontological statement, only appeared when it was intended, in opposition to the idea of world-formation from unoriginate matter, to give expression to the omnipotence, freedom and uniqueness of God.}}&lt;/ref&gt; understand creation ''ex nihilo'' as a second-century theological development. According to this view, church fathers opposed notions appearing in pre-Christian [[creation myth]]s and in [[Gnosticism]]—notions of creation by a [[demiurge]] out of a primordial state of matter (known in religious studies as ''[[chaos (mythology)|chaos]]'' after the Greek term used by [[Hesiod]] in his ''[[Theogony]]'').&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = Probably the idea of creation never entered the human mind apart from Revelation. Though some of the pagan philosophers attained to a relatively high conception of God as the supreme ruler of the world, they seem never to have drawn the next logical inference of His being the absolute cause of all finite existence. [...] The descendants of Sem and Abraham, of Isaac and Jacob, preserved the idea of creation clear and pure; and from the opening verse of Genesis to the closing book of the Old Testament the doctrine of creation runs unmistakably outlined and absolutely undefiled by any extraneous element. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." In this, the first, sentence of the Bible we see the fountain-head of the stream which is carried over to the new order by the declaration of the mother of the Machabees: "Son, look upon heaven and earth, and all that is in them: and consider that God made them out of nothing" (2 Maccabees 7:28). One has only to compare the Mosaic account of the creative work with that recently discovered on the clay tablets unearthed from the ruins of Babylon to discern the immense difference between the unadulterated revealed tradition and the puerile story of the cosmogony corrupted by polytheistic myths. Between the Hebrew and the Chaldean account there is just sufficient similarity to warrant the supposition that both are versions of some antecedent record or tradition; but no one can avoid the conviction that the Biblical account represents the pure, even if incomplete, truth, while the Babylonian story is both legendary and fragmentary (Smith, "Chaldean Account of Genesis", New York, 1875).}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became important to Judaism, to ongoing strands in the Christian tradition, and—as a corollary—to Islam.

The first sentence of the Greek version of Genesis in the [[Septuagint]] starts with the words: ἐν ἀρχῇ ἐποίησεν, translatable as "in the beginning he made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Gary Alan|title=The Greek of the Septuagint|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=NA-mTy4X_WAC&amp;pg=PR11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A verse of [[2 Maccabees]] (a book written in [[Koine Greek]] in the same sphere of Hellenized Judaism of [[Alexandria]], but predating Philo by about a century) expresses the following: "I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not; and so was mankind made likewise." (2{{nbsp}}Maccabees 7:28, [[KJV]]).  While those who believe in ''ex nihilo'' point to God creating "things that were not", those who reject creation out of nothing point out that the context mentions the creation of man, who was "made from the dust" and not from absolutely "nothing". Many ancient texts tend to have similar issues, and those on each side tend to interpret the text according to their understanding.

Max Weber summarizes a [[sociology|sociological]] view of the overall development and corollaries of the theological idea:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[...] As otherworldly expectations become increasingly important, the problem of the basic relationship of god to the world and the problem of the world's imperfections press into the foreground of thought; this happens the more life here on earth comes to be regarded as a merely provisional form of existence when compared to that beyond, the more the world comes to be viewed as something created by god ''ex nihilo'', and therefore subject to decline, the more god himself is conceived as a subject to transcendental goals and values, and the more a person's behavior in this world becomes oriented to his fate in the next. [...]&lt;ref&gt;

==Supporting arguments==

===Logical===
A major argument for ''creatio ex nihilo'', the [[first cause argument]], states in summary:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
# everything that begins to exist has a cause
# the universe began to exist
# therefore, the universe must have a cause

An expansion of the first cause argument is the [[Kalam cosmological argument]], which also requires ''creatio ex nihilo'':{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} 
# Everything that begins to exist has a cause
# The universe began to exist
# Therefore, the universe has a cause.
# If the universe has a cause, then an uncaused, personal creator of the universe exists, who without the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless, and infinitely powerful.
# Therefore, an uncaused, personal creator of the universe exists, who without the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless, and infinitely powerful.

Another argument for ''ex nihilo'' creation comes from [[Claude Nowell]]'s [[Summum]] philosophy that states before anything existed, nothing existed, and if nothing existed, then it must have been possible for nothing to be. If it is possible for nothing to be (the argument goes), then it must be possible for everything to be.&lt;ref&gt;

 |quote       = First, says Hesiod, there came to be Chaos, and then Earth, Tartarus (which Voegelin curiously neglects in his account), and Eros. For Voegelin this is a creatio ex nihilo, which points the finger of questioning towards the yet undifferentiated beyond. If he is right, the Greek philosophers who followed were unanimous in retreating from this seeming violation of the principle of sufficient reason to the principle that ex nihilio nihil fit.[sic]

===In Jewish philosophy===
{{main|Jewish philosophy}}

In ''The Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma'' (''Kitāb al-Amānāt wa l-Iʿtiqādāt'', ''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth]]'', completed 933) written by [[Saadia Gaon]] (c. 882−942) the metaphysical problems of the creation of the world and the unity of the Creator are discussed. In this book, Saadia Gaon gives four proofs for the doctrine of the [[Creation myth|creation]] of the world ''ex nihilo'' (''[[Ayin and Yesh|yesh me-ayin]]'').

To harmonize the biblical statement of the creation ''ex nihilo'' with the doctrine of the primordial elements, the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'' assumes a double creation, one ideal and the other real.&lt;ref name=JewishEncyclopedia&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=YEẒIRAH, SEFER|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13386-sefer-yezirah|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;br&gt;

In introducing ''Sefer Yetzirah's'' theory of creation Saadia Gaon makes a distinction between the Biblical account of creation ''ex nihilo'', in which no process of creation is described, and ''matter formed by speech'' as described in ''Sefer Yetzirah''. The [[cosmogony]] of ''Sefer Yetzirah'' is even omitted from the discussion of creation in his magnum opus ''Emunoth ve-Deoth''.

===Islamic===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
[[Early Islamic philosophy]], as well as key Muslim schools of thought, have argued a wide array of views, the basis always being that the creator was an eternal being who was outside of the creation (i.e., any materially based entities within all of creation), and was not a part of creation. Several schools of thought stemming from the first cause argument, and a great deal of philosophical works from Muslim scholars such as [[Al-Ghazali]], came from the following verses in the Qur'an. The following quotations come from [[Muhammad Asad]]'s translation, ''[[The Message of The Qur'an]]'':

To expound the term 'beginning,' of Christ, is altogether frivolous. For Moses simply intends to assert that the world was not perfected at its very commencement, in the manner in which it is now seen, but that it was created an empty chaos of heaven and earth. His language therefore may be thus explained. When God in the beginning created the heaven and the earth, the earth was empty and waste. He moreover teaches by the word 'created,' that what before did not exist was now made; for he has not used the term יצר, (yatsar,) which signifies to frame or forms but ברא, (bara,) which signifies to create. Therefore his meaning is, that the world was made out of nothing. Hence the folly of those is refuted who imagine that unformed matter existed from eternity; and who gather nothing else from the narration of Moses than that the world was furnished with new ornaments, and received a form of which it was before destitute."

==Opposing arguments==
{{See also|Parmenides|Nothing comes from nothing}}

===Logical===
The "first cause" argument was rooted in ancient Greek philosophy and based on observation in physics. Originally, it was understood{{by whom|date=April 2017}} in the context of creation from chaos. The observed phenomenon seen in reality is that nothing moves by itself. In other words, motion is not self-caused; thus, the Classic Greek thinkers argued that the cosmos must have had a "prime mover" ''[[primum movens]]''. However, this scientific observation of ''motion'' does not logically extend to the idea of ''existence'', and therefore does not necessarily indicate creation from absolutely nothing.

In theology, ''ex nihilo'' creation states that there was a beginning to one's existence, and anything that exists has a beginning. This idea of a ''required beginning'' appears to contradict the proposed creator who existed ''without a beginning''. In other words, people are considered to be contingent beings, and their existence depends upon a non-contingent being. However, if non-contingency is possible, then there is no basis for arguing that contingency is required for existence, nor can it be logically concluded that the number of non-contingent beings or non-contingent things is limited to one single substance or one single Being.

David Ray Griffin expressed his thoughts on this as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;"No special philosophical problems are raised by this view: If it is intelligible to hold that the existence of God requires no explanation, since something must exist necessarily and "of itself," then it is not unintelligible to hold that that which exists necessarily is God ''and'' a realm of non-divine actualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.anthonyflood.com/griffincreationoutofchaos.htm |title= David Ray Griffin "Creation Out of Chaos and the Problem of Evil" |publisher= Anthonyflood.com |accessdate= 2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Christian===
Bruce K. Waltke wrote an extensive Biblical study of creation theology in which he argues for creation from chaos rather than from nothing - based on the Hebrew Torah and the New Testament texts. The Western Conservative Baptist Seminary published this work in 1974 and again in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Creation and Chaos: An Exegetical and Theological Study of Biblical Cosmogony&lt;/ref&gt; On a historical basis, many{{quantify|date=April 2017}} scholars agree that the doctrine of ''creatio ex nihilo'' was not the original intent of the Biblical authors, but instead a change in the ''interpretation'' of the texts that began to evolve in the mid-second century AD in the atmosphere of Hellenistic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Oord offers nine objections to ''creatio ex nihilo'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://thomasjayoord.com/index.php/blog/archives/creatio_ex_nihilo_the_problem/#.UQDtUOgRkeM |title= Creatio Ex Nihilo: The Problem · For The Love of Wisdom and The Wisdom of Love · Thomas Jay Oord |publisher= Thomasjayoord.com |accessdate= 2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Theoretical problem: One cannot conceive absolute nothingness.
# Biblical problem: Scripture – in Genesis, 2 Peter, and elsewhere – suggests creation from something (water, deep, chaos, etc.), not creation from absolutely nothing.
# Historical problem: The [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]]s [[Basilides]] and [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] first proposed ''creatio ex nihilo'' on the basis of assuming the inherently evil nature of creation, and in the belief that God does not act in history.  Early Christian theologians adopted the idea to affirm the kind of absolute divine power that many Christians now reject.
# Empirical problem: We have no evidence that our universe originally came into being from absolutely nothing.
# Creation-at-an-instant problem:  We have no evidence in the history of the Universe after the [[big bang]] that entities can emerge instantaneously from absolute nothingness.  As the earliest philosophers noted, out of nothing comes nothing (''[[Nothing comes from nothing|ex nihilo, nihil fit]]'').
# Solitary power problem: ''Creatio ex nihilo'' assumes that a powerful God once acted alone.  But power, as a social concept, only becomes meaningful in relation to others.
# Errant revelation problem: The God with the capacity to create something from absolutely nothing would apparently have the power to guarantee an unambiguous and inerrant message of salvation (for example: [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant Bible]]).  An unambiguously clear and inerrant divine revelation does not exist.
# [[Problem of Evil]]: If God once had the power to create from absolutely nothing, God essentially retains that power.  But a God of love with this capacity appears [[culpability|culpable]] for failing to prevent evil.
# Empire Problem: The kind of divine power implied in ''creatio ex nihilo'' supports a [[theology of empire]], based upon unilateral force and control of others.

[[Process theology|Process theologians]] argue that humans have always related a God to some "world" or another. They&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Creation Out of Chaos and the Problem of Evil by David Ray Griffin|url= http://www.anthonyflood.com/griffincreationoutofchaos.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; also claim that rejecting ''creatio ex nihilo'' provides the opportunity to affirm that God has everlastingly created and related with some realm of non-divine actualities or another (compare [[continuous creation]]). According to this alternative God-world theory, no non-divine thing exists without the creative activity of God, and nothing can terminate God's necessary existence.

Some [[non-trinitarian]] Christian churches do not teach the ''ex nihilo'' doctrine:
* [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) teaches that [[Jehovah]] (whom they identify as the heavenly form of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]), under the direction of [[God the Father]], organized this world and others like it out of eternal, pre-existing materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Jesus Christ|url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/jesus-christ?lang=eng|work= The Guide to the Scriptures|publisher= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate= 2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Bruce R.

God had materials to organize the world out of chaos... The pure principles of element are principles which can never be destroyed; they may be organized and reorganized, but not destroyed. They had no beginning and can have no end"&lt;ref&gt;(History of the Church 6:308-309).&lt;/ref&gt;  Debate continues on the issue of creation Ex Nihilo versus creation Ex Materia between evangelical authors Paul Copan and William Lane Craig&lt;ref&gt;The New Mormon Challenge: Responding to the Latest Defenses of a Fast-Growing Movement&lt;/ref&gt; and LDS/Mormon apologist Blake Ostler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fairlds.org/authors/ostler-blake/reviews-of-the-new-mormon-challenge |title= Reviews of The New Mormon Challenge " FAIR |publisher= Fairlds.org |accessdate= 2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] teach that God used the energy he possesses to create the Universe based on their interpretation of Isaiah{{nbsp}}40:26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= The Watchtower|date= October 1, 2009|pages= 4&amp;ndash;6|title= What Is the Holy Spirit?|url= http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2009721|publisher= Watch Tower Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe this harmonizes with the scientific idea of the relationship between matter and energy. They distinguish Jehovah from Jesus Christ, teaching that before he created the physical universe, Jehovah created Jesus and that Michael is the heavenly form of Jesus.

GK III.23 notes for instance that the ''sruti'' equally upholds the view that creation occurs from a pre-existent being (''sat'') and that it proceeds from non-existence. creation is most frequently understood to be a transformation (''parinama'') or an emanation from a pre-existent reality. Creation from non-being (''asat''), however, is put forward as a possibility in ''Chandogya Upanisad'' III.19 and ''Taittiriya Upanisad'' II.7. This is not necessarily a ''creatio ex nihilo'', but in all likelihood denotes an emergence of being from the pregnant and undifferentiated chaos known as non-being (''asat''). Nevertheless, the equating of non-being with nothingness may have been intended and it is certainly criticized on those grounds in ''Chandogya Upanisad'' VI.2. The predominant Brahmanical creation theme, however, describes an emanation from or transformation of "''sat''," whether envisaged as an abstract impersonal reality as in ''Taittiriya Upanisad'' II.i, or from a personal creator, as in ''Prasna Upanisad'' I.4.

The ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' (BG) states the eternality of matter and its transformability clearly and succinctly: "Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/13/20 |title= Bhagavad Gita 13.20 |publisher= Vedabase.com |accessdate= 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening words of Krishna in BG{{nbsp}}2.12-13 also imply this, as do the doctrines referred to in BG{{nbsp}}16.8 as explained by the commentator Vadiraja Tirtha.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://dvaita.info/pipermail/dvaita-list_dvaita.info/2007-April/002780.html Sri Vadiraja's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most philosophical schools in Hinduism maintain that material creation started with some minute particle (or seed) which had to be co-eternal or a part of ultimate reality (Brahman). This minute starting point is also the point into which all creation contracts at the end of each cycle. This concept varies between various traditions, such as the Vishishtadvaita tradition (which asserts that the Universe forms a part of God, created from some aspect of His divinity) and Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta traditions (which state that the minute initial particle (shuddha Maya) has always existed and was never created).

=== Linguistic and textual ===
Scholars have suggested alternative translations from the [[Biblical Hebrew]] for the concept often rendered as "created" in [[English-language]] versions of Genesis 1. Van Volde, for example, suggests that the Genesis account tells of the "separation" of existing material rather than of creation ''ex nihilo''.&lt;ref&gt;

Note that ordinary language may lack a concise definitive native expression for "creation ''ex nihilo''" - hence the need for the technical Latinate phrase itself. The English-language word "create" itself comes from the Latin ''creare'' (to make, bring forth, produce, beget), with a root cognate with ''crescere'' (to arise, to grow) and allied to the English word ''crescent'' (originally meaning "growing").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD| create | accessdate=2017-04-16}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1820">'''GOLD''' ("'''General Ontology for Linguistic Description'''") is an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]] for [[descriptive linguistics]]. It gives a formalized account of the most basic categories and relations used in the scientific description of human language.

GOLD was first introduced by Farrar and Langendoen (2003). Originally, it was envisioned as a solution to the problem of resolving disparate markup schemes for linguistic data, in particular data from [[endangered language]]s. However, GOLD is much more general and can be applied to all languages. In its function, GOLD overlaps with the [[ISO_12620]] Data Category Registry (ISOcat), it is, however, more stringently structured. 

GOLD was maintained by the [[LINGUIST List]] and others from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linguistics-ontology.org/version GOLD versions]&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://tla.mpi.nl/relish/ RELISH] project created a mirror of the 2010 edition of GOLD as a Data Category Selection within ISOcat. As of 2018, GOLD data remains an important terminology hub in the context of the [[LLOD|Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud]], but as it is not actively maintained anymore, its function is increasingly replaced by [[OLiA]] (for linguistic annotation, building on GOLD and ISOcat) and [http://lexinfo.net/ lexinfo.net] (for dictionary metadata, building on ISOcat).

'''Georges Philippe Friedmann''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁidman|lang}}; 13 May 1902 – 15 November 1977), was a French sociologist and philosopher, known for his influential work on the effects of industrial labor on individuals and his criticisms of the uncontrolled embrace of technological change in twentieth-century Europe and the United States.

== Biography ==
Friedmann was the last child of Adolphe Friedmann (1857-1922), a Berlin merchant, and Elizabeth Nathan (1871-1940). He was born in Paris, where his parents moved after their marriage in Berlin in 1882. They acquired French nationality in 1903.

After a brief period studying industrial chemistry, Friedmann prepared for the philosophy ''[[agrégation]]'' at the prestigious [[Lycée Henri-IV|Lycée Henri IV]] in Paris. He studied philosophy at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] from 1923-1926. He served as an assistant to the sociologist [[Célestin Bouglé]] at the Centre de documentation sociale, a social science research center at the ENS funded by the banker [[Albert Kahn (banker)|Albert Kahn]] and, later, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

Upon the death of his father in 1929, Friedmann inherited a fortune of 2.6 million francs, which enabled him to finance several of his young classmates' intellectual journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lallement|first=Michel|date=2014|title=Georges Friedmann au Cnam (1946-1959)|url=http://technique-societe.cnam.fr/medias/fichier/chc1-2014-1_1422283474502-pdf?pk_campaign=chc|journal=Cahiers du CNAM|volume=1|pages=43–74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedmann eventually donated a large part of the fortune to the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Fondation Curie]] for cancer research. After his death, Degas paintings Friedmann had inherited from his father's collection were donated to the [[Louvre]].

Friedmann married his first wife, Hania Olszweska, a Polish Catholic, in 1937. The couple had one daughter, Liliane, born in 1941 in Toulouse. After Hania's death in 1957, Friedmann married Marcelle Rémond in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reynaud|first=Jean-Daniel|date=1994|title=FRIEDMANN, Georges (1902-1977). Professeur d'Histoire du travail (1946-1959)|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/inrp_0298-5632_1994_ant_19_1_8449|journal=Bibliothèque Historique de l'Éducation|volume=19|pages=544–549|via=Persée}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking his family to Toulouse, Friedmann joined the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]], when he was hunted by the Nazi [[Gestapo]] due to his Jewish heritage. He later wrote that he escaped the [[Gestapo]] in 1943, and was hidden in a school in [[Dordogne]] by a pair of young schoolteachers.&lt;sup&gt;[[Georges Friedmann#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Friedmann's journals from the war, published posthumously in 1987, recounted his experiences as a member of the resistance.

He received his ''Doctorat d'état'' in 1946, with his major thesis on mechanization in industrial production and minor thesis on Leibniz and Spinoza, both published as monographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/isa-past-presidents/list-of-presidents/georges-friedmann/|title=Georges Friedmann|last=|first=|date=|website=International Sociological Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarly work ==
At the ENS, Friedmann was close to the Philosophies group that opposed the influence of [[Henri Bergson]] and was influential in bringing Marx’s earlier philosophical texts to France, and included [[Georges Politzer]], [[Norbert Guterman]]n, [[Paul Nizan]], and [[Henri Lefebvre]]. The group's initial journal, ''Esprit,'' and its successor, ''Philosophies'', were funded by Friedmann's personal wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=French Marxism Between the Wars: Henri Lefebvre and the Philosophies|last=Burkhard|first=Bud|publisher=Humanity Books|year=2000|isbn=|location=Amherst, NY|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, Friedmann made several trips to the [[Soviet Union]], where observed the Soviet industry and technology. His 1938 book, ''De la Sainte Russie à l’U.R.S.S.'' established him as an authority on Soviet society in France. But even his moderate criticisms of the U.S.S.R. and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] caused bitter conflict with members of the [[French Communist Party]] and began Friedmann’s move away from political activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gouarné|first=Isabelle|title=Engagement philosoviétique et posture sociologique dans l'entre-deux-guerres : le rôle politico-intellectuel de Georges Friedmann|journal=Sociologie du Travail|volume=54|issue=3|pages=356–374|doi=10.1016/j.soctra.2012.06.002|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedmann’s doctoral thesis, published after the end of the war in 1946, examined the "human problems" of automation and mechanization European industrial production. A critical, historical overview of paradigms of industrial management, particularly [[scientific management]], [[Industrial and organizational psychology|industrial psychology]], and [[Human relations movement|human relations]], ''Problèmes humains du machinisme industriel'' examined social scientists’ efforts to "humanize" industrial labor that had been fragmented and [[Deskilling|de-skilled]] by industrialization and Taylorism. Friedmann argued that while these efforts were an improvement on the "technicist ideology" of management engineering, social science would not lead to significant changes in labor practices without class conflict and the transformation of the capitalist economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Problèmes humains du machinisme industriel|last=Friedmann|first=Georges|publisher=Gallimard|year=1946|isbn=978-2070225897|location=Paris|pages=381–388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedmann’s book is considered a founding text of French ''sociologie du travail'', and his seminar influenced a number of younger sociologists, historians, and philosophers, including [[Edgar Morin]] and [[Alain Touraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Servants of post-industrial power? : sociologie du travail in Modern France|last=1937-|first=Rose, Michael,|date=1979|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780333236499}}&lt;/ref&gt; While holding various professorships and serving as the head of the French [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS), Friedmann continued to travel extensively around the world, observing and publishing on labor practices and industrial models in the United States, Israel, and South America. His analysis of the nature of the Jewish people and Israeli society in ''The End of the Jewish People''?, one of his few works to be translated into English, attracted media attention in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9905E7D7113AE63ABC4152DFB166838C679EDE&amp;legacy=true|title=Victory, or Defeat?|last=Lask|first=Thomas|date=July 19, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 6, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedmann gradually shifted from emphasis on labor to a broader concern with "technical civilization." His final book, ''La Puissance et la Sagesse'', a mixture of autobiography and reflection on contemporary society, modified his earlier Marxism and emphasized the importance of interiority and morality on humanizing postwar consumer society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.openedition.org/editionscnrs/1669|title=Georges Friedmann : Un sociologue dans le siècle, 1902-1977|last=Segrestin|first=Denis|publisher=CNRS Editions|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Grémion|editor-first=Pierre|location=Paris|pages=141–152|chapter=«La Puissance et la Sagesse» : Georges Friedmann face à la civilisation technicienne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:hansard-1832.jpg|right|thumb|''Hansard'' title page from 1832]]
'''''Hansard''''' is the traditional name of the transcripts of Parliamentary Debates in Britain and many Commonwealth countries. It is named after [[Thomas Curson Hansard]] (1776–1833), a London printer and publisher, who was the first official printer to the parliament at Westminster.

==Origins==
Though the history of the ''Hansard'' began in the British parliament, each of Britain's colonies developed a separate and distinctive history. Before 1771, the British Parliament had long been a highly secretive body. The official record of the actions of the House was publicly available, but there was no record of the debates. The publication of remarks made in the House became a breach of Parliamentary privilege, punishable by the two Houses of Parliament. As the populace became interested in parliamentary debates, more independent newspapers began publishing unofficial accounts of them.

The many penalties implemented by the government, including fines, dismissal, imprisonment, and investigations, are reflective of "the difficulties faced by independent newspapermen who took an interest in the development of Upper Canada, and who, in varying degrees, attempted to educate the populace to the shortcomings of their rulers".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

Several editors used the device of veiling parliamentary debates as debates of fictitious societies or bodies. The names under which parliamentary debates were published include ''Proceedings of the Lower Room of the Robin Hood Society'' and ''Debates of the Senate of Magna Lilliputia''.&lt;ref name="C-H"&gt;[http://www.commonwealth-hansard.org/chea_story.asp Story of Hansard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223040314/http://www.commonwealth-hansard.org/chea_story.asp |date=2011-02-23 }} — Commonwealth Hansard Editors Association&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate of Magna Lilliputia was printed in [[Edward Cave]]'s ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', which was first published in 1732. The names of the speakers were carefully "[[Fillet (redaction)|filleted]]"; for example, Sir [[Robert Walpole]] was thinly disguised as "Sr. R―t W―le".&lt;ref name=Trewin&gt;{{cite book|last=Trewin|first=J.C|title=Printer to the House: The Story of Hansard|year=1952|publisher=The Chapel River Press|location=Andover, Hants, Great Britain|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1771 [[Brass Crosby]], who was [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]], had brought before him a printer by the name of John Miller who dared publish reports of Parliamentary proceedings. He released the man, but was subsequently ordered to appear before the House to explain his actions. Crosby was committed to the [[Tower of London]], but when he was brought to trial, several judges refused to hear the case and after protests from the public, Crosby was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dougsaunders.net/2010/12/brass-crosby-julian-assange-wikileaks/|title=Brass Crosby: The Julian Assange of 1771|author=|date=17 December 2010|website=dougsaunders.net|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318133153/http://dougsaunders.net/2010/12/brass-crosby-julian-assange-wikileaks/|archivedate=18 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament ceased to punish the publishing of its debates as harshly, partly due to the campaigns of [[John Wilkes]] on behalf of free speech. There then began several attempts to publish reports of debates. Among the early successes, the ''Parliamentary Register'' published by [[John Almon]] and [[John Debrett]] began in 1775 and ran until 1813.

[[William Cobbett]] (1763–1835), a noted radical and publisher, began publishing ''Parliamentary Debates'' as a supplement to his ''[[Political Register]]'' in 1802, eventually extending his reach back with the ''Parliamentary History''. Cobbett's avocation for the freedom of the press was severely punished by the British Government. On June 5, 1810 [[William Cobbett]] stood trial for seditious libel for an article he wrote against the British Government which was published by [[Thomas Curson Hansard]]. Cobbett was found "guilty, upon the fullest and most satisfactory evidence".&lt;ref name=Trewin /&gt; The court sentence read: "The court do adjudge that you, [[William Cobbett]] pay to our Lord the King a fine of £1000; that you be imprisoned in His Majesty's gaol of Newgate for the space of two years, and that at expiration of that time you enter into a recognizance to keep the peace for seven years—yourself in the sum of £3000, and two good and sufficient sureties in the sum of £1000; and further, that you be imprisoned till that recognizance be entered into, and that fine paid".&lt;ref name=Trewin /&gt; The sentence was described by J. C. Trewin as "vindictive".&lt;ref name=Trewin /&gt; The Court argued that [[Thomas Curson Hansard]], who had "seen the copy before it was printed, ought not to have suffered it to have been printed at all"&lt;ref name=Trewin /&gt; and was sentenced to three months imprisonment in the [[King's Bench Prison]].

Cobbett's reports were printed by [[Thomas Curson Hansard]] from 1809; in 1812, Cobbett's finances ran asunder and he divested himself of his proprietorship of both the ''Parliamentary Debates'' and ''Parliamentary History'', which then "passed into the hands of Hansard in 1812".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; ''Cobbett's Parliamentary Debates'' became ''Hansard Parliamentary Debates'', "abbreviated over time to the now familiar Hansard".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; From 1829 the name "Hansard" appeared on the title page of each issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hansard-westminster.co.uk/story.asp ::: Department of the Official Report (Hansard) – Story of Hansard :::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817171411/http://www.hansard-westminster.co.uk/story.asp |date=2009-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Cobbett nor Hansard ever employed anyone to take down notes of the debates, which were taken from a multiplicity of sources in the morning newspapers. For this reason, early editions of ''Hansard'' are not to be absolutely relied upon as a guide to everything discussed in Parliament.

Hansard outlasted competitors including Almon and Debrett, and the later ''Mirror of Parliament'' published by J. H. Barrow from 1828 to 1843; Barrow's work was more comprehensive but he checked each speech with the Member and allowed them to "correct" anything they wished they had not said. The last attempt at a commercial rival was ''[[The Times]]'' which published debates in the 1880s. In 1878 a subsidy was granted to the Hansard press and at that point reporters were employed.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; Despite hiring contract reporters there were still widespread complaints about the accuracy of the debate reports. In 1889 Henry Hansard, the son of Thomas Hansard, broke the family connection with the debates.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==

The ''Hansard'' of today, a comprehensive account of every speech, began in 1909 when [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] took over the publication and established its own staff of official ''Hansard'' reporters. At the same time the decision was made to publish debates of the two houses in separate volumes, and to change the front cover from orange-red to light blue. A larger page format was introduced with new technology in 1980.

''Hansard'' is not a word-for-word transcript of debates in Parliament. Its terms of reference are those set by a House of Commons Select Committee in 1893, as being a report

{{quote|which, though not strictly verbatim, is substantially the verbatim report with repetitions and redundancies omitted and with obvious mistakes (including grammatical mistakes) corrected, but which, on the other hand, leaves out nothing that adds to the meaning of the speech or illustrates the argument.&lt;ref name="Hansard terms of reference"&gt;Ian Church, "Official Report [HANSARD] Centenary Volume", 2009, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One instance of such an eliminated redundancy involves the calling of members in the House of Commons. In that House, the Speaker must call on a member by name before that member may speak, but ''Hansard'' makes no mention of the recognition accorded by the Speaker. Also, ''Hansard'' sometimes adds extraneous material to make the remarks less ambiguous. For example, though members refer to each other as "the hon. Member for ''Constituency Name''{{-"}} rather than by name, ''Hansard'' adds, in parentheses, the name of the member being referred to, the first time that Member is referred to in a speech or debate. When a Member simply points at another whose constituency he or she cannot remember, ''Hansard'' identifies him or her.

Any interruption to debate  will be marked with the word "(Interruption)". This understated phrase covers a variety of situations, ranging from members laughing uproariously to the physical invasion of the chamber. Interjections from seated members, such as heckling during [[Prime minister's questions|Prime Minister's Questions]], are generally only included if the member who is speaking responds to the interjection.

''Hansard'' also publishes written answers – known as [[written ministerial statement]]s – made by Government [[Minister (government)|ministers]] in response to questions formally posed by members. In 1839, Hansard, by order of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], printed and published a report stating that an [[obscenity|indecent]] book published by a Mr. Stockdale was circulating in [[Newgate Prison]]. Stockdale sued for [[defamation]] but Hansard's defence, that the statement was true, succeeded. On publication of a reprint, Stockdale sued again but Hansard was ordered by the House to plead that he had acted under order of the Commons and was protected by [[parliamentary privilege]]. In the resulting case of ''[[Stockdale v Hansard]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1839) 9 Ad &amp; El 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;State Trials (New Series) III, 723.&lt;/ref&gt; the court found that the House held no privilege to order publication of defamatory material. In consequence, Parliament passed the [[Parliamentary Papers Act 1840]] to establish privilege for publications under the House's authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bradley, A.W.  |author2=Ewing, K.D. | year=2003 | title=Constitutional and Administrative Law | publisher=Pearson | location=London | edition=13th | pages=219–220 | isbn=0-582-43807-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stockdale, E.

(eds) | title=Luke Graves Hansard's Diary 1814–1841 | year=1962 | location=Oxford | publisher=Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1909—and for important votes before then—''Hansard'' has listed how members have voted in [[Division (vote)|divisions]]. Furthermore, the proceedings and debates in committee are also published in separate volumes. For many years the House of Commons ''Hansard'' did not formally acknowledge the existence of parties in the House, except obliquely, with Members' references to other Members of the same party as "hon. Friends", but in 2003 this changed and members' party affiliations are now identified. The ''Hansard'' of the House of Lords operates entirely independently of its Commons counterpart, but with similar terms of reference. It covers parliamentary business in the House of Lords Chamber itself, as well as the debates in the Moses Room, known as Grand Committee. Parliamentary Written Answers and Statements are also printed. Emma Crewe notes that "Editors view reporters in general as a hive of revolution and anti-establishment attitudes, while they perceive themselves as calm and uncomplaining".&lt;ref name="Crewe2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crewe |first=Emma |title=Lords of parliament: manners, rituals and politics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VHpIwkpFOCkC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=lords+of+parliament+hansard+revolutionary#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 January 2011 |year=2005 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-7207-9 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet, with the help of volunteers, has made the UK ''Hansard'' more accessible. The UK ''Hansard'' is currently being digitised to a high-level format{{clarify|date=November 2014}} for on-line publication.{{citation needed|date=November 2016|reason=Some citation talking about these voluntary efforts, etc?}} It is possible to review and search the UK ''Hansard'' from 1803, with the exception of Standing Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/commons/|title=House of Commons Hansard archives|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518231458/http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/commons/|archivedate=2014-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/|title=Hansard Online - commencing May 2010|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113141245/https://hansard.parliament.uk/|archivedate=2016-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because ''Hansard'' is treated as accurate, there is a parliamentary convention whereby if a member of parliament makes an inaccurate statement in parliament, he/she must write a correction in the copy of ''Hansard'' kept in the House of Commons library.

==Canada==
[[File:Hansard, Canada, Dominion Parliament (July 17, 1895).jpg|thumb|Sample of ''Hansard'' from the Canadian House of Commons, 1895. Shows sample of several members speaking as described in the text.]]

===House of Commons===
As with the Westminster ''Hansard'', the Canadian version is not strictly verbatim, and is guided by the principle of avoiding "repetitions, redundancies and obvious errors". Unlike the UK House of Commons, members are referred to in the House only by the parliamentary ridings they represent ("The member for Halifax West", etc.) or by their cabinet post. ''Hansard'' supplies an affiliation the first time each member speaks in the House on a particular day—"'''Mr. Mathieu Ravignat (Pontiac, NDP''')" or "'''Hon. Lynne Yelich (Minister of State for Western Economic Diversification, CPC.)'''"—and by name only when they rise later to speak.

If interjections give rise to a call for order by the Speaker, they are reported as "'''Some hon. members: Oh, oh!'''" The details of the approval or negativing of motions and bills are reported in rather baroque detail:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=hansard&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=38&amp;Ses=1|title=Debates (Hansard) No. 159 - November 28, 2005 (38-1) - House of Commons of Canada|author=|date=|website=www2.parl.gc.ca|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309095935/http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=38&amp;Pub=hansard&amp;Ses=1|archivedate=9 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|'''The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marcel Proulx):''' The House has heard the terms of the motion. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?&lt;br&gt;

===Translation===
Given the [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] nature of the Canadian federal government, two equivalent Canadian ''Hansard''s are maintained, one in [[French language|French]] and one in [[English language|English]]. This makes it a natural [[Parallel text alignment|parallel text]], and it is often used to train French–English [[machine translation]] programs. In addition to being already translated and aligned, the size of the ''Hansard''s and the fact that new material is always being added makes it an attractive [[text corpus|corpus]]. However, its usefulness is hindered by the fact that the translations, although accurate in meaning, are not always literally exact.

The Canadian ''Hansard'' records make note of the language used by the members of parliament, so as not to misinterpret the words of the person who has the floor. If the member speaks in French, the English ''Hansard'' records would state that the member spoke in French and refer the reader to the French ''Hansard'' record.

In one instance, during a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[filibuster]] in the [[Senate of Canada]], Senator [[Philippe Gigantès]] was accused of reading one of his books only so that he could get the translation for free through the ''Hansard''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoy, Claire. ''Nice Work: The Continuing Scandal of Canada's Senate'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newfoundland===
In Newfoundland the struggle for the free press was much more violent. Henry Winton, editor of ''Saint John's Ledger'', "had his ears cut off and was left unconscious by thugs who had been lying in wait for him after dark".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; The fate of Winton was to be his printer's as well. 
The Authorities, who were not on friendly terms with the ''Ledger'', made little to no effort to apprehend the culprits.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; In another case, a "Gentleman by the name Parsons", of the ''Newfoundland Patriot'', "was sentenced to three months imprisonment in another incident".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

===Nova Scotia===
As was the case in many early Canadian regions, the newspapers were the first source of the Parliamentary debates. Canada's first newspaper, the ''[[Halifax Gazette]]'', was printed on Grafton street in Halifax in 1752. The two most prominent papers in Parliamentary reporting were the ''[[Acadian Recorder]]'', founded in 1813 by Anthony Henry Holland, and the ''Free Press'', established in 1816 by Edward Ward.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=John|title=The Hansard Chronicles|year=1980|publisher=Deneau and Greenberg Publishers Ltd|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=0-88879-023-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both newspapers reported the debates of the House of Assembly starting in 1817.

The [[Family Compact]] of Nova Scotia, nicknamed "the little compact", "viewed the admission of reporters to the Assembly with disdain" and "were not slow to react whenever they felt the slightest affront".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; There are many cases which exemplify the "struggle to obtain freedom of the press and parliamentary reportings in the Maritimes" as in the case of William Minns in 1823, who was forced to appear before the bar of the house, and William Milne, who was jailed for not being able to pay his debts.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

''The Novascotian'' newspaper would soon become Nova Scotia's most prominent paper after its launch in 1824, which was highly influenced by [[George Young (reporter)|George Young]] who was instrumental in its establishment.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; [[George Young (reporter)|George Young]] sought permission from the Assembly to report its debates. Permission was granted, yet he was not provided with very many privileges in the House. They didn't make it easy for him and didn't allow him a seat in the lower deck.

In 1827 [[Joseph Howe]] bought the ''Novascotian'' from Young. "There was no more powerful an advocate of parliamentary debates than Howe".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; In 1835 [[Joseph Howe]] was "prosecuted over a publication of a letter in the ''Novascotian''".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; He was charged with libel. This case was infamous and is considered to be a "cornerstone in the establishment of freedom of the press in Canada".&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; Howe, who defended himself in court, was found to be Not Guilty. This is why his case is viewed as a milestone in the development of the free press.

===Ontario===
[[File:Ontario Hansard 1953.jpg|right|thumb|Cover page of ''Hansard'' for the Province of Ontario, February 12, 1953]]
No official record of the debates in the provincial Legislature was produced before 1944. The debates were reported in various newspapers; the provincial archives clipped and collected these reports in a series of scrapbooks until 1953.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/about/library_l21.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial website now posts ''Hansard'' online, with records from March 29, 1977 to current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/ |title=Legislative Debates Search Page |publisher=Hansardindex.ontla.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-09-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619023323/http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/ |archivedate=2016-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alberta===
[[Alberta]] adopted a ''Hansard'' in 1972.&lt;ref name="assembly.ab.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/pib/hansard_home.htm|title=ALL ABOUT HANSARD - Legislative Assembly of Alberta|author=|date=|website=www.assembly.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1905 to 1971, local newspapers reported on legislative proceedings, and from these articles the Legislature Library has compiled a Scrapbook ''Hansard'', which is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://librarysearch.assembly.ab.ca/client/en_CA/scrapbookhansard|title=Scrapbook Hansard|author=|date=|website=librarysearch.assembly.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; News reporters were allowed to take handwritten notes in the Chamber, but they could not to make sound recordings, and members of the public were not allowed to take notes.&lt;ref&gt;Standing Orders of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/standing/standing_orders.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 a recording system was installed in the Chamber. Initially the Clerk’s office provided transcription only for special events, such as throne speeches, but requests from MLAs for transcripts increased, and by 1971 all House proceedings were being recorded. On March 8, 1972, the government introduced a motion to create ''Alberta Hansard'', and the following day they brought forward a motion allowing audio and video recording in the Chamber and also permitting visitors to the galleries to take notes. Assembly standing orders 115 and 116 set out the rules for broadcast media in the Chamber and at committee meetings, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/pib/hansard_AB_history.htm|title=ALL ABOUT HANSARD - Legislative Assembly of Alberta|author=|date=|website=www.assembly.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hansard'' staff verifies the names of individuals and entities mentioned in the House. Like other ''Hansard''s, ''Alberta Hansard'' follows editorial guidelines established in the 19th century, and transcripts are substantially verbatim. Revisions are limited to “the correction of grammar, spelling and punctuation, ensuring that the correct parliamentary forms are observed, and minimizing superfluous repetition and redundancies, but no material alterations shall be made, nor any amendments that would in any way tend to change the sense of what has been spoken.”&lt;ref&gt;Standing Order 113, https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/standing/standing_orders.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Transcripts for [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] proceedings from 1972 onward are available online, and current issues are usually posted within 12 hours of the day’s sitting. A transcript for a regular afternoon Assembly sitting of 4.5 hours contains more than 30,000 words.&lt;ref name="assembly.ab.ca"/&gt; Also available online are transcripts for meetings of committees of the Legislative Assembly from the 1990s onward, earlier for some committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=adr_home|title=Assembly Documents and Records- Legislative Assembly of Alberta|author=|date=|website=www.assembly.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Columbia===
No complete official record of the debates in the British Columbia Legislature was produced until 1972; a partial record was issued beginning in 1970. Unlike the Ottawa ''Hansard'', opposition members and government backbenchers are identified only by initial and last name: "'''J. Horgan'''". Current cabinet ministers have their names prefaced with "Honourable": "'''Hon. S. Hagen'''". Interjections giving rise to a call for order by the Speaker are reported only as "Interjection". Other interjections are reported as spoken if they are clearly audible and if they are responded to in some way by the member who has the floor. While the details of approval or negativing of motions and bills closely parallel the House of Commons, the reporting is simplified to a style line ("Motion approved" or "Motion negatived").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.bc.ca/hansard/38th3rd/H70531p.htm Hansard, Thursday, May 31, 2007 p.m., Vol. 22, No. 3 (HTML)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926212412/http://www.leg.bc.ca/hansard/38th3rd/H70531p.htm |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
The [[Parliament of Australia]] also keeps record of debates, using the term ''Hansard''.&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard | title=Hansard – Parliament of Australia | publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] | work=Parliament of Australia website | accessdate=22 November 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015021919/http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard | archivedate=15 October 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peo.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fact_sheets/records_parliament.html | title=Fact Sheets – Records of the Parliament | publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] | work=Parliamentary Education Office website | accessdate=22 November 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130164509/http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fact_sheets/records_parliament.html | archivedate=30 November 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The records are published by the [[State Law Publisher]].&lt;ref name="parliament.wa.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/webcms/webcms.nsf/content/hansard | title=Parliament of WA – Hansard | publisher=[[Parliament of Western Australia]] | work=Parliament of Western Australia website | accessdate=22 November 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204110751/http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/WebCMS/WebCMS.nsf/content/hansard | archivedate=4 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of South Australia]] was the first convict free state colony to use ''Hansard''; where it became a convention from 1857.

==New Zealand==
{{Main|Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)}}

On 9 July 1867 a team of five reporters, led by Chief Reporter [[C.C.N. Barron]], produced the first official report of debates of the [[Parliament of New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18920711.2.10|title=A Quarter of a Century.|author=|date=11 July 1892|publisher=|pages=2|accessdate=28 April 2018|via=Papers Past|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218154551/https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18920711.2.10|archivedate=18 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18880709.2.8|title=Evening Post.

Today ''Hansard'' is produced by a team of 17 [[Full-time equivalent|FTE]] Hansard Editors within the [[Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives]]. ''Hansard'' is published on the [[New Zealand Parliament]] website each day the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House]] sits, and later indexed bound volumes are produced.

Speeches are transcribed directly from digital recordings of the debate, with staff present in the [[debating chamber]] to monitor the debate by recording the sequence of speakers and any interjections. Interjections are reported only if the member speaking replies to them or remarks on them during the course of his or her speech. Hansard Editors follow strict rules on what changes they can make to the words [[MPs]] use in the [[debating chamber]]. ''Hansard'' is as close to [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] as possible, although Hansard Editors remove repetitions and redundancies and make minor grammatical corrections. [[MPs]] are provided draft copies of their speeches at the same time that the speeches are first published on the Parliament website. [[MPs]] can request correction of inadvertent factual inaccuracies but they are unable to significantly change what they said in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/what-is-hansard/|title=What is Hansard?|author=|date=|website=www.parliament.nz|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129044314/https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/what-is-hansard/|archivedate=29 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews270420091/650th-bound-edition-of-hansard-published|title=Features (pre 2016)|author=|date=|website=www.parliament.nz|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218130306/https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews270420091/650th-bound-edition-of-hansard-published|archivedate=18 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Parliament==
The [[European Parliament]] has its verbatim report of proceedings of the plenary sessions, often referred to by its name in French {{lang|fr|compte rendu in extenso}} (CRE). It is eventually available in nearly all of the [[languages of the European Union|Union's languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/plenary/cre.do|title=Home - Plenary - European Parliament|author=|date=|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830133034/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/plenary/cre.do|archivedate=30 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is present in most flowering species, although varies in structural dimensions and appearance.{{sfn|Cronquist|1981}} This differentiation between the hypanthium in particular species is useful for [[plant identification|identification]]. Some [[geometry|geometric]] forms are [[obconic]] shapes as  in [[heteromeles|toyon]], whereas some are saucer-shaped as in ''[[Mitella caulescens]]''.

Its presence is diagnostic of many [[family (biology)|families]], including the [[Rosaceae]], [[Grossulariaceae]], and [[Fabaceae]]. In some cases, it can be so deep, with such a narrow top, that the flower can appear to have an [[anatomical terms of location|inferior]] [[ovary (botany)|ovary]] - the ovary is below the other attached floral parts. The hypanthium is known by different common names in differing species. In the [[eucalypt]]s, it is referred to as the ''gum nut''; in roses it is called the [[rose hip|hip]].

==Variations in plant species==

[[File:2013-04-29 16-35-13-fleur-58f.jpg|thumb|right|In ''[[Spiraea]]'' the hypanthium supports a nectar-producing "disk" which is ring-shaped and may have lobes as it does here. The stamens arise between the petals and the disk.]]

[[File:20140226Narcissus pseudonarcissus2.jpg|thumb|''Narcissus pseudonarcissus'', showing from the upper bend to the tip of the flower: [[spathe]], ovary, hypanthium, [[tepal]]s, [[perianth#Corona|corona]]]]
In [[myrtles]] the hypanthium can either surround the ovary loosely or tightly; in some cases it can be fused to the walls of the ovary. It can vary in length. The rims around the outside of the hypanthium contain the calyx lobes or free sepals, [[petal]]s and either the stamen or multiple stamen that are attached at one or two points. 
The flowers of the family Rosaceae always have some type of hypanthium or at least a floral cup from which the sepals, petals and stamens all arise. In the [[Rosaceae|family Rosaceae]], or the [[rose]] family, the hypanthium is lined with nectar-producing tissue known as [[nectar]]ies. The nectar is a sugary substance that attracts [[bird]]s and [[bee]]s to the flower, who then take the pollen from the lining of the hypanthium and transfer it to the next flower they visit, usually a neighbouring plant.{{sfn|Givnish|1997}}

The stamens borne on the hypanthium are the pollen-producing [[sex organ|reproductive organs]] of the flower. The hypanthium helps in many ways with the reproduction and [[pollination|cross pollination]] pathways of most plants. It provides [[weather]] protection and a medium to sustain the lost pollen, increasing the probability of fertility and cross-pollination.{{sfn|Clarke|2004}} The retained pollen can then attach to [[pollinator]]s such as [[bird]]s, [[bee]]s, [[moth]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[bat]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]] and other [[animal]]s. [[Wind]] can act as an instigator for [[fertilisation]]. The hypanthium is also an adaptive feature for structural support. It helps the [[plant stem|stem]] fuse together with the flower, in turn strengthening the bond and overall stability and integrity.{{sfn|Snow|2003}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9789">'''Islamic bioethics''', or Islamic [[medical ethics]], ({{lang-ar|الأخلاق الطبية}} ''al-akhlaq al-tibbiyyah'') refers to Islamic guidance on [[ethics|ethical]] or [[morality|moral]] issues relating to medical and scientific fields, in particular, those dealing with human life.&lt;ref name="Shomali, Mohammad Ali 2008"&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction ==
In Islam, human life is regarded as an invaluable gift from [[Allah|God]], and should therefore be both respected and protected.&lt;ref&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Younis, Huda. "Islamic Bioethics." O&amp;G Magazine Winter 2008: 24.&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident in many [[Qur’an]]ic verses or ''[[ayat]]'', one of the most important being:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"if anyone slays a human being, unless it be [in punishment] for murder or spreading corruption on earth, it shall be as though he had slain all mankind; whereas, if anyone saves a life, it shall be as though he had saved the lives of all mankind."(Qur’an 5:32)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is this verse which has ultimately fueled the interest in Islamic bioethics and within it exist two basic principles which ensure that the sanctity of human life is preserved:
# Saving a life is obligatory.
# Unjustified taking of a life is classified as [[murder]] and, thus, forbidden.

Though [[Muslim]]s recognize and maintain that Allah is the ultimate source of life (Qur’an 2:258), the Qur’an illustrates that God has instilled in them [[reason]], [[free will]], the ability to distinguish between what is morally acceptable and what is unacceptable (Qur’an 91:8) while also supplying the provisions of nature (Qur’an 45:13).&lt;ref name="Shomali, Mohammad Ali 2008"/&gt; With these things, Muslims are held responsible for maintaining health and preventing illness. In the event that illness occurs, Muslims are obliged to seek medical treatment in a manner which is Islamically appropriate and permissible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Sources==
The fundamental basis of Islamic bioethics is that all rulings and actions must fall into accordance with Islamic law ([[shari’a]]) and [[Islamic ethics]]. By evaluating bioethical issues from and ethical and legal standpoint, jurists can issue decrees or [[fatwa]]s regarding the permissibility of the pertaining subject. Any rule that has not been explicitly outlined in the religious texts or formulated from them by jurists is referred to as [[bid‘ah]] (innovation) and, therefore, is [[haram]] (impermissible).&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, all medical procedures and treatments, as well as conduct between patient and medical professional must be legitimized by the sources of Islamic law, 

* Qur’an,
* [[Hadith]] or [[Sunnah]]
* [[Ijtihad]]
** In [[Sunni]] Islam, ijtihad includes [[qiyas]] (analogy), [[ijma]] (consensus), [[maslaha]] (public welfare) and ‘[[urf]] (customary practice)
** In [[Shi’a]] Islam it is composed solely of al-[['aql]] (reason)

==Principles==
Principles of [[bioethics]] in the Western world were first developed and outlined by two American philosophers and bioethicists, [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[James F. Childress]], in their book, ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics''. The concept of bioethical principles has since been regarded as a purely “Western” innovation which is absent in the Islamic health care system.&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; These bioethical principles: [[autonomy]], [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]], [[non-maleficence]] and [[justice]] have been legitimized by Muslims jurists as falling into the sphere of Islamic law and have also been supported by Qur’anic verses (Qur'an 3:104, 16:90 and 17:70). They have subsequently become the foundational spirit underlying the ''Oath of the Muslim Doctor'' [http://www.islamset.com/ethics/code/oath.html] and, thus, dictate the conduct between a Muslim physician and his or her patient.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hathery, Shabib. "The Muslim Doctor: Duties and Responsibilities." ''Islamic Medical Association Conference, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.'' Ed. Khan, Y. and H. Bouagada. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authority ==
Formulations of rulings on bioethical issues in the Islamic context generally arise due to some form of deliberation between medical professionals and religious authority who have been recognized as most qualified individuals of location or time period.&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; After being approached by health care officials, a member of the religious authority ([[mufti]]) may then consult the religious texts and determine whether or not a specific issue is obligatory ([[wajib]]/[[fard]]), recommended ([[mustahabb]]), neutral ([[mubah]]), discouraged ([[makruh]]) or forbidden ([[haram]]).&lt;ref&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==
As health care and science have progressed over time, and the Muslim population has also increased to over one billion adherents over every continent on the globe, there have been increasingly prevalent circumstances for the evaluation of technological applications and bioethical issues to determine how they fit into the Islamic sphere. As a result, larger bodies of Islamic committees have been formed to address issues at hand. National Committees of Medical Ethics/Bioethics have been formed in many [[Islamic countries]] which work together with [[ulema]] to issue fatwas ensuring that neither the progress of medical science is hindered, nor the Islamic code of [[bioethics]] is jeopardized.&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of Islamic law (sharia’) is so heavily valued that each issue is looked at independently and subsequently deemed permissible or impermissible. Specific issues addressed in the modern scientific era include [[abortion]], [[fertility treatment]]s, [[family planning]], [[euthanasia]], [[genetic research]], [[cloning]], [[stem cell research]] among many other issues.&lt;ref&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Younis, Huda. "Islamic Bioethics." O&amp;G Magazine Winter 2008: 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 13-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic Medical and Scientific Ethics Project==
The [http://engage.bioethics.georgetown.edu/imse Islamic Medical and Scientific Ethics (IMSE) Project] is a multinational effort to produce a comprehensive collection of Islamic bioethics resources.&lt;ref&gt;http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/collections/islamic/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Project staff members at two [[Georgetown University]] libraries, the [[Kennedy Institute of Ethics|Bioethics Research Library]] (Washington) and the [[Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar#Library|School of Foreign Service-Qatar Library]] (Doha), have already compiled over 1,000 relevant written works into the IMSE Special Collection and have entered them into the searchable IMSE Database. The IMSE Project is funded by the [[Qatar National Research Fund]] (QNRF), a member of the [[Qatar Foundation|Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qnrf.org/nl/research_news/index.php?ELEMEID=1646&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julius Stone''' (7 July 1907 – 1985) was [[Challis Professor]] of [[Jurisprudence]] and [[International Law]] at the [[University of Sydney]] from 1942 to 1972, and thereafter a visiting Professor of Law at the [[University of New South Wales]] and concurrently Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[Hastings College of Law]], [[University of California]].

He is the author of 27 books on jurisprudence and international law, and is hailed by his official biography at the Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence as one of the premier legal theorists.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/juliusstone.shtml Biography of Julius Stone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623171512/http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/juliusstone.shtml |date=23 June 2006 }}, Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence, Sydney Law School, University of Sydney.  URL accessed 5 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Stone was born in [[Leeds]], England to parents who were poor [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] refugees.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Education==
Stone received a scholarship to [[Oxford University]], where he earned Bachelor of Arts (Jurisprudence), [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] and [[Doctor of Civil Law]] degrees. He followed this with a [[Master of Laws]] from [[Leeds University]], and then a [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] from [[Harvard University]].

==Career==
Stone taught at Harvard, and briefly at Leeds, then went to [[New Zealand]] where he worked at [[Auckland University College]]. In 1942, he was appointed [[Challis Professor]] of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[University of Sydney]], a position he held until 1972. Stone's appointment was controversial for several reasons; he was perceived to have a radical jurisprudential stance, some wanted the Chair to be held open until the end of the war as it was suggested that there were suitable candidates in active service. It was suspected that the fact that he was a Jew also played a role. A debate over his appointment was carried out in both the Australian parliament and local newspapers; the Chancellor of the University, and two Fellows of the University Senate, resigned in protest.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; This early experience of [[anti-Semitism]] influenced his lifelong commitment to justice, according to his biographer, Leonie Star (Star 1993).

Stone has been described by his official ''JSIJ'' biography as having "a life-long commitment to Israel"&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; and in the ''[[Sydney Law Review]]'' as having an emotional and "fierce loyalty to the State of Israel" that led some of his colleagues to "express fear even to discuss Israel with him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kirby|first1= Michael|authorlink=Michael Kirby (judge)|year=2005 |title= Julius Stone and the Struggle for the Soul of Law |journal= [[Sydney Law Review]] |publisher= [[University of Sydney]]  |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=323, 332 |url= http://sydney.edu.au/law/slr/docs_pdfs/editions/slr_v27_n2.pdf |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Stone moved to the [[University of New South Wales]], where he was a visiting Professor of Law until his death in 1985. While at University of New South Wales, he concurrently held the position of Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[Hastings College of Law]], [[University of California]].

In 1999, 15 years after Stone's death, the University of Sydney established an institute of jurisprudence which was named after him, the Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="stone_inst"&gt;[http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence The Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614004212/http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/ |date=14 June 2006 }} Accessed 21 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Stone influenced generations of lawyers who studied at University of Sydney. For most of his time there, the Law School was a practice-based school and students learnt what they needed to become practising lawyers. According to A J Brown of Griffith University, the former [[Justice]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] was heavily influenced at university by Stone. [http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24992503-5001030,00.html]

===Israeli settlements===
Stone's view is that [[Israeli settlements]] in the [[West Bank]] are legal under international law, and do not constitute a violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] (Article 49(6)). He stated:

"Irony would...be pushed to the absurdity of claiming that Article 49(6), designed to prevent repetition of Nazi-type genocidal policies of rendering Nazi metropolitan territories judenrein, has now come to mean that...the West Bank...must be made judenrein and must be so maintained, if necessary by the use of force by the government of Israel against its own inhabitants. Common sense as well as correct historical and functional context excludes so tyrannical a reading of Article 49(6.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=1&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=378&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=5603&amp;TTL=The_Settlements_Issue:_Distorting_the_Geneva_Convention_and_the_Oslo_Accords The Settlements Issue: Distorting the Geneva Convention and the Oslo Accords ]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Honorary life member of the American Society of International Law (1962). 
*[[Swiney Prize for Jurisprudence]] from the [[Royal Society of Arts]] (1964).
*World Research Award from the Washington Conference on World Peace through Law (1965).
*The Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence at Sydney Law School, [[University of Sydney]] is named in his honour.

==Criticism==
Stone has been criticised for his views in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] by [[Ben Saul]], saying: "Many of Stone’s positions on critical international legal issues in the Israel/Palestine conflict stepped outside even generous zones of plausible or reasonable interpretations of the law, even on the law as it then often ambiguously stood, and certainly in hindsight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ben Saul|year=2009|title=Julius Stone and the Question of Palestine in International Law|journal=Legal Studies Research Paper|issue= 09/106|pages=Abstract|publisher=University of Sidney|ssrn=1485056|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Low-power broadcasting''' refers to a [[radio station|broadcast station]] operating at a low [[electrical power]] to a smaller service area than "full power" stations within the same region, but often distinguished from "micropower broadcasting" (more commonly "[[microbroadcasting]]") and [[broadcast translator]]s. '''LPAM''', '''LPFM''' and '''LPTV''' are in various levels of use across the world, varying widely based on the [[law]]s and their [[enforcement]].

==Canada==
Radio communications in Canada are regulated by the Radio Communications and Broadcasting Regulatory Branch, a branch of [[Industry Canada]], in conjunction with the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC). Interested parties must apply for both a certificate from Industry Canada and a license from CRTC in order to operate a radio station. Industry Canada manages the technicalities of spectrum space and technological requirements whereas content regulation is conducted more so by CRTC.

LPFM is broken up into two classes in Canada, Low (50 watts) and Very Low (10 watts). The transmitters therefore range from 1 to 50 watts, as opposed to 1 to 100 watts in the U.S. {{as of|2000}}, 500 licenses (very low and low-power FM) have been issued. These transmitters are generally only allowed in remote areas.

Stations in the low-power class are subject to the same CRTC licensing requirements, and will generally follow the same [[call signs in Canada|call sign]] format, as full-power stations. Stations in the very low-power class formerly had to have CRTC licenses as well, although a series of CRTC regulation changes in the early 2000s exempted most such stations from licensing; a station in this class will usually not have a conventional call sign, but will instead be identified in a naming format consisting of a four-digit number preceded by the letters CH for a television station or VF for a radio station.

The regulation of spectrum space is strict in Canada, as well having restrictions on second and third adjacent channels, along with other protections for AM and FM commercial radio. In addition, because there have been a few cases that found that FM frequencies have caused interference to the aeronautical navigation and communications (NAV/COM) spectrum (though evidence is not very concrete presently), [[pirate broadcasting|pirate radio]] regulation has remained very strict as well. However, the two regulating bodies do have certain exemptions. For example, low-power announcement transmitters that meet the requirement of Broadcasting Equipment Technical Standards 1, Limited Duration Special Events Distribution Undertakings, Temporary Resource Development Distribution Undertakings, and Public Emergency Radio Undertakings are a few instances, which according to certain criteria, may be exempt from certificate/license requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author = Industry Canada. Radiocommunications and Broadcasting Regulatory Branch, Spectrum and Telecommunications Management.|date = 2000|title = Frequently asked questions on low power FM broadcasting (RIC-40) |location = Ottawa, Canada|publisher =  Spectrum Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, there is no formal transmission power below which a television transmitter is broadcasting at low power. Industry Canada, in most cases, considers a television transmitter to be low-power if the noise-limited bounding contours are less than 20&amp;nbsp;km from the antenna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/bpr10-i1.pdf/$FILE/bpr10-i1.pdf|title = Part 10: Application and Procedures and Rules for Digital Television (DTV) Undertakings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]] residents are allowed to broadcast licence free-of-charge at a maximum of 1 watt [[EIRP]] in the FM guardbands from 87.6 to 88.3 and from 106.7 to 107.7&amp;nbsp;MHz under a General User Radio License (GURL), which is issued by Radio [[Spectrum management|Spectrum Management]], managed by the [[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)|Ministry of Economic Development]]. Prior to June 2010, the lower band was located between 88.1 and 88.8 and a maximum of 500&amp;nbsp;mW EIRP allowed. Broadcasters on these frequencies are required to cease operations if they interfere with other, licensed broadcasters and have no protection from interference from other licensed or unlicensed broadcasters. Contact details must also be broadcast every hour.&lt;ref name=NZRSM/&gt;

Further restrictions are in place for the protection of aeronautical services.  Use of the following frequencies is not permitted within certain boundaries approaching Auckland and Wellington airports:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rsm.govt.nz/about-rsm/pdf-and-documents-library/spectrum-policy/official-information-notices-gazette/gurl-notices/low-power-fm-broadcasting/radiocommunications-regulations-general-user-radio-licence-for-low-power-fm-broadcasting-notice-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 107.5 to 107.7 FM and 107.0 to 107.3, respectively.

There exists a 25&amp;nbsp;km [[broadcast translator]] rule: one licensee may operate two transmitters anywhere (close together), but a third transmitter must be at least 25&amp;nbsp;km away from at least one of the first two transmitters.&lt;ref name=NZRSM&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/licensees/types-of-licence/general-user-licences/low-power-fm-broadcasting|title = Radiocommunications Regulations (General User Licence for Low Power FM Broadcasting) Notice 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are efforts on self-regulation of the broadcasters themselves. The NZRSM Radio Inspectors do, however, regularly monitor and make random unannounced visits to broadcasters, and will impose fines for violations of the regulations. New broadcasters are also subject to an initial compulsory inspection.

==United Kingdom==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Temporary low-power stations are allowed at times via a [[Restricted Service Licence]]. Since 2001, long-term LPFM licences have been available in remote areas of the country. These are currently used for many establishments, including [[military base]]s, universities and hospitals with fixed boundaries.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==United States==

===FM radio===
Low Power FM (LPFM) is a [[non-commercial educational]] broadcast service. LPFM licenses may be issued to non-commercial educational entities, and public safety and transportation organizations. Individuals and holders of other types of broadcast licenses are not eligible to hold an LPFM license.

====LPFM classes====
* Class L1 (LP100) is to 100 [[watt]]s [[effective radiated power]] (ERP). ({{CodeFedReg|47|73|811}})
* Class L2 (L10) is at least 1 and up to 10 watts ERP. ({{CodeFedReg|47|73|811}})

In addition, Class D educational licenses exist for stations of 10 watts [[transmitter power output]] (TPO) or less, regardless of ERP. These stations are all grandfathered operations, as no new licenses of this type have been issued since 1978, except in Alaska. They are not considered to be LPFM stations, although they operate noncommercially and have similar coverage areas to Class L2 stations.

====Legislation====

=====Origins of LPFM=====
In January 2000, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] established Low Power FM (LPFM) as a new designated class of radio station. These stations were allowed to operate at 1–10 or 50–100 watts of power, compared to the minimum requirement for commercial stations at 100 watts. ({{CodeFedReg|47|73|211}}). Originally, it was supported by activists and groups and figures associated with [[Progressivism in the United States|American progressivism]]; music artists (such as [[Bonnie Raitt]]); religious leaders/churches (such as the [[United Church of Christ]]); and educators (for example, [[American Library Association]], the [[Communication Workers of America]] [[trade union|labor union]], the [[National League of Cities]].

The original purpose of LPFM was to serve as an alternative to "[[radio homogenization]]", as described in the ''J&amp;MC Quarterly Journal'', as "... Necessary to offset the growing consolidation of station ownership in the wake of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which removed caps on radio ownership, as well as the decline of locally produced radio programming."&lt;ref name="Class D to LPFM"&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = Alan G. Stavisky|author2 = Robert K. Avery|author3 =  Helena Vanhala|title = From Class D to LPFM: The High-Powered Politics of Low-Power Radio|journal =  Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|volume = 78|date = 2001|pages = 340–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main opposition to LPFMs came from the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB), which opposed the act on grounds to "maintain spectrum integrity" for commercial broadcasting, according to NAB President Edward O. Fritts.&lt;ref name="Class D to LPFM"/&gt;

=====Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000=====&lt;!-- linked from "National Association of Broadcasters" --&gt;
Pressure from the National Association of Broadcasters urged [[United States Congress|Congress]] to slip the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000 into a general spending bill that circulated through Congress. President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the bill in December 2000, albeit reluctantly{{Weasel inline|date=November 2018}}. The actual bill that went through Congress [http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;dbname=cp106&amp;sid=cp106nfZjS&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr567.106&amp;item=&amp;sel=TOC_12219&amp; ] was meant to tighten standards for LPFM stations, in an effort to make it harder for stations to be approved in order to protect full-power FM stations had these provisions:
# The FCC has the ability and jurisdiction to license LPFM stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 1999|title = H.R. 3439 [106th]: Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h106-3439&amp;tab=summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Third adjacent channel interference protections require LPFM stations to be separated by at least 0.6&amp;nbsp;MHz from all other stations with the intent of preventing signal interference.
# Applicants who have engaged in the unlicensed operation of any station cannot receive LPFM licenses.
# The FCC agreed to commission studies on the interference effects and economic impact of LPFM on full-power stations (the findings, later published in the ''[[MITRE Corporation]] Report'', suggest that third adjacent channel interference protections may not be necessary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Radio Magazine|date = March 1, 2004|title = FCC Reports LPFM Interference Findings to Congress|access-date = March 3, 2008|url = http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409100247/http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|archivedate = April 9, 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This act basically shifted policy making from the FCC to Congress, which was considered an insult against the FCC. (Stavisky, Alan G., Robert K. Avery, and Helena Vanhala. "From Class D to LPFM: The High-Powered Politics of Low-Power Radio." Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly 78 (2001): 340–54.)

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2005=====
The Local Community Radio Act of 2005 was introduced by Senators [[John McCain]], [[Maria Cantwell]] and [[Patrick Leahy]]. After the FCC complied with the provisions of the Radio Broadcasting Act of 2000 by commissioning [http://www.recnet.net/mitre/2.pdf the MITRE Report] to test if there was significant interference from LPFM stations on the full-power stations, the study showed that the interference of LPFM is minimal and would not have a significant effect on other stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.current.org/tech/tech0314lpfm.html Current.org|title = Mitre study on LPFM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110525090155/http://www.current.org/tech/tech0314lpfm.html|archivedate = 2011-05-25|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sen. Leahy, "This bill will open up the airwaves to truly local broadcasting while protecting full-power broadcasters from unreasonable interference and preserving important services such as reading services for the blind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=8904246a-cd92-489c-81b1-48d8eddc4298&amp;Region_id=&amp;Issue_id=|title = United States Senator John McCain :: Press Office :&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2007=====
Sponsored in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] by Congressmen [[Mike Doyle (Pennsylvania politician)|Mike Doyle]] and [[Lee Terry]] and in the [[United States Senate]] by Senators Maria Cantwell and John McCain, the Local Community Radio Act of 2007 failed to be voted on. The House bill, H.R. 2802, was referred to the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet on June 21, 2007.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"&gt;{{cite web|date = 2007|title = H.R. 2802: Local Community Radio Act of 2007|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-2802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the bill was not passed in FY 2007, the bill was removed from the docket as ''Never Passed''.

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2009=====
This bill was an update of the Local Community Radio Act of 2007. It would have required the FCC to alter current rules in order to get rid of the minimum distance separation between low-power FM stations and third-adjacent channel stations.&lt;ref name="ww-111hr1147"&gt;{{cite web|date = 2009|title = H.R. 1147, The Local Community Radio Act of 2009|access-date =  May 23, 2009|url = http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/111_HR_1147.html#toc2|publisher = Washington Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, there was a minimum distance requirement; however the FCC found that LPFM stations did not cause any interference on third-adjacent channel stations, thus eliminating the need for such a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = RADIO magazine - The Radio Technology Leader|date = 2004|title = FCC Reports LPFM Interference Findings to Congress|access-date = May 24, 2009|url = http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081012040159/http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|archivedate = October 12, 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Local Community Radio Act of 2009 also would have required that the FCC keep the rules that offer interference protection to third-adjacent channels that offer a [[radio reading service]] (the reading of newspapers, books or magazines for those who are blind or hearing impaired).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = KPBS Radio Reading Service|title = About|access-date = May 23, 2009|url = http://kpbsreadingservice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This protection will ensure that such channels are not subject to possible interference by LPFM stations.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;

The final part of the bill required that when giving out licenses to FM stations, the FCC must make sure that these licenses are also available to LPFM stations and that licensing decisions are made with regard to local community needs.&lt;ref name="ww-111hr1147"/&gt; The bill had unanimous bipartisan support from FCC leadership. It was passed by the House and referred to the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ4TC9Aqjfc|title=FCC: Unanimous, bipartisan support for LPFM|date=September 18, 2009|author=[[United States Congress]]|publisher=[[Free Press (organization)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2010=====
The Local Community Radio Act of 2010 (based upon the legislation originally introduced in 2005) was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on January 4, 2011 as {{USPL|111|371}}, after passage in the House on December 17, 2010, and the U.S. Senate on December 18, 2010. In a statement after the bill became law, Federal Communications Commission chairman [[Julius Genachowski]] said, "Low power FM stations are small, but they make a giant contribution to local community programming. This important law eliminates the unnecessary restrictions that kept these local stations off the air in cities and towns across the country." The Act states that the Federal Communications Commission, when licensing new FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations, should ensure that licenses are available to FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations; such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community; and FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations remain equal in status and secondary to existing and modified full-service FM stations.

In general, the FCC was to modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between low-power FM stations; and full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations.

====Arguments for LPFM====
*[[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], a non-partisan advocacy organization pushing for media reform, specifically in promoting "diversity and independent media ownership, strong public media, and universal access to communications,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper = Free Press|date = 2008|title = Local Radio Now|access-date =  February 12, 2008|url = http://www.freepress.net/lpfm/}}&lt;/ref&gt; voiced its support of LPFM for a variety of reasons:
** It strengthens community identity.
** It creates an outlet for amateur musicians to get their music heard.
** It creates diversity on the air because women and racial minorities are represented.
** It creates an opportunity for young people, especially college students, who are interested in radio to learn about the business.
** It provides farmers with up to date agricultural information.
*[[Prometheus Radio Project]], a non-profit organization that "builds, supports, and advocates for community radio stations which empower participatory community voices and movements for social change,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Prometheus Radio Project|date = 2009|title = About Prometheus Radio Project|access-date = February 10, 2011|url = http://www.prometheusradio.org/about_us}}&lt;/ref&gt; also supported LPFM, citing these reasons:
** The media should not limit democratic participation but should provide a way for communities and movements to express themselves
** Public airwaves shouldn't be concentrated in private/corporate hands
** Low Power FM gives a voice to communities
** Low Power FM needs to be protected from big broadcasters

A ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = B. Stelter|date = January 11, 2011|title = Low-Power FM Radio to Gain Space on the Dial|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/arts/25radio.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on a LPFM station called KOCZ highlights a number of key arguments for LPFM:
* "In Louisiana, a large African-American community appreciate how LPFM plays a genre of music called [[zydeco]], a potent blend of [[Cajun music|Cajun]], [[rhythm and blues]] and, among a younger generation, [[hip-hop]], often features accordion and washboard.“
* LPFM influences commercial radio to offer listeners a wider range of music. “Commercial stations had started playing more zydeco since KOCZ started broadcasting in 2002. 'They know that we make them better,' an advocate said.”
* Because LPFM is non-commercial, schools and organizations are able to promote many community service-related projects that help better the local neighborhood. "KOCZ is licensed to the Southern Development Foundation, a civil rights group that grants scholarships and runs a business incubator but has fallen on hard times. The foundation treats the station as a 24-hour form of community outreach. "
* LPFM promotes a very close community. "A woman walked into the station ... asked for an announcement to be broadcast about her lost dog... 'She was able to get her dog back the next day’”
* LPFM is crucial for small communities in times of emergencies. “A low power FM radio station can stay on the air even if the power goes out. Low power FM saved lives during Katrina.”

Former President Bill Clinton is a known advocate of LPFM saying it is "giving voice to the voiceless", including schools, community groups, churches, and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Mike Janssen|date = January 15, 2001|title = Intervention by Congress slashes LPFM licensing 80%|newspaper = Current|access-date = February 11, 2008|url = http://www.current.org/tech/tech0101lpfm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown Paper Tickets CEO Steve Butcher supports LPFM, stating in a letter to the FCC, "We hear from event producers frequently who can't afford radio ad buys on commercial stations. These local entrepreneurs can afford underwriting on smaller stations that can help build awareness about their events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Brown Paper Tickets|date = September 13, 2011|title = Brown Paper Tickets CEO Makes Voice Heard for Low Power FM|access-date = September 13, 2011|url = http://www.brownpapertickets.com/pressrelease/100008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LPFM stations are considered to be affordable compared to an average FM station, whose operating costs can run up to a million dollars, and could only afforded by businesses and the very wealthy. An antenna and transmitter can cost between $2,000 and $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = HowStuffWorks|date = 2000|title = What is low-power FM LPFM?|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question330.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments against LPFM====
* Signal interference on FM station – High-power FM stations express concern that LPFM stations may cause interference with their signals if third adjacent-channel interference protections are not observed. While the Mitre Report suggests that the likelihood for interference is not as threatening as previously thought, high-power FM stations question the methodology, scope and validity of the study and its results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LPFM Report Fatally Flawed |work=Radio TechCheck |publisher=[[National Association of Broadcasters]] |date=October 20, 2003 |url=http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=4666 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114101516/http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=4666 |archivedate=January 14, 2009 |access-date=October 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* FM translators – These devices allow a radio station to rebroadcast its signal to reach a greater area. FM translators could benefit religious broadcasters wishing to reach a larger audience, as well as many AM radio stations who, due to [[Ionospheric reflection|ionospheric refraction]], are required to emit weaker signals during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Ron Whittaker|date = June 14, 2007|title = Elements of Mass Communication: AM FM Waves and Sound|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/frtv017.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; FM translators are low-power, so compete with LPFM for limited space on the airwaves.
* In some states, the local [[Department of Transportation]] operates large networks of LPFM stations that act as [[highway advisory radio]] stations – a service traditionally operated at the fringes of the [[amplitude modulation|AM]] band – restricting the number of available channels{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} (these systems can be licensed to the entire AM band, but the LPFM service provides considerably greater coverage at 100 watts than the 10-watt limit on AM – hence the considerable appeal for government agencies).
* Some investors in radio believe LPFM services prevent the development of [[digital radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Factsheets|access-date = May 29, 2008|url = http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Factsheets?lpfmfact032900.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[NPR]] is a major opponent to low-power FM. Their stance is that allowing more flexible rules for LPFM would burden other stations by forcing them to deal with interference problems and because full-power broadcasters reach a broader audience and provide a greater service, they should be favored regarding spectrum availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Everhart |first=Karen |title=Pubradio rejects higher status for low-power |newspaper=[[Current (newspaper)|Current]] |date=May 12, 2008 |url=http://www.current.org/fcc/fcc0808lpfm.shtml |access-date=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Everhart |first=Karen |author2=jonathan  |title=Once again NPR opposes expansion of low-power FM |publisher=reclaimthemedia.org |date=May 21, 2008 |url=http://www.reclaimthemedia.org/grassroots_media/once_again_npr_opposes_expansi%3D5996 |access-date=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The National Association of Broadcasters is the other major source of opposition. Its stance is that full-power FM broadcasters “enhance localism” by providing community-responsive information such as emergency information. Allowing low-power FM stations to have equal spectrum rights could be detrimental to these necessary programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MacBride |first=Marsha J. |last2=Timmerman |first2=Jerianne |last3=Bobeck |first3=Ann W. |title=Comments of the National Association of Broadcasters |work=Before the FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION |format=PDF |publisher=National Association of Broadcasters |date=August 22, 2005 |url=http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search§ion=20055&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentFileID=367 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114112638/http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search%C2%A7ion=20055&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentFileID=367 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 14, 2009 |access-date=October 14, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LPFM vs. broadcast translators====
{{See also|Broadcast relay station#Great Translator Invasion of 2003}}
Unlike the former [[list of broadcast station classes#FM|FM class D]] license, an LPFM station has no priority over broadcast translators in the allocation of available spectrum. This is problematic insofar as the regulations for [[broadcast translator]]s exempts non-commercial stations from the requirement that translators be within the coverage area of the original station that they rebroadcast. However, this provision only affects translators in the non-commercial portion of the band.  Stations in the commercial part of the spectrum must be fed over the air unless they are within the actual service area of the primary station.  Since the translator window of 2003 was only open for commercial channels, the use of directly-fed via satellite FM translators, commonly called "Satellators", was never a factor in the 2003 window.

The FCC licensing window for new translator applications in 2003 resulted in over 13,000 applications being filed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radioworld.com/article/translator-39flood39-causes-concern/16974 |title=Translator 'Flood' Causes Concern |date=10 September 2003 |author=Naina Narayana Chernoff |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of them coming from a few religious broadcasters.  However even though all translators on commercial frequencies must be fed by a direct, over-the-air source, regardless of who owns the translator per FCC rule 74.1231(b),&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|47|74|1231|(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the actual over-the-air source (the primary station) can be satellite fed, just as commercial stations can be fed by satellite. This leads to programming from a single station (retransmitted by many others) ending up on several hundred different translators. One station cannot apply for hundreds or thousands of translators nationwide, using automated means to generate license applications for all available channels, unless all of their applications are exclusively on the non-commercial part of the broadcast band (88–91.9&amp;nbsp;MHz). ({{CodeFedReg|47|74|1231(b)}}) As with any new service that shares the FM spectrum, when translators are added to an area, they can reduce or eliminate the availability of channels both for new LPFM applicants and for relocation of any existing LPFM stations displaced by full-service broadcasters. Unlike an LPFM station, a translator is not required to (and legally not authorized to) originate any local content except as permitted by {{CodeFedReg|47|74|1231|(g)}}.  Thus there is competition for spectrum in some locations between the LPFM service and the FM translator service.

In May 2018, several groups supporting community-based low-power FM stations filed objections with the FCC, citing the [[Local Community Radio Act]], accusing it of favoring existing station coverage expansion with translator licenses - "a spectrum grab" - over new LPFM spectrum licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ashworth|first1=Susan|title=LPFM Advocates File Objections to Nearly 1,000 Applications|url=https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/lpfm-advocates-file-objections-to-nearly-1000-applications|website=Radio World|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobson|first1=Adam|title=Are Hundreds Of Pending FM Translators In Jeopardy? {{!}} Radio &amp; Television Business Report|url=https://www.rbr.com/local-comm-radio-act/|website=www.rbr.com|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prometheus May 2018 translator objections"&gt;{{cite web|title=Low-power FM radio advocates file 1,000 Objections with FCC {{!}} Prometheus Radio Project|url=https://www.prometheusradio.org/InformalObjections20180516|website=www.prometheusradio.org|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AM radio===
{{see also|AM broadcasting#Microbroadcasting}}
The acronym 'LPAM' is not a legal term in the United States and is only used in this article as a (conventional) abbreviation. Unlike LPFM stations, which have legal and regulatory status, FCC rules do not define "LPAM" nor issue licenses for low-power AM transmission. LPAM is only an acronym applied to licensed low-power AM operations and to Part 15 transmissions as well.

Any "low power AM" in FCC licensing for stations in the United States is the requirement for higher-power licensed AM stations to reduce their transmit power at nighttime or post-sunset / pre-sunrise as part of their FCC broadcast authorization. There is a category ''Class&amp;nbsp;D'' for AM broadcast licenses, which limited stations to daytime-only transmission before regulations changed in the 1980s. Many, but not all, Class&amp;nbsp;D stations have been granted authority to broadcast at night with enough power to be heard within a few miles of their transmitters.

Other LPAM operations are known as [[Travelers' Information Stations]] (TIS), sometimes also called highway advisory radio (HAR). Authorized under FCC Part 90.242, these are stations licensed to local transportation departments or other governmental or quasi-governmental agencies to provide bulletins to motorists regarding traffic conditions. These are often near highways and airports, and occasionally other tourism attractions such as [[national park]]s. Some are used by chemical and nuclear facilities for emergency evacuation information systems, others by public safety entities for mobile operations.

Music is not allowed on TIS/HAR stations and they are restricted to only 3&amp;nbsp;kHz wide, "[[High fidelity|low-fidelity audio]]" as well, compared to the 10&amp;nbsp;kHz audio for standard AM broadcasters and 15&amp;nbsp;kHz audio permitted on FM stations. (Modern AM stations in the US actually restrict their audio to 5&amp;nbsp;kHz down to 2.5&amp;nbsp;kHz - roughly the same as to TIS stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radioworld.com/tech-and-gear/5-khz-audio-bandwidth-on-am|title=5 kHz Audio Bandwidth on AM|author=|date=|website=radioworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Travelers' Information Stations|TIS]] transmissions are normally authorized for 10&amp;nbsp;Watts or less, although some higher authorizations exist, primarily in locations where emergency evacuation may become necessary. The 60&amp;nbsp;Watt TIS stations on 1640 and 1680&amp;nbsp;kHz at [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] have the highest licensed power among full-time TIS stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/letterPdf/LetterPdfController?licId=1236825&amp;letterVersionId=52&amp;autoLetterId=0&amp;letterCode=AZ&amp;radioServiceCode=PW&amp;op=LetterPdf&amp;licSide=Y&amp;letterTo=L%20%20%20%20&amp;archive=nul&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
There are more than 2,450 licensed low-power television (LPTV) stations in the U.S., which are located in markets of all sizes, from [[New York City]] (five stations, though more exist in the market from other [[city of license|cities of license]]) down to [[Junction City, Kansas]] (two stations).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

LPTV (-LP) and LPTV Digital (-LD) are common in the U.S., Canada and most of the [[Americas]], where most stations originate their own programming. Stations that do not originate their own programming are designated as [[broadcast relay station#translator stations|translator]]s (-TX). The Community Broadcasters Act of 1998 directed the FCC to create a classification of LPTV licenses called [[Class A television service|Class A]] (-CA). Digital low-power and Class-A television stations have an ERP limit of 3,000 watts (3&amp;nbsp;kW) for VHF, and 15 kilowatts for UHF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fcc.gov/mb/video/files/afcce.ppt|title = FCC Slideshow, slide 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LPTV service is considered a secondary service by the FCC, which means the licensee is not guaranteed protection from interference or displacement. An LPTV station must accept harmful interference from full-service television stations and may not cause harmful interference to any full-service television station (the FCC defines interference levels deemed to be "harmful"). The problem with potential displacement was made evident during the [[Digital television transition in the United States|transition of broadcasting in the United States from analog to digital]]. All television stations operating on UHF channels 52 and above were required to move to channel 51 or below. Full-service stations were guaranteed a place to land in the new compressed band while LPTV stations operating on channels 52 and above were required to either find their own channel or lose their license.

====Class A LPTV stations====
The FCC provided a one-time filing opportunity for existing LPTV stations to become Class A stations. The designation was only available to LPTV stations that were producing two hours per week of local programming. Class A stations had to maintain a production studio within their Grade B contour, and comply with many of the requirements placed on full-service television stations. This allowed them to obtain protected channel status.

====Must-carry====
One of the key distinctions between full-service television stations and low-power stations is [[cable television]] and [[direct broadcast satellite]] (DBS) carriage. Full-service stations are guaranteed carriage in their local [[media market|television market]] through "[[must-carry]]" whereas LPTV stations are not. In 2008, there was an effort put forward by FCC chairman Kevin Martin to grant must-carry rights to Class A LPTV stations. The effort failed due to a lack of support from the other FCC Commissioners.

====Network affiliates====
Though many low-power television stations are either unaffiliated, or broadcast programming from small networks meant for their use, some LPTV stations are affiliated with major broadcast networks like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[The CW]] or [[MyNetworkTV]]. Examples include in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] with [[NBC]] on [[WBTS-LD]], [[Youngstown, Ohio]], where a pair of LPTV stations based at [[WYFX-LD]] broadcast Fox programming, along with the [[digital subchannel]] of the co-owned [[CBS]] affiliate, [[WKBN-TV]], or in the [[Lima, Ohio]] area, whose low-power stations are affiliates of major networks, such as [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

====Digital transition====
On July 15, 2011, the FCC issued an order to low-power broadcasters that effectively requires all remaining television transmitters to vacate channels 52 to 69 by December 31, 2011. In that same order, the FCC effectively required all remaining analog transmitters to have shut down by March 29, 2016.

Unlike AM and FM, unlicensed use of television bands is prohibited for broadcasting. The [[amateur television]] channels do allow for some very limited non-entertainment transmissions however, with some [[repeater]]s airing [[NASA TV]] during [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space exploration|mission]]s when they are not in local use.

The low-power television industry was represented by the Community Broadcasters Association (CBA), which held its annual convention each year in October and an annual meeting each year in April at the National Association of Broadcasters Convention in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. The meeting was always held on the Monday night of the NAB convention in Ballroom B of the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] and was open to anyone interested in the low-power television industry.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} On August 13, 2009, the CBA announced in a statement that it would shut down after 20 years of representing LPTV stations. One reason given was the "restrictive regulations that kept the Class A and LPTV industry from realizing its potential". Another was the inability to reach most viewers, partly due to [[Multichannel Video Programming Distributor]]s refusing to carry these channels. In addition, Amy Brown, former CBA executive director, said, "some 40% of Class A and LPTV station operators believe they will have to shut down in the next year if they are not helped through the digital transition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/327560-Community_Broadcasters_Association_to_Shutter.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Community Broadcasters Association to Shutter|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2009-08-13|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, the FCC released its Notices of Proposed Rules for Digital Radio. The Commission reaffirms its commitment to provide broadcasters with the opportunity to take advantage of [[digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) technology, proposed criteria for evaluating models and systems, such as the In Band On Channel (IBOC) system, and inquired on the needs for a mandatory DAB transmission standard.

In section 39 of the Notice, the FCC inquires as how to balance incentives for broadcasters to switch to digital systems with incumbents of new entrance opportunities, stating that they “seek analyses of the minimum power levels that would preserve service within protected service areas in an all-digital environment, and alternatively, the levels that would not result in significant disruptions to current listening patterns.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Prometheus Radio Project, Initials|date = February 12, 2006|title =  Review of fcc proposed rules for digital radio and impact for lpfm|url = http://prometheusradio.org/node/139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DAB system that has been identified as the best fit for LPFM is IBOC system. This is a hybrid system that uses existing frequencies and can operate carrying digital information along with analog broadcast signal on the sidebands. However, the digital carriers require the bandwidth to be widened, which would cause interference to stations on the first adjacent channel. If LPFM adopts IBOC, then LPFM would also need to accept a second adjacent channel restriction between two LPFM stations, as there is a potential that the sidebands of two LPFM stations would overlap causing interference. Currently, imposing a second adjacent channel restriction would impact less than 10 LPFM stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Michelle Eyre|date = September 21, 2008|title =  A Comparitive[sic] overview of digital audio broadcasting (dab) systems|url = http://home.recnet.com/dab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies''' ('''MA-MISS''') is a miniaturized [[imaging spectrometer]] designed to provide imaging and spectra by reflectance in the [[near-infrared]] (NIR) wavelength region and determine the mineral composition and [[stratigraphy]]. The instrument is part of the science payload onboard the European [[ExoMars rover]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/34664-exomars-facts.html ExoMars: Searching for Life on Mars]. Elizabeth Howell, ''Space.com''. March 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; tasked to search for [[biosignature]]s, and scheduled to [[Mars landing|land on Mars]] in 2021. MA-MISS is essentially inside a drill on the Rover, and will take measurements of the sub-surface directly.

MA-MISS will help on the search for biosignatures by studying minerals and ices ''in situ'' before the collection of samples. The instrument is integrated within the Italian [[core drill]] system called DEEDRI, and it will be dedicated to ''in situ'' studies of the mineralogy inside the excavated holes in terms of visible and infrared spectral reflectance.&lt;ref name='Vago 2017'&gt;[https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2016.1541 Ma_MISS on ExoMars: Mineralogical Characterization of the Martian Subsurface].

==Objectives==

The [[ExoMars|ExoMars programme]] is an [[astrobiology]] project focused on the search for [[biosignature]]s in the subsurface of Mars, and to better understand the geological evolution and [[Planetary habitability|habitability]] of Mars. The study of the Martian subsurface will provide important constraints on the nature, timing and duration of alteration and sedimentation processes on Mars, as well as on the complex interactions between the surface and the atmosphere. The stated objectives of the MA-MISS experiment are: &lt;ref name='Vago 2017'/&gt; 
*Determine the composition of subsurface materials.
*Map the distribution of subsurface [[Water on Mars|water]] and {{chem|CO|2}} ices.
*Characterize grain size.
*Reconstruct a [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] column for clues on subsurface geological processes.

In [[offshore engineering|offshore]] and [[coastal engineering]], '''metocean''' refers to the [[syllabic abbreviation]] of [[meteorology]] and [[physical oceanography|(physical) oceanography]].

==Metocean study==
In various stages of an offshore or coastal engineering project a '''metocean study''' will be undertaken. This, in order to estimate the environmental conditions of direct influence on the choices to be made during the project phase at hand, and to arrive at an effective and efficient solution for the problems/goals stated. In later phases of a project, more detailed and thorough metocean studies may be needed, depending on whether there is an expected additional gain with respect to the successful and efficient completion of the project.

==Metocean conditions==
'''Metocean conditions''' refer to the combined [[wind]], [[wind wave|wave]] and [[climate]] (etc.) conditions as found on a certain location. They are most often presented as statistics, including [[seasonal variation]]s, [[contingency table|scatter tables]], [[wind rose]]s and [[cumulative frequency analysis|probability of exceedance]]. The metocean conditions may include, depending on the project and its location, statistics on:
;Meteorology: 
* [[wind speed]], [[wind direction|direction]], [[wind|gustiness]], [[wind rose]] and [[power spectrum|wind spectrum]]
* [[air temperature]]
* [[humidity]]  
* occurrence and strength of [[typhoon]]s, [[hurricane]]s and (other) [[cyclone]]s

==Metocean data==
[[File:Arct0148 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|right|Ice beacon – for tracking the movement of the ice by [[GPS]], as well as containing other sensors for measuring more metocean parameters – and Pablo Clemente-Colón of the U.S. [[National Ice Center]].]]

The metocean conditions are preferably based on '''metocean data''', which can come from [[measuring instrument]]s deployed in or near the project area, global (re-analysis) models and [[remote sensing]] (often by satellites). For estimating probabilities of exceedance – for relevant physical quantities – data of extreme events during more than one year is needed.

By use of [[verification and validation|validated]] [[numerical model]]s, the availability of metocean data can be extended. For instance, consider the case of a coastal location where no wave measurements are available. If there is long-term wave data available in a nearby offshore location (e.g. from satellites), a [[wind wave model]] can be employed to transform the offshore wave statistics to the nearshore location (provided the bathymetry is known).

Often, long-term local measurements of wave conditions due to extreme events (e.g. hurricanes) are missing. By using estimates for the wind [[field (physics)|fields]] during past extreme events, the corresponding wave conditions can be computed through [[wave hindcast]]s.

'''Microbiology of decomposition''' is the study of all microorganisms (mainly [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]) involved in [[decomposition]], the chemical and physical processes during which organic matter is broken down and reduced to its original elements.

Decomposition microbiology can be divided between two fields of interest:
# decomposition of [[plant]] materials;
# decomposition of [[cadavers]] and carcasses.

The decomposition of plant materials is commonly studied in order to understand the [[Carbon cycle|cycling of carbon]] within a given environment and to understand the subsequent impacts on soil quality. Plant material decomposition is also often referred to as composting. The decomposition of cadavers and carcasses has become an important field of study within forensic [[taphonomy]].

==Decomposition microbiology of plant materials==

{{See also|compost}}
 
The breakdown of vegetation is highly dependent on oxygen and moisture levels. During decomposition, microorganisms require oxygen for their respiration. If anaerobic conditions dominate the decomposition environment, microbial activity will be slow and thus decomposition will be slow.  Appropriate moisture levels are required for microorganisms to proliferate and to actively decompose organic matter. In arid environments, bacteria and fungi dry out and are unable to take part in decomposition. In wet environments, anaerobic conditions will develop and decomposition can also be considerably slowed down. Decomposing microorganisms also require the appropriate plant substrates in order to achieve good levels of decomposition. This usually translates to having appropriate carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N). The ideal composting carbon-to-nitrogen ratio is thought to be approximately 30:1. As in any microbial process, the decomposition of plant litter by microorganisms will also be dependent on temperature. For example, leaves on the ground will not undergo decomposition during the winter months where snow cover occurs as temperatures are too low to sustain microbial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McKinley |first1=V.L. |last2=Vestal |first2=J.R. |last3=Eralp |first3=A.E. |year=1985 |title=Microbial activity in composting |journal=BioCycle |publisher= |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=47–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decomposition microbiology of cadavers and carcasses==

The decomposition processes of cadavers and carcasses are studied within the field of forensic taphonomy in order to:
*aid in the estimation of [[post-mortem interval]] (PMI) or time since death;
*aid in the location of potential clandestine graves.

Decomposition microbiology as applied to forensic taphonomy can be divided into 2 groups of studies:
* microorganisms from within the body;
* microorganisms from the decomposition environment.

===Microorganisms in the body===

When considering cadavers and carcasses, [[putrefaction]] is the proliferation of microorganisms within the body following death and also encompasses the breakdown of tissues brought upon by the growth of bacteria. The first signs of putrefaction are usually the discolorations of the body which can vary between shades of green, blue, red or black depending on 1) where the color changes are observed and 2) how far along within the decomposition process the observation is made. This phenomenon is known as marbling. Discolorations are the results of bile pigments being released following an enzymatic attack of the [[liver]], [[gallbladder]] and [[pancreas]] and the release of hemoglobin breakdown products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gill-King | first= Harrell |editor-first= William D.| editor-last=Hagldund |title= Forensic Taphonomy: The post-mortem fate of human remains |publisher=CRC Press |year=1997 |pages=93–108 |chapter=Chapter Chemical and Ultrastructural Aspects of Decomposition |isbn= 978-0-8493-9434-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proliferation of bacteria throughout the body is accompanied with the production of considerable amounts of gases due to their capacities of [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vass|first1=A.A.|last2=Barschik|first2=S.A.|last3=Sega|first3=G.|last4=Caton|first4=J.|last5=Skeen|first5=J.T.|last6=Love|first6=J.C.|year=2002|title=Decomposition chemistry of human remains: a new methodology for determining post-mortem interval|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|volume=47|issue=3|pages=542–553|url= http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0022-1198&amp;site=1|doi= 10.1520/JFS15294J|pmid=12051334}}&lt;/ref&gt; As gases accumulate within the bodily cavities the body appears to swell as it enters the bloat stage of decomposition.

As oxygen is present within a body at the beginning of decomposition, [[aerobic organism|aerobic bacteria]] flourish during the first stages of the process. As the microbial population increases, an accumulation of gases changes the environment into anaerobic conditions which is consequently followed by a change to [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Janaway | first= Robert C |editor1-first= John| editor1-last=Hunter |editor2-first= Charlotte| editor2-last=Roberts|editor3-first=Anthony|editor3-last=Martins| title= Studies in crime: An introduction to forensic archaeology|publisher=Batsford |year=1996 |pages=58–85 |chapter=The decay of human buried remains and their associated materials |isbn= 0-415-16612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gastro-intestinal bacteria are thought to be responsible for the majority of the putrefactive processes that occur in cadavers and carcasses. This can be in part attributed to the impressive concentrations of viable gastro-intestinal organisms and the metabolic capacities they possess allowing them to use an array of different nutrient sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson|first=Michael|title= Microbial inhabitants of humans: their ecology and role in health and disease|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2005|isbn= 0-521-84158-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gastro-intestinal bacteria are also capable of migrating from the gut to any other region of the body by using the [[lymphatic system]] and [[blood vessel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Janaway | first= Robert C |editor1-first= John| editor1-last=Hunter |editor2-first= Charlotte| editor2-last=Roberts|editor3-first=Anthony|editor3-last=Martins| title= Studies in crime: An introduction to forensic archaeology|publisher=Batsford |year=1996 |pages=58–85 |chapter=The decay of human buried remains and their associated materials |isbn= 0-415-16612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, we know that coliform varieties of ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' are important members of the aerobic putrefactive bacteria and that members of the genus ''[[Clostridium]]'' make up a large part of anaerobic putrefactive bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Janaway | first= Robert C |editor1-first= John| editor1-last=Hunter |editor2-first= Charlotte| editor2-last=Roberts|editor3-first=Anthony|editor3-last=Martins| title= Studies in crime: An introduction to forensic archaeology|publisher=Batsford |year=1996 |pages=58–85 |chapter=The decay of human buried remains and their associated materials |isbn= 0-415-16612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Microo scheme.jpg|thumb|center|frame| Proposed evolution of microorganisms within the body during decomposition. As oxygen is available at the beginning of decomposition, aerobic microorganisms flourish and quickly deplete the oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria can then proliferate in the body. Later in the decomposition process, fungi and bacteria from the environment will also become involved in the process.]]

===Microorganisms outside the body===

Cadavers and carcasses are usually left to decompose in contact with soil whether through burial in a grave or if left to decompose on the soil surface. This allows microorganisms in the soil and air to come in contact with the body and to take part in the decomposition process. Soil microorganism communities also undergo changes as a result of decomposition fluids leaching in the environment. Cadavers and carcasses often show signs of fungal growth suggesting that fungi use the body as a source of nutrients.

The exact impacts that decomposition may have on surrounding soil microbial communities remains unclear as some studies have shown increases in microbial biomass following decomposition whereas other have seen decreases. It is likely that the survival of microorganisms throughout the decomposition process is highly dependent of a multitude of environmental factors including pH, temperature and moisture.      [[File:Example of a pig carcass in the dry decay stage of decomposition.jpg|thumb|Frame|Right|Skeletonized pig carcass showing the production of a cadaver decomposition island surrounding the remains as a result of leaching of decomposition fluids into the surrounding environment.]]

====Decomposition fluids and soil microbiology====

Decomposition fluids entering the soil represent an important influx of organic matter and can also contain a large microbial load of organisms from the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Putman|first1=R.J.|year=1978|title= Flow of energy and organic matter from a carcase during decomposition: Decomposition of small mammal carrion in temperate systems 2|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|volume=31|issue=1|pages=58–68|jstor=3543384|doi=10.2307/3543384|journal=Oikos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area where the majority of the decomposition fluid leaches into the soil is often referred to as a cadaver decomposition island (CDI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carter|first1= D.O.|last2=Yellowlees|first2=D.|last3=Tibbett|first3=M.|year=2006|title= Cadaver decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems| journal= Naturwissenschaften |publisher= Springer|volume=94|pages= 12–24|url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/r8021xqt7667w264/|doi= 10.1007/s00114-006-0159-1|pmid=17091303}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that decomposition can have a favorable influence on the growth of plants due to increased fertility, a useful tool when trying to locate clandestine graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hunter |first1= John |last2= Cox |first2=Margaret |title= Forensic archaeology: advances in theory and practice |publisher= [[Routledge]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-415-27312-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes in the concentration of nutrients can have lasting effects that are still seen years after a body or carcass has completely disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Towne |first1= E.G. |year=2000 |title= Prairie vegetation and soil nutrient response to ungulate carcasses |publisher= Springer |volume=122 |issue=2 |pages= 232–239 |doi= 10.1007/PL00008851 |jstor=4222536 |journal=Oecologia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence that the surge in nutrients can have on the microorganisms and vegetation of a given site is not well understood but it appears that decomposition initially has an inhibitory effect for an initial stage before entering a second stage of increased growth.

====Decomposition fungi====

{{See also|detritivore|decomposer|decomposition}}

[[File:Fungihoof.JPG|right|frame| Fungal mycelia (white) on hoof of a deceased pig|412x412px]] It is well known that fungi are heterotrophic for carbon compounds and almost all other nutrients they require. They must obtain these through saprophytic or parasitic associations with their hosts which implicates them in many decomposition processes.

Two major groups of fungi have been identified as being linked to cadaver decomposition: 
* [[ammonia fungi]]
* post-putrefactive fungi

Ammonia fungi are broken-down into two groups referred to as "early stage fungi" and "late stage fungi." Such a classification is possible due to the successions that are observed between the types of fungi that fruit in or around a burial environment. The progression between the two groups occurs following the release of nitrogenous products from a body in decomposition.  Early stage fungi are described as being [[ascomycota|ascomycetes]], [[fungi imperfecti|deuteromycetes]] and saprophytic [[basidiomycota|basidiomycetes]] whereas late stage fungi consisted of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1= David O. |last2=Tibbett |first2=Mark |year=2003 |title= Taphonomic mycota: Fungi with forensic potential |journal= Journal of Forensic Sciences |publisher=Blackwell |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=168–171 |url=http://enterprise.astm.org.uproxy.library.dc-uoit.ca/SUBSCRIPTION/DIGITAL_LIBRARY/JOURNALS/FORENSIC/PAGES/JFS2002169.htm |doi=10.1520/JFS2002169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Decomposition fungi as PMI estimators=====

Considering the amount of forensic cases in which significant amounts of mycelia are observed is quite high, investigating cadaver associated mycota may prove valuable to the scientific community as they have much forensic potential.

Only one attempt at using fungi as a PMI marker in a forensic case has been published to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hitosugi |first1= Masahito |last2=Ishii |first2=Kiyoshi |last3=Yaguchi |first3=Takashi |last4=Chigusa |first4=Yuichi |last5=Kurosu |first5=Akira |last6=Kido |first6=Masahito |last7=Nagai |first7=Toshiaki |last8=Tokudome |first8=Shogo |title= Fungi can be a useful forensic tool |journal= Legal medicine |publisher=Elsevier |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages= 240–242 |url=http://www.legalmedicinejournal.com/article/S1344-6223%2806%2900052-6/abstract | doi = 10.1016/j.legalmed.2006.04.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study reported the presence of two types of fungi (''Penicillium'' and ''Aspergillus'') on a body found in a well in Japan and stated that they could estimate PMI as being approximately ten days based on the known growth cycles of the fungi in question.

'''Mission Muralismo''' was an artistic movement that brought awareness of issues as well as depicted everyday life as lived by the people in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|San Francisco Mission District]] and other barrios around the world. The Mission was an artistic playground for muralists to speak out about injustices and social issues around their city, the country and the world. Latin American muralists voiced their cries for international attention and aimed to create awareness for the social and political problems of Latin America through the murals they painted. The [[Nicaraguan]] community especially contributed to artistic projects to shed light on the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] and their struggles from 1979 to the 1990s.

== Origins and Influences ==

Murialismo can credit its origins to agencies like the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), a [[New Deal]] federal program established during the Great Depression to employ millions of struggling Americans to carry out public works projects along with supporting large arts, drama, media, and literacy projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=David|title=Freedom From Fear|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-9650868-9-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WPA helped fund artists like [[Diego Rivera]] in the 1930s, who helped bring an international muralist perspective to the Mission District. Other muralists like [[David Siqueiros|David Alfaro Siquieros]] and [[José Clemente Orozco]] who, with Rivera, made up the group Los Tres Grandes, also continued to innovate and bring “stylistic orthodoxy” to make “ideological and religious tableaux”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacoby|first=Annice|title=Street Art San Francisco: Mission Muralismo|year=2009|publisher=Abrams|isbn=978-0-8109-9635-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This foundation and influence was at the core of Mission Muralismo as values like being “outscale” and “outspoken” became standard in the murals and projects painted throughout the decades. The nature of being outspoken is what helped contribute to the precedent that murals in the Mission District aimed to present.

== Solidarity with Latin American Movements ==

Beyond Mexican muralists in the 1930s to the 1960s, there was a growing Central American refugees escaping political turbulence and civil war in the 1970s, some of whom found refuge in the Mission District. Nicaraguan artists and poets in particular found a home in San Francisco to build a solidarity movement with the Nicaraguan struggle. [[Roberto Vargas (poet)|Roberto Vargas]], a famed literary figure in the Nicaraguan community, critically stated, “we came in the human wave fleeing the brutality of the Somoza regime”—the human wave being the vast migration of Nicaraguan refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perez|first=Gina M.|title=Beyond El Barrio|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9129-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; With poets and artists like Vargas, along with the aftermath of the political atmosphere of the late 1960s in the Bay Area, the struggle to liberate Nicaragua from Somoza’s regime continued in the Mission District. The Nicaraguans who came from that human wave banded together and created a movement from the barrio, showing a strong sense of solidarity for the Sandinista struggle in Nicaragua by setting up offices for the Sandinista Front and spreading the word on the uprising through La Prensa, a newspaper from Managua, Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perez|first=Gina M.|title=Beyond El Barrio|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9129-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Murals ==

The Sandinista victory brought forth a great sense of pride from the Nicaraguan community as well as building bridges with other Latin American communities. The exterior of Casa Nicargua in the Mission District boasts a mural featuring “Chilean and Nicaraguan symbols beneath a handshake of support between the two countries,” reflecting the respect the Nicaraguan community has for the [[Chile]]an government under the fallen President [[Salvador Allende]] and celebrating the Sandinista victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perez|first=Gina M.|title=Beyond El Barrio|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9129-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decade that the Sandinistas controlled Nicaragua, “close to three hundred murals were created” by muralists who traveled to Nicaragua from the Bay Area to bring the solidarity movement back to the homeland, showing an American support from the barrio of the Mission District to the barrios in Nicaragua.

== Recognition ==

Although the murals exist in the Mission District and in Nicaragua, more notable movements like the United States’ government support for the Contra War, the effort to establish a counter military movement to combat and overthrow the Sandinista government, suppress the artistic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perez|first=Gina M.|title=Beyond El Barrio|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9129-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mission Muralismo and its influence on the Nicaraguan solidarity struggle is imperative to understand how the politics and atmosphere of political turbulence affected the barrios in Nicaragua and the barrios created in the United States as a result of the conflict. The murals serve as a voice for the barrio, one of the many tools used to make concerns vocal and visible to their communities in Nicaragua and in their new American home.

== History ==

=== Youth rights movement ===
{{further|History of youth rights in the United States}}

The youth rights movement first utilized the [[Internet]] in 1991,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} with the creation of the Y-Rights listserv mailing list. Two members of that original Internet presence, Matthew Walcoff and Matt Herman, began a non-profit organization out of that mailing list known as [[Americans for a Society Free from Age Restrictions|ASFAR]]. Not too long after ASFAR was founded, a [[Rockville, Maryland]] high school student began a youth rights group called YouthSpeak. At the same time, a third youth from Canada, Joshua Gilbert, was starting a youth rights organization for his country, the Canadian Youth Rights Association (CYRA). Walcoff, Herman, Hein and Gilbert all met through ASFAR, and decided to start a non-profit corporation to help unify the youth rights movement, which at that point consisted of almost a dozen different groups around North America and the world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Forming NYRA ===

By June 1998, NYRA was incorporated as a [[Maryland]] [[non-profit]] [[public-benefit corporation]] with intention to lead the Youth Rights political movement in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} It was formed by the original founders of ASFAR because of the desire to create a moderate, pragmatic organization in the [[Youth Rights, USA|Youth Rights]] Movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

NYRA's Executive Director from 2000 to 2012 was [[Alex Koroknay-Palicz]]. As its key spokesman, he was featured on [[CNN]], [[Fox News]], [[PBS]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', as well as many others, on youth rights issues such as the voting and drinking ages. In 2012, Koroknay-Palicz stepped down before reemerging in 2015.

2005 was a significant year for NYRA.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In late March, Koroknay-Palicz and several NYRA members traveled to Vermont in support of a bill lowering the drinking age to 18.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  They visited numerous colleges and signed up over 2000 new supporters.  They participated in a debate at the Vermont state house, and the event was significantly covered by the media.  Meanwhile, in Washington state, a new chapter in [[Olympia, Washington]], testified in support of a state constitutional amendment to lower the state's voting age to sixteen.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} From February to August 2006, President Adam King led a local campaign to add a nonvoting student adviser onto the Buncombe County (N.C.) Board of Education.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} His project had the support of the ''[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]'' and over 60 faculty members and administrators at his high school.  However, in August, the Board of Education rejected his proposal citing that they already had sufficient student input.  During his campaign, King made several appearances in the media.

By 2006, NYRA's main area of focus was expanding its local chapters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Chapters had increased fivefold between 2003 and 2006.  In 2006, the Board of Directors formally established that chapters are separate legal entities.  The chapter formation division saw a major restructure near the end of 2006.  Previously, the division was divided into five regions with one person assigned to that region.  However, the division's management decided to utilize a national pool of representatives working with all intents throughout the nation. In December 2006, NYRA received its first substantial grant from the Babson Foundation.  And in January 2007, it began renting an office from [[Common Cause]] in downtown Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/26/AR2007112602238.html Age Is Just a Number - washingtonpost.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the organizations changed its slogan from "[https://web.archive.org/web/20050512143015/http://www.oneandfour.org/archives/2005/04/the_last_civil.html the last civil rights movement]", in reference to the [[youth rights movement]], to "live free, start young."

In 2009, NYRA began to take prominent legal action and assert itself as a force for youth and students in [[jurisprudence]]. The organization filed its first joint amicus curiae brief in [[Safford Unified School District v. Redding|Safford v. Redding]], a student rights case brought before the United States Supreme Court, its President published an opinion opposing the Barr et al. v. Lafon case in the award-winning University of Pittsburgh School of Law journal "[[the Jurist]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/hotline/2008/08/sixth-circuit-ruling-on-confederate.php |title=JURIST - Hotline: Sixth Circuit ruling on Confederate flag ban is an attack on students' rights |accessdate=2010-05-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829024341/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/hotline/2008/08/sixth-circuit-ruling-on-confederate.php |archivedate=August 29, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a local chapter filed a lawsuit against the city of West Palm Beach, Florida, in an effort to repeal its curfew, a case which is still ongoing.

NYRA co-sponsored the First Annual National Youth Rights Day which occurred on April 14, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalyouthrightsday.org/ National Youth Rights Day].

=== Founding ===
[[Image:SulfurSpringAdjusted2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Sulphur Spring, renovated in 2005, was a major vacation spot for health seekers in the 1830s.]]

In 1841, Ohio residents Adam Poe and Charles Elliott decided to establish a university "of the highest order" in central Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, they purchased the [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#Elliott Hall|Mansion House Hotel]], a former health resort with its Sulphur Spring, using funds raised from local residents.&lt;ref name="elliott"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://catalog.owu.edu/cat-a09.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060306153516/http://catalog.owu.edu/cat-a09.pdf | archivedate = March 6, 2006|format=PDF| title = The University: Policy on Voluntary Sexual Relationships between Faculty/Staff and Students&amp;nbsp;– Traditions (PDF) | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = September 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="order"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.owu.edu/2003/elliott2.html| title = Elliott Hall Dedication | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = May 15, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe and Elliott wrote a charter emphasizing "the [[democracy|democratic]] spirit of teaching", which was approved by the [[Ohio]] State [[Legislature]]. Early in the following year they opened the [[college preparatory]] Academy and formed a [[Board of Trustees]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio Wesleyan University, named (like several other U.S. colleges and universities) after [[John Wesley]], founder of [[Methodism]], opened on November 13, 1844 as a Methodist-related but [[nonsectarian]] institution, with a College of Liberal Arts for male students.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/~catalog/cat-a04.pdf|format=PDF| title = Ohio Wesleyan University Catalogue | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = September 1, 2004 |archivedate=September 25, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925114524/http://go.owu.edu/~catalog/cat-a04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amongfirst"&gt;{{cite web | author= Labaree, David F. | url = http://www.stanford.edu/~dlabaree/U.S.%20Universities%20Sorted%20by%20Founding%20Date%20ver%202.doc | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615130643/http://www.stanford.edu/~dlabaree/U.S.%20Universities%20Sorted%20by%20Founding%20Date%20ver%202.doc | dead-url = yes | archive-date = June 15, 2007 | title = U.S. Colleges and Universities | publisher = | accessdate = October 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohio Wesleyan's first president, [[Edward Thomson]], stated in his [[Inauguration|inaugural address]] on August 5, 1846 that the school was "a product of the [[classical liberalism|liberality]] of the local people."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; This liberal philosophy contributed to Ohio Wesleyan's vocal opposition to [[slavery]] in the 1850s.&lt;ref name="1850issues"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=231791077249253| title = Roots of Secession: Slavery and Politics in Antebellum Virginia| publisher = University of North Carolina Press| accessdate = October 15, 2005| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050413133931/http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=231791077249253| archive-date = April 13, 2005| dead-url = yes| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/revepete/HolinessCh3.html |title=The Methodist Movement Comes to America and Impacts Slavery |publisher=Reve' M.

=== Curriculum growth and fundraising ===

Retrieved on 2007-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the mid-19th century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on attracting students, adding fields of study, and fundraising, by which it significantly increased its endowment.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#Sturges Hall|Sturges Hall]] was constructed as the University's first library in 1855.&lt;ref name="sturges"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admission.owu.edu/sturges.html |title=Sturges Hall |publisher=Ohio Wesleyan University |accessdate=March 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410121140/http://admission.owu.edu/sturges.html |archivedate=April 10, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural History housed in [[History of Ohio Wesleyan University#Campus expansion|Merrick Hall]].&lt;ref name="merrick"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://botany.owu.edu/depthist.html|title = Departmental History |publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = March 4, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070209110531/http://botany.owu.edu/depthist.html |archivedate = February 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College]], established in 1853, merged with the university in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="merged"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=787|title = Ohio Wesleyan University|publisher = Ohio Historical Society|accessdate = October 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1876 and 1888, enrollment tripled and [[music education]] greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built in this time.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, pp. 72–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:OWU Athletic Grounds, Delaware Ohio 1915.jpg|250px|thumb|right|An early baseball game at Edwards Field, with Edwards Gymnasium in the background.]]
By the end of the 19th century, Ohio Wesleyan had added a School of Music (1877), School of Fine Arts (1877), School of Oratory (1894), and Business School (1895) to the original College of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844).&lt;ref&gt;Kukula, R. &amp; K. Trubner (1923). ''Minerva: Jahrbuch der Gelehrten Welt''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter and Company&lt;/ref&gt; To address the need for new departments and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities and courses to make them on par with OWU's new academic position. [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#University Hall|University Hall]], [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings#Slocum Hall|Slocum Library]], extensions to the [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College|Monnett campus]], and athletic facilities were all constructed during that period.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1891 and 1895, Ohio Wesleyan specialized the curriculum by establishing departments for [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[geology]], [[Public speaking|speech]], [[history]], [[French language|French]], [[English studies|English]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; This specialization encouraged undergraduates to continue studies at graduate level, allowed professional preparation for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, and promoted exchange study in Europe.&lt;ref name="nsfphdrate"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06319/pdf/tabb1.pdf|format = PDF|title = Top 50 U.S. baccalaureate institutions of Ph.D.s: 1920–24 and 1995–99 (PDF)|publisher = National Science Foundation|accessdate = December 24, 2006|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061108210719/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06319/pdf/tabb1.pdf|archivedate = November 8, 2006|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two professional schools for [[law]] and [[medicine]] were formed in 1896.

In 1905, the Board of Trustees decided to keep Ohio Wesleyan a college, despite the expansion of the curriculum and campus and the word "university" in the institution's name.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bachelor of Science]] degree was abolished, which left only the [[Bachelor of Arts]]. Two students were selected as [[Rhodes Scholars]] in 1905 and 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwards Gymnasium]] was built in 1906.&lt;ref name=athletics_history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bishops.owu.edu/hist1.html |title=The History of OWU Athletics |publisher=Ohio Wesleyan University |accessdate=February 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308111323/http://bishops.owu.edu/hist1.html |archivedate=March 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, the United Societies of [[Phi Beta Kappa]], the oldest undergraduate honor society in the United States, installed the "Eta of Ohio" ΦΒΚ chapter on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Chapter_Chronology&amp;Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=1624 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001756/http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Chapter_Chronology&amp;Template=%2FCM%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=1624 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |title=The Phi Beta Kappa Society: Chapter Chronology N-Z |publisher=The [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] |accessdate=March 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, the school added [[History of Ohio Wesleyan University#Campus expansion|Sanborn Hall]], housing the Music Department.&lt;ref name="sanborn"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://catalog.owu.edu/cat-i04.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615130644/http://catalog.owu.edu/cat-i04.pdf | archivedate = June 15, 2007|format=PDF|title = Facilities |publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = March 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, academic requirements for the bachelor's degree were reduced, and Latin and mathematics were no longer emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; During the presidency of [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|John W. Hoffman]] (1916–1928), the Academy and School of Business were closed; the Academy had started in 1842 as a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]], and throughout its seventy-five years frequently outnumbered the college in enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1920s, the chapel service was dropped and [[sororities]] were formed. Ohio Wesleyan also increased the number of buildings on campus, including Selby Stadium, Austin Manor, and [[Perkins Observatory]]; another building, Stuyvesant Hall, was in planning; and Edgar Hall was opened.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Years of change, 1930-1984 ===
[[Image:StuyFront.png|250px|left|thumb|Stuyvesant Hall, built in 1930, is the oldest residence in use on West Campus. A $14 million, donor-funded renovation of the facility was completed in September 2012.]]
During [[the Great Depression]], both enrollment and [[alumni]] donations shrank.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, pp. 140–160.&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] size remained stable, lack of tuition and alumni revenues precipitated financial problems which threatened the college's survival in the administrations of [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|Edmund D. Soper]] (1928–1938), Acting President [[Edward Loranus Rice]] (1938–1939), and [[List of Ohio Wesleyan University presidents|Herbert John Burgstahler]] (1939–1949).&lt;ref&gt;Tull, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration adjusted the curriculum during the early 1930s to address these problems.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, pp. 160–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek and Latin declined, while business administration and economics thrived and the highest enrollments were in the social sciences, English, pre-medicine, and history. The registrar reported that, in these years, the number of students from [[New England]] states, urban Ohio areas, and from international locations increased. By the 1930s, the Methodist students were a minority among the student body;&lt;ref&gt;Burtchaell, pp. 174–175;&lt;/ref&gt; formal ties to the Methodist church were severed in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;Burtchaell, pp. 304–319.&lt;/ref&gt; and led to debate among Board members in the 1930s, eventually resulting in the university's current active but loose historical affiliation with the [[United Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Burtchaell, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study into the relationship between American educational institutions and the Christian denominations they were historically affiliated with, James Tunstead Burtuchell writes that it was during this period that "in its personnel, its resources, and its students", Ohio Wesleyan lost its "symbiotic intimacy with the United Methodist Church."&lt;ref&gt;Burtchaell, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Ohio Wesleyan introduced a new "Centennial Curriculum", which enacted seven distribution requirements across the sciences and humanities; the new requirement for a foreign language course was added to the existing humanities requirement.&lt;ref name="Tull-182"&gt;Tull, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson and Bashford Halls, originally men's dorms, were built between 1951 and 1954.&lt;ref name="Tull-182"/&gt; In the 1960s, faculty, staff and administrators fought over administrative structure and control.&lt;ref&gt;Tull, pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually settled on a new "statement of aims" that stressed values, rather than religious goal statements, and instituted a more internationalized curriculum, a new Women's Studies Program, and an International Business major; the faculty senate also introduced a new academic calendar with three 10.5-week terms.&lt;ref&gt;Tull, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Wenzlau's presidency (1968–1984) began with the challenge of campus unrest: Ohio Wesleyan students took over the [[ROTC]] building, demanded its shut-down, and eventually eliminated ROTC in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Murchland, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murchland, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Students also demanded participation in departmental meetings and faculty committees, and the democratic process in the governance of Ohio Wesleyan grew in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Murchland, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Wenzlau's presidency witnessed decline in students' test scores, an unusually high attrition rate, lack of adequate research to identify potential major donors and a growing "[[party school]]" image,&lt;ref&gt;Murchland, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a rocky relationship between him and the student body.&lt;ref&gt;Murchland, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1979 and 1982, the campus newspaper ''[[The Transcript]]'' frequently criticized Wenzlau's presidency, blaming it for "severely affecting the reputation of the college".&lt;ref&gt;Murchland, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange resulted in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' report on the school that eventually precipitated the end of Wenzlau's presidency.&lt;ref name="OWUandWP"&gt;Peterson, Bill. "Enrollments Lower, Costs Higher". ''The Washington Post'', December 19, 1982, First Section, A5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1984-today ===

The president, David Warren, increased admission standards in 1985, engaged students in a "live-in" presidency, expanded media exposure and established a National Colloquium focused on the liberal arts.  Warren engaged in forty-one interviews on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] networks.&lt;ref&gt;Murchland, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Ohio Wesleyan has achieved several academic and athletic recognitions. A 1986 study, titled "Educating America's Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges," identified Ohio Wesleyan as one of 48 highly selective "science-active" liberal arts institutions in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED258532&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;objectId=0900000b801160bc Educating America's Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges].

Ohio Wesleyan continues to undertake construction projects. The Hamilton-Williams Campus Center opened in 1991. The Memorial Union Building was renovated in 2001 to accommodate the Economics Department, the Academic Resource Center, the Information Services portion of the combined Libraries and Information Services department, and the Woltemade Center for Economics, Business and Entrepreneurship.

=== Emphasis on internationalism ===

Ohio Wesleyan has upheld academic [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] since its early years; since the 19th century, the college has established links with several international schools. In 1879, OWU alumna Elizabeth Russell founded [[Kwassui College|Kwassui Women's College]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], when predominant Japanese culture considered women's education unimportant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Windolf | first = Paul |author2=Francisco Ramirze | year = 1989 | title = Expansion and Structural Change: Higher Education in Germany, the United States, and Japan, 1870–1990 | publisher = Contemporary Sociology | location= | id =Vol. 27, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Kwassui College is one of the top finishing schools for young women in Japan.&lt;ref name="kwassuijp"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kwassui.ac.jp/ | title = Kwassui Institute|publisher = Kwassui Institute|accessdate = October 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, William Ehnis (from the class of 1898) traveled to [[Africa]] and opened a school in [[Mutare]], [[Zimbabwe]], that eventually became the [[University of Africa|Africa University]].&lt;ref name="africauniv"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.africau.edu/ | title = Africa University | publisher = Africa University | accessdate = October 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1988, Conrad Kent established the popular Salamanca Spanish Program for Ohio Wesleyan students.
The school also manifests international interest in the percentage of international students it recruits and enrolls annually. Since 1983, Ohio Wesleyan has been listed in ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' among colleges that attract the highest percentage of international students.&lt;ref name="departmentofeducation"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edupass.org/finaid/undergraduate.phtml | title = Schools with Financial Aid for International Undergraduate Students | publisher = Mark Kantrowitz | accessdate = October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="departmentofeducation2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edupass.org/admissions/schoolsearch.phtml | title = Choosing a School | publisher = Mark Kantrowitz | accessdate = October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iied"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://opendoors.iienetwork.org/?p=49938 | title = International Students: Leading Institutions by Institutional Type | publisher = Institute of International Education | accessdate = October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mostinternationalstudents"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pmc.edu/about/ranking/2005/international.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908002353/http://www.pmc.edu/about/ranking/2005/international.html | archivedate = September 8, 2006 | title = Most International Students | publisher = U.S.News &amp; World Report| accessdate = October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of international students grew in the early and mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="chronicleOWUIntl"&gt;Desruisseaux, Paul.

High participation in formal exchange programs constitutes a third target of the school's international focus.&lt;ref&gt;Tull, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[Great Lakes Colleges Association]] agreement, OWU established an exchange program with [[Waseda University]] in 1962 to provide approximately 30 American students with opportunities to study in [[Japan]] and 30 Japanese students to study at Ohio Wesleyan each year.&lt;ref name="waseda"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.waseda.jp/intl-ac/bulletin/c14.html | title = Agreements with Overseas Institutions | publisher = Waseda University | accessdate = October 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Salamanca program, founded by Conrad Kent in 1988,&lt;ref name="salamanca"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/~jjarriba/Salamanca/programhistory.htm|title = Ohio Wesleyan University: The Salamanca Program|publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = October 18, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901180552/http://go.owu.edu/~jjarriba/Salamanca/programhistory.htm |archivedate = September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducts the exchange of approximately one hundred students and faculty between OWU and the [[University of Salamanca]] in [[Spain]].

== Campus ==
{{Main|List of Ohio Wesleyan University buildings}}
{{see also|Richard Ross Museum of Art|Ohio Wesleyan University Library|Strand Theatre (Delaware, Ohio)}}
The Ohio Wesleyan campus is next to downtown Delaware, and is bisected by Sandusky Street, the main north/south street through the heart of the city. The street informally divides the campus into an eastern sector composed mainly of academic buildings and a western sector composed mainly of residential and administrative buildings. Many facilities have been constructed in the last two years, with substantial benefit to science, art, and athletic programs on campus.

=== Other facilities and off-campus programs ===
{{Main|Perkins Observatory|Strand Theatre (Delaware, Ohio)}}

OWU operates several facilities outside campus: The Philadelphia Business Center, Wesleyan in Washington, [http://nyartsprogram.org/ The New York Arts Program] for the performing, visual and media arts (a GLCA arts program), [[Perkins Observatory]], [[Strand Theatre (Delaware, Ohio)|The Strand Theatre]], and the [[Kraus Preserve of Ohio Wesleyan University|Kraus Wilderness Preserve]].

Perkins Observatory is situated in Delaware on land separate to the main campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perkins-observatory.org/programs.html#directions |title=How to find us |publisher=Perkins Observatory |accessdate=November 30, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928084907/http://www.perkins-observatory.org/programs.html |archivedate=September 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The observatory is named after [[Hiram Perkins]], a former professor of mathematics and astronomy at the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perkins-observatory.org/history.html#hiram |title=Hiram Perkins |publisher=Perkins Observatory |accessdate=November 30, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928085124/http://www.perkins-observatory.org/history.html |archivedate=September 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the observatory was built in 1931, it housed the third-largest [[telescope]] in the world, which has since been moved to [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name=PerkinsHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perkins-observatory.org/history.html#69 |title=History of Perkins Observatory |publisher=Perkins Observatory |accessdate=November 30, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928085124/http://www.perkins-observatory.org/history.html |archivedate=September 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Perkins dome now houses a {{convert|32|in|mm|sing=on}} telescope, which is the second-largest in Ohio.

The university also maintains offices for [[study abroad]], US domestic study, and [[internship]] programs. Such programs include: Wesleyan in Washington, which allows students to study for a semester in [[Washington, D.C.]], in research and [[internship]] positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/49.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901174920/http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/49.php | archivedate = September 1, 2006 | title = Learning in Washington | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = October 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philadelphia Center offers students hundreds of internship and field placement opportunities off-campus and the chance to live independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/52.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901175021/http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/52.php | archivedate = September 1, 2006 | title = Philadelphia Center Gives Students Taste of Life in the Big City | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = November 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the New York Arts Program, which allows students of the arts to gain a semester of hands on experience in the arts in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=NYArtsProgram&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newyorkartsprogram.org | title = Wesleyan Arts Program | publisher = New York Arts Program | accessdate = November 21, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070923042407/http://www.newyorkartsprogram.org/ | archivedate = September 23, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community relations ===
{{see also|Delaware, Ohio}}

OWU has strong community ties with the City of Delaware.&lt;ref name="towngown"&gt;{{cite web | last = Donnelly | first = Sara | url = http://www.portlandphoenix.com/archive/features/02/04/19/feat_bates.html | title = Can Bates and L/A excel together? | publisher = The Portland Phoenix | date = April 18–25, 2002 | accessdate = November 29, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071023030745/http://www.portlandphoenix.com/archive/features/02/04/19/feat_bates.html | archivedate = October 23, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students participate in Delaware's community through a variety of educational, social, and cultural programs. The student-led Columbus Initiative, founded in 1989, is an [[experiential learning]] partnership between OWU and Columbus public schools.&lt;ref name="experientiallearning"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://magazine.owu.edu/2005_spring_pdfs/feat_linden.pdf |format=PDF| title = Learning at Linden (PDF) | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = November 25, 2006}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 150 Ohio Wesleyan students from this program tutor and mentor underprivileged pupils from Columbus.&lt;ref name="columbusinitiative"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://magazine.owu.edu/feat_linden.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901203431/http://magazine.owu.edu/feat_linden.html | archivedate = September 1, 2006 | title = Learning at Linden | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = November 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ohio Wesleyan Ambassadors Program (ISAP) promotes cultural diversity and ethnic awareness within the local community,&lt;ref name = "isap"/&gt; and exposes international students to [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] through the community. The program's ambassadors visit local schools to give presentations and participate in events for local [[non-profit]] community organizations.&lt;ref name="isap"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/56.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901175210/http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/56.php | archivedate = September 1, 2006 | title = New International Student Ambassador Program at OWU | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = November 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campus organizations cooperate with local residents on issues of [[civic engagement]] and [[activism]]. Progress OWU allows students from Ohio Wesleyan and local schools to express their voices on [[politics]], [[public policy]], and [[corporate]] and [[social issues]], both on campus and in the local community.&lt;ref name="progressservice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://service.owu.edu/organizations.html |title=Student Service Clubs, Organizations and Small Living Units |publisher=Ohio Wesleyan University |accessdate=November 25, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810015642/http://service.owu.edu/organizations.html |archivedate=August 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural programs also take part in community relations. In the 1960s, Ohio Wesleyan donated the Arts Castle, then part of the Fine Arts department, to the City of Delaware. It is now home to the Delaware County Cultural Arts Center. The Arts Castle hosts a variety of community programs in art, and offers classes ranging from ballet to fine arts.&lt;ref name="artscastle"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.artscastle.org/house.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061219180855/http://www.artscastle.org/house.html | archivedate = December 19, 2006 | title = History of The Arts Castle | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University, The Arts Castle | accessdate = November 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the OWU received a donation to rehabilitate the historic [[Strand Theatre (Delaware, Ohio)|Strand Theatre]] in downtown Delaware.&lt;ref name="strandpurchase"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.owu.edu/news/2002/strand.html | title = Gift Support Enables OWU to Purchase Strand Theatre | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = October 15, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111190155/http://www.owu.edu/news/2002/strand.html | archivedate = January 11, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university and the City of Delaware sponsor several events in town throughout the year: the Delaware Arts Festival, the [[Little Brown Jug (horse racing)|Little Brown Jug]], the Delaware County Fair, and the Castle Arts Affair.&lt;ref name="delawareevents"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.visitdelohio.com/big_events.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070103045602/http://visitdelohio.com/big_events.php | archivedate = January 3, 2007 | title = Big Events | publisher = Delaware County Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau | accessdate = December 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Delaware Arts Festival is an annual event held the weekend after [[Mother's Day]] on the streets of Historic Downtown Delaware.&lt;ref name="artsfestival"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.delawareartsfestival.org | title = About the Delaware Arts Festival Association, Inc. | publisher = Delaware Arts Festival | accessdate = December 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival hosts over 170 booths featuring works of local, regional, and other artists.

OWU has partisan political groups ranging from liberal to conservative, such the College Republicans and the College Democrats, and several activism awareness groups such as Black Men of the Future, Black Student Union (formerly Student Union on Black Awareness), PRIDE, Viva Latinx, and Rafiki Wa Afrika.

=== Traditions ===
{{see also|Ohio Wesleyan Sweetly and strong}}

Many Ohio Wesleyan traditions originate from its early years. Monnett Weekend, beginning in 1896, welcomes female alumni, parents, and friends of the university. Events include a "People's Parade" with clowns, banners and marching, faculty lectures, Maypole dancing, Choral Arts Society, and an all-campus carnival.&lt;ref&gt;Murchland, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; It started as a girls' athletic fête held at the Monnett Athletic Club for Mothers Day. All events were held at the [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College|Monnett Campus]], where female students danced around the [[Maypole]], while men were barred. The men, in turn, developed their own tradition: they arrived at Monnett Campus early in the morning, and concealed themselves in trees to watch the festivities, discreetly.&lt;ref&gt;Tull, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, Ohio Wesleyan held its first ''Mock Convention'', which has recurred in every [[United States presidential election]] year since 1920.&lt;ref name="mockconvention"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/%7Emock2004/cygnus/rules.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060902092424/http://go.owu.edu/~mock2004/cygnus/rules.htm | archivedate = September 2, 2006| title = Mock Convention| publisher = Miller, Candi | accessdate = December 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to inform participants, students, faculty staff, and Ohio residents about the [[presidential nominating convention]],&lt;ref name="mockconvention2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/%7Emock2004/cygnus/news.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060902092552/http://go.owu.edu/~mock2004/cygnus/news.htm | archivedate = September 2, 2006 | title = 2004 Mock Convention Platform| publisher = Miller, Candi | accessdate = December 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; presidential candidate, and key issues in the upcoming election.&lt;ref name="mockconvention3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/%7Emock2004/cygnus/board.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060902092430/http://go.owu.edu/~mock2004/cygnus/board.htm | archivedate = September 2, 2006 | title = A Tradition Since 1917| publisher = Miller, Candi | accessdate = December 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1920s, all freshmen were required to wear "dinks", red caps with black brims and a black W on the front.&lt;ref&gt;Tull, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Disobedient students who refused to wear the "dink" were tossed into the ''Sulphur Spring'' (see later reference). This tradition ended in the 1960s. The freshman class of 1957 wore dinks for half the first semester.&lt;ref&gt;Murchland, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohio Wesleyan's [[Homecoming]] takes place in early October,&lt;ref name="homecomingOWU"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://connect2.owu.edu/ourtown/230.php| title = Homecoming Aims for Increased Student Involvement| publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University| accessdate = December 1, 2006| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111190100/http://connect2.owu.edu/ourtown/230.php| archivedate = January 11, 2008| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Ohio Wesleyan [[American football|football]] team plays one of its traditional rivals.

The ''President's Ball'', a recent gala organized by the college president, takes place on the first Saturday of December.&lt;ref name="presidentsball"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://welcome.owu.edu/questions9.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050207140214/http://welcome.owu.edu/questions9.html | archivedate = February 7, 2005| title = Ohio Wesleyan Campus Traditions | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other traditions include ''OWU vs. Denison'', which stages a "fierce" athletic rivalry between Ohio Wesleyan and [[Denison University]];&lt;ref name="archrival"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bishops.owu.edu/mlax.html| title = Men's Lacrosse
| publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '' Sagan Colloquium'', spanning the fall semester, recently expanded to include the spring semester, which consists of speeches focusing on an issue of concern to the [[liberal arts]];&lt;ref name="sagan"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.collegetoolkit.com/Colleges/Profile/204909.aspx| title = What Makes Us Unique|publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Orchesis'', an annual celebration of modern dance and the arts, which occurs at the end of the academic year. "Fresh-X" is an optional program for newly admitted students that occurs just before orientation in which students may choose between hiking, backpacking and other outdoor activities to make friends with their new classmates.&lt;ref name="fresh-x"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://fresh-x.owu.edu/| title = Welcome to "Fresh X"| publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University| accessdate = December 1, 2006| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061215033844/http://fresh-x.owu.edu/| archivedate = December 15, 2006| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus used to host two major musical events, ''Unity through Music'' and ''Springfest''. ''Unity through Music'' occurred once a year in the fall semester, and covered various musical styles in a [[carnival]] atmosphere, during the day; while, during the evening, a huge dance is held in the Hamilton-Williams Campus Center.&lt;ref name="unitythroughmusic"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/158.php | title = CPB Presents Unity Through Music | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = January 5, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111190034/http://connect2.owu.edu/newsandviews/158.php | archivedate = January 11, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Springfest, the second musical event, proceeded in mid-April and had featured well-known music groups such as [[Counting Crows]], [[The Roots]], [[Guster]], [[Ben Folds]], and [[Gym Class Heroes]]. It was organized by the Campus Programming Board, who have changed the name to "Bishop Bash," in an attempt to create more campus pride.&lt;ref name="springfesttradition"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://go.owu.edu/~owunews/021005/topstory1.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050228081451/http://go.owu.edu/~owunews/021005/topstory1.html | archivedate = February 28, 2005| title = Springfest funding in limbo | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University|accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Bash has hosted multiple different styled events, including [[Drake Bell]], [[Bo Burnham]], and most recently, in 2017, [[The Mowgli's]] and [[NeverShoutNever]].

A rock next to Hayes Hall has been part of the residential campus for the last 50 years, and students continually repaint it with [[graffiti]] and [[slogans]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web | url = http://owjl.owu.edu/description.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901202313/http://owjl.owu.edu/description.php | archivedate = September 1, 2006| title = Description| publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = December 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Housing ===
[[Image:PeaceandJusticeWinter.jpg|thumb|right|The House of Peace and Justice, a Small Living Unit on West Campus.]]
The university can house up to 1,600 students on campus.&lt;ref name = "housingcapacity"/&gt; First-year students are required to live on campus during their first two semesters. A lottery system matches second to fourth-year students with dormitories and another lottery system determines how many students are allowed to live in off-campus housing. Housing options include dormitories, small living units, fraternities, and cooperative housing.&lt;ref name="generalhousing"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://admission.owu.edu/reslife.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070303012234/http://admission.owu.edu/reslife.html | archivedate = March 3, 2007 | title = Residential Life | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson, Bashford, Stuyvesant, and Smith Halls are large mid-rise dormitories on campus. Welch Hall is designated as a "quiet" dorm for honors students.&lt;ref name="welch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admission.owu.edu/welch.html |title=Welch Hall |publisher=Ohio Wesleyan University |accessdate=January 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050211041933/http://admission.owu.edu/welch.html |archivedate=February 11, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes Hall is an all-female dorm.&lt;ref name="hayes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admission.owu.edu/hayes2.html |title=Hayes Hall |publisher=Ohio Wesleyan University |accessdate=January 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050920043146/http://admission.owu.edu/hayes2.html |archivedate=September 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:N24101750 30197695 4010.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Students converse on the back porch of The House of Peace and Justice, a Small Living Unit on West Campus.]]
Approximately 90 non-freshmen students live in Small Living Units (SLUs), which are [[cooperative|co-ops]] united voluntarily to meet shared economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations in democratically controlled houses. The houses allow students to live cooperatively with one another by sharing regularly scheduled house chores, participating in the decision process, and, in some, sharing the cooking duties. Each unit houses a group of 10–17 students, and is organized to promote a common theme, usually indicated by the co-op's name. As of the 2017–2018 academic year, the SLUs consist of The [[Peace]] and [[Justice]] House, The Citizens of the World House, The Sexuality and Gender Equality House, The House of Linguistic Diversity, The House of Spiritual Athletes, The [[Ecology|Tree]] House, and The Interfaith House. The University owns these houses; the co-ops, therefore, must follow the University's living policies. The co-ops do, however, elect their own members and do not have [[resident assistant|Resident Advisers]] or faculty in residence like other on-campus residence halls. They have a House Moderator who is selected by Residential Life and undergoes the same training as a Resident Advisor. At the end of each calendar year, every existing and potential co-op must submit a house proposal describing its plans for theme promotion for the next academic year. The University Housing office places co-ops in houses every year on a competitive basis.&lt;ref name="SLUprocess"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://connect2.owu.edu/ourtown/95.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901174509/http://connect2.owu.edu/ourtown/95.php| archivedate=September 1, 2006| title = SLUSH is Here: Apply to your Favorite SLU | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the school offers Theme Houses, which do not have to go through the renewal process. They include the Honors House (HoHo) and House of Black Culture.

Off-campus housing is available only to students residing in Delaware, OH while living with their spouse or direct family; 17% of students live off-campus.&lt;ref name="housingcapacity"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://reslife.owu.edu/housing.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901203805/http://reslife.owu.edu/housing.htm | archivedate = September 1, 2006 | title = Housing Options | publisher = Ohio Wesleyan University | accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="percentoffcampusliving"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drlife_3109_brief.php |title=Campus Housing |publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report |accessdate=December 3, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823191900/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drlife_3109_brief.php |archivedate=August 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most students assert Ohio Wesleyan's policy of off-campus housing as one of the "worst things" about Ohio Wesleyan because of the resulting shortage of the number of lottery tickets allowing people to live off due to the off-campus lottery cap.&lt;ref name="surveyoffcampusliving"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.collegeprowler.com/guide.asp/1427402604/index.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061101191135/http://www.collegeprowler.com/guide.asp/1427402604/index.html | archivedate = November 1, 2006 | title = Students tell it like it is | publisher = College Prowler Guide Book | accessdate = December 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohio Wesleyan participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] as a member of the [[North Coast Athletic Conference]] (NCAC). Known as the ''Battling Bishops'', Ohio Wesleyan competes in 25 varsity men's and women's sports.

Formal athletics at the college date to 1875, when the first football teams were organized to play against other institutions. In the late 1880s, Ohio Wesleyan had perhaps the strongest amateur baseball team in the state of Ohio behind the pitching of [[Phil Saylor|Phil "Lefty" Saylor]].  The school joined the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]] along with [[Oberlin College]], [[Kenyon College]], [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], and [[Case Western Reserve University|Case Western]] in 1902. In 1983, Ohio Wesleyan joined with nine other colleges in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania to create the North Coast Athletic Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northcoast.org/ncacintropage.html |title=About NCAC |publisher=NCAC |accessdate=October 31, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111230313/http://www.northcoast.org/ncacintropage.html |archivedate=November 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAC seeks to bring together a group of liberal arts institutions that value the primacy of the academic mission over the athletic one.&lt;ref&gt;Massa, Robert J.

'''Organizational economics''' (also referred to as ''economics of organization'') involves the use of [[economics|economic]] logic and methods to understand the existence, nature, design, and performance of [[organizations]], especially [[management|managed]] ones.

Organizational economics is primarily concerned with the obstacles to coordination of activities inside and between organizations (firms, alliances, institutions, and market as a whole).

Organizational economics is known for its contribution to and its use of:
* [[Transaction cost|Transaction cost theory]]: costs incurred to organize an activity, especially regarding research of information, bureaucracy, communication etc.
* [[Principal–agent problem|Agency theory]]: dilemmas connected to making decisions on behalf of, or that impact, another person or entity.
* [[Contract theory]]: ways economic actors use to construct contractual arrangements, generally in the presence of [[asymmetric information]].

In [[population dynamics]] and [[population ecology]], '''overshoot''' occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term [[carrying capacity]] of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thesenecaeffect.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/humans-in-ecological-overshoot-collapse-now-to-avoid-a-larger-catastrophe/|title=Humans in ecological overshoot: Collapse now to avoid a larger catastrophe|last=schreef|first=Nathan Surendran|date=2014-12-01|website=The Seneca Effect|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in [[population density]]. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed 'overshoot-and-collapse'.

Overshoot can occur due to lag effects.  [[Reproduction]] rates may remain high relative to the [[Mortality rate|death rate]].&lt;ref name="eaec"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology and Ecosystem Conservation |last=Schmitz |first=Oswald J. |author2= |year=2013 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=1597265985 |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ip7phSL199YC |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entire [[ecosystem]]s may be severely affected and sometimes reduced to less-[[Complexity|complex]] states due to prolonged overshoot.&lt;ref name="geap"&gt;{{cite book |title=Green Ethics and Philosophy: An A-to-Z Guide Volume 8 of The SAGE Reference Series on Green Society: Toward a Sustainable Future-Series Editor: Paul Robbins |chapter=Development and Ethical Sustainability |last=Howes |first=Michael |editor1-first=Julie |editor1-last=Newman |year=2011 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=1452266220 |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l7e9AwAAQBAJ |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The eradication of disease can trigger overshoot when a population suddenly exceeds the land's carrying capacity. An example of this occurred on the [[Horn of Africa]] when [[smallpox]] was eliminated. A region that had supported around 1 million [[pastoralists]] for centuries was suddenly expected to support 14 million people. The result was [[overgrazing]], which led to [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref name="lkp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21029-lowkey-projects-keep-horn-of-africa-famine-at-bay.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news |title=Low-key projects keep Horn of Africa famine at bay |author=Debora MacKenzie |accessdate=11 October 2011 |date=10 October 2011 |work=NewScientist |publisher=Reed Business Information }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring human overshoot==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
Globally, we can measure how much the human economy demands against what the biosphere can renew.&lt;ref&gt;Mathis Wackernagel, Niels B. Schulz, Diana Deumling, Alejandro Callejas Linares, Martin Jenkins, Valerie Kapos, Chad Monfreda, Jonathan Loh, Norman Myers Richard Norgaard and Jørgen Rander (May 16, 2002). [http://www.pnas.org/content/99/14/9266.full.pdf+html?sid=1dc62d01-1f10-4ef5-a47c-af92a54dacb2 Tracking the ecological overshoot of the human economy]. Retrieved 2 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; One accounting approach is the [[ecological footprint]]. Footprint accounting measures the demand on [[biocapacity]], i.e., area of biologically productive land and water required to produce the ecological services (including resource regeneration and waste absorption) for a given population. Biocapacity encompasses the biologically productive capacity of all of the planet's surface areas – cropland, grazing land, forest, fresh water etc. Footprint accounts include non-renewable resources like fossil fuels and other minerals in as far as their use puts a demand on biocapacity. Some demands are difficult to measure and are not included in the accounts – hence the results tend to underestimate dependency. Ecological footprint and biocapacity are measured in global hectares (hectares with world average biological productivity). Thus increased productivity would reduce dependency; while increased population or consumption per head would increase it.

The percentage of an area's footprint supported from its renewable resources shows its overall resource dependence within or above its areas' regeneration rate. A percentage over 100 percent indicates local overuse or net dependence on ecosystems elsewhere.  Similarly, the percentage of an area’s population supported from its renewable resources is its sustainable population at current consumption levels with current technology; the remaining percentage is its overshoot population. A country's biocapacity deficit increases as either their population or their per capita consumption grows; and faster if both grow.

The '''Owatonna Art Education Project''' was a project in [[Owatonna, Minnesota]] in the United States, intended to promote the production of new knowledge through science, establish standards of excellence in education, and provide opportunities for self-improvement and visual enhancement. It was started 1933 and continued until 1938. The findings were published in 1944.

'''Photosynthesis''' is a process used by plants and other organisms to [[Energy transformation|convert]] [[Light|light energy]] into [[chemical energy]] that can later be [[cellular respiration|released]] to fuel the organisms' activities. This chemical energy is stored in [[carbohydrates|carbohydrate molecules]], such as [[sugar]]s, which are synthesized from [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] – hence the name ''photosynthesis'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wiktionary:φῶς|φῶς]], ''phōs'', "light", and [[wiktionary:σύνθεσις|σύνθεσις]], ''synthesis'', "putting together".&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web |title=photosynthesis |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=photosynthesis&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSJ1&gt;{{LSJ|fw{{=}}s2|φῶς|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSJ2&gt;{{LSJ|su/nqesis|σύνθεσις|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, [[oxygen]] is also released as a waste product. Most [[plant]]s, most [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]] perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called [[photoautotroph]]s. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the [[atmospheric oxygen|oxygen content]] of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for [[life|life on Earth]].&lt;ref name=bryantfrigaard&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bryant DA, Frigaard NU |title=Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated |journal=[[Trends in Microbiology]] |volume=14 |issue=11 |pages=488–96 |date=Nov 2006 |pmid=16997562 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2006.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by [[protein]]s called [[photosynthetic reaction centre|reaction centres]] that contain green [[chlorophyll]] pigments. In plants, these proteins are held inside [[organelle]]s called [[chloroplast]]s, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the [[plasma membrane]]. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip [[electron]]s from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADPH) and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the "energy currency" of cells.

In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, long-term energy storage in the form of sugars is produced by a subsequent sequence of {{nobreak|light-independent}} reactions called the [[Calvin cycle]]; some bacteria use different mechanisms, such as the [[reverse Krebs cycle]], to achieve the same end. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is [[carbon fixation|incorporated]] into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as [[ribulose bisphosphate]] (RuBP).&lt;ref name="isbn0-321-73975-2"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Reece J, Urry L, Cain M, Wasserman S, Minorsky P, Jackson R |title=Biology |edition=International |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=978-0-321-73975-9 |pages=235, 244 |quote=This initial incorporation of carbon into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation.|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then [[biological reductant|reduced]] and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as [[glucose]].

==Overview==
[[File:Simple photosynthesis overview.svg|thumb|Photosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and fixes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into sugar.]]
Photosynthetic organisms are [[photoautotroph]]s, which means that they are able to [[Chemical synthesis|synthesize]] food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis; [[photoheterotroph]]s use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon.&lt;ref name=bryantfrigaard/&gt; In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This is called ''oxygenic photosynthesis'' and is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in [[plants]], [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]], the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. There are also many varieties of [[anoxygenic photosynthesis]], used mostly by certain types of bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen.

Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called [[carbon fixation]]; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into [[carbohydrate]]. Carbon fixation is an [[endothermic]] [[redox]] reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of [[cellular respiration]]: while photosyntesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrate, cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrate or other [[nutrient]]s to carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism's [[metabolism]]. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different [[cellular compartment]]s.

The general [[chemical equation|equation]] for photosynthesis as first proposed by [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis van Niel]] is therefore:&lt;ref name = "Whitmarsh_1999"&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Singhal GS, Renger G, Sopory SK, Irrgang KD, Govindjee | title = Concepts in Photobiology: Photosynthesis and Photomorphogenesis | chapter = Chapter 2: The Basic Photosynthetic Process | vauthors = Whitmarsh J, Govindjee | year = 1999 | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Boston | isbn = 978-0-7923-5519-9 | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=dqSuoOtDM1cC&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=photosynthesis%20reaction%20equation%20generalized&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=photosynthesis%20reaction%20equation%20generalized&amp;f=false | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{underset|carbon&lt;br/&gt;dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{underset|electron donor|2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A}} + {{underset|light energy|[[photons]]}} → {{underset|[[carbohydrate]]|[&amp;#8203;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;#8203;]}} + {{underset|oxidized&lt;br/&gt;electron&lt;br/&gt;donor|2A}} + {{underset|water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}

Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is:
: {{underset|carbon&lt;br/&gt;dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{underset|water|2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}} + {{underset|light energy|photons}} → {{underset|carbohydrate|[CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]}} + {{underset|oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{underset|water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}

This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the [[#Light-dependent reactions|light-dependent reaction]] and a product of the [[#Light-independent reactions|light-independent reaction]], but canceling ''n'' water molecules from each side gives the net equation:

: {{underset|carbon&lt;br/&gt;dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{underset| water |H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}} + {{underset|light energy|photons}} → {{underset|carbohydrate|[CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]}} + {{underset| oxygen |O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}

Other processes substitute other compounds (such as [[arsenite]]) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to [[arsenate]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Anaerobic Photosynthesis'', [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]], '''86''', 33, August 18, 2008, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The equation for this reaction is:
: {{underset|carbon&lt;br/&gt;dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{underset|&lt;br/&gt;arsenite|(AsO{{su|b=3|p=3−}})}} + {{underset|light energy|photons}} → {{underset|&lt;br/&gt;arsenate|(AsO{{su|b=4|p=3−}})}} + {{underset|carbon&lt;br/&gt;monoxide|CO}}(used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)&lt;ref name="pmid18703741"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kulp TR, Hoeft SE, Asao M, Madigan MT, Hollibaugh JT, Fisher JC, Stolz JF, Culbertson CW, Miller LG, Oremland RS | title = Arsenic(III) fuels anoxygenic photosynthesis in hot spring biofilms from Mono Lake, California | journal = Science | volume = 321 | issue = 5891 | pages = 967–70 | date = Aug 2008 | pmid = 18703741 | doi = 10.1126/science.1160799 | bibcode = 2008Sci...321..967K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, ''light-dependent reactions'' or ''light reactions'' capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]]. During the second stage, the ''light-independent reactions'' use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide.

Most organisms that utilize oxygenic photosynthesis use [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] for the light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave [[infrared]] or, more specifically, far-red radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Scientists discover unique microbe in California's largest lake | url = http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-news/Scientists-discover-unique-microbe-in-Californias-largest-lake-203-1/ | accessdate = 2009-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some [[archaea]] use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals. The [[bacteriorhodopsin]] changes its configuration in response to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L8DHHSO2RFsC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=bacteriorhodopsin+photosynthesis+evolved+separately Plants: Diversity and Evolution], page 14, Martin Ingrouille, Bill Eddie&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolutionarynovelty.blogspot.co.uk/2008/12/opsins-amazing-evolutionary-convergence.html Evolution of Photosynthesis]&lt;/ref&gt;

In photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in [[cell membrane]]s. In its simplest form, this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself.&lt;ref name="pmid17055774"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tavano CL, Donohue TJ |title=Development of the bacterial photosynthetic apparatus |journal=[[Current Opinion in Microbiology]] |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=625–31 |date=Dec 2006 |pmid=17055774 |pmc=2765710 |doi=10.1016/j.mib.2006.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called [[thylakoid]]s,&lt;ref name=Mullineaux1999/&gt; or bunched up into round [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] called ''intracytoplasmic membranes''.&lt;ref name="pmid17895378"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sener MK, Olsen JD, Hunter CN, Schulten K |title=Atomic-level structural and functional model of a bacterial photosynthetic membrane vesicle |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=104 |issue=40 |pages=15723–8 |date=Oct 2007 |pmid=17895378 |pmc=2000399 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0706861104 |bibcode=2007PNAS..10415723S }}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures can fill most of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb.&lt;ref name=Mullineaux1999&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mullineaux CW |year=1999 |title=The thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria: structure, dynamics and function |journal=[[Australian Journal of Plant Physiology]] |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=671–677 |doi=10.1071/PP99027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in [[organelle]]s called [[chloroplast]]s. A typical [[plant cell]] contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and [[peripheral membrane protein]] complexes of the photosynthetic system.

Plants absorb light primarily using the [[pigment]] [[chlorophyll]]. The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected which is the reason that most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments such as [[carotene]]s and [[xanthophyll]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-13-250882-6"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Campbell NA, Williamson B, Heyden RJ |title=Biology Exploring Life |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-13-250882-7 |url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae also use chlorophyll, but various other pigments are present, such as [[phycocyanin]], [[carotene]]s, and [[xanthophyll]]s in [[green algae]], [[phycoerythrin]] in [[red algae]] (rhodophytes) and [[fucoxanthin]] in [[brown algae]] and [[diatoms]] resulting in a wide variety of colors.

These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins. In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together. Such a combination of proteins is also called a [[light-harvesting complex]].

Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, the majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called [[leaf|leaves]]. Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and [[arid]]ity, such as many [[Euphorbia]] and [[cactus]] species, have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the [[mesophyll tissue|mesophyll]], can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant [[wax]]y [[Plant cuticle|cuticle]] that protects the leaf from excessive [[evaporation]] of water and decreases the absorption of [[ultraviolet]] or [[blue]] [[light]] to reduce [[heat]]ing. The transparent [[Leaf#Epidermis|epidermis]] layer allows light to pass through to the [[Mesophyll tissue|palisade]] mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place.

==Light-dependent reactions==
[[File:Thylakoid membrane 3.svg|thumb|450px|right|Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane]]
{{Main|Light-dependent reactions}}
In the [[light-dependent reactions]], one molecule of the [[pigment]] [[chlorophyll]] absorbs one [[photon]] and loses one [[electron]]. This electron is passed to a modified form of chlorophyll called [[pheophytin]], which passes the electron to a [[quinone]] molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an [[electron transport chain]] that leads to the ultimate reduction of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADP]] to [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]]. In addition, this creates a [[Electrochemical gradient|proton gradient]] (energy gradient) across the [[chloroplast membrane]], which is used by [[ATP synthase]] in the synthesis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called [[Photodissociation|photolysis]], which releases a [[dioxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) molecule as a waste product.

The overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:&lt;ref name="Raven"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Raven PH, Evert RF, Eichhorn SE |title=Biology of Plants |edition=7th |publisher=[[W. H. Freeman and Company]] |year=2005 |location=New York |pages=124–127 |isbn=978-0-7167-1007-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 ADP + 3 P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + light → 2 NADPH + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 ATP + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Not all [[wavelength]]s of light can support photosynthesis. The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of [[accessory pigment]]s present. For example, in green plants, the [[action spectrum]] resembles the [[absorption spectrum]] for [[chlorophyll]]s and [[carotenoid]]s with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum  is blue-green light, which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above ground green plants. The non-absorbed part of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|light spectrum]] is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms.

===Z scheme===
[[File:Z-scheme.png|thumb|675px|center|The "Z scheme"]]
In plants, [[light-dependent reaction]]s occur in the [[thylakoid membrane]]s of the [[chloroplast]]s where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic.

In the non-cyclic reaction, the [[photon]]s are captured in the light-harvesting [[antenna complex]]es of [[Photosystem|photosystem II]] by [[chlorophyll]] and other [[accessory pigments]] (see diagram at right). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex frees an electron by a process called [[photoinduced charge separation]]. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That freed electron is transferred to the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an [[Electron transfer chain|electron transport chain]] (the so-called '''''Z-scheme''''' shown in the diagram), it initially functions to generate a [[chemiosmotic potential]] by pumping proton cations (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An [[ATP synthase]] enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during [[photophosphorylation]], whereas [[NADPH]] is a product of the terminal [[redox]] reaction in the ''Z-scheme''. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in [[Photosystem I]]. There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that [[photosystem]]. The electron is then passed along a chain of [[electron acceptor]]s to which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the co-enzyme NADP with a H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADPH (which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends.

The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic, but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name ''cyclic reaction''.

===Water photolysis===
{{Main|Photodissociation|Oxygen evolution}}
The NADPH is the main [[reducing agent]] produced by chloroplasts, which then goes on to provide a source of energetic electrons in other cellular reactions. Its production leaves chlorophyll in photosystem I with a deficit of electrons (chlorophyll has been oxidized), which must be balanced by some other reducing agent that will supply the missing electron. The excited electrons lost from chlorophyll from [[photosystem I]] are supplied from the electron transport chain by [[plastocyanin]]. However, since [[photosystem II]] is the first step of the ''Z-scheme'', an external source of electrons is required to reduce its oxidized '''chlorophyll ''a''''' molecules. The source of electrons in green-plant and cyanobacterial photosynthesis is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by four successive charge-separation reactions by photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic [[oxygen]] and four [[hydrogen]] ions; the electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active [[tyrosine]] residue that then reduces the oxidized chlorophyll ''a'' (called P680) that serves as the primary light-driven electron donor in the photosystem II reaction center. That photo receptor is in effect reset and is then able to repeat the absorption of another photon and the release of another photo-dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is [[catalysis|catalyzed]] in photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four [[manganese]] ions and a calcium ion; this [[oxygen-evolving complex]] binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction (Dolai's S-state diagrams).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Umasankar | last = Dolai | name-list-format = vanc | title = Chemical Scheme of Water-Splitting Process during Photosynthesis by the Way of Experimental Analysis | journal = IOSR Journal of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | year = 2017 | pages = 65–67 | doi = 10.9790/3008-1206026567 | doi-broken-date = 2018-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Photosystem II is the only known biological [[enzyme]] that carries out this oxidation of water. The hydrogen ions released contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen for [[cellular respiration]], including photosynthetic organisms.&lt;ref name="VK Yachandra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/~vkyachan/index.html |title=Yachandra Group Home page}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18250316"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pushkar Y, Yano J, Sauer K, Boussac A, Yachandra VK |title=Structural changes in the Mn4Ca cluster and the mechanism of photosynthetic water splitting |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=105 |issue=6 |pages=1879–84 |date=Feb 2008 |pmid=18250316 |pmc=2542863 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0707092105 |bibcode=2008PNAS..105.1879P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Light-independent reactions==

===Calvin cycle===
{{Main|Light-independent reactions|Carbon fixation}}
In the [[light-independent reactions|light-independent]] (or "dark") reactions, the [[enzyme]] [[RuBisCO]] captures [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and, in a process called the [[Calvin cycle]], it uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;{{rp|128}}

:3 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

[[File:Calvin-cycle4.svg|thumb|right|400px|Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation]]
[[Carbon fixation]] produces the intermediate three-carbon sugar product, which is then converted into the final carbohydrate products. The simple carbon sugars produced by photosynthesis are then used in the forming of other organic compounds, such as the building material [[cellulose]], the precursors for [[lipid]] and [[amino acid]] biosynthesis, or as a fuel in [[cellular respiration]]. The latter occurs not only in plants but also in [[animal]]s when the energy from plants is passed through a [[food chain]].

The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which [[carbon dioxide]] combines with a five-carbon sugar, [[ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate]], to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound, [[glycerate 3-phosphate]], also known as 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]] produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]]. This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde ([[PGAL]]) or, more generically, as [[triose]] phosphate. Most (5 out of 6 molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced is used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus "recycled" often condense to form [[hexose]] phosphates, which ultimately yield [[sucrose]], [[starch]] and [[cellulose]]. The sugars produced during carbon [[metabolism]] yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of [[amino acids]] and [[lipids]].

===Carbon concentrating mechanisms===

====On land====
[[File:HatchSlackpathway2.svg|thumb|right|400px|Overview of [[C4 carbon fixation]]]]
In hot and dry conditions, plants close their [[stomata]] to prevent water loss. Under these conditions, {{co2}} will decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of [[photorespiration]] by the [[oxygenase]] activity of [[Rubisco|ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase]] and decrease in carbon fixation. Some plants have [[evolution|evolved]] mechanisms to increase the {{co2}} concentration in the leaves under these conditions.&lt;ref name="williamsjohnston"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams BP, Johnston IG, Covshoff S, Hibberd JM |title=Phenotypic landscape inference reveals multiple evolutionary paths to C4 photosynthesis |journal=[[eLife]] |volume=2 |pages=e00961 |date=September 2013 |pmid=24082995 |doi=10.7554/eLife.00961 |pmc=3786385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|C4 carbon fixation}}

Plants that use the [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule [[Phosphoenolpyruvate|phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)]], a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called [[Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase|PEP carboxylase]], creating the four-carbon organic acid [[oxaloacetic acid]]. Oxaloacetic acid or [[malate]] synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized [[bundle sheath]] cells where the enzyme [[RuBisCO]] and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where {{co2}} released by [[decarboxylation]] of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon [[3-phosphoglyceric acid]]s. The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases {{co2}} fixation and, thus, the [[photosynthetic capacity]] of the leaf.&lt;ref name="Taiz"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Taiz L, Geiger E |title=Plant Physiology |publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] |year=2006 |edition=4th |isbn=978-0-87893-856-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{c4}} plants can produce more sugar than {{c3}} plants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many important crop plants are {{c4}} plants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants]] because the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle. Over 90% of plants use {{c3}} carbon fixation, compared to 3% that use {{c4}} carbon fixation;&lt;ref name="sage"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Monson RK, Sage RF |title=C₄ plant biology |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |location=Boston |year=1999 |pages=551–580 |chapter=The Taxonomic Distribution of C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Photosynthesis |isbn=978-0-12-614440-6 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=H7Wv9ZImW-QC&amp;pg=PA551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the evolution of {{c4}} in over 60 plant lineages makes it a striking example of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name="williamsjohnston"/&gt;

{{Main|CAM photosynthesis}}

[[Xerophytes]], such as [[cacti]] and most [[succulents]], also use PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called [[CAM photosynthesis|Crassulacean acid metabolism]] (CAM). In contrast to {{c4}} metabolism, which ''spatially'' separates the {{co2}} fixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle, CAM ''temporally'' separates these two processes. CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from {{c3}} plants, and fix the {{co2}} at night, when their stomata are open. CAM plants store the {{co2}} mostly in the form of [[malic acid]] via carboxylation of [[phosphoenolpyruvate]] to oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to malate. Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases {{co2}} inside the leaves, thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by RuBisCO. Sixteen thousand species of plants use CAM.&lt;ref name="pmid11886877"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dodd AN, Borland AM, Haslam RP, Griffiths H, Maxwell K |title=Crassulacean acid metabolism: plastic, fantastic |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Botany]] |volume=53 |issue=369 |pages=569–80 |date=Apr 2002 |pmid=11886877 |doi=10.1093/jexbot/53.369.569 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In water====
[[Cyanobacteria]] possess [[carboxysome]]s, which increase the concentration of {{co2}} around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis. An enzyme, [[carbonic anhydrase]], located within the carboxysome releases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the dissolved hydrocarbonate ions (HCO{{su|b=3|p=−}}). Before the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diffuses out it is quickly sponged up by RuBisCO, which is concentrated within the carboxysomes. HCO{{su|b=3|p=−}} ions are made from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein. They cannot cross the membrane as they are charged, and within the cytosol they turn back into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase. This causes the HCO{{su|b=3|p=−}} ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Badger MR, Price GD |title=CO2 concentrating mechanisms in cyanobacteria: molecular components, their diversity and evolution |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Botany]] |volume=54 |issue=383 |pages=609–22 |date=Feb 2003 |pmid=12554704 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erg076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pyrenoid]]s in [[algae]] and [[hornwort]]s also act to concentrate {{co2}} around rubisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1139/b98-074 |volume=76|issue=6|pages=1052–1071|vauthors=Badger MR, Andrews JT, Whitney SM, Ludwig M, Yellowlees DC, Leggat W, Price GD |title=The diversity and coevolution of Rubisco, plastids, pyrenoids, and chloroplast-based CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-concentrating mechanisms in algae |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Botany]] |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual plants' photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted, light intensity, temperature and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and can vary from 0.1% to 8%.&lt;ref name="urlWhat is Photosynthesis"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.life.illinois.edu/govindjee/whatisit.htm | title = What is Photosynthesis | vauthors = Govindjee R | website = | publisher = Biology at Illinois }}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s convert light into [[electric energy]] at an efficiency of approximately 6–20% for mass-produced panels, and above 40% in laboratory devices.

Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light absorbed by the leaf. But analysis of chlorophyll-fluorescence, P700- and P515-absorbance and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about e.g. the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assimilation rates. With some instruments even wavelength-dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schreiber U, Klughammer C, Kolbowski J |title=Assessment of wavelength-dependent parameters of photosynthetic electron transport with a new type of multi-color PAM chlorophyll fluorometer|journal=Photosynthesis Research|date=2012|volume=113|issue=1–3|pages=127–144|doi=10.1007/s11120-012-9758-1|pmid=22729479|pmc=3430841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A phenomenon known as [[quantum walk]] increases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly. In the photosynthetic cell of an algae, bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called [[chromophore]]s arranged in an antenna-shaped structure named a photocomplex. When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a [[quasiparticle]] referred to as an [[exciton]], which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form that makes it accessible for the cell's metabolism. The exciton's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously "choose" the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time. Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances, due to obstacles in the form of destructive interference that come into play. These obstacles cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic "hop". The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.&lt;ref name="urlBBC News - Plants seen doing quantum physics"&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-22996054 | title = Plants 'seen doing quantum physics' | journal = BBC News | vauthors = Palmer J | date = 21 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlQuantum Biology: Better Living Through Quantum Mechanics - The Nature of Reality"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2014/03/quantum-life/ | title = Quantum Biology: Better Living Through Quantum Mechanics - The Nature of Reality | vauthors = Lloyd S | date = 10 March 2014 | publisher = Nova: PBS Online, WGBH Boston }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23788794"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hildner R, Brinks D, Nieder JB, Cogdell RJ, van Hulst NF | title = Quantum coherent energy transfer over varying pathways in single light-harvesting complexes | journal = Science | volume = 340 | issue = 6139 | pages = 1448–51 | date = Jun 2013 | pmid = 23788794 | doi = 10.1126/science.1235820 | bibcode = 2013Sci...340.1448H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
{{Life timeline}}
{{main|Evolution of photosynthesis}}
Early photosynthetic systems, such as those in [[Green sulfur bacteria|green]] and [[Purple sulfur bacteria|purple sulfur]] and [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|green]] and [[purple bacteria|purple nonsulfur bacteria]], are thought to have been [[Anoxygenic photosynthesis|anoxygenic]], and used various other molecules as [[electron donor]]s rather than water. Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used [[hydrogen]] and [[sulfur]] as electron donors. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various [[amino acid|amino]] and other [[organic acid]]s as an electron donor. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules. The use of these molecules is consistent with the geological evidence that Earth's early atmosphere was highly [[Reducing environment|reducing]] at [[History of Earth#Hadean and Archaean|that time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gale|first1=Joseph|name-list-format=vanc|title=Astrobiology of Earth : The emergence, evolution and future of life on a planet in turmoil|date=2009|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191548352|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossils of what are thought to be [[Protein filament|filamentous]] photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Katharine | last = Davis | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18424671.600-photosynthesis-got-a-really-early-start.html | title = Photosynthesis got a really early start | journal = New Scientist | date = 2 October 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | first = Rowan | last = Hooper | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19125654.200-revealing-the-dawn-of-photosynthesis.html | title = Revealing the dawn of photosynthesis | journal = New Scientist | date = 19 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies, reported in March 2018, also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="ELSVR-20180306"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caredona |first=Tanai |title=Early Archean origin of heterodimeric Photosystem I |url=https://www.heliyon.com/article/e00548 |date=6 March 2018 |journal=[[Elsevier]] |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e00548 |doi=10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e00548 |pmid=29560463 |pmc=5857716 |accessdate=23 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AST-20180307"&gt;{{cit web |last=Howard |first=Victoria |title=Photosynthesis Originated A Billion Years Earlier Than We Thought, Study Shows.|url=https://www.astrobio.net/also-in-news/photosynthesis-originated-billion-years-earlier-thought-study-shows/ |date=7 March 2018 |work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] |accessdate=23 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source of [[oxygen]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] derives from [[Oxygen evolution|oxygenic photosynthesis]], and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the [[oxygen catastrophe]]. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in [[cyanobacteria]], became important during the [[Paleoproterozoic]] era around 2 billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor, which is [[Redox|oxidized]] to molecular oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}) in the [[photosynthetic reaction center]].

===Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts===
[[File:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|150px|left|Plant cells with visible chloroplasts (from a moss, ''[[Plagiomnium affine]]'')]]
Several groups of animals have formed [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in [[coral]]s, [[sponge]]s and [[sea anemone]]s. It is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple [[body plan]]s and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Venn AA, Loram JE, Douglas AE | title = Photosynthetic symbioses in animals | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 1069–80 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18267943 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erm328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a few marine [[Mollusca|mollusk]]s ''[[Elysia viridis]]'' and ''[[Elysia chlorotica]]'' also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies. This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time.&lt;ref name="pmid10806222"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rumpho ME, Summer EJ, Manhart JR | title = Solar-powered sea slugs.

An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with [[cyanobacteria|photosynthetic bacteria]], including a circular [[chromosome]], prokaryotic-type [[ribosome]], and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center.&lt;ref name="pmid9914199"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Douglas SE | title = Plastid evolution: origins, diversity, trends | journal = Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 655–61 | date = Dec 1998 | pmid = 9914199 | doi = 10.1016/S0959-437X(98)80033-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17600460"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reyes-Prieto A, Weber AP, Bhattacharya D | title = The origin and establishment of the plastid in algae and plants | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 41 | issue =  | pages = 147–68 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17600460 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.41.110306.130134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[endosymbiotic theory]] suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by [[endocytosis]]) by early [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells to form the first [[plant]] cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], chloroplasts possess their own DNA, separate from the [[nuclear DNA]] of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those found in [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name="pmid12620099"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raven JA, Allen JF | title = Genomics and chloroplast evolution: what did cyanobacteria do for plants? | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | page = 209 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12620099 | pmc = 153454 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2003-4-3-209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA in chloroplasts codes for [[redox]] proteins such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers.

===Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis===
The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once, in a [[Common descent|common ancestor]] of extant [[cyanobacteria]]. The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450–2320 million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomitani A, Knoll AH, Cavanaugh CM, Ohno T | title = The evolutionary diversification of cyanobacteria: molecular-phylogenetic and paleontological perspectives | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 14 | pages = 5442–7 | date = Apr 2006 | pmid = 16569695 | pmc = 1459374 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0600999103 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/103/14/5442.abstract | bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.5442T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanofr.html |title=Cyanobacteria: Fossil Record |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Earth's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Alison | name-list-format = vanc | title = Plant biology | publisher = Garland Science | location = New York, NY | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0815340256 | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Available evidence from geobiological studies of [[Archean]] (&gt;2500 Ma) [[sedimentary rock]]s indicates that life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered.

[[Cyanobacteria]] remained the principal [[primary producers]] of oxygen throughout the [[Proterozoic Eon]] (2500–543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of [[nitrogen fixation]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Green algae]] joined blue-green algae as the major primary producers of oxygen on [[Continental shelf|continental shelves]] near the end of the [[Proterozoic]], but it was only with the [[Mesozoic]] (251–66 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did the [[primary production]] of oxygen in marine shelf waters take modern form.

==Discovery==
Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century.

[[Jan Baptist van Helmont|Jan van Helmont]] began the research of the process in the mid-17th century when he carefully measured the [[mass]] of the soil used by a plant and the mass of the plant as it grew. After noticing that the soil mass changed very little, he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water, the only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially accurate — much of the gained mass also comes from carbon dioxide as well as water. However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant's [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] comes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself.

[[Joseph Priestley]], a chemist and minister, discovered that, when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar, and burned a candle in it (which gave off CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax. He further discovered that a mouse could similarly [[Breathing|"injure"]] air. He then showed that the air that had been "injured" by the candle and the mouse could be restored by a plant.

In 1778, [[Jan Ingenhousz]], repeated Priestley's experiments. He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours.

In 1796, [[Jean Senebier]], a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light. Soon afterward, [[Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure]] showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by which photosynthesis is used to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined.

[[Cornelis Van Niel]] made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis. By studying [[purple sulfur bacteria]] and green bacteria he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent [[redox]] reaction, in which hydrogen [[Reducing agent|reduces]] (donates its &lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; electron to) carbon dioxide.

[[Robert Emerson (scientist)|Robert Emerson]] discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths, the other up to 700&amp;nbsp;nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll "a", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll "a" with most of the available chlorophyll "b", among other pigment. These include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta are equal in both the PSII and PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII system, which in turn powers the photochemistry.&lt;ref name="ps"/&gt;
[[File:Melvin Calvin.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Melvin Calvin]] works in his photosynthesis laboratory.]]

[[Robin Hill (biochemist)|Robert Hill]] thought that a complex of reactions consisting of an intermediate to cytochrome b&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (now a plastoquinone), another is from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by plastoquinone, which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f for it is a sufficient reductant. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water, were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939. He showed that isolated [[chloroplast]]s give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like [[iron]] [[oxalate]], [[ferricyanide]] or [[benzoquinone]] after exposure to light. The Hill reaction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker DA | title = 'And whose bright presence' - an appreciation of Robert Hill and his reaction | journal = Photosynthesis Research | volume = 73 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 51–4 | year = 2002 | pmid = 16245102 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1023/A:1020479620680 | url = http://www.life.uiuc.edu/govindjee/Part1/Part1_Walker.pdf | authorlink1 = David Alan Walker }}&lt;/ref&gt; is as follows:

:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 A + (light, chloroplasts) → 2 AH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

where A is the electron acceptor. Therefore, in light, the electron acceptor is reduced and oxygen is evolved.

[[Sam Ruben|Samuel Ruben]] and [[Martin Kamen]] used [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] to determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water.

[[Melvin Calvin]] and [[Andrew Benson]], along with [[James Bassham]], elucidated the path of carbon assimilation (the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle) in plants. The carbon reduction cycle is known as the [[Calvin cycle]], which ignores the contribution of Bassham and Benson. Many scientists refer to the cycle as the Calvin-Benson Cycle, Benson-Calvin, and some even call it the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (or CBB) Cycle.

[[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientist [[Rudolph A. Marcus]] was able to discover the function and significance of the electron transport chain.

[[Otto Heinrich Warburg]] and [[Dean Burk]] discovered the I-quantum photosynthesis reaction that splits the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, activated by the respiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1931/warburg.html Otto Warburg – Biography]. Nobelprize.org (1970-08-01). Retrieved on 2011-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, first experimental evidence for the existence of [[photophosphorylation]] ''in vivo'' was presented by [[Otto Kandler]] using intact ''[[Chlorella]]'' cells and interpreting his findings as light-dependent [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] formation.&lt;ref name="Kandler_1950"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kandler|first=Otto|author-link=Otto Kandler|year=1950|title=Über die Beziehungen zwischen Phosphathaushalt und Photosynthese.

[[Louis N.M. Duysens]] and [[Jan Amesz]] discovered that chlorophyll a will absorb one light, oxidize cytochrome f, chlorophyll a (and other pigments) will absorb another light, but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome, stating the two light reactions are in series.

===Development of the concept===
In 1893, [[Charles Reid Barnes]] proposed two terms, ''photosyntax'' and ''photosynthesis'', for the biological process of ''synthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid, in the presence of chlorophyll, under the influence of light''. Over time, the term ''photosynthesis'' came into common usage as the term of choice. Later discovery of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gest | first1 = Howard | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2002 | title = History of the word photosynthesis and evolution of its definition | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1020419417954#| journal = Photosynthesis Research | volume = 73 | issue = 1–3| pages = 7–10 | doi=10.1023/A:1020419417954| pmid = 16245098 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===C3 : C4 photosynthesis research===
After   WWII at late 1940 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the details of photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists [[Melvin Calvin]], Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calvin|first=Melvin| name-list-format = vanc |date=July 1989|title=Forty years of photosynthesis and related activities|url=|journal=Photosynthesis Research|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–16|doi=10.1007/BF00047170|pmid=24424488|access-date=|doi-broken-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pathway of CO2 fixation by the algae ''Chlorella'' in a fraction of a second in light resulted in a 3 carbon molecule called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). For that original and ground-breaking work, a [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] was awarded to Melvin Calvin in 1961. In parallel, plant physiologists studied leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 u mole CO2/square metere.sec., with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants having the same photosynthetic capacities that were light saturated at less than 50% of sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verduin J | year = 1953 | title = A table of photosynthesis rates under optimal, near natural conditions. | journal = Am.

==Factors==

[[File:Leaf 1 web.jpg|thumb|The [[leaf]] is the primary site of photosynthesis in plants.]]
There are three main factors affecting photosynthesis{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} and several corollary factors. The three main are:{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}
*Light [[irradiance]] and [[wavelength]]
*[[Carbon dioxide]] [[concentration]]
*[[Temperature]].

Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the amount of [[leaf]] area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the [[chloroplast]]s to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Chapin159"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology | first1 = F. Stuart | last1 = Chapin | first2 = Pamela A. | last2 = Matson | first3 = Harold A. | last3 = Mooney | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Springer | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-387-95443-1 | location = New York | pages = 97–104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature===
{{See also|PI curve|label 1=PI (photosynthesis-irradiance) curve}}
[[File:Chlorophyll ab spectra-en.svg|thumb|[[Absorbance]] spectra of free chlorophyll ''a'' (&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;) and ''b'' (&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;) in a solvent. The '''action spectra''' of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified ''in vivo'' depending on specific pigment-protein interactions.]]
The process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere, and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jones | first1 = Hamlyn G. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Plants and Microclimate: a Quantitative Approach to Environmental Plant Physiology | date = 2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | isbn = 978-0-521-27959-8 | edition = Third }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable, with both time and space.

In the early 20th century, [[Frederick Blackman]] and [[Gabrielle Matthaei]] investigated the effects of light intensity ([[irradiance]]) and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation.
*At constant temperature, the rate of carbon assimilation varies with irradiance, increasing as the irradiance increases, but reaching a plateau at higher irradiance.
*At low irradiance, increasing the temperature has little influence on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant high irradiance, the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased.

&lt;!--[[File:carbon a t.jpg|thumb|Carbon assimilation at a constant temperature.]] unsourced graph with swapped axis titles --&gt;
These two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known that, in general, [[photochemical]] reactions are not affected by [[temperature]]. However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation. These are the [[Light-dependent reaction|light-dependent 'photochemical']] temperature-independent stage, and the [[Light-independent reaction|light-independent, temperature-dependent]] stage. Second, Blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of [[limiting factor]]s. Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light. Cyanobacteria, which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments. To combat this problem, a series of proteins with different pigments surround the reaction center. This unit is called a [[phycobilisome]].{{clarify|date=November 2015}}

===Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration===
[[File:Photorespiration.svg|thumb|350px|Photorespiration]]
As carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by the [[light-independent reaction]]s increases until limited by other factors. [[RuBisCO]], the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions, has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the concentration of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will [[Carbon fixation|fix carbon dioxide]]. However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This process, called [[photorespiration]], uses energy, but does not produce sugars.

RuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons:
#One product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead of [[3-phosphoglycerate]] (3 carbon). Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the Calvin-Benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle. A high oxygenase activity, therefore, drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the [[Calvin-Benson cycle]].
#Phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis.
#Salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway, and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate. The reactions also produce [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is able to [[Molecular diffusion|diffuse]] out of the plant, leading to a loss of nitrogen.

::A highly simplified summary is:

:::2 glycolate + ATP → 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + ADP + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more commonly known as [[photorespiration]], since it is characterized by light-dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.

A [[fishery]] is an area with an associated [[fish]] or [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] population which is harvested for its [[Commercial fishing|commercial]] or [[Recreational fishing|recreational]] value. Fisheries can be [[Wild fisheries of the world|wild]] or [[Fish farm|farmed]]. [[Population dynamics]] describes the ways in which a given population grows and shrinks over time, as controlled by birth, death, and migration. It is the basis for understanding changing fishery patterns and issues such as habitat destruction, predation and optimal harvesting rates. The '''population dynamics of fisheries''' is used by [[Fisheries science|fisheries scientist]]s to determine [[Sustainable yield in fisheries|sustainable yields]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilderbuera, Thomas K and Zhang, Chang Ik (1999) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T6N-3WDKGMG-7&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=a9c222a53c510d31b89d6ece311422be ''Evaluation of the population dynamics and yield characteristics of Alaska plaice, Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus, in the eastern Bering Sea.''] Fisheries Research.

The basic accounting relation for population dynamics is the [[Matrix population models|BIDE]] (Birth, Immigration, Death, Emigration) model, shown as:&lt;ref&gt;Caswell, H.  2001.  Matrix population models: Construction, analysis and interpretation, 2nd Edition.  Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Massachusetts.  {{ISBN|0-87893-096-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''B'' &amp;minus; ''D'' + ''I'' &amp;minus; ''E''

where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of individuals at time 1, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of individuals at time 0, ''B'' is the number of individuals born, ''D'' the number that died, ''I'' the number that immigrated, and ''E'' the number that emigrated between time 0 and time 1. While immigration and emigration can be present in [[Wild fisheries of the world|wild fisheries]], they are usually not measured.

A fishery population is affected by three dynamic rate functions:

* [[Birth rate]] or '''recruitment'''. Recruitment means reaching a certain size or reproductive stage. With fisheries, recruitment usually refers to the age a fish can be caught and counted in nets.
*Growth rate. This measures the growth of individuals in size and length. This is important in fisheries where the population is often measured in terms of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].
*[[Fish mortality|Mortality]]. This includes harvest mortality and natural mortality. Natural mortality includes non-human predation, disease and old age.

If these rates are measured over different time intervals, the '''harvestable surplus''' of a fishery can be determined. The harvestable surplus is the number of individuals that can be harvested from the population without affecting long term stability (average population size). The harvest within the harvestable surplus is called '''compensatory mortality''', where the harvest deaths are substituting for the deaths that would otherwise occur naturally. Harvest beyond that is '''additive mortality''', harvest in addition to all the animals that would have died naturally.

Care is needed when applying population dynamics to real world fisheries. Over-simplistic modelling of fisheries has resulted in the collapse of key [[Fish stock|stocks]].&lt;ref name=Epitaph /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lessons /&gt;

==History==
The first principle of population dynamics is widely regarded as the exponential law of [[Malthus]], as modelled by the [[Malthusian growth model]]. The early period was dominated by [[demography|demographic]] studies such as the work of [[Benjamin Gompertz]]  and [[Pierre François Verhulst]] in the early 19th century, who refined and adjusted the Malthusian demographic model. A more general model formulation was proposed by F.J. Richards in 1959, by which the models of Gompertz, Verhulst and also [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] are covered as special cases of the general formulation.&lt;ref&gt;Richards F. J. (1959) "A Flexible Growth Function for Empirical Use",
''Journal of Experimental Botany'', '''10''': 290-301.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population size==
The [[population size]] (usually denoted by ''N'') is the number of individual [[organism]]s in a [[population]].

The [[effective population size]] (''N''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;) was defined by [[Sewall Wright]], who wrote two landmark papers on it (Wright 1931, 1938).  He defined it as "the number of breeding individuals in an [[idealized population]] that would show the same amount of dispersion of [[allele frequency|allele frequencies]] under random [[genetic drift]] or the same amount of [[inbreeding]] as the population under consideration". It is a basic parameter in many models in [[population genetics]]. ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; is usually less than ''N'' (the absolute population size).

[[Small population size]] results in increased [[genetic drift]].  [[Population bottleneck]]s are when population size reduces for a short period of time.

[[Overpopulation (biology)|Overpopulation]] may indicate any case in which the population of any species of animal may exceed the [[carrying capacity]] of its [[ecological niche]].

==Virtual population analysis==
{{Main|Virtual population analysis}}
'''Virtual population analysis (VPA)''' is a [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] modeling technique commonly used in [[fisheries science]] for reconstructing historical fish numbers at age using information on death of individuals each year. This death is usually partitioned into catch by fisheries and [[Fish mortality|natural mortality]]. VPA is virtual in the sense that the population size is not observed or measured directly but is inferred or back-calculated to have been a certain size in the past in order to support the observed fish catches and an assumed death rate owing to non-fishery related causes.

==Minimum viable population==
{{Main|Minimum viable population}}
The minimum viable population (MVP) is a lower bound on the population of a species, such that it can survive in the wild. More specifically MVP is the smallest possible size at which a biological population can exist without facing extinction from natural disasters or demographic, environmental, or genetic [[stochastic]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;Holsinger (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "population" refers to the population of a species in the wild.

As a reference standard, MVP is usually given with a population survival probability of somewhere between ninety and ninety-five percent and calculated for between one hundred and one thousand years into the future.

The MVP can be calculated using [[computer simulation]]s known as [[population viability analysis|population viability analyses]] (PVA), where populations are modelled and future population dynamics are projected.

==Maximum sustainable yield==
{{main|Maximum sustainable yield}}
In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], the [[maximum sustainable yield]] or '''MSY''' is, theoretically, the largest catch that can be taken from a fishery stock over an indefinite period.&lt;ref&gt;Europa: European Union (2006) [http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l66037.htm Management based on maximum sustainable yield] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223064801/http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l66037.htm |date=2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Europa: European Union (2006) [http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/06/268&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en Questions and Answers on Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)]
&lt;/ref&gt; Under the assumption of logistic growth, the MSY will be exactly at half the [[carrying capacity]] of a species, as this is the stage at when population growth is highest. The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the [[optimum sustainable yield]].

This [[logistic function|logistic]] model of growth is produced by a population introduced to a new habitat or with very poor numbers going through a lag phase of slow growth at first. Once it reaches a foothold population it will go through a rapid growth rate that will start to level off once the species approaches carrying capacity. The idea of maximum sustained yield is to decrease population density to the point of highest growth rate possible. This changes the number of the population, but the new number can be maintained indefinitely, ideally.

MSY is extensively used for fisheries management.&lt;ref&gt;WWF Publications (2007) [http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/epo/initiatives/fisheries/publications/index.cfm?uNewsID=97580 ''The Maximum Sustainable Yield objective in Fisheries'']{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries. [http://www.fish.govt.nz/en-nz/SOF/Indicators.htm ''MSY Harvest Strategies.'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the logistic (Schaefer) model, MSY in most modern fisheries models occurs at around 30-40% of the unexploited population size (see e.g. &lt;ref&gt;Thorpe et al. (2015) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12292/epdf ''Evaluation and management implications of uncertainty in a multispecies size-structured model of population and community responses to fishing '']&lt;/ref&gt;). This fraction differs among populations depending on the life history of the species and the age-specific selectivity of the fishing method.

However, the approach has been widely criticized as ignoring several key factors involved in fisheries management and has led to the devastating collapse of many fisheries. As a simple calculation, it ignores the size and age of the animal being taken, its reproductive status, and it focuses solely on the species in question, ignoring the damage to the ecosystem caused by the designated level of exploitation and the issue of bycatch. Among [[Conservation biology|conservation biologists]] it is widely regarded as dangerous and misused.&lt;ref name=Epitaph&gt;Larkin PA (1977) [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:0ZITmBnzlDUJ:fiesta.bren.ucsb.edu/~gsd/595e/docs/22.%2520Larkin_Epitaph_Max_Sust_Yield.pdf+Larkin+1977+%22An+epitaph+for+the+concept+of+maximum+sustained+yield%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=nz&amp;sig=AHIEtbSBFh-w5xzWiBK7rnHSLBmolsfaWA "An epitaph for the concept of maximum sustained yield"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Transactions of the American Fisheries Society'', '''106''': 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lessons&gt;[[Carl Walters|Walters C]] and Maguire J (1996) "Lessons for stock assessment from the northern cod collapse", ''Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries'', '''6''':125–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruitment==
Recruitment is the number of new young fish that enter a population in a given year. The size of fish populations can fluctuate by orders of magnitude over time, and five to 10-fold variations in abundance are usual. This variability applies across time spans ranging from a year to hundreds of years. Year to year fluctuations in the abundance of short lived [[forage fish]] can be nearly as great as the fluctuations that occur over decades or centuries. This suggests that fluctuations in reproductive and recruitment success are prime factors behind fluctuations in abundance. Annual fluctuations often seem random, and recruitment success often has a poor relationship to adult stock levels and fishing effort. This makes prediction difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Houde DE (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-0Co8nrLVxUC&amp;pg=PT101&amp;lpg=PT101&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cthe+recruitment+problem%E2%80%9D+fish&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_P-2RdOVOy&amp;sig=QhOBRdj0YorYbgr1Vk2N2dkI_oA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sxBVSo2iLpiI6wOv48XoDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6 Recruitment variability] in Jakobsen T, Fogarty MJ, Megrey BA and Moksness E.

==Overfishing==
[[File:HCR.gif|thumb|right|300px|The Traffic Light colour convention, showing the concept of Harvest Control Rule (HCR), specifying when a rebuilding plan is mandatory in terms of [[Precautionary principle|precautionary]] and limit reference points for [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] [[biomass]] and fishing [[Fish mortality|mortality rate]].]]
{{Main|Overfishing}}
The notion of [[overfishing]] hinges on what is meant by an '''acceptable level''' of fishing.

A current operational model used by some fisheries for predicting acceptable levels is the '''Harvest Control Rule''' (HCR). This formalizes and summarizes a management strategy which can actively adapt to subsequent feedback. The HCR is a variable over which the management has some direct control and describes how the harvest is intended to be controlled by management in relation to the state of some indicator of stock status. For example, a harvest control rule can describe the various values of fishing mortality which will be aimed at for various values of the stock abundance.  Constant catch and constant fishing mortality are two types of simple harvest control rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coad|first1=Brian W.|last2=McAllister|first2=Don E.|title=Dictionary of Ichthyology|url=http://www.briancoad.com/dictionary/H.htm|accessdate=2 January 2015|date=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720124618/http://www.briancoad.com/dictionary/H.htm|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Biological overfishing''' occurs when fishing [[Mortality rate|mortality]] has reached a level where the stock [[biomass]] has negative [[marginalism|marginal growth]] (slowing down biomass growth), as indicated by the red area in the figure. Fish are being taken out of the water so quickly that the replenishment of stock by breeding slows down.  If the replenishment continues to slow down for long enough, replenishment will go into reverse and the population will decrease.
* '''Economic''' or '''bioeconomic overfishing''' additionally considers the cost of fishing and defines overfishing as a situation of negative marginal growth of [[resource rent]].  Fish are being taken out of the water so quickly that the growth in the profitability of fishing slows down. If this continues for long enough, profitability will decrease.

==Metapopulation==
{{Main|Metapopulation}}
A metapopulation is a group of spatially separated populations of the same [[species]] which interact at some level.  The term was coined by [[Richard Levins]] in 1969. The idea has been most broadly applied to species in naturally or artificially [[habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]]. In Levins' own words, it consists of "a population of populations".&lt;ref&gt;Levins, R. 1969. "Some demographic and genetic consequences of environmental heterogeneity for biological control." Bulletin of the Entomological Society of America, 15, 237-240&lt;/ref&gt;

A metapopulation generally consists of several distinct populations together with areas of suitable habitat which are currently unoccupied.  Each population cycles in relative independence of the other populations and eventually goes extinct as a consequence of demographic stochasticity (fluctuations in population size due to random demographic events); the smaller the population, the more prone it is to extinction.

Although individual populations have finite life-spans, the population as a whole is often stable because immigrants from one population (which may, for example, be experiencing a population boom) are likely to re-colonize habitat which has been left open by the extinction of another population.  They may also emigrate to a small population and rescue that population from extinction (called the ''rescue effect'').

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Age class structure==
{{Main|Age class structure}}
Age can be determined by counting growth rings in [[fish]] scales, [[otoliths]], cross-sections of fin spines for species with thick spines such as [[triggerfish]], or teeth for a few species. Each method has its merits and drawbacks. Fish scales are easiest to obtain, but may be unreliable if scales have fallen off of the fish and new ones grown in their places. Fin spines may be unreliable for the same reason, and most fish do not have spines of sufficient thickness for clear rings to be visible. Otoliths will have stayed with the fish throughout its life history, but obtaining them requires killing the fish. Also, otoliths often require more preparation before ageing can occur.

An age class structure with gaps in it, for instance a regular [[normal distribution|bell curve]] for the population of 1-5 year-old fish, excepting a very low population for the 3-year-olds, implies a bad [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] year 3 years ago in that species.

Often fish in younger age class structures have very low numbers because they were small enough to slip through the [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] nets, and may in fact have a very healthy population.

==Population cycle==
{{Main|Population cycle}}
A population cycle occurs where [[population]]s rise and fall over a predictable period of time. There are some species where population numbers have reasonably predictable patterns of change although the full reasons for population cycles is one of the major unsolved ecological problems. There are a number of factors which influence population change such as availability of food, predators, diseases and climate.

==Trophic cascades==
{{Main|Trophic cascade}}
Trophic cascades occur when [[predator]]s in a [[food chain]] suppress the abundance of their [[prey]], thereby releasing the next lower [[trophic level]] from [[predation]] (or [[herbivory]] if the intermediate trophic level is an [[herbivore]]). For example, if the abundance of large [[piscivore|piscivorous]] fish is increased in a [[lake]], the abundance of their prey, [[zooplankton|zooplanktivorous]] [[fish]], should decrease, large [[zooplankton]] abundance should increase, and [[phytoplankton]] [[biomass]] should decrease. This theory has stimulated new research in many areas of [[ecology]]. Trophic cascades may also be important for understanding the effects of removing top predators from food webs, as humans have done in many places through hunting and fishing activities.

;Classic examples
# In [[lake]]s, [[piscivore|piscivorous]] fish can dramatically reduce populations of [[zooplankton|zooplanktivorous]] fish, [[zooplankton|zooplanktivorous]] fish can dramatically alter [[freshwater]] [[zooplankton]] communities, and [[zooplankton]] grazing can in turn have large impacts on [[phytoplankton]] communities. Removal of piscivorous fish can change lake water from clear to green by allowing phytoplankton to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter SR, Kitchell JF, Hodgson JR (1985) Cascading trophic interactions and lake productivity. Bioscience 35:634-639&lt;/ref&gt;
# In the [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]], in Northern [[California]], fish ([[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] and [[California Roach|roach]]) consume fish larvae and predatory [[insects]]. These smaller [[predator]]s prey on [[midge]] larvae, which feed on [[algae]]. Removal of the larger fish increases the abundance of algae.&lt;ref&gt;Power ME (1990) Effects of fish in river food webs. Science 250: 811-814&lt;/ref&gt;
# In [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] [[kelp forest]]s, [[sea otters]] feed on [[sea urchin]]s. In areas where sea otters have been [[hunting|hunt]]ed to [[local extinction|extinction]], sea urchins increase in abundance and decimate [[kelp]]&lt;ref&gt;Estes JA, Palmisano JF (1974) Sea otters: their role in structuring nearshore communities. Science 185: 1058-1060&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent theory, the [[mesopredator release hypothesis]], states that the decline of top predators in an ecosystem results in increased populations of medium-sized predators (mesopredators).

==Basic models==
* The classic population equilibrium model is [[Pierre François Verhulst|Verhulst's]] 1838 [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|growth model]]:

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = r N \left(1 - \frac {N}{K} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''N''(''t'') represents number of individuals at time ''t'', ''r'' the intrinsic growth rate and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]], or the maximum number of individuals that the environment can support.

* The individual growth model, published by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|von Bertalanffy]] in 1934, can be used to model the rate at which fish grow. It exists in a number of versions, but in its simplest form it is expressed as a [[differential equation]] of length (''L'') over time (''t''):

:: &lt;math&gt;L'(t) = r_B \left( L_\infty - L(t) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; is the von Bertalanffy growth rate and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sub&gt; the ultimate length of the individual.

* [[Milner Baily Schaefer|Schaefer]] published a fishery equilibrium model based on the [[Pierre François Verhulst|Verhulst]] model with an assumption of a bi-linear catch equation, often referred to as the Schaefer short-term catch equation:

::&lt;math&gt;H(E,X)=q E X\!&lt;/math&gt;

:where the variables are; ''H'', referring to catch (harvest) over a given period of time (e.g. a year); ''E'', the fishing effort over the given period; ''X'', the fish stock biomass at the beginning of the period (or the average biomass), and the parameter ''q'' represents the catchability of the stock.

:Assuming the catch to equal the net natural growth in the population over the same period (&lt;math&gt;\dot{X}=0&lt;/math&gt;), the equilibrium catch is a function of the long term fishing effort ''E'':

::&lt;math&gt;H(E)=q K E (1-\frac{qE}{r})&lt;/math&gt;

:''r'' and ''K'' being biological parameters representing intrinsic growth rate and natural equilibrium biomass respectively.

* The [[Baranov catch equation]] of 1918 is perhaps the most used equation in fisheries modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Quinn | first = Terrance J. II| title = Ruminations on the development and future of population dynamics models in fisheries | doi = 10.1111/j.1939-7445.2003.tb00119.x | journal = Natural Resource Modeling | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 341–392| year = 2003| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives the catch in numbers as a function of initial population abundance ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt; and fishing ''F'' and natural mortality ''M'':
:: &lt;math&gt;C = \frac{F}{F+M} (1-e^{-(F+M)T}) N_0&lt;/math&gt;

: where ''T'' is the time period and is usually left out (i.e. ''T=1'' is assumed). The equation assumes that fishing and natural mortality occur simultaneously and thus "compete" with each other. The first term expresses the proportion of deaths that are caused by fishing, and the second and third term the total number of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Baranov, FI (1918) "On the question of the biological basis of fisheries" ''Izvestiya'', '''1''': 81–128. (Translated from Russian by W.E. Ricker, 1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Ricker model]] is a classic discrete population model which gives the expected number (or density) of individuals ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; in generation ''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 as a function of the number of individuals in the previous generation,

:: &lt;math&gt;N_{t+1} = N_t e^{r(1-\frac{N_t}{k})}&lt;/math&gt;

:Here ''r'' is interpreted as an intrinsic growth rate and ''k'' as the [[carrying capacity]] of the environment. The Ricker model was introduced in the context of the fisheries by [[Bill Ricker|Ricker]] (1954).

* The [[Beverton–Holt model]], introduced in the context of fisheries in 1957, is a classic discrete-time population model which gives the [[expected value|expected]] number ''n''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''+1&lt;/sub&gt; (or density) of individuals in generation ''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 as a function of the number of individuals in the previous generation,

:: &lt;math&gt;n_{t+1} = \frac{R_0 n_t}{1+ n_t/M}. &lt;/math&gt;

:Here ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is interpreted as the proliferation rate per generation and ''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;''M'' is the [[carrying capacity]] of the environment.

==Predator-prey equations==
{{See also|Lotka-Volterra equation|Competitive Lotka-Volterra equations|Nicholson-Bailey model}}
The classic predator-prey equations are a pair of first order, [[non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s used to describe the dynamics of [[Systems biology|biological systems]] in which two species interact, one a predator and one its prey. They were proposed independently by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] in 1925 and [[Vito Volterra]] in 1926.

An extension to these are the [[competitive Lotka-Volterra equations]], which provide a simple model of the population dynamics of species competing for some common resource.

In the 1930s [[Alexander John Nicholson|Alexander Nicholson]] and [[Victor Albert Bailey|Victor Bailey]] developed a model to describe the population dynamics of a coupled predator-prey system. The model assumes that predators search for prey at random, and that both predators and prey are assumed to be distributed in a non-contiguous ("clumped") fashion in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Hopper&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, a credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model (and its common prey dependent generalizations) emerged, the ratio dependent or [[Arditi-Ginzburg equations|Arditi-Ginzburg model]].&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 1989. [http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/ginzburglab/Coupling%20in%20Predator-Prey%20Dynamics%20-%20Arditi%20and%20Ginzburg,%201989.pdf Coupling in predator-prey dynamics: ratio dependence].  ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' 139: 311-326.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models.  According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong.  They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi-Ginzburg model as the first approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6546">'''Preservationist''' is generally understood to mean ''historic preservationist'': one who advocates to preserve architecturally or historically significant buildings, structures, objects, or sites from demolition or degradation. [[Historic preservation]] usually refers to the preservation of the built environment, not to the preservation of, for instance, primeval forests or wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Association of Historic District Commissions, ''[http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055105/http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources |date=2011-07-27 }}'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Preservationist'' is, however, sometimes used descriptively in other contexts, notably with regards to language and the environment.

==Other uses of the term==
Persons who work to preserve ancient or [[endangered language]]s are called [[Language preservation|language preservationists.]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Language Preservation: UNESCO-CI |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=11171&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20060706085338/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=11171&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Clarification: ''Ethnologue,'' a reference work published by [[SIL International]], has cataloged the world’s known living languages, and it estimates that 417 languages are on the verge of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ |accessdate=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservationist is also sometimes used in the natural [[environmentalist]] field, but while the natural environment [[conservation movement|conservationist]] movements preserve [[ecosystem]]s and the [[natural environment]], this movement is widely known as ''[[conservation ethic|conservation]]'' or ''[[environmentalism]]''. 

*Clarification: A key difference between the Preservationist and [[conservation movement|Conservationist]] [[environmentalist]] schools is this: Preservationists view the environment as having intrinsic value that should be preserved by making as little change to it as possible. Conservationists view the environment as having instrumental value that can be of help to people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Earle Funk]], ''What's the Name, Please?'', Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; and generally accept [[Gifford Pinchot]]'s notion of [[sustainable yield]]: that man can harvest some forest or animal products from a natural environment on a regular basis without compromising the long-health of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;W.N. Sparhawk, "The History of Forestry in America" in Trees: Yearbook of Agriculture,1949. Washington,D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservationism has been defined by [[Richard Heinberg]] in his book ''Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World'' as distinguishing survivalist groups who wish merely to survive a collapse of civilization from preservationist communities who wish to preserve as much of human culture as is possible in the event of collapse. 

*Clarification: The idea of preservationist communities is part of a broader strategy in which individuals achieve independence from the centralized power grid, forming sustainable communities that could provide mutual support in the event of critical depletion of non-renewable resources.&lt;ref&gt;Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World ({{ISBN|9780865715103}}) (2004; British edition 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Quranic Arabic Corpus''' is an annotated linguistic resource consisting of 77,430 words of Quranic Arabic. The project aims to provide morphological and syntactic annotations for researchers wanting to study the language of the Quran.&lt;ref name="dukes1"&gt;K. Dukes, E. Atwell and N. Habash (2011). [http://www.kaisdukes.com/papers/qcorpus-lrej2011.pdf ''Supervised Collaboration for Syntactic Annotation of Quranic Arabic.''] Language Resources and Evaluation Journal (LREJ).

==Functions==
The grammatical analysis helps readers further in uncovering the detailed intended meanings of each verse and sentence. Each word of the Quran is tagged with its part-of-speech as well as multiple morphological features. Unlike other annotated Arabic corpora, the grammar framework adopted by the Quranic Corpus is the traditional Arabic grammar of [[i'rab]] ({{lang|ar|'''إﻋﺮﺍﺏ'''}}). The research project is led by [[Kais Dukes]] at the [[University of Leeds]],&lt;ref name=tri/&gt; and is part of the Arabic language computing research group within the School of Computing, supervised by Eric Atwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/eric|title=Profile for Dr Eric Atwell - School of Computing - University of Leeds|first=|last=Engineering|website=www.comp.leeds.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annotated corpus includes:&lt;ref name="dukes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dukes3"&gt;K. Dukes and N. Habash (2011). [http://www.kaisdukes.com/papers/qparse-iwpt2011.pdf ''One-step Statistical Parsing of Hybrid Dependency-Constituency Syntactic Representations.''] International Conference on Parsing Technologies (IWPT). Dublin, Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A manually verified [[Part-of-speech tagging|part-of-speech]] tagged Quranic Arabic corpus. 
* An annotated [[treebank]] of Quranic Arabic. 
* A novel visualization of traditional [[Arabic grammar]] through dependency graphs. 
* Morphological search for the Quran. 
* A machine-readable morphological lexicon of Quranic words into English. 
* A part-of-speech [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] for Quranic Arabic organized by lemma.
* An online message board for community volunteer annotation.

Corpus annotation assigns a part-of-speech tag and morphological features to each word. For example, annotation involves deciding whether a word is a noun or a verb, and if it is inflected for masculine or feminine. The first stage of the project involved automatic part-of-speech tagging by applying Arabic language computing technology to the text. The annotation for each of the 77,430 words in the Quran was then reviewed in stages by two annotators, and improvements are still ongoing to further improve accuracy.

Linguistic research for the Quran that uses the annotated corpus includes training [[Hidden Markov model]] [[Part-of-speech tagging|part-of-speech]] taggers for Arabic,&lt;ref&gt;M. Albared, N. Omar and M. Ab Aziz (2011).

==History==
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}
In 2006 school district officials stated that disorder was not increasing at Roxborough High while some teachers stated that it was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Snyder, Susan|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-143343554.html|title=Tension at Roxborough High: Teachers say disorder is on the rise.

In 2010 [[Manayunk, Philadelphia|Manayunk]] resident and Philadelphia School District teacher Keith Newman criticized the school district's handling of the high school, stating that it should not be ranked as "persistently dangerous" since it is in a relatively well-to-do area. At the time he was running for election for a political position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scally, Bernard J.|url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2010/05/09/roxborough_review/news/doc4be0896b94a54803448993.txt?viewmode=fullstory|title=Candidate Profile - 'A regular guy'|publisher=''[[Roxborough Review]]''|date=2010-05-09|accessdate=2016-11-16|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6m442G9KZ?url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2010/05/09/roxborough_review/news/doc4be0896b94a54803448993.txt?viewmode=fullstory|archivedate=2016-11-16|df=}} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

Roxborough alumnus Stephen Brandt made efforts to turn around the school during his time as principal. The school district had asked him, previously a [[Norristown School District]] employee, to help improve the high school. He received the 2013 Lindback Award for Distinguished Principal Leadership. In 2013 Brandt, then the outgoing principal, stated that Dana Jenkins was going to be the new principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scally, Bernard J.|url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2013/06/14/roxborough_review/news/doc51b745e5a0979592908489.txt|title=New principal named for Roxborough High|publisher=''[[Roxborough Review]]''|date=2013-06-14|accessdate=2016-11-16}} ([https://www.webcitation.org/6m40YiyNV?url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2013/06/14/roxborough_review/news/doc51b745e5a0979592908489.txt?viewmode=fullstory Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the school received a $1 million grant from the Philadelphia School Partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Graham, Kristen A.|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/education/20161010_City_school_getting__1M.html|title=City school getting $1M|publisher=''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]''|date=2016-10-10|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic performance==
In 2015 Jenkins stated that the graduation rate was 84%. A 2015 ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' article stated that the school, while experiencing issues involving a lack of resources, was one of the best-performing comprehensive high schools in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Graham, Kristen A.|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/education/20151208_Study__Philly_comprehensive_high_schools_in_trouble.html|title=Study: Philly comprehensive high schools in trouble|publisher=''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]''|date=2015-12-08|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual harassment in the military''' is unwanted [[Human sexual activity|sexual behaviour]], which is defined as threatening, offensive, or otherwise upsetting to others in a [[military]] setting. The behaviour is more common in the military than in [[civilian]] life. Women are substantially more likely than men to experience [[sexual harassment]] in the armed forces. Other groups at higher risk include child cadets/recruits and military [[Detention (imprisonment)|detainees]].

== Behaviour ==
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}

Sexual harassment in the military includes a broad spectrum of behaviour. Undirected behaviours that affect the working environment, such as sexist jokes and the prominent display of [[Pornography|pornographic material]], may constitute sexual harassment, as do directed behaviours targeted at one or more individuals, such as unwanted sexual advances and [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/538E55EE-9CA4-4177-9A0B-6853A431B283/0/20060522SRReport.pdf|title=Quantitative &amp; qualitative research into sexual harassment in the armed forces|last=Rutherford|first=Sarah|last2=Schneider|first2=Robin|date=2006|website=|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121018171845/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/538E55EE-9CA4-4177-9A0B-6853A431B283/0/20060522SRReport.pdf|archive-date=2012-10-18|dead-url=bot: unknown|access-date=2018-03-08|last3=Walmsley|first3=Alexis|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in Canada has found that a culture of undirected sexual harassment increases the risk of directed sexual harassment and assault.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Case examples ===
In the [[British Army|British army]], a woman told the following story to researchers in 2006:&lt;blockquote&gt;‘A friend was out on an [[Military exercise|exercise]] when a group of men ducked her head in a bucket of water and each time she came up for breath she had to repeat “I am useless and I am a female”. She told the story and said it was a joke but I could see she was upset.’&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian armed forces]], demeaning attitudes to women are pervasive, according to the ''Deschamps Review'' of 2015:&lt;blockquote&gt;'Interviewees reported regularly being told of orders to “stop being pussies” and to “leave your purses at home” [...] The use of the word “cunt”, for example, is commonplace, and rape jokes are tolerated. [...] A commonly held attitude is that, rather than be a soldier, a sailor or an aviator, a woman will be labeled an “ice princess”, a “bitch”, or a “slut”. Another saying is that women enter the CAF “to find a man, to leave a man, or to become a man”.'&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A woman in the [[French Army|French army]], [[pseudonym]]ised by the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' newspaper as Captain Carole, was [[rape]]d by her commanding officer:&lt;blockquote&gt;'It was months before I could pronounce the word "rape"... I blamed myself. I said: "We are trained in hand to hand combat. Why didn’t I stop him?" But when that happens you are terrorised.'&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-battles-sexual-abuse-in-the-military-9271383.html|title=France battles sexual abuse in the military|last=Lichfield|first=John|date=2014-04-20|work=Independent|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Prevalence and risk factors ==
Studies of sexual harassment have found that it is markedly more common in [[military]] than [[civilian]] settings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828143812|title=Military psychologists' desk reference|last=Anderson|first=E H|last2=Suris|first2=A|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-992826-2|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=Brett A|location=Oxford|pages=264–269|chapter=Military sexual trauma|oclc=828143812|editor-last2=Barnett|editor-first2=Jeffrey E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reasons for this have been suggested. A Canadian study found that key risk factors associated with military settings are the typically young age of personnel, the isolated locations of bases, the minority status of women, and the disproportionate number of men in senior positions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cimvhr.ca/conference/mh-symposium/documents/presentations/5-Watkins.pdf|title=Sexual Assault in the Canadian Armed Forces: Prevalence, Circumstances, Correlates, and Mental Health Associations|last=Watkins|first=Kimberley|last2=Bennett|first2=Rachel|date=|website=|access-date=2018-03-08|last3=Richer|first3=Isabelle|last4=Zamorski|first4=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Canadian research has found that an emphasis in military organisations on [[conformity]], [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]], and [[Hierarchy|hierarchical power relations]], combine to increase the risk, particularly to personnel of low rank, who are less able than others to resist inappropriate expectations made of them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The [[Masculinity|traditionally masculine]] values and behaviours that are rewarded and reinforced in military settings are also thought to play a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Kathryn E.|last2=Parrott|first2=Dominic J.|date=May 2011|title=What accounts for men's hostile attitudes toward women?

Canadian research has also found that the risk of sexual misconduct increases during deployment on [[military operation]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Principal targets ==

=== Female personnel ===
While some male personnel are sexually harassed, women are substantially more likely to be affected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Women who are younger and joined the military at a younger age face a greater risk, according to American, British, Canadian, and French research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/07/23/11/19/cessation-of-military-recruiting-in-public-elementary-and-secondary-schools|title=Cessation of Military Recruiting in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools|last=American Public Heatlh Association|date=2013-10-30|website=www.apha.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

=== Detainees ===
Individuals detained by the military are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment. During the [[Iraq War]], for example, personnel of the [[United States Army|US army]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|US Central Intelligence Agency]] committed a number of [[human rights violations]] against detainees in the [[Abu Ghraib prison]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html|title=Other government agencies|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|publisher=Salon.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212035108/http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html|archivedate=February 12, 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=April 3, 2012|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[rape]], [[sodomy]], and other forms of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="New Yorker 2004-05-17"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/17/040517fa_fact2?currentPage=all|title=Chain of Command|last=Hersh|first=Seymour M.|date=May 17, 2004|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=September 13, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101055751/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/17/040517fa_fact2?currentPage=all|archivedate=January 1, 2012|deadurl=no|quote=NBC News later quoted U.S. military officials as saying that the unreleased photographs showed American soldiers "severely beating an Iraqi prisoner nearly to death, having sex with a female Iraqi prisoner, and 'acting inappropriately with a dead body.'

== Barriers to redress ==
Although the risk of sexual misconduct in the armed forces is widely acknowledged, personnel are frequently reluctant to report incidents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1168765/dod-releases-latest-military-sexual-assault-report/|title=DoD Releases Latest Military Sexual Assault Report|last=US, Department of Defence|date=2017-05-01|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For example:
* An official report of the [[Australian Defence Force]] concluded that women affected by harassment were less likely to make a complaint because they do not expect a serious response.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.defenceabusetaskforce.gov.au/Reports/Documents/Dart-final-report-2016.pdf|title=Defence Abuse Response Taskforce: Final report|last=Defence Abuse Response Taskforce|date=2016|website=|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[ombudsman]] of the [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian armed forces]] confirmed that women fear the consequences if they report a sexual offence against them to their [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]: 'The fear of repercussions is blatant,' he said in 2014.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; In 2015, the Deschamps Review reported that one of the main reasons why personnel do not lodge a complaint is a fear of the consequences for their career and that there had many complainants had faced reprisals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Leila Minano, the co-author of a book documenting sexual abuse in the [[French Armed Forces|French armed forces]], commented that complaints from women were systematically discouraged from complaining, and were often moved out of their unit if they did so.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;
* In the UK, an official report on sexual harassment in the [[British Army|British army]] found that almost half of personnel who had an 'upsetting' experience of sexual harassment did not complain for fear of an impact on their career.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* In the [[United States Armed Forces|US armed forces]], a study in 2016 found that 58% of women who reported sexual misconduct by peers said that they had met with retaliation as a consequence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sexual-assault-reports-u-s-military-reach-record-high-pentagon-n753566|title=Sexual assault reports in U.S. military reach record high, Pentagon says|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Defense estimated in 2017 that two in three victims of sexual assault do not report it.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Since the number of official complaints represents only a fraction of sexual harassment in the military,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sapr.mil/public/docs/reports/FY16_Annual/FY16_SAPRO_Annual_Report.pdf|title=Department of Defense Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military: Fiscal Year 2016|last=US, Department of Defense|date=2017|website=|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; armed forces that have committed to reduce prevalence produce periodic estimates of its extent using anonymised surveys.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Mental health effects ==
Women affected by sexual harassment are more likely than other women to suffer [[Stress (biology)|stress]]-related [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] afterwards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research in the US found that when [[sexual abuse]] of female military personnel is [[Psychological trauma|psychiatrically traumatic]], the odds of suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) after deployment on operations increase by a factor of nine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research in the US has found that personnel affected by sexual harassment are somewhat less likely to develop depression or PTSD if a formal report leads to effective action to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Margret E.|last2=Street|first2=Amy E.|last3=Stafford|first3=Jane|date=2014|title=Victims' psychosocial well-being after reporting sexual harassment in the military|journal=Journal of trauma &amp; dissociation: the official journal of the International Society for the Study of Dissociation (ISSD)|volume=15|issue=2|pages=133–152|doi=10.1080/15299732.2014.867563|issn=1529-9740|pmid=24410254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military leadership in some countries has begun to acknowledge a culture of sexual misconduct in the armed forces. For example:
* The British armed forces co-commissioned their first formal study of the problem in 2006, and in 2016 the head of the [[British Army|British army]] noted the ‘overly sexualised’ soldier culture and committed to reducing the extent of sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/14/army-has-overly-sexualised-heavy-drinking-culture-head-of-armed/|title=Army has 'overly-sexualised' heavy drinking culture, Chief of General Staff admits|last=Farmer|first=Ben|date=2016-06-14|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, after a major study uncovered widespread sexual harassment and assault in the Canadian armed forces, [[Jonathan Vance|General Jonathan Vance]], Chief of the Defence Staff, acknowledged: 'Harmful sexual behaviour is a real problem in our institution.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/sexual-misconduct-military-survey-1.3868377|title=960 soldiers reported being sexually assaulted in the past year|last=Harris|first=Kathleen|date=2016-11-28|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The US established the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office in 2005, which reports annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sapr.mil/index.php/about/mission-and-history|title=Mission &amp; History|last=US, Department of Defense|date=2018|website=|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual harassment in the military, by country ==

=== Australia ===
Widespread reports of sexual harassment in the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian armed forces]] led to the establishment of the [[Defence Abuse Response Taskforce]] to investigate complaints from women between 1991 and 2011. It received 2,439 complaints, of which it deemed 1,751 to be plausible.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A [[Royal Commission]] into institutional [[child sexual abuse]] was established in 2012, which investigated widespread allegations of historical abuse in the navy.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The Commission took evidence from 8,000 individuals&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/private-sessions|title=Private sessions|last=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse|date=2017-05-30|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported in 2017 that many recruits of both sexes and from the age of 15 had been repeatedly sexually abused by older recruits between 1967 and 1971, including by anal [[gang rape]], and in some cases young recruits had been forced to rape each other.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The practice was ‘tolerated’ by senior staff, according to the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/22/navy-staff-tolerated-widespread-child-sexual-abuse-of-recruits-royal-commission-says|title=Navy staff tolerated widespread child sexual abuse of recruits, royal commission says|last=Australian Associated Press|date=2017-08-22|website=Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Further|Defence Abuse Response Taskforce|Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse}}

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Sexual assault in the Canadian Forces}}According to official statistics gathered by [[Maclean's|''Maclean's'' magazine]], the Canadian military police received an average of 178 complaints of sexual assault between 2000 and 2014, representing an estimated 10% of all cases.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In 2014, the [[ombudsman]] of the Canadian armed forces described sexual harassment in the institution as 'a huge problem'.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In 2015, after widespread allegations of sexual misconduct in the military, a major official report, the ''External Review into Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces'' (the ''Deschamps Review''), was published.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It found that sexual harassment was commonplace and embedded in military culture, and that pervasive degrading attitudes to women and LGBTQ personnel were jeopardising their safety.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ''Deschamps Review'' also criticised the armed forces for a culture of dismissiveness.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; One male interview told the Review, for example: "Girls that come to the Army know what to expect." It stated that senior [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] are frequently seen as tolerating sexual harassment and discouraging the individuals affected from making a complaint.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The following year, in 2016, a major study of 43,000 [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian armed forces]] personnel reported that 27% of female personnel reported at least one incident of sexual assault since they joined the military, and 5% of female regular armed forces personnel reported the same in the previous 12 months (equivalent to approximately 960 women per year).

=== France ===
The extent of sexual harassment in the [[French Armed Forces|French armed forces]] first came to light in 2014 when 35 cases of sexual harassment and assault were detailed in ''La Guerre Invisible'', a book by Leila Minano and Julia Pascual.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871236655|title=La guerre invisible: révélations sur les violences sexuelles dans l'armée française|last=Leila|first=Miñano|last2=Pascual|first2=Julia|publisher=Les Arènes|others=|year=2014|isbn=2352043026|location=Paris|pages=|language=fr|oclc=871236655}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' newspaper, the armed forces had not been required to report incidents or to keep statistics, and an official report acknowledged that awareness of the problem had been institutionally suppressed.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Following concerns expressed in 2004 by the UK Equal Opportunities Commission (now the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]]) about persistent sexual harassment in the British armed forces,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; a number of anonymised, official surveys have been undertaken. The first, in 2006, found that a male-dominated culture sexualised women and diminished their military competence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Among the comments made to researchers by male personnel about their female counterparts were: ‘Ok there are a few exceptions but on the whole they [women] shouldn’t be here.’; 'They're all [[lesbian]]s or [[slut]]s.'; and 'They are emotionally unstable.'&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The report found that 15% of women had had a 'particularly upsetting' experience of sexual harassment in the previous 12 months; the proportion rose to 20% in the youngest age group.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A similar survey in 2009 found the 8% of women in the army had had a ‘particularly upsetting’ experience in the previous 12 months, and the most recent survey, in 2015, found that 13% of women reported the same.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2017, a [[Panorama (TV series)|BBC ''Panorama'']] documentary found multiple cases of the sexual abuse of cadets from age 11 during the 1980s, and reported that the victims and their parents were discouraged from making a formal complaint or contacting the police.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The [[Ministry of Defence]] paid £2 million in 2012 and 2013 to settle allegations of the child sexual abuse of military cadets,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; and between 2012 and 2017 recorded a further 363 allegations, of which 282 were referred to the police.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Military sexual trauma|Sexual assault in the United States military}}In 2017, the Department of Defense reported that an estimated 14,900 military personnel were sexually assaulted in 2016,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; of whom 6,172 made an official complaint.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to an article published in ''[[Medscape]]'', up to 80% of women in the armed forces have been sexually harassed, and 25% have experienced a sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/781380_3|title=Mission Critical: Getting Vets With PTSD Back to Work|last=Meade|first=Barbara J|last2=Glenn|first2=Margaret K|date=2013-03-29|website=www.medscape.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315173801/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/781380_3|archive-date=2016-03-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology]], a '''tribe''' is a [[human]] [[social group]]. Exact definitions of what constitutes a tribe vary among anthropologists, and the term is itself considered controversial in academic circles in part due to its association with [[colonialism]]. In general use, the term may refer to people perceived by a population to be [[wikt:primitive|primitive]] and may have negative connotations. The concept is often contrasted with other social groups concepts, such as [[nation]]s, [[state (polity)|state]]s, and forms of [[kinship]].

In some places, such as [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|India]] and [[Tribe (Native American)|North America]], tribes are [[Polity|polities]] that have been granted legal recognition and limited autonomy by the national or federal government.

== Etymology ==
The word tribe first occurs in English in 12th-century [[Middle English]]-literature, in reference to the [[twelve tribes of Israel]]. The Middle English word is derived from Old French ''tribu'' and, in turn, from Latin ''tribus'' (plural ''tribūs''), in reference to a supposed tripartite division of the original Roman state along ethnic lines, into ''tribūs'' known as the ''Ramnes'' (or ''Ramnenses''), ''Tities'' (or ''Titienses''), and ''Luceres'', corresponding, according to [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], to the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], [[Sabines]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] respectively. The ''Ramnes'' were named after [[Romulus]], leader of the Latins, ''Tities'' after [[Titus Tatius]], leader of the Sabines, and ''Luceres'' after [[Lucumo]], leader of an Etruscan army that had assisted the Latins. In 242–240 BC, the [[Tribal Assembly]] (''comitia tributa'') in the [[Roman Republic]] included 35 tribes (four "urban tribes" and 31 "rural tribes"). According to [[Livy]], the three "tribes" were squadrons of cavalry, rather than ethnic divisions.

The term's ultimate etymology is uncertain, perhaps from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] roots ''tri-'' ("three") and ''bhew'' ("to be"). The classicist [[Gregory Nagy]] says,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Nagy]],''Greek Mythology and Poetics'', {{Page numbers needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing the linguist [[Émile Benveniste]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Émile Benveniste]], ''Origines de la formation des noms en indo-européen'',  {{Page numbers needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Umbrian]] ''trifu'' (equivalent of the Latin ''tribus'') is apparently derived from a combination of ''*tri-'' and ''*bhu-'', where the second element is cognate with the Greek root ''phúō'' φύω “to bring forth” and the Greek [[wikt:φυλή|''phulē'']] φυλή "clan, race, people" (plural ''phylai'' φυλαί). The Greek ''[[polis]]'' ("state" or "city") was, like the Roman state, divided into three ''phylai''.

In Europe during the late medieval era, the Bible was written mostly in [[New Latin]] and instead of ''tribus''  the word ''phyle'' was used, derived from the Greek ''phulē''&lt;!-- 'and ultimately the Hebrew, meaning or "sceptre" ' ← Commented this out as the connection, if any, is not at all clear  --&gt;. In the historical sense, "tribe", "race" and "clan" have often been used interchangeably.

==Usage controversy==
The term and concept of a ''tribe'' is controversial among anthropologists and other academics active in the [[social science]]s. The term ''tribe'' was in common use in the field of anthropology until the late 1950s and 1960s, during which time scholars began to reassess its utility. In 1970, anthropologist [[J. Clyde Mitchell]] writes:
:The tribe, a long respected category of analysis in anthropology, has recently been the object of some scrutiny by anthropologists ... Doubts about the utility of the tribe as an analytical category have almost certainly arisen out of the rapid involvement of peoples, even in the remotest parts of the globe, in political, economic and sometimes direct social relationship with industrial nations. The doubts, however, are based ultimately on the definition and meaning which different scholars give to the term 'tribe', its adjective 'tribal', and its abstract form 'tribalism'.&lt;ref name="MITCHELL-1970-83"&gt;Mitchell, Clyde J. 1970. "Tribe and Social Change in South Central Africa: A Situational Approach" in Gutkind, Peter C. W. Editor. ''The Passing of Tribal Man in Africa'', p. 83. [[Brill Publishers|Brill]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing in 2013, scholar Matthew Ortoleva notes that "like the word ''Indian'', ''[t]ribe'' is a word that has connotations of colonialism."&lt;ref name="ORTOLEVA-2013-95"&gt;Ortoleva, Matthew. 2013. "We Face East" in Goggin, Peter N. Editor. ''Environmental Rhetoric and Ecologies of Place'', p. 95. [[Routledge]]. {{ISBN|9781135922658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tribes and nations ==
Considerable debate has accompanied efforts to define and characterize tribes. When scholars use the term, they may perceive differences between pre-state tribes and contemporary tribes; there is also general controversy over [[cultural evolution]] and [[colonialism]].  In the popular imagination, tribes reflect a way of life that predates, and is more natural than that in modern states. Tribes also privilege primordial social ties and are clearly bounded, homogeneous, parochial, and stable.  Tribes are an organization among families (including clans and lineages), which generates a social and ideological basis for solidarity that is in some way more limited than that of an "ethnic group" or of a "nation".  [[Anthropology|Anthropological]] and [[Ethnohistory|ethnohistorical]] research has challenged all of these notions.

[[Cultural anthropology|Anthropologist]] [[Elman Service]] presented a [[Sociopolitical typology|system of classification]] for societies in all human cultures, based on the evolution of [[social inequality]] and the role of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. This system of classification contains four categories:

# [[Hunter-gatherer]] [[Band society|bands]] that are generally [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]]
# Tribal societies with some limited instances of [[social rank]] and prestige
# [[Social stratification|Stratified]] tribal societies led by [[tribal chief|chieftains]] (see [[Chiefdom]])
# [[Civilization]]s, with complex social hierarchies and organized, institutional governments

In his 1975 study, ''The Notion of the Tribe'', [[Cultural anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Morton Fried|Morton H. Fried]] provided numerous examples of tribes that encompassed members who spoke different languages and practiced different rituals, or who shared languages and rituals with members of other tribes.  Similarly, he provided examples of tribes in which people followed different political leaders, or followed the same leaders as members of other tribes.  He concluded that tribes in general are characterized by fluid boundaries and heterogeneity, are not parochial, and are dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Morton H. Fried (1972) ''The Notion of Tribe''.  Cummings Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isolierte-Völker.png|thumb|300px|A map of [[uncontacted tribes]], around the start of the 21st century]]
Fried proposed that most contemporary tribes do not have their origin in pre-state tribes, but rather in pre-state bands. Such "secondary" tribes, he suggested, developed as modern products of state expansion. Bands comprise small, mobile, and fluid social formations with weak [[leadership]]. They do not generate surpluses, pay no taxes, and support no standing army.  Fried argued that secondary tribes develop in one of two ways. First, states could set them up as means to extend administrative and economic influence in their hinterland, where direct political control costs too much. States would encourage (or require) people on their frontiers to form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses and taxes, and would have a leadership responsive to the needs of neighboring states (the so-called "scheduled" tribes of the United States or of British India provide good examples of this). Second, bands could form "secondary" tribes as a means to defend against state expansion. Members of bands would form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses that could support a standing army that could fight against states, and they would have a leadership that could co-ordinate economic production and military activities.

[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] continue to explore the development of pre-state tribes. Current research suggests that tribal structures constituted one type of adaptation to situations providing plentiful yet unpredictable resources. Such structures proved flexible enough to coordinate production and distribution of food in times of scarcity, without limiting or constraining people during times of surplus.

A '''woody plant''' is a [[plant]] that produces [[wood]] as its structural tissue. Woody plants are usually either [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, or [[liana]]s. These are usually [[perennial plant]]s whose stems and larger roots are reinforced with wood produced from secondary [[xylem]]. The main stem, larger branches, and roots of these plants are usually covered by a layer of [[Bark (botany)|bark]]. Wood is a structural [[cell (biology)|cellular]] adaptation that allows woody plants to grow from above ground stems year after year, thus making some woody plants the largest and tallest [[terrestrial plant]]s.

Wood is primarily composed of xylem cells with [[cell wall]]s made of [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]]. Xylem is a [[vascular tissue]] which moves water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves. Most woody plants form new layers of woody tissue each year, and so increase their stem diameter from year to year, with new wood deposited on the inner side of a [[vascular cambium]] layer located immediately beneath the bark. However, in some [[monocotyledons]] such as [[Arecaceae|palms]] and [[Dracaena (plant)|dracaenas]], the wood is formed in bundles scattered through the interior of the trunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chase |first=Mark W. |year=2004 |title=Monocot relationships: an overview |journal=[[American Journal of Botany|Am. J. Bot.]] |volume=91 |issue=10 |pages=1645–1655 |doi=10.3732/ajb.91.10.1645 |pmid=21652314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woody herbs are [[herbaceous plant]]s that develop hard woody stems. They include such plants as ''[[Uraria picta]]'' and certain species in family [[Polygonaceae]]. These herbs are not truly woody but have hard densely packed stem tissue. Other herbaceous plants have woody stems called a [[caudex]], which is a thickened stem base often found in plants that grow in [[alpine climate|alpine]] or dry environments.

Under specific conditions, woody plants may [[Decomposition|decay]] or may in time become [[petrified wood]].

The symbol for a woody plant, based on ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] is [[Image:Saturn symbol.svg|14px|♃]], which is also the [[astronomical symbol]] for the planet [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stearn |first=William T. |title=Botanical Latin |edition=Fourth |origyear=1966 |year=1992 |location=Portland |publisher=Timber Press |isbn=0881923214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57148">'''Xenoestrogens''' are a type of [[xenohormone]] that imitates [[estrogen]]. They can be either synthetic or natural [[chemical compound]]s.  Synthetic xenoestrogens include some widely used industrial compounds, such as [[Polychlorinated biphenyls|PCBs]], [[Bisphenol A|BPA]], and [[phthalates]], which have estrogenic effects on a living organism even though they differ chemically from the estrogenic substances produced internally by the [[endocrine system]] of any organism.  Natural xenoestrogens include [[phytoestrogen]]s which are plant-derived xenoestrogens.  Because the primary route of exposure to these compounds is by consumption of phytoestrogenic plants, they are sometimes called "dietary estrogens".  [[Mycoestrogen]]s, estrogenic substances from [[fungus|fungi]], are another type of xenoestrogen that are also considered [[mycotoxin]]s.

Xenoestrogens are clinically significant because they can mimic the effects of endogenous estrogen and thus have been implicated in [[precocious puberty]] and other disorders of the reproductive system.&lt;ref name="Aksglaede_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herman-Giddens_1997"/&gt;

Xenoestrogens include pharmacological estrogens (estrogenic action is an intended effect, as in the drug [[ethinylestradiol]] used in [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|contraceptive pill]]), but other chemicals may also have estrogenic effects. Xenoestrogens have been introduced into the environment by industrial, agricultural and chemical companies and consumers only in the last 70 years or so, but archiestrogens have been a ubiquitous part of the environment even before the existence of the human race given that some plants (like the cereals and the legumes) are using estrogenic substances possibly as part of their natural defence against [[herbivore]] animals by controlling their fertility.&lt;ref name="pmid3203635"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hughes CL | title = Phytochemical mimicry of reproductive hormones and modulation of herbivore fertility by phytoestrogens | journal = Environ.

Xenoestrogens are also called "environmental hormones" or "EDC" (Endocrine Disrupting Compounds).   Most scientists that study xenoestrogens, including [[The Endocrine Society]], regard them as serious environmental hazards that have [[Endocrine disruptor|hormone disruptive effects]] on both wildlife and humans.&lt;ref name="isbn0-911131-35-3"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bern HA |author2=Blair P |author3=Brasseur S |author4=Colborn T |author5=Cunha GR |author6=Davis W |author7=Dohler KD |author8=Fox G |author9=Fry M |author10=Gray E |author11=Green R |author12=Hines M |author13=Kubiak TJ |author14=McLachlan J |author15=Myers JP |author16=Peterson RE |author17=Reijnders P.J.H. |author18=Soto A |author19=Van Der Kraak G |author20=vom Saal F |author21=Whitten P |veditors=Clement C, Colborn T | title = Chemically-induced alterations in sexual and functional development -- the wildlife/human connection | chapter =  Statement from the Work Session on Chemically-Induced Alterations in Sexual Development: The Wildlife/Human Connection | edition = | language = | publisher = Princeton Scientific Pub.

== Mechanism of action ==
The onset of puberty is characterized by increased levels of hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH triggers the secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) from the [[anterior pituitary gland]], which in turn causes the ovaries to respond and secrete [[estradiol]].  Increases in gonadal estrogen promote breast development, female fat distribution and skeletal growth.  Adrenal androgen and gonadal androgen result in pubic and axillary hair.&lt;ref name="Speroff_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt; Peripheral precocious puberty caused by exogenous estrogens is evaluated by assessing decreased levels of gonadotrophins.&lt;ref name="Massart_2006"/&gt;

Hormones or substances with hormone disrupting capability may interfere with pubertal development by actions at different levels – hypothalamic-pituitary axis, gonads, peripheral target organs such as the breast, hair follicles and genitals.  Exogenous man made chemicals that mimic estrogen can alter the functions of the endocrine system and cause various health defects by interfering with synthesis, metabolism, binding or cellular responses of natural estrogens.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toppari_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caserta_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danzo_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Danzo BJ | title = The effects of environmental hormones on reproduction | journal = Cell.

Although the physiology of the reproductive system is complex, the action of environmental exogenous estrogens is hypothesized to occur by two possible mechanisms. Xenoestrogens may temporarily or permanently alter the feedback loops in the brain, pituitary, gonads, and thyroid by mimicking the effects of estrogen and triggering their specific receptors or they may bind to hormone receptors and block the action of natural hormones.  Thus it is plausible that environmental estrogens can accelerate sexual development if present in a sufficient concentration or with chronic exposure.&lt;ref name="Toppari_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danzo_1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Louis_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raiser_2006"/&gt; The similarity in the structure of exogenous estrogens and the estrogens has changed the hormone balance within the body and resulted in various reproductive problems in females.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt; The overall mechanism of action is binding of the exogenous compounds that mimic estrogen to the estrogen binding receptors and cause the determined action in the target organs.&lt;ref name="Mueller_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mueller SO | title = Xenoestrogens: mechanisms of action and detection methods | journal = Anal Bioanal Chem | volume = 378 | issue = 3 | pages = 582–7 |date=February 2004 | pmid = 14564443 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-003-2238-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenoestrogens have been implicated in a variety of medical problems, and during the last 10 years many scientific studies have found hard evidence of adverse effects on human and animal health.{{refn|&lt;ref name="pmid14657511"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aravindakshan J, Paquet V, Gregory M, Dufresne J, Fournier M, Marcogliese DJ, Cyr DG | title = Consequences of xenoestrogen exposure on male reproductive function in spottail shiners (Notropis hudsonius) | journal = Toxicol.

There is a concern that xenoestrogens may act as false messengers and disrupt the process of [[reproduction]]. Xenoestrogens, like all estrogens, can increase growth of the [[endometrium]], so treatments for [[endometriosis]] include avoidance of products which contain them. Likewise, they are avoided in order to prevent the onset or aggravation of [[adenomyosis]]. Studies have implicated observations of disturbances in wildlife with estrogenic exposure.  For example, discharge from human settlement including runoff and water flowing out of wastewater treatment plants release a large amount of xenoestrogens into streams, which lead to immense alterations in aquatic life.  With a [[bioaccumulation]] factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; –10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, fish are extremely susceptible to pollutants.&lt;ref name="Williams_1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams DE, Lech JJ, Buhler DR | title = Xenobiotics and xenoestrogens in fish: modulation of cytochrome P450 and carcinogenesis | journal = Mutat.

It reduces the flexibility of the uterine walls.

When comparing fish from above a wastewater treatment plant and below a wastewater treatment plant, studies found disrupted ovarian and testicular histopathology, gonadal intersex, reduced gonad size, vitellogenin induction, and altered sex ratios.&lt;ref name="Vajda_2008"/&gt;

The sex ratios are female biased because xenoestrogens interrupt gonadal configuration causing complete or partial sex reversal.  When comparing adjacent populations of white sucker fish, the exposed female fish can have up to five oocyte stages and asynchronously developing ovaries versus the unexposed female fish who usually have two oocyte stages and group-synchronously developing ovaries.  Previously, this type of difference has only been found between tropical and temperate species.&lt;ref name="Vajda_2008"/&gt;

Sperm concentrations and motility perimeters are reduced in male fish exposed to xenoestrogens in addition to disrupt stages of spermatogenesis.&lt;ref name="pmid15159524"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vajda_2008"/&gt;  Moreover, xenoestrogens have been leading to vast amounts of intersex in fish.  For example, one study indicates the numbers of intersex in white sucker fish to be equal to the number of males in the population downstream of a waste water treatment plant.  No intersex members were found upstream from the plant.  Also, they found differences in the proportion of testicular and ovarian tissue and its degree of organization between the intersex fish.&lt;ref name="Vajda_2008"/&gt;  Furthermore, xenoestrogens expose fish to CYP1A inducers through inhibiting a putative labile protein and enhancing the Ah receptor, which has been linked to epizootics of cancer and the initiation of tumors.&lt;ref name="Williams_1998"/&gt;

The induction of CYP1A has been established to be a good bioindicator for xenoestrogen exposure.  In addition, xenoestrogens stimulate vitellogenin (Vtg), which acts as a nutrient reserve, and Zona readiata proteins (Zrp), which forms eggshells.  Therefore, Vtg and Zrp are biomarkers to exposure for fish.&lt;ref name="pmid10856602"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arukwe A, Celius T, Walther BT, Goksøyr A | title = Effects of xenoestrogen treatment on zona radiata protein and vitellogenin expression in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) | journal = Aquat.

It has been suggested that very low levels of a xenoestrogen, [[Bisphenol A]], could affect fetal neural signalling more than higher levels, indicating that classical models where dose equals response may not be applicable in susceptible tissue.&lt;ref name="pmid16123166"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zsarnovszky A, Le HH, Wang HS, Belcher SM | title = Ontogeny of rapid estrogen-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in the rat cerebellar cortex: potent nongenomic agonist and endocrine disrupting activity of the xenoestrogen bisphenol A | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 146 | issue = 12 | pages = 5388–96 |date=December 2005 | pmid = 16123166 | doi = 10.1210/en.2005-0565  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As this study involved intra-cerebellar injections, its relevance to environmental exposures is unclear, as is the role of an estrogenic effect compared to some other toxic effect of bisphenol A.

=== Impact ===

The ubiquitous presence of such estrogenic substances is a significant health concern, both individually and for a population. Life relies on the transmission of biochemical information to the next generation, and the presence of xenoestrogens may interfere with this transgenerational information process through "chemical confusion" (Vidaeff and Sever),&lt;ref name="pmid15808781"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vidaeff AC, Sever LE | title = In utero exposure to environmental estrogens and male reproductive health: a systematic review of biological and epidemiologic evidence | journal = Reprod.

Agencies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[World Health Organization]] [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] are charged to address these issues.

==== Tuscany precocious puberty cases ====
Dr. Massart and colleagues from the [[University of Pisa]] studied the increased prevalence of precocious puberty in a region of northwest Tuscany. This region of Italy is represented by a high density of navy yards and greenhouses where exposures to pesticides and mycoestrogens (estrogens produced by fungi) are common.   Although unable to identify a definitive cause of the high rates of precocious puberty, the authors concluded environmental pesticides and herbicides may be implicated.&lt;ref name="Massart_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Massart F, Meucci V, Saggese G, Soldani G | title = High growth rate of girls with precocious puberty exposed to estrogenic mycotoxins | journal = J.

==== Dairy contamination ====
Animal feed was contaminated with several thousand pounds of polybrominated biphenyl in Michigan in 1973 resulting in high exposures of PBB in the population via milk and other products from contaminated cows.  Perinatal exposure of children was estimated by measuring PBB in serum of mothers some years after exposure.  Girls that had been exposed to high PBB levels through lactation had an earlier age of menarche and pubic hair development than girls who had less perinatal exposure.  The study noted there no differences found in the timing of breast development among the cases and controls.&lt;ref name="Toppari_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raiser_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogan_2007"/&gt;

==== Fish contamination ====
The Great Lakes have been polluted with industrial wastes (mainly PCBs and DDT) since the beginning of the 20th century.  These compounds have accumulated in birds and sports fish.  A study was designed to assess the impact of consumption of contaminated fish on pregnant women and their children.  Concentrations of maternal serum PCB and DDE and their daughters' age at menarche were reviewed.  In multivariate analysis, DDE but not PCB was linked with a lowered age of menarche.&lt;ref name="Raiser_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Den_Hond_Schoeters_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogan_2007"/&gt; Limitations of the study included indirect measurement of the exposure and self reporting of menarche.&lt;ref name="Raiser_2006"/&gt;

==== Implications ====

Precocious puberty has numerous significant physical, psychological and social implications for a young girl. Unfortunately, premature pubertal growth spurt and accelerated bone maturation will result in premature closure of [[distal]] [[epiphysis]] which causes reduced adult height and short stature.&lt;ref name="Cesario_Hughes_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cesario SK, Hughes LA | title = Precocious puberty: a comprehensive review of literature | journal = J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 263–74 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17489932 | doi = 10.1111/j.1552-6909.2007.00145.x | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, US Food and Drug Administration has recommended to not take estrogen in food of more than 3.24&amp;nbsp;ng per day for females.&lt;ref name="Partsch_Sippell_2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Partsch CJ, Sippell WG | title = Pathogenesis and epidemiology of precocious puberty.

The current literature is inadequate to provide the information we need to assess the extent to which environmental chemicals contribute to precocious puberty.&lt;ref name="Wang_2005"/&gt; Gaps in our knowledge are the result of limitations in the designs of studies, small sample sizes, challenges to conducting exposure assessment and the few number of chemicals studied.&lt;ref name="Wang_2005"/&gt; Unfortunately exposure is inferred and not actually measured in available studies.&lt;ref name="Caserta_2008"/&gt; The ability to detect the possible role of chemicals in altering pubertal development is confounded by many nutritional, genetic and lifestyle factors capable of affecting puberty and the complex nature of the reproductive endocrine system.&lt;ref name="Guillette_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meeker_2009"/&gt; Other research challenges include shifts in exposure levels among populations over time and simultaneous exposures to multiple compounds.&lt;ref name="Meeker_2009"/&gt; Overall the literature does not with certainty support the contention that environmental chemicals or dietary factors are having widespread effects on human sexual development.  However data does not refute such a hypothesis either.  Accelerated sexual development is plausible in individuals exposed to high concentration of estrogenic substances.  There is a concerning steady increase in exposure to a wide variety of xenoestrogens in the industrial world.  Further research is needed to assess the impact of these compounds on pubertal development.

=== In other animals ===

Non-human animal studies have shown that exposure to environmental contaminants with estrogenic activity can accelerate the onset of puberty.

== Common environmental estrogens ==

=== Atrazine ===
[[Atrazine]] is widely used as an herbicide to control broad-leaf weed species that grow in crops such as corn, sugarcane, hay and winter wheat. Atrazine is also applied to Christmas trees, residential lawns, golf courses, and other recreational areas. Atrazine is the second largest selling pesticide in the world and estimated to be the most heavily used herbicide in the United States.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt;

=== BPA ===
BPA ([[Bisphenol A]]) is the monomer used to manufacture [[polycarbonate]] plastic and epoxy resins used as a lining in most food and beverage cans.

=== DDT ===
DDT ([[Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane]]) was widely used in pesticides for agriculture until it was banned in 1972 in the United States due to its hazardous effects on the environment. DDT continues to be used in many parts of the world for agricultural use, insect control and to fight the spread of malaria.  DDT and its metabolites DDE and DDD are persistent in the environment and accumulate in fatty tissues.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roy JR, Chakraborty S, Chakraborty TR | title = Estrogen-like endocrine disrupting chemicals affecting puberty in humans--a review | journal = Med.

=== Dioxin ===
[[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|Dioxin]], a group of highly toxic chemicals are released during combustion processes, pesticide manufacturing and [[Bleaching of wood pulp#Chlorine and hypochlorite|chlorine bleaching]] of [[wood pulp]].  Dioxin is discharged into waterways from pulp and paper mills.  Consumption of animals fats is thought to be the primary pathway for human exposure.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caserta_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobson-Dickman_Lee_2009"/&gt;

=== Endosulfan ===
[[Endosulfan]] is an insecticide used on numerous vegetables, fruits, cereal grains and trees. Endosulfan can be produced as a liquid concentrate, wettable powder or smoke tablet. Human exposure occurs through food consumption or ground and surface water contamination.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson_2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Watson CS, Jeng YJ, Guptarak J | title = Endocrine disruption via estrogen receptors that participate in nongenomic signaling pathways | journal = J.

=== PBB ===
PBB ([[Polybrominated biphenyls]]) are chemicals added to plastics used in computer monitors, televisions, textiles and plastics foams to make them more difficult to burn.  Manufacturing of PBBs in the United States stopped in 1976, however because they do not degrade easily PBBs continue to be found in soil, water and air.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raiser_2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rasier G, Toppari J, Parent AS, Bourguignon JP | title = Female sexual maturation and reproduction after prepubertal exposure to estrogens and endocrine disrupting chemicals: a review of rodent and human data | journal = Mol.

===PCBs===
PCBs ([[Polychlorinated biphenyls]]) are man made organic chemicals known as [[Organochloride|chlorinated hydrocarbons]].  PCBs were manufactured primarily for use as insulating fluids and coolants given their chemical stability, low flammability and electrical insulating properties.  PCBs were banned in 1979 but like DDT continue to persist in the environment.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caserta_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogan_2007"/&gt;

===Phthalates===
[[Phthalates]] are plasticizers providing durability and flexibility to plastics such as polyvinyl chloride. High molecular weight phthalates are used in [[flooring]], wall coverings and medical device such as intravenous bags and tubing.  Low molecular weight phthalates are found in perfumes, lotions, cosmetics, varnishes, lacquers and coatings including timed releases in pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Patisaul_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nilsson_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nilsson R | title = Endocrine modulators in the food chain and environment | journal = Toxicol Pathol | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 420–31 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10862560 | doi =10.1177/019262330002800311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zeranol===
[[Zeranol]] is currently used as an anabolic growth promoter for [[livestock]] in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=US Food and Drug Administration|title=21CFR522.2680|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=522.2680|accessdate=14 June 2014|ref=21CFR522.2680}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Health Canada|title=Questions and Answers - Hormonal Growth Promoters|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/vet/faq/growth_hormones_promoters_croissance_hormonaux_stimulateurs-eng.php|accessdate=14 June 2014|quote=There are six hormonal growth promoters approved in Canada for use in beef cattle: three natural - progesterone, testosterone and estradiol-17ß; and three synthetic - trenbolone acetate (TBA), zeranol and melengestrol acetate (MGA).}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been banned in the [[EU]] since 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agriculture and Fisheries (including Agro-industry, Food technologies, Forestry, Aquaculture and Rural Development) |title=Development, validation and harmonisation of screening and confirmatory tests to distinguish zeranol abuse from fusarium toxin contamination in food animals |url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/agro/fair/en/uk3443.html |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=14 June 2014 |quote=The use of zeranol for growth promotion in food animals was banned in the EU in 1985. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305071349/http://ec.europa.eu/research/agro/fair/en/uk3443.html |archivedate=March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is still present as a contaminant in food through meat products that were exposed to it.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt;
