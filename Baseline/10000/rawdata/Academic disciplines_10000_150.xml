'''Active citizenship''' refers to a [[philosophy]] espoused by organizations and educational institutions which advocates that members of [[Charitable organization|charitable organizations]], companies or [[nation-state]]s have certain roles and responsibilities to [[society]] and the [[Natural environment|environment]], although those members may not have specific governing roles.

== Description ==

Active citizenship can be seen as an articulation of the debate over [[rights]] versus [[moral responsibility|responsibilities]]. If a body gives rights to the people under its remit, then those same people might have certain responsibilities to uphold. This would be most obvious at a [[country]] or nation-state level, but could also be of wider scope, such as the Internet ([[Netizen]]) or Earth ([[global citizenship]]). The implication is that an active citizen is one who fulfils both their rights and responsibilities in a balanced way.

A problem with this concept is that although rights are often written down as part of the law, responsibilities are not as well defined, and there may be disagreements amongst the citizens as to what the responsibilities are. For example, in the [[UK|United Kingdom]], citizens have the right to free health care, but [[voting]] in [[elections]] is not compulsory, even though many people would define this as a responsibility.

Writing a clear definition of responsibilities for an active citizen is much more problematic than writing a list of rights. For example, although voting might be considered a basic responsibility by many people, there are some who through [[disability]] or other issues are not able to [[Participation (decision making)|participate]] fully in the voting process.

An active citizen is someone who takes a role in the community; the term has been identified with volunteering by writers such as Jonathan Tisch, who wrote in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' in 2010 advocating that busy Americans should try to help others, particularly by offering high-level professional expertise in such areas as [[banking]], [[education]], [[engineering]], and [[technology]] to help the less fortunate.&lt;ref name=twsJun16xxx&gt;{{cite news

 |title= Active Citizenship: A New Approach to Volunteering
 |publisher= ''Huffington Post''
 |quote= I introduced Citizen You, the movement I've spearheaded to encourage Americans to utilize their professional skills to help others. This new kind of volunteering, which has come to be known as "active citizenship," is a fresh, innovative solution to an old problem: Countless busy Americans would love to help others, but simply don't have the time to figure out the perfect way to be useful. What could be more useful than applying high-level professional expertise -- in banking, law, education, engineering, technology, and other fields -- toward problems faced by those who are less fortunate?

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Active citizenship is considered an OoF by some due to its vague definition. Examples include volunteering, donating, and recycling.

== Examples of active citizenship in education ==
Due to concerns over such things as a lack of OoF in elections (reflected by low voter turnout), the British Government launched a [[Citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] programme several years ago. Citizenship education is now compulsory in UK schools up to 14 and is often available as an option beyond that age.

In [[Scotland]], UK, active citizenship has been one of the three major themes of [[community]] [[policy]] since [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library/documents-w3/cctl-00.htm The Osler Report (section 6.6)] in 1998. The [[Scottish Government|Scottish Government's]] 2009 guidelines for [[Community learning and development]], [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/02/18793/32157 Working and Learning Together], has active citizenship as a target within other policy aims. Britain has a points-based [[immigration]] system, and in 2009 was Oofed a probationary period for newly admitted immigrants which would examine, in part, how well they were being so-called ''active citizens''.&lt;ref name=twsJun16yyy&gt;{{cite news

 |quote= Becoming British just got trickier. Under a new government proposal announced on Aug. 3, would-be Brits may have to work a little bit harder to get their citizenship when a second test is added to the country's points-based immigration system. If the plan goes through, applicants would serve a term as "probationary citizens," winning or losing points on the path to the passport depending on how well they fit into British society. Critics have also attacked the ways points could be awarded. Some worry that the "active citizenship" fast track would coerce candidates into volunteering,

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Denmark]], "active citizenship" is part of the curriculum in ''Danish teacher's Education''. The course is defined as 36 lessons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emu.dk/sem/fag/klm/ Curriculum in Danish]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], there is an [http://activecit.mohawkcollege.ca/ Active Citizenship Course] being run at Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. It is a compulsory course that is delivered by the Language Studies Department to all students at the college.
Organizations that cite active citizenship as part of their mission or vision statement include the following:

*[[Omidyar Network]]
*[[Active Citizenship Network]]
*[[Minnesota Active Citizenship Initiative (MACI)]]
*[[Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service]]

In the [[United States]], writer [[Catherine Crier]] wondered in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' about whether Americans had lost sight of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s sense of ''active citizenship''. Crier lamented how Americans have tended to neglect participating in voluntary associations, and tend to live as "strangers apart from the rest", quoting [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name=twsJun16zzz1&gt;{{cite news
 |author= Catherine Crier
 |title= A Degree in Citizenship
 |publisher= ''Huffington Post''
 |quote= [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], described our challenge over a century ago in his monumental work, Democracy in America. So clearly did he see the strength of a democracy and the weakness of human character, his words might have been written today. He said, in summary, that our real power as a people came through voluntary associations. Our personal freedoms would be protected if we could voluntarily resolve the problems of society, rather than permit the heavy hand of government to do it for us. But he recognized our great weakness--the willingness to live 'as strangers apart from the rest'.... we Americans have failed to shoulder our responsibilities. The qualities of active citizenship that Jefferson ascribed to us have not been realized, nor have our appointed leaders lived up to their noble assignment.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, writer Eboo Patel in ''[[Newsweek]]'' suggested that president [[Barack Obama|Obama]] had a somewhat different sense of active citizenship, meaning strong families, a vibrant civic center in which persons of different faiths and secular backgrounds work together, with government acting as a "catalyst."&lt;ref name=twsJun16zzz2&gt;{{cite news
 |author= Eboo Patel
 |title= The Faith Divide

 |quote= Barack Obama's vision of the good society is based on the idea of strong families, a vibrant civic sector that includes groups from various faith and secular backgrounds working together, and a government that serves as a catalyst, a convener and a capacity-builder, while always respecting the line between church and state. And Barack Obama's Faith Council gives me a vision for what active citizenship in that good society can look like.

{{Anthropology}}
'''[[Anthropology of development|Anthropology]] of media''' (also '''anthropology of mass media''', '''media anthropology''') is an area of study within [[social anthropology|social]] or [[cultural anthropology]] that emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of [[mass media]].

==Methodology==
The use of [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods, particularly [[ethnography]], distinguishes media anthropology from other disciplinary approaches to mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Faye Ginsburg, Lila Abu-Lughod &amp; Brian Larkin. (2002) ''Media Worlds: Anthropology of New Terrain''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within [[media studies]], media ethnographies have been of increasing interest since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;David Morley. (1980) ''The âNationwideâ Audience: Structure and Decoding''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ien Ang. (1991) ''Desperately Seeking the Audience''&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Stephen Putnam Hughes remarks in a recent review, these studies often do not engage in rigorous ethnographic fieldwork, ignoring or misapplying such landmark anthropological techniques as [[participant observation]] or long-term fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Putnam Hughes. (2011). 'Anthropology and the Problem of Audience Reception', in Marcus Banks &amp; Jay Ruby. ''Made to be Seen: Perspectives on the History of Visual Anthropology''&lt;/ref&gt; Given such differences, anthropologists who take an interest in the media see themselves as forming a distinct subfield from ethnographic approaches to [[media studies]] and [[cultural studies]].

==Theory==
The anthropology of media is a fairly inter-disciplinary area, with a wide range of other influences. The theories used in the anthropology of media range from practice approaches, associated with theorists such as [[Pierre Bourdieu]], as well as discussions of the appropriation and adaptation of new technologies and practices.  Theoretical approaches have also been adopted from [[visual anthropology]] and from [[film theory]], as well as from studies of ritual and performance studies (e.g. dance and theatre), studies of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], audience reception in media studies, [[new media]] and network theories, theories of [[globalisation]], theories of international [[civil society]], and discussions on participatory communications and [[governance]] in [[development studies]].

==Ethnographic contexts==
The types of ethnographic contexts explored in the anthropology of media range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, [[journalists]] in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media such as newspaper cartoons (Khanduri 2014).  Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movements]], human rights &lt;ref&gt;Wortham, Erica (2013) Indigenous Media in Mexico: Culture, Community and the State (Duke University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as [[radio]], [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]] and [[television]](Mankekar 1999, Abu-Lughod 2005) have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Spitulnik. (1993) 'Anthropology and Mass Media', ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', 22: 293-315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lila Abu-Lughod. (1997) 'The Interpretation of Cultures after Television', ''Representations'', 59: 109-133&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate change and species range shifts ===
[[Climate change]] is expected to drive many species out of parts of their current [[species distribution|ranges]] while creating new suitable habitats elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature02121 |pmid=14712274 |last1=Thomas |first1=C.

=== Assisted colonization vs. species introduction ===
Assisted colonization is a specific type of [[introduced species|species introduction]]. An introduction is any act of establishing a species in a habitat it does not currently occupy. It often refers to a long-distance relocation, such as the accidental introduction of an [[invasive species]] from one continent to another, or the intentional relocation of a species in decline to a habitat where it can persist. By contrast, assisted colonization acknowledges that the natural [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] rate of many species may be too slow to naturally respond to rapid human-caused environmental change and asks, âif this species could disperse fast enough to keep pace with the changing environment, where would it establish?â Assisted colonization practitioners consider helping the species disperse into such sites, which are often immediately adjacent to the speciesâ historical range.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hunter | first1 = M. L. | title = Climate Change and Moving Species: Furthering the Debate on Assisted Colonization | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00780.x | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 1356â1358 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17883502| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted colonization thus represents a small artificial boost to an otherwise natural process, acknowledging that the threatârapid human-caused environmental changeâwas produced by humans in the first place. Confusion of assisted colonization with species introduction in generalâoften much larger in scale and with greater risk of adverse impactsâmay be the principal reason why some are reluctant to consider assisted colonization (see [[#Controversy|Controversy]], below).&lt;ref name=Mueller&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mueller | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Hellmann | first2 = J.

=== Terminology ===
When first proposed, the idea was referred to as âassisted migrationâ.&lt;ref name=McLachlanH/&gt; The terminology was later criticized for being reminiscent of natural, cyclic animal migrations in response to changing seasons.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; It was renamed âassisted colonization,â as colonization more accurately describes the natural phenomenon that management would seek to assist. Others have sought to further distinguish this idea from any natural process by referring to it as âmanaged relocation.â&lt;ref name=Sax&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sax | first1 = D.

=== Acclimatization and adaptation as alternatives to colonization ===
Even under rapid climate change, dispersal into new areas may not be necessary for some species to persist. Instead of tracking climate shifts through space, some species may be able to survive in their present locations by developing tolerance to new conditions through [[acclimatization]] and/or [[adaptation]].&lt;ref name=Rice&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rice|first1=Kevin J.|last2=Emery|first2=Nancy C.|year=2003|title=Managing microevolution: Restoration in the face of global change|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|volume=1|issue=9|pages=469â478|doi=10.2307/3868114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skelly"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Skelly | first1 = D.

One study determined that evolution of higher temperature tolerance in some species of amphibians and reptiles will likely occur fast enough to allow these species to survive a 3&amp;nbsp;Â°C temperature increase over 100 years, consistent with low- to mid-range projections of global warming.&lt;ref name=Skelly/&gt; By contrast, many species, such as most [[temperate]] trees, have longer generation times and therefore may adapt more slowly; they may take thousands of years to evolve a similar increase in temperature tolerance.&lt;ref name=Rice/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skelly/&gt; Adaptation this slow would be insufficient for keeping up with expected future global warming if colonization of new habitats is not an option.

== Types ==
Generally speaking, there are three accepted ways that assisted colonization can take place, each one of them with specific benefits and situations in which it applies. They can be defined as reintroduction, introduction and augmentation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Weeks|first = Andrew R|last2 = Sgro|first2 = Carla M|last3 = Young|first3 = Andrew G|last4 = Frankham|first4 = Richard|last5 = Mitchell|first5 = Nicki J|last6 = Miller|first6 = Kim A|last7 = Byrne|first7 = Margaret|last8 = Coates|first8 = David J|last9 = Eldridge|first9 = Mark D B|date = 2011-11-01|title = Assessing the benefits and risks of translocations in changing environments: a genetic perspective|journal = Evolutionary Applications|volume = 4|issue = 6|pages = 709â725|doi = 10.1111/j.1752-4571.2011.00192.x|issn = 1752-4571|pmc = 3265713|pmid = 22287981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Augmentation ===
In augmentation, a population is identified with a small number of mating individuals. This can lead to many problems, including inbreeding depression, and often leads to a dwindling number of individuals. Further complicating matters, with such a small population and consistent inbreeding depression, genetic drift is of worry as well, leading to high levels of homozygosity. To combat these problems, individuals are reintroduced to the population. This can be done via ''ex situ'' breeding of individuals or by physically relocating a separate population to join the identified, problematic population.

=== Introduction ===
In introduction, a species is brought to a habitat in which it has never before existed. This can be done for a number of reasons, ranging from climate change associated habitat loss to the introduction of predator species that cannot be controlled. Generally speaking, this is the type of assisted colonization that contains the most potential for harmful effects, like those described elsewhere in this article. Currently, a number of introductions of endangered populations from Australia have been made with varying degrees of success to small islands near the mainland where the only reason that the population had not dispersed before was due to the physical waterway.

=== Reintroduction ===
Reintroductions involve restoring a species to its native range. The species may no longer be found there due to any number of reasons, though most common is often the introduction of predators or habitat loss due to either climate change or other human factors. This is generally done to broaden the range of threatened populations and to reconnect fragmented populations.

==Controversy==
Significant controversy has developed around the idea of assisted colonization since it was first put forth in the scientific literature in 2007.&lt;ref name=McLachlanH/&gt; The two sides can be separated roughly as follows. Supports generally believe that the expected benefits of assisted colonization, including saving and strengthening species, outweighs the potential harm of any project. Detractors generally believe that other conservation techniques which do not include the high risk of invasive species are not only better suited but are also more likely to succeed. This debate continues throughout the literature generally due to a lack of real-world applications and follow-ups. Though these conservation efforts are becoming increasingly common, few long term looks at their success have been conducted.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt;

===Invasive species risk===
Perhaps the principal concern scientists have expressed over assisted colonization is the potential for relocated species to be invasive in their new habitats, driving out native species.&lt;ref name=Simberloff&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ricciardi | first1 = A. | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2008.12.006 | title = Assisted colonization is not a viable conservation strategy | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 248 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear that assisted colonization will facilitate invasions stems mostly from observations of the vast numbers of species that have become invasive outside their native ranges by (often inadvertent) introduction by humans. Although most agree that assisted colonization efforts, unlike accidental introductions, should involve detailed planning and risk assessment, for some, any threat of introducing invasive species, no matter how small, disqualifies assisted colonization as a viable management response to climate change.&lt;ref name=Simberloff/&gt;

Those who wish to keep assisted colonization on the table often note that the vast majority of historical species invasions have resulted from continent-to-continent or continent-to-island transportation of species and that very few invasions have resulted from the comparatively short-distance, within-continent movement of species proposed for assisted colonization.&lt;ref name=Mueller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sax/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoegh&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hoegh-Guldberg | first1 = O. | last2 = Hughes | first2 = L. | last3 = McIntyre | first3 = S. | last4 = Lindenmayer | first4 = D.

Terrestrial species that became invasive on the same continent where they originated were often transported across large biogeographic barriers, such as mountain ranges. These long-distance, within-continent translocations are unlike expected uses of assisted colonization, which generally involve helping species colonize habitats immediately adjacent to their current ranges.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

===Uncertainty in the planning process===
To identify populations at risk and locate new potential habitats, conservationists often use [[Environmental niche modelling|Niche models]]. These models predict the suitability of habitats in the future based on how closely their climates resemble the climate currently inhabited by the species. Though useful for describing broad trends, these models make a number of unrealistic assumptions that restrict the usefulness of their predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dawson | first1 = T.

The uncertainties in predictions of future suitable habitat limits confidence in assisted colonization decisions and has led some to reject assisted colonization entirely.&lt;ref name=Simberloff/&gt;

Despite the uncertainty inherent in predictions of future suitable habitat, some studies have demonstrated that predictions can be quite accurate. A study of Hesperia comma butterflies in Britain identified unoccupied habitat sites that were likely to support the species under a warmer climate based on their similarity to occupied sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lawson | first1 = C.

The data suggested that the suitable, uncolonized sites could be good targets for assisted colonization. The results suggested that if investigators can demonstrate their model makes reliable predictions with real-world data, models might be trusted for informing assisted colonization decisions.

===Weighing the risks and benefits===

The science is clear that climate change will drive many species extinct, and a traditional, land-preservation ethic will not prevent extinctions.&lt;ref name=McLachlanH/&gt; Those wary of moving species instead suggest expanding networks of [[habitat corridor]]s, allowing species to naturally migrate into newly suitable areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Krosby | first1 = M. | last2 = Tewksbury | first2 = J. | last3 = Haddad | first3 = N.

Evidence suggests that slowly evolving and slowly dispersing species (including species that are dispersal-limited due to [[habitat fragmentation]]) will decline or go extinct in the absence of assisted colonization programs.&lt;ref name=Hoegh/&gt;

In their rejection of assisted colonization, Ricciardi and Simberloff cite the precautionary principle, stating that any unknown risk, no matter how small, of assisted colonization resulting in the creation of new invasive species is enough to require that it not be undertaken.&lt;ref name=Simberloff/&gt; Many scientists reject this position, however, noting that in many cases where extinctions due to climate change are likely, the risks of extinction from not facilitating colonization are probably far worse than the risks of facilitating colonization.&lt;ref name=Sax/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt; They argue that the precautionary principle cuts both ways, and the risks of inaction must be compared against the risks of action. Others note that the ethics of assisting colonization will depend on the values of the stakeholders involved in a specific decision rather than the position of scientists on assisted colonization in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schlaepfer | first1 = M.

Many therefore believe we should strive to maintain biodiversity and functioning ecosystems in the face of climate change, even if it means actively moving species beyond their native ranges.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt; In the absence of assisted colonization, climate change is already causing many highly mobile species, such as butterflies, to colonize areas they have not previously inhabited.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt; Through assisted colonization, managers could help rare or less-mobile species keep pace, possibly preventing future extinctions due to a their inability to colonize new areas fast enough. Though some argue that nature often responds to challenges more effectively in the absence of human intervention, others note that current climate change, itself, is a human intervention.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt; Many species that would have been effective dispersers under slower, natural climate change may be left behind by more mobile species under current rates of human-caused climate change. Thus, through changing the climate, humans may already be artificially segregating species even without actively relocating them.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt;

Critics may also have major concerns about different genetic issues when considering assisted colonization such as maladaptation to novel environmental conditions and hybridization with similar species. These often depend on the genetic structure and level of genetic variation in the source populations. The environmental conditions in which these populations are being introduced must also be taken into account. In order to enhance genetic variation, and thus adaptive potential, material could be sourced from multiple populations. This is known as composite provenancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Broadhurst|first1=Linda|title=Seed supply for broadscale restoration: maximizing evolutionary potential|journal=Evolutionary Applications|date=4 September 2008|volume=1|issue=4|pages=587â597|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2008.00045.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the environmental gradient is well known, such as predictable changes in elevation or aridity, source populations should be âgenetically matchedâ to recipient sites as best as possible to ensure that the translocated individuals ae not maladapted. This strategy of moving species beyond their current range has been suggested for those that are severely threatened or endangered. By moving them outside their native range, hopefully the immediate threats of predation, disease, and habitat loss can be avoided. However, these species are usually already suffering from some sort of genetic issue resulting from low effective population size such as inbreeding depression, loss in genetic diversity, or maladaptation. Therefore, caution must be taken with what few individuals remain and rapid population growth must be the primary goal. In the case of some species, this can be accomplished with a captive breeding program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weeks|first1=Andrew|last2=Sgro|first2=Carla|last3=Young|first3=Andrew|last4=Frankham|first4=Richard|last5=Mitchell|first5=Nicki|last6=Byrne|first6=Margaret|last7=Coates|first7=David|last8=Eldridge|first8=Mark|last9=Sunnucks|first9=Paul|last10=Breed|first10=Martin|last11=James|first11=Elizabeth|last12=Hoffmann|first12=Ary|title=Assessing the benefits and risks of translocations in changing environments: a genetic perspective|journal=Evolutionary Applications|date=18 June 2011|volume=4|issue=6|pages=709â725|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2011.00192.x|pmid=22287981|pmc=3265713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Approximately 300 million tree seedlings are planted in the western USA, British Columbia (BC) and Yukon each year. Many climatologists are predicting that the climate could be 3â4Â°C warmer when those trees are harvested 60-80 years after planting. These changes to climate will expose trees to increased stress and health risks, compromising the many goods and services from our forests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hre/forgen/interior/AMAT.htm British Columbia Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations--Assisted Migration Adaptation Trial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to this threat, the Ministry has initiated a large-scale study to determine the long-term health of seedlings of 16 tree species planted beyond their native ranges, into areas expected to become suitable due to changes in climate this century.&lt;ref name=Marris&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marris | first1 = E. | title = Forestry: Planting the forest of the future | doi = 10.1038/459906a | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7249 | pages = 906â908 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19536238| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from the study will be used to develop guidelines for when and how assisted colonization of trees should be conducted.

In 2009, British Columbia also altered guidelines for selecting seeds for replanting forests after a timber harvest. Previously, foresters were required to use seeds from within 200 meters downhill and 300 meters uphill, but the new policy allows foresters to obtain seeds from up to 500 meters downhill, taking advantage of the fact that populations in warmer habitats downhill may be better adapted to the future climate of the restoration site.&lt;ref name=Marris/&gt;

===Dixon National Tallgrass Prairie Seed Bank, USA===
Although not actively engaging in assisted colonization, the Dixon National Tallgrass Prairie Seed Bank seeks to collect seeds from populations of species expected to decline or disappear due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vitt | first1 = P. | last2 = Havens | first2 = K. | last3 = Kramer | first3 = A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3490">'''Biomusicology''' is the study of [[music]] from a [[Biology|biological]] point of view. The term was coined by Nils L. Wallin in 1991 to encompass several branches of [[music psychology]] and [[musicology]], including [[evolutionary musicology]], [[Cognitive neuroscience of music|neuromusicology]], and [[ethnomusicology|comparative musicology]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallin, N. L. (1991): ''Biomusicology: Neurophysiological, Neuropsychological and Evolutionary Perspectives on the Origins and Purposes of Music'', Stuyvesant, NY: Pendragon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary musicology studies the "origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution", and "music evolution and human evolution". Neuromusicology studies the "brain areas involved in music processing, neural and cognitive processes of musical processing", and "ontogeny of musical capacity and musical skill". Comparative musicology studies the "functions and uses of music, advantages and costs of music making", and "universal features of musical systems and musical behavior".&lt;ref name="Brown, Merker, Wallin"&gt;Wallin, Nils L./BjÃ¶rn Merker/Steven Brown (1999): "An Introduction to Evolutionary Musicology." In: Wallin, Nils L./BjÃ¶rn Merker/Steven Brown (Eds., 1999): ''The Origins of Music'', pp. 5â6. {{ISBN|0-262-23206-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied biomusicology "attempts to provide biological insight into such things as the [[Music therapy|therapeutic uses of music]] in medical and psychological treatment; widespread use of music in the audiovisual media such as film and television; the ubiquitous [[Background music|presence of music in public places]] and its role in influencing mass behavior; and the potential use of music to function as a general enhancer of learning."&lt;ref name="Brown, Merker, Wallin"/&gt;

Whereas biomusicology refers to music among humans, [[zoomusicology]] extends the field to other species.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21982">'''Chemical thermodynamics''' is the study of the interrelation of [[heat]] and [[thermodynamic work|work]] with [[chemical reaction]]s or with physical changes of [[thermodynamic state|state]] within the confines of the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. Chemical thermodynamics involves not only laboratory measurements of various thermodynamic properties, but also the application of mathematical methods to the study of chemical questions and the ''spontaneity'' of processes.

The structure of chemical thermodynamics is based on the first two [[laws of thermodynamics]].  Starting from the first and second laws of thermodynamics, four equations called the "fundamental equations of Gibbs" can be derived.  From these four, a multitude of equations, relating the thermodynamic properties of the [[thermodynamic system]] can be derived using relatively simple mathematics.  This outlines the mathematical framework of chemical thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="Book1" &gt;{{cite book | last = Ott | first = Bevan J.  |author2=Boerio-Goates, Juliana | title = Chemical Thermodynamics â Principles and Applications | publisher = Academic Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-12-530990-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Willard Gibbs.jpg|right|thumb|[[J. Willard Gibbs]] - founder of ''chemical thermodynamics'']]
In 1865, the German physicist [[Rudolf Clausius]], in his ''Mechanical Theory of Heat'', suggested that the principles of [[thermochemistry]], e.g. the [[heat]] evolved in [[Combustion|combustion reactions]], could be applied to the principles of [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;Clausius, R. (1865). ''The Mechanical Theory of Heat â with its Applications to the Steam Engine and to Physical Properties of Bodies.'' London: John van Voorst, 1 Paternoster Row. MDCCCLXVII.&lt;/ref&gt;  Building on the work of Clausius, between the years 1873-76 the American mathematical physicist [[Willard Gibbs]] published a series of three papers, the most famous one being the paper ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]''.  In these papers, Gibbs showed how the first two [[laws of thermodynamics]] could be measured graphically and mathematically to determine both the [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] of chemical reactions as well as their tendencies to occur or proceed.  Gibbsâ collection of papers provided the first unified body of thermodynamic theorems from the principles developed by others, such as Clausius and [[Nicolas LÃ©onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]].

During the early 20th century, two major publications successfully applied the principles developed by Gibbs to chemical processes, and thus established the foundation of the science of chemical thermodynamics.  The first was the 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall]].  This book was responsible for supplanting the [[chemical affinity]] with the term [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] in the English-speaking world.  The second was the 1933 book ''Modern Thermodynamics by the methods of Willard Gibbs'' written by [[E. A. Guggenheim]].  In this manner, Lewis, Randall, and Guggenheim are considered as the founders of modern chemical thermodynamics because of the major contribution of these two books in unifying the application of [[thermodynamics]] to [[chemistry]].&lt;ref name="Book1" /&gt;

== Overview ==
The primary objective of chemical thermodynamics is the establishment of a criterion for the determination of the feasibility or [[spontaneous process|spontaneity]] of a given transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Klotz, I. (1950). ''Chemical Thermodynamics.'' New York: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, chemical thermodynamics is typically used to predict the [[energy]] exchanges that occur in the following processes:
#[[Chemical reaction]]s
#[[Phase changes]]
#The formation of [[solutions]]

The following [[state function]]s are of primary concern in chemical thermodynamics:

*[[Internal energy]] (''U'')
*[[Enthalpy]] (''H'')
*[[Entropy]] (''S'')
*[[Gibbs free energy]] (''G'')

Most identities in chemical thermodynamics arise from application of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, particularly the [[Conservation of energy|law of conservation of energy]], to these state functions.

'''The 3 laws of thermodynamics''':
#The energy of the universe is constant.
#In any spontaneous process, there is always an increase in entropy of the universe
#The entropy of a perfect crystal(well ordered) at 0 Kelvin is zero

==Chemical energy==
{{Main|Chemical energy}}
'''Chemical energy''' is the potential of a [[chemical substance]] to undergo a transformation through a [[chemical reaction]] or to transform other chemical substances. Breaking or making of chemical bonds involves [[energy]] or heat, which may be either absorbed or evolved from a chemical system.

Energy that can be released (or absorbed) because of a reaction between a set of chemical substances is equal to the difference between the energy content of the products and the reactants. This change in energy is called the change in [[internal energy]] of a chemical reaction. Where &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\rm f}U^{\rm o}_{\mathrm {reactants}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[internal energy]] of formation of the reactant molecules that can be calculated from the [[bond energy|bond energies]] of the various chemical bonds of the molecules under consideration and &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\rm f}U^{\rm o}_{\mathrm {products}}&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy of formation of the product molecules. The change in internal energy is a process which is equal to the heat change if it is measured under conditions of constant volume (at STP condition), as in a closed rigid container such as a [[Calorimeter#Bomb calorimeters|bomb calorimeter]]. However, under conditions of constant pressure, as in reactions in vessels open to the atmosphere, the measured heat change is not always equal to the internal energy change, because pressure-volume work also releases or absorbs energy. (The heat change at constant pressure is called the [[enthalpy]] change; in this case the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation|enthalpy of formation]]).

Another useful term is the [[heat of combustion]], which is the energy released due to a [[combustion]] reaction and often applied in the study of [[fuels]]. Food is similar to hydrocarbon fuel and carbohydrate fuels, and when it is oxidized, its caloric content is similar (though not assessed in the same way as a hydrocarbon fuel â see [[food energy]]).

In chemical thermodynamics the term used for the chemical potential energy is [[chemical potential]], and for chemical transformation an equation most often used is the [[Gibbs-Duhem equation]].

==Chemical reactions==
{{Main|Chemical reaction}}
In most cases of interest in chemical thermodynamics there are internal [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] and processes, such as [[chemical reaction]]s and [[phase transition]]s, which always create [[entropy]] unless they are at equilibrium, or are maintained at a "running equilibrium" through "quasi-static" changes by being coupled to constraining devices, such as [[piston]]s or [[electrode]]s, to deliver and receive external work. Even for homogeneous "bulk" materials, the free energy functions depend on the [[chemical compound|composition]], as do all the [[extensive quantity|extensive]] [[thermodynamic potentials]], including the internal energy. If the quantities {&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;}, the number of [[chemical species]], are omitted from the formulae, it is impossible to describe compositional changes.

===Gibbs function or Gibbs Energy===
For a "bulk" (unstructured) system they are the last remaining extensive variables. For an unstructured, homogeneous "bulk" system, there are still various ''extensive'' compositional variables {&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;} that ''G'' depends on, which specify the composition, the amounts of each [[chemical substance]], expressed as the numbers of molecules present or (dividing by [[Avogadro's number]] = 6.023 Ã 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;), the numbers of [[mole (unit)|moles]]

:&lt;math&gt; G = G(T,P,\{N_i\})\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For the case where only ''PV'' work is possible

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}G = -S\, \mathrm{d}T + V \, \mathrm{d}P + \sum_i \mu_i \, \mathrm{d}N_i \,&lt;/math&gt;

in which ''Î¼&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[chemical potential]] for the ''i''-th [[component (thermodynamics)|component]] in the system

:&lt;math&gt; \mu_i  = \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial N_i}\right)_{T,P,N_{j\ne i},etc. } \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The expression for d''G'' is especially useful at constant ''T'' and ''P'', conditions which are easy to achieve experimentally and which approximates the condition in [[life|living]] creatures

:&lt;math&gt; (\mathrm{d}G)_{T,P} = \sum_i \mu_i \, \mathrm{d}N_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Chemical affinity===
{{main|Chemical affinity}}
While this formulation is mathematically defensible, it is not particularly transparent since one does not simply add or remove molecules from a system. There is always a ''process'' involved in changing the composition; e.g., a chemical reaction (or many), or movement of molecules from one phase (liquid) to another (gas or solid). We should find a notation which does not seem to imply that the amounts of the components (&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;) can be changed independently. All real processes obey [[conservation of mass]], and in addition, conservation of the numbers of [[atom]]s of each kind. Whatever molecules are transferred to or from should be considered part of the "system".

Consequently, we introduce an explicit variable to represent the degree of advancement of a process, a progress [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]&amp;nbsp;''Î¾'' for the ''[[extent of reaction]]'' (Prigogine &amp; Defay, p.&amp;nbsp;18; Prigogine, pp.&amp;nbsp;4â7; Guggenheim, p.&amp;nbsp;37.62), and to the use of the [[partial derivative]] â''G''/â''Î¾'' (in place of the widely used "Î''G''", since the quantity at issue is not a finite change). The result is an understandable [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] for the dependence of d''G'' on [[chemical reaction]]s (or other processes). If there is just one reaction
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{d}G)_{T,P} = \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial \xi}\right)_{T,P} \, \mathrm{d}\xi.\,&lt;/math&gt;

If we introduce the ''[[stoichiometric coefficient]]'' for the ''i-th'' component in the reaction

::&lt;math&gt;\nu_i = \partial N_i / \partial \xi \,&lt;/math&gt;

which tells how many molecules of ''i'' are produced or consumed, we obtain an algebraic expression for the partial derivative

:&lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial \xi} \right)_{T,P} = \sum_i \mu_i \nu_i = -\mathbb{A}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where, (De Donder; Progoine &amp; Defay, p.&amp;nbsp;69; Guggenheim, pp.&amp;nbsp;37,240), we introduce a concise and historical name for this quantity, the "[[chemical affinity|affinity]]", symbolized by '''A''', as introduced by [[ThÃ©ophile de Donder]] in 1923. The minus sign comes from the fact the affinity was defined to represent the rule that spontaneous changes will ensue only when the change in the Gibbs free energy of the process is negative, meaning that the chemical species have a positive affinity for each other. The differential for ''G'' takes on a simple form which displays its dependence on compositional change

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{d}G)_{T,P} = -\mathbb{A}\, d\xi  \,.&lt;/math&gt;

If there are a number of chemical reactions going on simultaneously, as is usually the case

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{d}G)_{T,P} = -\sum_k\mathbb{A}_k\, d\xi_k  \,.&lt;/math&gt;

a set of reaction coordinates {&amp;nbsp;Î¾&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;}, avoiding the notion that the amounts of the components (&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;) can be changed independently. The expressions above are equal to zero at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], while in the general case for real systems, they are negative because all chemical reactions proceeding at a finite rate produce entropy. This can be made even more explicit by introducing the reaction ''rates'' d''Î¾''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;/d''t''. For each and every &lt;span style="color:maroon;"&gt;''physically independent''&lt;/span&gt; ''process'' (Prigogine &amp; Defay, p.&amp;nbsp;38; Prigogine, p.&amp;nbsp;24)

::&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{A}\ \dot{\xi} \le 0  \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a remarkable result since the chemical potentials are intensive system variables, depending only on the local molecular milieu. They cannot "know" whether the temperature and pressure (or any other system variables) are going to be held constant over time. It is a purely local criterion and must hold regardless of any such constraints. Of course, it could have been obtained by taking partial derivatives of any of the other fundamental state functions, but nonetheless is a general criterion for (&amp;minus;''T'' times) the entropy production from that spontaneous process; or at least any part of it that is not captured as external work. (See ''Constraints'' below.)

We now relax the requirement of a homogeneous âbulkâ system by letting the [[chemical potential]]s and the affinity apply to any locality in which a chemical reaction (or any other process) is occurring. By accounting for the [[entropy production]] due to irreversible processes, the inequality for d''G'' is now replaced by an equality

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}G = - S \, \mathrm{d}T + V \, \mathrm{d}P -\sum_k\mathbb{A}_k\, \mathrm{d}\xi_k  + W'\,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}G_{T,P} = -\sum_k\mathbb{A}_k\, \mathrm{d}\xi_k  + W'.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Any decrease in the [[Gibbs function]] of a system is the upper limit for any [[isothermal process|isothermal]], [[isobaric process|isobaric]] work that can be captured in the [[surroundings]], or it may simply be [[dissipation|dissipated]], appearing as ''T'' times a corresponding increase in the entropy of the system and/or its surrounding. Or it may go partly toward doing external work and partly toward creating entropy. The important point is that the ''[[extent of reaction]]'' for a chemical reaction may be coupled to the displacement of some external mechanical or electrical quantity in such a way that one can advance only if the other one also does. The coupling may occasionally be ''rigid'', but it is often flexible and variable.

===Solutions===
In solution [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]], the [[Gibbs free energy]] decrease (â''G''/â''Î¾'', in molar units, denoted cryptically by Î''G'') is commonly used as a surrogate for (&amp;minus;''T'' times) the entropy produced by spontaneous [[chemical reaction]]s in situations where there is no work being done; or at least no "useful" work; i.e., other than perhaps some Â±&amp;nbsp;''P'' d''V''. The assertion that all ''spontaneous reactions have a negative Î''G'' is merely a restatement of the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]], giving it the [[dimensional analysis|physical dimensions]] of energy and somewhat obscuring its significance in terms of entropy. When there is no useful work being done, it would be less misleading to use the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transform]]s of the entropy appropriate for constant ''T'', or for constant ''T'' and ''P'', the Massieu functions  &amp;minus;''F''/''T'' and &amp;minus;''G''/''T'' respectively.

==Non equilibrium==
{{Main|non-equilibrium thermodynamics}}

Generally the systems treated with the conventional chemical thermodynamics are either at equilibrium or near equilibrium. [[Ilya Prigogine]] developed the thermodynamic treatment of [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]] that are far from equilibrium. In doing so he has discovered phenomena and structures of completely new and completely unexpected types. His generalized, nonlinear and irreversible thermodynamics has found surprising applications in a wide variety of fields.

The non equilibrium thermodynamics has been applied for explaining how ordered structures e.g. the biological systems, can develop from disorder. Even if Onsager's relations are utilized, the classical principles of equilibrium in thermodynamics still show that linear systems close to equilibrium always develop into states of disorder which are stable to perturbations and cannot explain the occurrence of ordered structures.

Prigogine called these systems [[dissipative systems]], because they are formed and maintained by the dissipative processes which take place because of the exchange of energy between the system and its environment and because they disappear if that exchange ceases. They may be said to live in [[symbiosis]] with their environment.

The method which Prigogine used to study the stability of the dissipative structures to perturbations is of very great general interest. It makes it possible to study the most varied problems, such as city traffic problems, the stability of insect communities, the development of ordered biological structures and the growth of cancer cells to mention but a few examples.

===System constraints===

In this regard, it is crucial to understand the role of walls and other ''constraints'', and the distinction between ''independent'' processes and ''coupling''. Contrary to the clear implications of many reference sources, the previous analysis is not restricted to [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogeneous]], [[isotropy|isotropic]] bulk systems which can deliver only ''P''d''V'' work to the outside world, but applies even to the most structured systems. There are complex systems with many chemical "reactions" going on at the same time, some of which are really only parts of the same, overall process. An ''independent'' process is one that ''could'' proceed even if all others were unaccountably stopped in their tracks. Understanding this is perhaps a â[[thought experiment]]â in [[chemical kinetics]], but actual examples exist.

A gas reaction which results in an increase in the number of molecules will lead to an increase in volume at constant external pressure. If it occurs inside a cylinder closed with a piston, the equilibrated reaction can proceed only by doing work against an external force on the piston. The extent variable for the reaction can increase only if the piston moves, and conversely, if the piston is pushed inward, the reaction is driven backwards.

Similarly, a [[redox]] reaction might occur in an [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] cell with the passage of [[electric current|current]] in [[wire]]s connecting the [[electrode]]s. The half-cell reactions at the [[electrode]]s are constrained if no current is allowed to flow. The current might be dissipated as [[joule heating]], or it might in turn run an electrical device like a [[electric motor|motor]] doing [[mechanical work]]. An [[automobile]] [[lead]]-[[acid]] [[battery (electricity)|battery]] can be recharged, driving the chemical reaction backwards. In this case as well, the reaction is not an independent process. Some, perhaps most, of the Gibbs free energy of reaction may be delivered as external work.

The [[hydrolysis]] of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and [[phosphate]] can drive the [[force]] times [[distance]] work delivered by living [[muscle]]s, and synthesis of ATP is in turn driven by a redox chain in [[Mitochonndrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s, which involves the transport of [[ion]]s across the membranes of these [[cell (biology)|cell]]ular [[organelle]]s. The coupling of processes here, and in the previous examples, is often not complete. Gas can leak slowly past a piston, just as it can slowly leak out of a [[rubber]] [[balloon]]. Some reaction may occur in a battery even if no external current is flowing. There is usually a coupling [[coefficient]], which may depend on relative rates, which determines what percentage of the driving free energy is turned into external work, or captured as "chemical work"; a misnomer for the free energy of another chemical process.

== Other Clarion Workshops ==
Independently-operated workshops which share the Clarion name and follow its founding principles include:
* [[Clarion West Writers Workshop]], founded in Seattle, Washington in 1971 by [[Vonda N. McIntyre]]. It has been held annually since 1984.
* Clarion South Writers Workshop was held at [[Griffith University]] in Brisbane, Australia. It was founded in 2004 and ran biennially. In 2009, Clarion South lost its venue, although the workshop was held that year. In March 2011, Clarion South organizers announced that future workshops were "on hold indefinitely."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.clarionsouth.org/|title = Workshop Update|date = March 2011|accessdate = |website = Clarion South|publisher = |last = |first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130328142743/http://www.clarionsouth.org/|archivedate = March 28, 2013|dead-url = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clinical vampirism''', more commonly known as '''Renfield's syndrome''' or '''Renfield syndrome''', is an obsession with drinking [[blood]]. The earliest formal presentation of clinical vampirism to appear in the psychiatric literature, with the psychoanalytic interpretation of two cases, was contributed by Richard L. Vanden Bergh and John F. Kelley in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vanden Bergh|first=Richard L.|author2=Kelley, John F.|title=Vampirism -- A review with new observations|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|year=1964|volume=11|pages=543â547|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1964.01720290085012|pmid=14208658}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the authors point out, brief and sporadic reports of blood-drinking behaviors associated with sexual pleasure have appeared in the psychiatric literature at least since 1892 with the work of Austrian forensic psychiatrist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]. Many medical publications concerning clinical vampirism can be found in the literature of forensic psychiatry, with the unusual behavior reported as one of many aspects of extraordinary violent crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hemphill|first=R.E.|author2=Zabow, T.|title=Clinical vampirism: A presentation of 3 cases and a reevaluation of Haigh, the "Acid-Bath Murderer"|journal=South African Medical Journal|year=1983|volume=63|pages=278â281.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaffe|first=PD|author2=DiCataldo, F.|title=Clinical vampirism: blending myth and reality|journal=Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law|year=1994|volume=22|issue=4|pages=533â544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramsland|first=Katharine|title=The Vampire Killers|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/vampires/1.html|publisher=Crime Library|accessdate=3 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210092523/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/vampires/1.html|archive-date=10 December 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The syndrome is named after [[Dracula]]'s human zoophagous follower, [[Renfield|R. M. Renfield]], in the 1897 novel by [[Bram Stoker]]. According to an interview conducted by psychology professor [[Katherine Ramsland]] with clinical psychologist [[Richard Noll]], who coined the eponymous term in a 1992 book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Richard Noll]] | title=Vampires, Werewolves and Demons: twentieth century reports in the psychiatric literature | publisher=Brunner/Mazel Publications | year=1992 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVkfHgAACAAJ&amp;dq |isbn=0-87630-632-6}},https://www.academia.edu/6793535/Vampires_Werewolves_and_Demons_Twentieth_Century_Case_Reports_in_the_Psychiatric_Literature_1991_&lt;/ref&gt; he invented the term and its purported diagnostic criteria as a whimsical parody of the "new DSM-speak" of the psychiatry of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramsland|first=Katharine|title=Vampire Personality Disorder|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shadow-boxing/201211/vampire-personality-disorder|publisher=Psychology Today (21 November 2012)|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a public lecture hosted by Penn State University's Institute for the Arts and Humanities on 7 October 2013, Noll traced the 20-year trajectory of his unintentionally created "monster" from the moment of its creation as a parody of DSM mental disorders to the cultural popularity of Renfield's syndrome today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Penn State University Institute for the Arts and Humanities|title=Events Schedule, October 2013|url=http://www.iah.psu.edu/archive/allevents.shtml|accessdate=10 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914194410/http://iah.psu.edu/archive/allevents.shtml|archive-date=14 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268278489_Renfield's_Syndrome_or_How_I_(Unintentionally)_Created_a_Monster?ev=prf_pub|title=Renfield's Syndrome, or, How I (Unintentionally) Created a Monster|website=ResearchGate|date=October 2013|author=Richard Noll|access-date=2017-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032407/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268278489_Renfield's_Syndrome_or_How_I_(Unintentionally)_Created_a_Monster?ev=prf_pub|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Noll's book appeared in the year 1992 clinical vampirism has usually been referred to as Renfield's syndrome. In an NBC pre-Halloween special hosted by actor Peter Graves entitled "The Unexplained: Witches, Werewolves and Vampires" that aired on 23 October 1994 (and is available on YouTube, with the 34:11 mark beginning the segment), pages from Noll's book were shown on camera as Canadian psychologist [[Leonard George]] summarized Renfield's syndrome for a wide television audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unexplained: Witches, Werewolves and Demons|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sQN7VpdX4s|publisher=You Tube|accessdate=2 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609000940/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sQN7VpdX4s|archive-date=9 June 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elias|first=Thomas D.|title=Television: "The Unexplained" Just the Latest Chapter in Peter Graves' Career|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-22/entertainment/9410220048_1_show-business-strange-stories-fun|publisher=Chicago Tribune, 22 October 1994|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=22 October 1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610205331/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-22/entertainment/9410220048_1_show-business-strange-stories-fun|archive-date=10 June 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characters suffering from Renfield's Syndrome have appeared on television. The first appeared in a 2005 episode of ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' titled "Committed" (Season 5, Episode 21).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CSI:Committed |url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/episodes/520 |quote=Kenny Valdez is in the Seclusion Room, strapped to a bed in a five-point restraint system, claiming he can "smell it!" Kenny suffers from Renfield's syndrome, a self-mutilator. The CSIs notice that even though Kenny has blood on his clothes, there is no spatter pattern. |publisher=[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]] |accessdate=2007-12-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228042908/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/episodes/520 |archivedate=2008-02-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cl/&gt; It was also mentioned in 2009 in episode 7, season 5 of ''Criminal Minds'' entitled "The Performer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CBS|title=Criminal Minds show homepage|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/criminal_minds/season/5/episodes/|accessdate=12 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611220100/http://www.cbs.com/shows/criminal_minds/season/5/episodes/|archive-date=11 June 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 an 11-episode Canadian television series, ''The Renfield Syndrome'', was filmed in Vancouver, B.C., but does not seem to have been aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Renfield Syndrome (2010)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764036/|accessdate=1 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406092302/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764036/|archive-date=6 April 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 2012 Renfield's syndrome was the subject of a video segment on ''The Huffington Post'' by Cara Santa Maria which again relied heavily on Noll's work and a recent scholarly article on the (pseudo-)syndrome published in the ''Journal of the History of the Neurosciences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santa Maria|first=Cara|authorlink=Cara Santa Maria|title=Renfield's Syndrome: A Mysterious Case of Real-Life Vampirism|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/renfields-syndrome-vampirism_n_1765799.html|publisher=The Huffington Post (15 August 2012)|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325171428/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/renfields-syndrome-vampirism_n_1765799.html|archive-date=25 March 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olry|first=Regis|author2=Duane E.

In addition to references to Renfield's syndrome in the psychiatric literature and mass media, the horror writer Chelsea Quinn Yarbro published a story entitled "Renfield's Syndrome" in July 2002, which was then reprinted in an anthology that appeared the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yarbro|first=chelsea Quinn|title=Apprehensions and Other Delusions|year=2003|publisher=Five Star|location=Waterville, Maine}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the title of a novel by J.A.

The twenty-year evolution of a farcical 3-page book section that shot through the mass media and thenâuncriticallyâinto the pages of a peer-reviewed scholarly journal should serve as a cautionary tale about the purported validity of other "mental disorders." Philosopher of science Ian Hacking refers to this process as "making up people" and critiques medical and psychiatric elites for the untoward effects of their "dynamic nominalism" on individual lives. Such arbitrary categories create new natural "kinds" of people (e.g., perverts, multiple personalities and so on) that serve larger political, cultural and moral purposes and change with historical contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hacking|first=Ian|title=Making Up People|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n16/ian-hacking/making-up-people|publisher=London Review of Books, 28 (16): 23-26, 17 August 2006|accessdate=3 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609150150/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n16/ian-hacking/making-up-people|archive-date=9 June 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hacking|first=Ian|title=Making Up People (full text)|url=http://generation-online.org/c/fcbiopolitics2.htm|accessdate=3 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306133122/http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcbiopolitics2.htm|archive-date=6 March 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the case history reports in the older psychiatric literature that formed the basis of Noll's parody, the condition starts with a key event in [[childhood]] that causes the experience of blood injury or the ingestion of blood to be exciting. After [[puberty]], the excitement is experienced as [[sexual arousal]]. Throughout [[adolescence]] and [[adulthood]], blood, its presence, and its consumption can also stimulate a sense of power and control. Noll speculated that Renfield's syndrome begins with [[autovampirism]] and then progresses to the consumption of the blood of other creatures.&lt;ref name=cl&gt;{{cite news |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |authorlink=Katherine Ramsland |title=Renfield's Syndrome |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/vampires/7.html |quote=Psychiatrists are aware that there exists a behavior known as "clinical vampirism," which is a syndrome involving the delusion of actually being a vampire and feeling the need for blood. This arises not from fiction and film but from the erotic attraction to blood and the idea that it conveys certain powers, although the actual manifestation of the fantasy may be influenced by fiction. It develops through fantasies involving sexual excitement. |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |accessdate=2007-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218202138/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/vampires/7.html |archive-date=2007-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[natural theology]] and [[philosophy]], a '''cosmological argument''' is an [[argument]] in which the existence of a unique being, generally seen as some kind of [[god]], is [[deductive reasoning|deduced]] or [[inductive reasoning|inferred]] from facts or alleged facts concerning causation, change, motion, contingency, or finitude in respect of the [[universe]] as a whole or processes within it.&lt;ref name=reichenbach&gt;{{cite web |last=Reichenbach |first=Bruce |title=Cosmological Argument |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2006 Edition, Edward N.

Whichever term is employed, there are three basic variants of the argument, each with subtle yet important distinctions: the arguments from [[Causality|''in causa'' (causality)]], [[Essence|''in esse'' (essentiality)]], and [[Becoming (philosophy)|''in fieri'' (becoming)]].

The basic premises of all of these are the concept of [[causality]]. The conclusion of these arguments is [[first cause]], subsequently deemed to be [[God]]. The history of this argument goes back to [[Aristotle]] or earlier, was developed in [[Neoplatonism]] and [[early Christianity]] and later in medieval [[Islamic theology]] during the 9th to 12th centuries, and re-introduced to medieval Christian theology in the 13th century by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. The cosmological argument is closely related to the [[principle of sufficient reason]] as addressed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Samuel Clarke]], itself a modern exposition of the claim that "[[nothing comes from nothing]]" attributed to [[Parmenides]].

[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], depicted here in [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'', both developed first cause arguments.]]

[[Plato]] (c. 427â347 BC) and [[Aristotle]] (c. 384â322 BC) both posited first cause arguments, though each had certain notable caveats.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, WL., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qbFKAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=plato+cosmological+argument&amp;q=%22chapter+1%22+natural#v=snippet&amp;q=%22chapter%201%22%20natural&amp;f=false ''The Cosmological Argument from Plato to Leibniz''], Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2001, pp. 1-5, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Laws]]'' (Book X), Plato posited that all movement in the world and the [[Cosmos]] was "imparted motion". This required a "self-originated motion" to set it in motion and to maintain it. In ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', Plato posited a "demiurge" of supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the Cosmos.

Aristotle argued ''against'' the idea of a first cause, often confused with the idea of a "[[Primum movens|prime mover]]" or "[[unmoved mover]]" ({{lang|grc|ÏÏá¿¶ÏÎ¿Î½ ÎºÎ¹Î½Î¿á¿¦Î½ á¼ÎºÎ¯Î½Î·ÏÎ¿Î½}} or ''primus motor'') in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' VIII, 4â6; ''Metaphysics'' XII, 1â6.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle argued in ''favor'' of the idea of several unmoved movers, one powering each [[celestial sphere]], which he believed lived beyond the sphere of the fixed stars, and explained why motion in the universe (which he believed was eternal) had continued for an infinite period of time. Aristotle argued the [[atomism|atomist's]] assertion of a non-eternal universe would require a [[first uncaused cause]] â in his terminology, an [[four causes|efficient]] first cause â an idea he considered a non-sensical flaw in the reasoning of the atomists.

Like Plato, Aristotle believed in an eternal [[cosmos]] with no beginning and no end (which in turn follows [[Parmenides]]' famous statement that "[[nothing comes from nothing]]"). In what he called "first philosophy" or metaphysics, Aristotle ''did'' intend a theological correspondence between the prime mover and deity (presumably [[Zeus]]); functionally, however, he provided an explanation for the apparent motion of the "[[fixed stars]]" (now understood as the daily rotation of the Earth). According to his theses, immaterial unmoved movers are eternal unchangeable beings that constantly think about thinking, but being immaterial, they're incapable of interacting with the cosmos and have no knowledge of what transpires therein. From an "aspiration or desire",&lt;ref&gt;"Cosmological Argument for the Existence of God", in ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967), Vol. 2, p233 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[celestial spheres]], ''imitate'' that purely intellectual activity as best they can, by [[uniform circular motion]]. The unmoved movers ''inspiring'' the [[classical planets|planetary]] spheres are no different in kind from the prime mover, they merely suffer a dependency of relation to the prime mover. Correspondingly, the motions of the planets are subordinate to the motion inspired by the prime mover in the sphere of fixed stars. Aristotle's natural theology admitted no creation or capriciousness from the immortal [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], but maintained a defense against dangerous charges of impiety.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[Plotinus]], a third-century Platonist, taught that the One transcendent absolute caused the universe to exist simply as a consequence of its existence (''creatio ex deo''). His disciple Proclus stated "The One is God".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Centuries later, the [[Islamic]] [[philosopher]] [[Avicenna]] (c. 980â1037) inquired into the question of [[being]], in which he distinguished between [[essence]] (''Mahiat'') and [[existence]] (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence could not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves could not originate and interact with the movement of the Universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Thus, he reasoned that existence must be due to an [[Causality|agent cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must coexist with its effect and be an existing thing.&lt;ref name="Islam in Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= | authorlink= | title=Islam |year=2007| encyclopedia=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-11-27|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Duncan writes that "it was first formulated by a Greek-speaking Syriac Christian neo-Platonist, [[John Philoponus]]," who claims to find a contradiction between the Greek pagan insistence on the eternity of the world and the Aristotelian rejection of the existence of any actual infinite." Referring to the argument as the "'[[Kalam]]' cosmological argument", Duncan asserts that it "received its fullest articulation at the hands of [medieval] Muslim and Jewish exponents of ''Kalam'' ("the use of reason by believers to justify the basic metaphysical presuppositions of the faith)."&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, S., ''Analytic philosophy of religion: its history since 1955'', Humanities-Ebooks, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225â1274) adapted and enhanced the argument he found in his reading of Aristotle and Avicenna to form one of the most influential versions of the cosmological argument.&lt;ref&gt;Summa Theologica, St. Thomas Aquinas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott David Foutz, [http://www.quodlibet.net/aqu5ways.shtml An Examination of Thomas Aquinas' Cosmological Arguments as found in the Five Ways], ''Quodlibet Online Journal of Christian Theology and Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; His conception of First Cause was the idea that the Universe must be caused by something that is itself uncaused, which he claimed is that which we call God:    "The second way is from the nature of the efficient cause. In the world of sense we find there is an order of efficient causes. There is no case known (neither is it, indeed, possible) in which a thing is found to be the efficient cause of itself; for so it would be prior to itself, which is impossible. Now in efficient causes it is not possible to go on to infinity, because in all efficient causes following in order, the first is the cause of the intermediate cause, and the intermediate is the cause of the ultimate cause, whether the intermediate cause be several, or only one. Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect. Therefore, if there be no first cause among efficient causes, there will be no ultimate, nor any intermediate cause. But if in efficient causes it is possible to go on to infinity, there will be no first efficient cause, neither will there be an ultimate effect, nor any intermediate efficient causes; all of which is plainly false. Therefore it is necessary to admit a first efficient cause, to which everyone gives the name of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/FP/FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1|title=Summa Theologica|author=|date=|website=www.dhspriory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 {{dubious|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--this is just a repetition of Aristotle's concept. Aquinas was more specific and more subtle than that.--&gt; Importantly, Aquinas' Five Ways, given the second question of his Summa Theologica, are not the entirety of Aquinas' demonstration that the Christian God exists. The Five Ways form only the beginning of Aquinas' Treatise on the Divine Nature.

== Versions of the argument ==

=== Argument from contingency ===

In the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] era, [[Aquinas]] formulated the "argument from [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]", following [[Aristotle]] in claiming that there must be something to explain why the Universe exists.{{dubious|date=May 2017}}&lt;!-- Aristotle did not believe in a first cause; is this a misreading? --&gt; Since the Universe could, under different circumstances, conceivably ''not'' exist (contingency), its existence must have a cause â not merely another contingent thing, but something that exists by [[INUS|necessity]] (something that ''must'' exist in order for anything else to exist).&lt;ref&gt;''Summa Theologiae, I :'' 2,3&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, even if the Universe has always existed, it still owes its existence to an [[Primum movens|uncaused cause]],&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas was an ardent student of Aristotle's works, a significant number of which had only recently been translated into Latin by [[William of Moerbeke]] .&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas further said: "...and this we understand to be God."&lt;ref&gt;''Summa Theologiae, I : '' 2,3&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas's argument from contingency allows for the possibility of a Universe that has no beginning in time. It is a form of argument from universal [[Causality|causation]]. Aquinas observed that, in nature, there were things with contingent existences. Since it is possible for such things not to exist, there must be some time at which these things did not in fact exist. Thus, according to Aquinas, there must have been a time when nothing existed. If this is so, there would exist nothing that could bring anything into existence. Contingent beings, therefore, are insufficient to account for the existence of contingent beings: there must exist a ''[[INUS|necessary]]'' being whose non-existence is an impossibility, and from which the existence of all contingent beings is derived.

The German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] made a similar argument with his [[principle of sufficient reason]] in 1714. "There can be found no fact that is true or existent, or any true proposition," he wrote, "without there being a sufficient reason for its being so and not otherwise, although we cannot know these reasons in most cases." He formulated the cosmological argument succinctly: "Why is there something rather than nothing?  The sufficient reason [...] is found in a substance which [...] is a necessary being bearing the reason for its existence within itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Monadologie'' (1714). [[Nicholas Rescher]], trans., 1991. ''The Monadology: An Edition for Students''. Uni. of Pittsburg Press. [http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/leibmon.pdf Jonathan Bennett's translation.] [http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/classics/leibniz/monad.htm Latta's translation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz's contingency argument was summarised by [[William Lane Craig]], as follows:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36cKSRVojRE&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. Everything that exists has an explanation of its existence.
:2. If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God.
:3. The universe exists.
:4. The universe has an explanation of its existence.
:5. Therefore, the explanation of the universe's existence is God.

Craig states that the only disputable statements are 1. and 2. He defended 1. from the question of 'What caused God?' by saying that God cannot be caused by anything, as that would imply that there is something greater than him, which is logically contradictory. He also denied that the universe was an exception to the rule, claiming that such a proposition [[begs the question|begging the question]]. He states &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpz7NaUDJU4&lt;/ref&gt; that saying 2. is wrong contradicts modern science, and that, far from not being specific to the God of Christianity, it actually leads to evidence specifically linking to a being outside of space and time, as well as one that is omnipotent and omniscient.

=== ''In esse'' and ''in fieri'' ===

The difference between the arguments from causation ''[[Becoming (philosophy)|in fieri]]'' and ''[[Essence|in esse]]'' is a fairly important one. ''In fieri'' is generally translated as "becoming", while ''in esse'' is generally translated as "in essence". ''In fieri'', the process of becoming, is similar to building a house. Once it is built, the builder walks away, and it stands on its own accord; compare the [[watchmaker analogy]]. (It may require occasional maintenance, but that is beyond the scope of the first cause argument.)

''In esse'' (essence) is more akin to the light from a candle or the liquid in a vessel. George Hayward Joyce, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], explained that "...where the light of the candle is dependent on the candle's continued existence, not only does a candle produce light in a room in the first instance, but its continued presence is necessary if the illumination is to continue. If it is removed, the light ceases. Again, a liquid receives its shape from the vessel in which it is contained; but were the pressure of the containing sides withdrawn, it would not retain its form for an instant." This form of the argument is far more difficult to separate from a purely first cause argument than is the example of the house's maintenance above, because here the First Cause is insufficient without the candle's or vessel's continued existence.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, George Hayward (1922) ''Principles of Natural Theology''. NY: Longmans Green.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]' argument is ''in fieri'', while [[Aquinas]]' argument is both ''in fieri'' and ''in esse''. This distinction is an excellent example of the difference between a [[deistic]] view (Leibniz) and a [[theistic]] view (Aquinas). As a general trend, the modern slants on the cosmological argument, including the [[Kalam cosmological argument|Kalam argument]], tend to lean very strongly towards an ''in fieri'' argument.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The philosopher [[Robert Koons]] has stated a new variant on the cosmological argument. He says that to deny causation is to deny all empirical ideas- for example, if we know our own hand, we know it because of the chain of causes including light being reflected upon one's eyes, stimulating the retina and sending a message through the optic nerve into your brain. He summarised the purpose of the argument as 'that if you donât buy into theistic metaphysics, youâre undermining empirical science. The two grew up together historically and are culturally and philosophically inter-dependentâ¦ If you say I just donât buy this causality principle â thatâs going to be a big big problem for empirical science.' This ''in fieri'' version of the argument therefore does not intend to prove God, but only to disprove objections involving science, and the idea that contemporary knowledge disproves the cosmological argument. &lt;ref&gt;https://crossexamined.org/new-proofs-gods-existence/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== KalÄm cosmological argument ===
{{Main|Kalam cosmological argument}}
William Lane Craig gives this argument in the following general form:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William L. |title=The Existence of God and the Beginning of the Universe |work=Truth Journal |publisher=Leaderu.com |accessdate=22 June 2008 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/truth/3truth11.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
# The Universe began to exist.
# Therefore, the Universe had a cause.

Craig explains, by nature of the event (the Universe coming into existence), attributes unique to (the concept of) God must also be attributed to the cause of this event, including but not limited to: omnipotence, Creator, being eternal and absolute self-sufficiency. Since these attributes are unique to God, anything with these attributes must be God. Something does have these attributes: the cause; hence, the cause is God, the cause exists; hence, God exists.

Craig defends the second premise, that the Universe had a beginning starting with [[Al-Ghazali]]'s proof  that an [[actual infinite]] is impossible. However, If the universe never had a beginning then there indeed '''would''' be an actual infinite, an infinite amount of cause and effect events. Hence, the Universe had a beginning.
&lt;!--
# the form advocated by Aquinas based on the impossibility of the "essential" ordering of an infinite regress; Aquinas argues that  only an "incidental" ordering among causes, but not an "essential" ordering, can reach back forever.
# the argument that an infinite regress is impossible because an [[actual infinite]] is impossible; this form is called the [[kalam cosmological argument]] by Craig, as he traces its first formulation to [[Al-Ghazali]].
# the argument from the [[principle of sufficient reason]], presented by Leibniz and Clarke.

A version of the cosmological argument could be stated as follows:

# Every finite and [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] being has a cause.
# A [[Causality|causal]] loop cannot exist.
# A causal chain cannot be of infinite length.
# Therefore, a First Cause (or something that is not an effect) must exist.
--&gt;

===Metaphysical argument for the existence of God===

[[Duns Scotus]], the influential Medieval Christian theologian, created a metaphysical argument for the existence of God. Though it was inspired by Aquinas' argument from motion, he, like other philosophers and theologians, believed that his statement for God's existence could be considered separate to Aquinas'. His explanation for God's existence is long, and can be summarised as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B&lt;/ref&gt;
#Something can be produced.
#It is produced by itself, something or another.
#Not by nothing, because nothing causes nothing.
#Not by itself, because an effect never causes itself.
#Therefore, by another ''A''.
#If A is first then we have reached the conclusion.
#If A is not first, then we return to 2).
#From 3) and 4), we produce another- ''B''. The ascending series is either infinite or finite.
#An infinite series is not possible.
#Therefore, God exists.

Scotus deals immediately with two objections he can see: first, that there cannot be a first, and second, that the argument falls apart when 1) is questioned. He states that [[infinite regress]] is impossible, because it provokes unanswerable questions, like, in modern English, 'What is infinity minus infinity?' The second he states can be answered if the question is rephrased using [[modal logic]], meaning that the first statement is instead 'It is possible that something can be produced.'

== Objections and counterarguments ==
{{see also|MÃ¼nchhausen trilemma}}

=== What caused the First Cause? ===
{{The Works of Aristotle}}
One objection to the argument is that it leaves open the question of why the First Cause is unique in that it does not require any causes. Proponents argue that the First Cause is exempt from having a cause, while opponents argue that this is [[special pleading]] or otherwise untrue.&lt;ref name=reichenbach/&gt; Critics often press that arguing for the First Cause's exemption raises the question of why the First Cause is indeed exempt,&lt;ref name=cline&gt;{{cite web |last=Cline |first= Austin |title=Cosmological Argument: Does the Universe Require a First Cause? {{pipe}} Agnosticism/Atheism |publisher=About.com |accessdate=June 20, 2008 |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/argumentsforgod/a/cosmological.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas defenders maintain that this question has been answered by the various arguments, emphasizing that none of its major forms rests on the premise that everything has a cause.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=07bHgxbG6A4C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=curious+blind+spot+in+the+anglo+cause+everything&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m3aujzj-la&amp;sig=aYqS9OJfoATKgcskZ3NLi7BAvx0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H9InVPvmJYvKaLPAguAO&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=curious%20blind%20spot%20in%20the%20anglo%20cause%20everything&amp;f=false Clarke, WN., "A Curious Blind Spot in the Anglo-American Tradition of Antitheistic Argument", in ''The Creative Retrieval of Saint Thomas Aquinas: Essays in Thomistic Philosophy, New and Old'', Fordham Univ Press, 2009, Ch. 5.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Lane Craig]], who famously uses the [[Kalam cosmological argument]], argues that, as the infinite is impossible, whichever perspective the viewer takes, there must always have been one unmoved thing to begin the universe. He uses [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]] and the question 'What is infinity minus infinity?' to illustrate the idea that the infinite is metaphysically, mathematically, and even conceptually, impossible. Other reasons include the fact that it is impossible to count down from infinity, and that, had the universe existed for an infinite amount of time, every possible event, including the final end of the universe, would already have occurred. He therefore states his argument in three points- firstly, everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence; secondly, the universe began to exist; so, thirdly, therefore, the universe has a cause of its existence. &lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmological-argument/#4.3&lt;/ref&gt; A response to this argument would be that the cause of the universe's existence (God) would need a cause for its existence, which, in turn, could be responded to as being logically inconsistent with the evidence already presented- even if God did have a cause, there would still necessarily be a cause which began everything, owing to the impossibility of the infinite stated by Craig.

Secondly, it is argued that the premise of [[causality]] has been arrived at via ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' ([[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]) reasoning, which is dependent on experience. [[David Hume]] highlighted this [[problem of induction]] and argued that [[Causality|causal relations]] were not true ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. However, as to whether inductive or deductive reasoning is more valuable still remains a matter of debate, with the general conclusion being that neither is prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/dedind.php |title=Deduction &amp; Induction |publisher=Socialresearchmethods.net |date=2006-10-20 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the argument tend to argue that it is unwise to draw conclusions from an extrapolation of causality beyond experience.&lt;ref name=reichenbach/&gt; Andrew Loke replies that, according to the [[Kalam Cosmological Argument]], only things which begin to exist require a cause. On the other hand, something that is without beginning has always existed and therefore does not require a cause. The Cosmological Argument shows that there cannot be an actual infinite regress of causes, therefore there must be an uncaused First Cause that is beginningless and does not require a cause. &lt;ref&gt; Andrew Loke, God and Ultimate Origins (Cham: Springer Nature, 2017), p. 189; Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Not evidence for a theist God ===
The basic cosmological argument merely establishes that a First Cause exists, not that it has the attributes of a [[theistic]] god, such as [[omniscience]], [[omnipotence]], and [[omnibenevolence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cosmological Argument for the Existence of God |author=Austin Cline |publisher= About, Inc. |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=3 August 2016 |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/argumentsforgod/a/cosmological.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why the argument is often expanded to show that at least some of these attributes are necessarily true, for instance in the modern Kalam argument given above.&lt;ref name=reichenbach /&gt;

=== Existence of causal loops ===
A causal loop is a form of [[predestination paradox]] arising where traveling backwards in time is deemed a possibility. A sufficiently powerful entity in such a world would have the capacity to travel backwards in time to a point before its own existence, and to then create itself, thereby initiating everything which [[Logical consequence|follows from]] it.

The usual reason which is given to refute the possibility of a causal loop is it requires that the loop as a whole be its own cause. [[Richard Hanley]] argues that causal loops are not logically, physically, or epistemically impossible: "[In timed systems,] the only possibly objectionable feature that all causal loops share is that coincidence is required to explain them."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hanley, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/v436qxx802383534 No End in Sight: Causal Loops in Philosophy, Physics and Fiction], ''Synthese''&lt;/ref&gt; However, Andrew Loke argues that causal loop of the type that is supposed to avoid a First Cause suffers from the problem of vicious circularity and thus it would not work.  &lt;ref&gt; Andrew Loke, ''God and Ultimate Origins'' (Cham: Springer Nature, 2017), chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existence of infinite causal chains ===
[[David Hume]] and later [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]] have invoked a similar principle in their criticisms of the cosmological argument. Rowe has called the principle the Hume-Edwards principle:&lt;ref&gt;Alexander R. Pruss, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/q134n458307w0125 The Hume-Edwards Principle and the Cosmological Argument], ''International Journal for Philosophy of Religion''&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|If the existence of every member of a set is explained, the existence of that set is thereby explained.}}

Nevertheless, David White argues that the notion of an [[infinite regress|infinite causal regress]] providing a proper explanation is fallacious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=David E.|title=An argument for God's existence|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m4t816n217704nxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Demea states that even if the succession of causes is infinite, the whole chain still requires a cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calvert|first=Brian|title=Another problem about Part IX of Hume's Dialogues|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r5x5g687h06571w6}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this, suppose there exists a causal chain of infinite contingent beings. If one asks the question, "Why are there any contingent beings at all?", it wonât help to be told that "There are contingent beings because other contingent beings caused them."  That answer would just presuppose additional contingent beings. An adequate explanation of why some contingent beings exist would invoke a different sort of being, a necessary being that is ''not'' contingent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://personal.stthomas.edu/mwrota/InfiniteRegress4%20Final.doc | format = DOC
 | title = Infinite Causal Chains and Explanation
 | first = Michael | last = Rota | work = Proceedings of the American Catholic Philosophical Association
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A response might suppose each individual is contingent but the infinite chain as a whole is not; or the whole infinite causal chain to be its own cause.

Severinsen argues that there is an "infinite" and complex causal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Severinsen|first=Morten|title=Principles Behind Definitions of Diseases â a Criticism of the Principle of Disease Mechanism and the Development of a Pragmatic Alternative|journal=Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hm2t476u01543017|quote=This implies that there is an "infinite" and complex causal structure behind each disease, and that the disease mechanism would have to encompass the whole structure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; White tried to introduce an argument âwithout appeal to the principle of sufficient reason and without denying the possibility of an infinite causal regressâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=David E.|title=An argument for God's existence|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m4t816n217704nxv|quote=My intention is to show that a cosmological argument for God's existence (not that of a first cause simpliciter) can be constructed without appeal to the principle of sufficient reason and without denying the possibility of an infinite causal regress.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other arguments have been offered to demonstrate that an actual infinite regress cannot exist, viz. the argument for the impossibility of concrete actual infinities, the argument for the impossibility of traversing an actual infinite, the argument from the lack of capacity to begin to exist, and various arguments from paradoxes. &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Loke, ''God and Ultimate Origins'' (Cham: Springer Nature, 2017), chapters 2 and 3; Waters,   Ben.   2013.   "Methuselahâs   Diary   and   the   Finitude   of   the   Past." ''Philosophia Christi'' 15: 463â469; Koons, Robert. 2014. ''A New Kalam Argument: Revenge of the Grim Reaper.'' NoÃ»s 48: 256â267.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big Bang cosmology===

Some cosmologists and physicists argue that a challenge to the cosmological argument is the nature of time: "One finds that time just disappears from the [[WheelerâDeWitt equation]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Folger|first=Tim|title=Time may not exist|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jun/in-no-time/|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[Carlo Rovelli]]). The [[Big Bang theory]] states that it is the point in which all [[dimension]]s came into existence, the start of both [[space]] and [[time]].&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;(J. Richard Gott III, James E. Gunn, David N. Schramm, and Beatrice M. Tinsley, "Will the Universe Expand Forever?" Scientific American [March 1976], p. 65)&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the question "What was there before the Universe?" makes no sense; the concept of "before" becomes meaningless when considering a situation without time.&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt; This has been put forward by J. Richard Gott III, James E. Gunn, David N. Schramm, and [[Beatrice Tinsley]], who said that asking what occurred before the Big Bang is like asking what is north of the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt; However, some cosmologists and physicists do attempt to investigate causes for the Big Bang, using such scenarios as the collision of [[Membrane (M-Theory)|membrane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Britt |first=Robert R. |title=Brane-Storm {{pipe}} Challenges Part of Big Bang Theory |publisher=Space.com |date=April 18, 2001 |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/bigbang_alternative_010413-3.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511144628/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/bigbang_alternative_010413-3.html |archivedate=11 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Edward Feser]] states that classical philosophers' arguments for the existence of God do not care about the Big Bang or whether the universe had a beginning. The question is not about what got things started or how long they have been going, but rather what keeps them going.&lt;ref&gt;Feser, Edward, The Last Superstition, St. Augustine Press 2008, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the above objections can be dispelled by separating the Cosmological Argument from the A-Theory of Time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benjamin Victor Waters |date=9 July 2015 |title=Toward a new kalÄm cosmological argument |work=Cogent Arts and Humanities |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/23311983.2015.1062461 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311983.2015.1062461 |accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently discussing God as a ''timeless'' (rather than "before" in a linear sense) cause of the Big Bang. There is also a Big Bang Argument, which is a variation of the Cosmological Argument using the Big Bang Theory to validate the premise that the Universe had a beginning.&lt;ref&gt;An article mentioning the existence of such an argument, but not necessarily endorsing it: http://strangenotions.com/why-we-should-be-cautious-using-the-big-bang-argument.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences''' ('''CIMS''') is an independent division of [[New York University]] (NYU) under the Faculty of Arts &amp; Science that serves as a center for research and advanced training in computer science and mathematics. It is considered one of the leading and most prestigious mathematics schools and mathematical sciences research centers in the world&lt;ref name="shanghairanking.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/Shanghairanking-Subject-Rankings/mathematics.html|title=ShanghaiRanking's Global Ranking of Academic Subjects 2017 - Mathematics - Shanghai Ranking - 2017|author=|date=|website=www.shanghairanking.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is named after [[Richard Courant]], one of the founders of the Courant Institute and also a mathematics professor at New York University from 1936 to 1972.

It is ranked #1 in [[applied mathematical research]] in US,&lt;ref name="grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/search?program=top-mathematics-programs&amp;specialty=applied-mathematics-rankings&amp;name=&amp;zip=&amp;program_rank=Any&amp;sort=&amp;sortdir=|title = Search: Sciences Programs {{!}} US News|publisher = US News|date = |accessdate = 2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; #5 in citation impact worldwide, and #12 in citation worldwide. On the [[Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index]], it is ranked #3 with an index of 1.84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/stats/productivity/page.php?byinst=true&amp;institution=2478&amp;year=2007 |title=Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index |publisher=The Chronicle |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known for its extensive research in pure mathematical areas, such as [[partial differential equations]], [[probability]] and [[geometry]], as well as applied mathematical areas, such as [[computational biology]], [[computational neuroscience]], and [[mathematical finance]]. The Mathematics Department of the Institute has 18 members of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] (more than any other mathematics department in the U.S.) and five members of the [[National Academy of Engineering]]. Four faculty members have been awarded the National Medal of Science, one was honored with the Kyoto Prize, and nine have received career awards from the National Science Foundation. Courant Institute professors [[Peter Lax]], [[S. R. Srinivasa Varadhan]], [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Mikhail Gromov]], [[Louis Nirenberg]]  won the 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2015 [[Abel Prize]] respectively for their research in partial differential equations, probability and geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/nyregion/01nyu.html | work=The New York Times | first=Lisa W. | last=Foderaro | title=Complex Math, Simple Sum: 3 Awards in 5 Years | date=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Nirenberg]] also received the [[Chern Medal]] in 2010, and [[Subhash Khot]] won the [[Nevanlinna Prize]] in 2014.

The Director of the Courant Institute directly reports to New York University's Provost and President and works closely with deans and directors of other NYU colleges and divisions respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cims.nyu.edu/about/courant.html|title=NYU &gt; Courant Institute &gt; About &gt; Courant and NYU|date=|publisher=Cims.nyu.edu|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undergraduate programs and graduate programs at the Courant Institute are run independently by the Institute, and formally associated with the [[NYU College of Arts and Science]] and [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]] respectively.

===Rankings===
The Courant Institute specializes in [[applied mathematics]], [[mathematical analysis]] and [[scientific computation]]. There is emphasis on [[partial differential equations]] and their applications.  The mathematics department is consistently ranked in the United States as #1 in applied mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/applied-mathematics-rankings |title=Best Applied Mathematics Programs &amp;#124; Top Math Schools &amp;#124; US News Best Graduate Schools |publisher=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other strong points are  analysis (currently #6)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/mathematical-analysis-rankings |title=Best Mathematical Analysis Programs &amp;#124; Top Math Schools &amp;#124; US News Best Graduate Schools |publisher=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  geometry (currently #10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/geometry-rankings |title=Best Geometry Programs &amp;#124; Top Math Schools &amp;#124; US News Best Graduate Schools |publisher=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the field of [[computer science]], CIMS concentrates in [[machine learning]], [[computation|theory]], [[programming languages]], [[computer graphics]] and [[parallel computing]]. The computer science program is ranked 28th among computer science programs in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings/page+2 |title=Best Computer Science Programs &amp;#124; Top Computer Science Schools &amp;#124; US News Best Graduate Schools |publisher=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] placed the Courant Institute as #2 worldwide in the subject ranking for mathematics.&lt;ref name="shanghairanking.com"/&gt;

===Admissions===
The Courant Institute offers [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Master of Science]] and [[Ph.D.]] degree programs in both [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] with program acceptance rates ranging from 3% to 29%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegradcafe.com/survey/index.php?q=NYU+computer+science&amp;t=a&amp;pp=50&amp;o=p |title=NYU computer science â¢ |publisher=Thegradcafe.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall acceptance rate for all CIMS graduate programs is 15%, and program admissions reviews are holistic. A high undergraduate GPA and high GRE score are typically prerequisites to admission to its graduate programs but are not required. Majority of accepted candidates met these standards. However, character and personal qualities and evidence of strong quantitative skills are very important admission factors. Consistent with its scientific breadth, the Institute welcomes applicants whose primary background is in quantitative fields such as economics, engineering, physics, or biology, as well as mathematics. Undergraduate program admissions are not directly administrated by the Institute but by the NYU undergraduate admissions office of College of Arts and Science.&lt;ref name="math.nyu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/financial_mathematics/content/05_prospectiveStudents/04.html |title=Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences NYU |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/degree/phd/application.html |title=Graduate Mathematics Courses |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/graduate/admissions/admission |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Graduate Admissions Information |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/new-york-university-courant-institute-of-mathematical-sciences-department-of-mathematics-admissions-000_10014124_10088.aspx |title=Department of Mathematics Admissions - New York University (Department of Mathematics) |publisher=Petersons.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduate program===
The Department of Mathematics at the Courant Institute offers PhDs in Mathematics, Atmosphere-Ocean Science, and Computational Biology; Masters of Science in Mathematical Finance, Mathematics, and Scientific Computing.

[[File:CIMS Lecture Hall.jpg|thumb|Lecture Hall at Warren Weaver Hall]]
The Graduate Department of Computer Science offers a PhD in computer science. In addition it offers Master of Science degrees in computer science, information systems (in conjunction with the [[Stern School of Business]]), and in scientific computing. For the PhD program, every PhD computer science student must receive a grade of A or A- on the final examination for algorithms, systems, applications, and a PhD-level course chosen by the student that does not satisfy the first three requirements, such as cryptography and numerical methods. Students may take the final exam for any these courses without being enrolled in the course.

The Computer Science Masters program offers instruction in the fundamental principles, design and applications of computer systems and computer technologies. Students who obtain an MS degree in computer science are qualified to do significant development work in the computer industry or important application areas. Those who receive a doctoral degree are in a position to hold faculty appointments and do research and development work at the forefront of this rapidly changing and expanding field. The emphasis for the MS in Information Systems program is on the use of computer systems in business. For the Master of Science in Scientific Computing, it is designed to provide broad training in areas related to scientific computing using modern computing technology and mathematical modeling arising in various applications. The core of the curriculum for all computer science graduate students consists of courses in algorithms, programming languages, compilers, artificial intelligence, database systems, and operating systems. Advanced courses are offered in many areas such as natural language processing, the theory of computation, computer vision, software engineering, compiler optimization techniques, computer graphics, distributed computing, multimedia, networks, cryptography and security, groupware and [[computational finance]]. Adjunct faculty, drawn from outside academia, teach special topics courses in their areas of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/graduate/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Graduate Programs in Computer Science |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless outside fellowships or scholarships are available to the students, all admitted Courant PhD students are granted with the GSAS MacCracken award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.math.nyu.edu/dynamic/phd/admissions-financial-support/financial-support/|title=Financial Support - Department of Mathematics - NYU Courant|author=|date=|website=www.math.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fellowship covers the tuition and provides 9 months of stipend along with other benefits such as health insurance and special housing opportunies. The MacCracken funding is renewable for a period of up to five years, assuming satisfactory progress toward the degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/gsas/admissions/financial-aid/maccracken-housing-program-for-doctoral-students.html|title=MacCracken Housing Program for Doctoral Students|author=|date=|website=gsas.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctoral students take advanced courses in their areas of specialization, followed by a period of research and the preparation and defense of the doctoral thesis. Courant Students in Ph.D. programs may earn a master's degree while in progress toward the Ph.D program. Areas where there are special funding opportunities for graduate students include: Mathematics, Mechanics, and Material Sciences, Number Theory, Probability, and Scientific Computing. All PhD candidates are required to take a written comprehensive examination, oral preliminary examination, and create a dissertation defense. Each supported doctoral student has access to his or her own dedicated Unix workstation. Many other research machines provide for abundant access to a variety of computer architectures, including a distributed computing laboratory.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/degree/phd/ |title=The Ph.D. Program |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undergraduate program===
The Courant Institute houses New York University's undergraduate programs in computer science and mathematics. In addition, CIMS provides opportunities and facilities for undergraduate students to do and discuss mathematical research, including an undergraduate math lounge on the 11th floor and an undergraduate computer science lounge on the 3rd floor of Warren Weaver Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/MathLounge.html |title=Math Lounge |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718174327/http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/MathLounge.html |archive-date=2011-07-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-derivatives.com/index.php?Itemid=5&amp;id=91&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view |title=New York University - MSc Mathematics in Finance |publisher=Global-derivatives.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics and computer science undergraduate and graduate programs at the Courant Institute has a strong focus on building quantitative and problem-solving skills through teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/ |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Undergraduate Program |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/ |title=Department of Mathematics, Courant Institute |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; An undergraduate computer science course on Computer Vision, for example, requires students to be in small teams to use and apply recently developed algorithms by researchers around the world on their own. One example assignment requires a student to study a paper written by researchers from [[Microsoft Research Cambridge]] in order to do an assignment on Segmentation and Graph Cut. To encourage innovation, students in advanced coursework are allowed to use any means to complete their assignment, such as a programming language of their choice and hacking a [[Kinect]] through legal means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring11/V22.0480-001/index.html |title=V22.0480-001 |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Courant Institute's undergraduate program also encourages students to engage in research with professors and graduate students. About 30% of undergraduate students participate in academic research through the competitive [[Research Experiences for Undergraduates]] program funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] or research funded primarily by the Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund. The Courant Institute has one of the highest percentage of undergraduate students doing research within [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |title=NYU &gt; A &amp; S &gt; Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund |publisher=Cas.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629120916/http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |archive-date=2011-06-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/spotlight.html |title=Undergraduate Student Spotlight - NYU Computer Science Department |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531134706/http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program |date=May 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/ |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Undergraduate Program |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; With permission of their advisers or faculty, undergraduate students may take graduate-level courses. Courant undergraduate students through the years and alumni contribute greatly to the vitality of the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. Some accomplishments by current and former undergraduate Courant students include an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Scholarship Winner, development of Object Category Recognition Techniques to sort garbage for recycling for the NYC's trash program, placement in 7th out of 42 in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and inventors of the [[Diaspora (software)]] social network.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The undergraduate division of the Department of Mathematics offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Mathematics. It consists of a wide variety of courses in pure and applied mathematics taught by a distinguished faculty with a tradition of excellence in teaching and research. Students in advanced coursework often participate in formulating models outside the field of mathematics as well as in analyzing them. For example, an advanced mathematics course in Computers in Medicine and Biology requires a student to construct two computer models selected from the following list: circulation, gas exchange in the lung, control of cell volume, and the renal countercurrent mechanism. The student uses the models to conduct simulated physiological experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:vGj-HafADLoJ:math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/Math%2520major%2520bulletin%25202010-11%2520Final.pdf+Math+undergraduate+nyu+requirements&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi4x3xv-_X-4B0Xil4BidRNWKCKg9smDHdaXmhcPNv2gRXB173WgH0mNEM6D-RGr6C-oEz4XoRNBZvoWRQ_RWpcHpNzWxe06LDC0hc2wG0Yi5rf6AFY3cYBVAKb3_wZ-EJjvU6I&amp;sig=AHIEtbSCuQUYJiy-dq4Yg8t8z5z6AnV2Ig |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The undergraduate division of the Department of Computer Science offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, two minors (one in computer science, and one in web programming and applications) and a joint minor in computer science/mathematics. The BA degree can also be pursued with honors. Students may combine the degree with other majors within the College of Arts and Science to create a personalized joint major. Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics. The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates in conjunction with the [[Tandon School of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Undergraduate CS Program Overview |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minor in computer science is designed primarily for mathematics and science majors whose work will require basic programming skills. The minor in web programming and applications is designed for humanities and social sciences students who plan to use computer application software such as spreadsheets, desktop publishing, multimedia, and Internet software extensively in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/minors |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Computer Science Minors |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduation===
The Courant Institute encourages students at any stage of their studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their career options. Members of the faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist students in finding appropriate summer employment. All graduate students are given official advisers, and  undergraduates are provided mentors from Courant faculty.

===Academic research===
[[File:Games for Learning Institute.jpg|thumb|The Courant Institute along with Microsoft Research are the founders of the Games for Learning Institute]]
The Department of Mathematics at Courant occupies a leading position in analysis and applied mathematics, including [[partial differential equations]], [[differential geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[probability]] and [[stochastic processes]], [[scientific computation]], [[mathematical finance]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. A special feature of the Institute is its highly interdisciplinary character â with courses, seminars, and active research collaborations in areas such as [[financial mathematics]], materials science, visual neural science, atmosphere/ocean science, cardiac fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and mathematical genomics. Another special feature is the central role of [[analysis]], which provides a natural bridge between pure and applied mathematics. The Department of Computer Science has strengths in multimedia, programming languages and systems, distributed and parallel computing, and the [[analysis of algorithms]].

Since 1948, Courant Institute has maintained its own research journal, [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]], which currently has the highest impact factor internationally among mathematics journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/78504520/issue |title=Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;   While the journal represents the full spectrum of the Institute's mathematical research activity, most articles are in  the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical analysis, or mathematical physics. Its contents over the years amount to a modern history of the theory of partial differential equations. Most articles originate within the Institute or are specially invited. The Institute also  publishes its own series of lecture notes. They are based on the research interests of the faculty and visitors of the   Institute, originated in advanced graduate courses and mini-courses offered at the Institute.

==History==
In 1934, [[Richard Courant]] left [[GÃ¶ttingen University]] in Germany to become a visiting professor at NYU. He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed "Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].

[[File:Scribus-1.3-Linux.png|300px|thumb|[[Scribus]], an [[Open-source software|open source]] desktop publishing application]]

'''Desktop publishing''' (abbreviated '''DTP''') is the creation of documents using [[page layout]] skills on a personal ("desktop") [[personal computer|computer]] primarily for print. Desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic quality text and images comparable to traditional [[typography]] and [[printing]]. This technology allows individuals, businesses, and other organizations to self-publish a wide range of printed matter. Desktop publishing is also the main reference for [[typography|digital typography]]. When used skillfully, desktop publishing allows the user to produce a wide variety of materials, from [[menu]]s to magazines and books, without the expense of commercial printing.

Desktop publishing combines a [[personal computer]] and [[WYSIWYG]] page layout [[software]] to create [[publication]] [[document]]s on a computer for either [[Publishing|large scale publishing]] or small scale local [[Multifunction printer|multifunction peripheral]] output and distribution. Desktop publishing methods provide more control over design, layout, and typography than [[word processing]]. However, word processing software has evolved to include some, though by no means all, capabilities previously available only with professional printing or desktop publishing.

The same DTP skills and software used for common paper and book publishing are sometimes used to create graphics for [[point of sale display]]s, [[promotional item]]s, [[Trade fair|trade show exhibits]], [[packaging|retail package designs]] and [[Out-of-home advertising|outdoor signs]]. Although what is classified as "DTP software" is usually limited to print and PDF publications, DTP skills aren't limited to print. The content produced by desktop publishers may also be exported and used for [[electronic media]]. The job descriptions that include "DTP", such as [[DTP artist]], often require skills using software for producing [[e-book]]s, web content, and [[web page]]s, which may involve [[web design]] or [[user interface design]] for any [[graphical user interface]].

== History ==

Desktop publishing was first developed at Xerox PARC in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winograd|first1=Terry|title=Bringing Design to Software|date=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0201854916|url=http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/bds/2p-star.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Steve|title=Encyclopedia of New Media|date=2002|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0761923824|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contradictory claim states that desktop publishing began in 1983 with a program developed by [[James Davise]] at a community newspaper in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;"What You See Is Pretty Close to What You Get: New h&amp;j, pagination program for IBM PC, " Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, 13(10), February 13, 1984, pp. 21-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The program Type Processor One ran on a [[Personal computer|PC]] using a [[graphics card]] for a [[WYSIWYG]] display and was offered commercially by Best info in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;"Type-X '85: Fulfilling the Promise of the PC, " Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, 15(2) pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; (Desktop ''[[typesetting]]'' with only limited page makeup facilities had arrived in 1978â9 with the introduction of [[TeX]], and was extended in the early 1980s by [[LaTeX]].) The DTP market exploded in 1985 with the introduction in January of the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[LaserWriter]] printer, and later in July with the introduction of [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]] software from [[Aldus Corporation|Aldus]], which rapidly became the DTP industry standard software. Later on, PageMaker overtook [[Microsoft Word]] in professional DTP in 1985. The term "desktop publishing" is attributed to Aldus founder [[Paul Brainerd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.optimism-modernity.org.uk/documents/index.html#note1 |title=The Stafford papers |first=Paul |last=Stiff |date=13 September 2006 |work=The optimism of modernity: recovering modern reasoning in typography |accessdate=27 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who sought a marketing catch-phrase to describe the small size and relative affordability of this suite of products, in contrast to the expensive commercial [[phototypesetting]] equipment of the day.

Before the advent of desktop publishing, the only option available to most people for producing typed documents (as opposed to handwritten documents) was a [[typewriter]], which offered only a handful of typefaces (usually fixed-width) and one or two font sizes.  Indeed, one popular desktop publishing book was entitled ''The Mac is not a typewriter'', and it had to actually explain how a Mac could do so much more than a typewriter.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Williams, ''The Mac is not a typewriter: A style manual for creating professional-level type on your Macintosh'' (Berkeley: Peachpit Press, 1990), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to create [[WYSIWYG]] page layouts on screen and then [[printing|print]] pages containing text and graphical elements at crisp 300 [[dots per inch|dpi]] resolution was revolutionary for both the typesetting industry and the personal computer industry; newspapers and other print publications made the move to DTP-based programs from older layout systems such as [[Atex (software)|Atex]] and other programs in the early 1980s.  

Early 1980s desktop publishing was a primitive affair. Users of the PageMaker-LaserWriter-Macintosh 512K system endured frequent software crashes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=%2Baldus+%22pagemaker%22+infoworld+review+1987#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=MacIntosh Layout Package Remarkably Fast, Powerful | date=8 June 1987 | accessdate=2011-04-15 | last=Thompson | first=Keith | journal=InfoWorld | volume=9 | issue=23 | pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; cramped display on the Mac's tiny 512 x 342 1-bit [[monochrome]] screen, the inability to control [[letter-spacing]], [[kerning]],&lt;ref&gt;the addition or removal of space between individual characters in a piece of typeset text to improve its appearance or alter its fit&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[typography|typographic features]], and discrepancies between the screen display and printed output. However, it was a revolutionary combination at the time, and was received with considerable acclaim.

Behind-the-scenes technologies developed by [[Adobe Systems]] set the foundation for professional desktop publishing applications. The LaserWriter and LaserWriter Plus printers included high quality, scalable Adobe [[PostScript]] fonts built into their [[Read-only memory|ROM]] memory. The LaserWriter's PostScript capability allowed publication designers to proof files on a local printer, then print the same file at DTP [[service bureau]]s using [[optics|optical resolution]] 600+ ppi PostScript printers such as those from [[Linotronic]]. Later, the [[Macintosh II]] was released which was much more suitable for desktop publishing because of its greater expandability, support for large color [[multi-monitor]] displays, and its [[SCSI]] storage interface which allowed fast high-capacity hard drives to be attached to the system. Macintosh-based systems continued to dominate the market into 1986, when the [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]]-based [[Ventura Publisher]] was introduced for [[MS-DOS]] computers. PageMaker's pasteboard metaphor closely simulated the process of creating layouts manually, but Ventura Publisher automated the layout process through its use of tags and [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|style sheets]] and automatically generated indices and other body matter. This made it suitable for manuals and other long-format documents.

Desktop publishing moved into the home market in 1986 with [[Professional Page]] for the [[Amiga]], [[PageStream|Publishing Partner]] (now PageStream) for the [[Atari ST]], GST's [[Timeworks Publisher]] on the PC and Atari ST, and [[Calamus (DTP)|Calamus]] for the [[Atari TT030]]. Software was published even for 8-bit computers like the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]]: Home Publisher, [[The Newsroom (software)|The Newsroom]], and [[geoPublish]]. During its early years, desktop publishing acquired a bad reputation as a result of untrained users who created poorly organized, unprofessional-looking "[[ransom note effect]]" layouts; similar criticism was leveled again against early [[World Wide Web]] publishers a decade later.  However, some desktop publishers who mastered the programs were able to realize truly professional results. Desktop publishing skills were considered of primary importance in career advancement in the 1980s, but increased accessibility to more user-friendly DTP software has made DTP a secondary skill to [[art direction]], [[graphic design]], [[multimedia]] development, [[marketing communications]], and [[Administration (business)|administrative careers]].  DTP skill levels range from what may be learned in a few hours (e.g., learning how to put clip art in a word processor) to what requires a college education.  The discipline of DTP skills range from technical skills such as [[prepress]] production and programming to creative skills such as [[communication design]] and [[graphic image development]].

{{asof|2014}} Apple computers remain dominant in publishing, even as the most popular software has changed from [[QuarkXPress]] (an estimated 95% market share in the 1990s) to [[Adobe InDesign]]. An [[Ars Technica]] writer claimed that year that "I've heard about Windows-based publishing environments, but I've never actually seen one in my 20+ years in design and publishing".&lt;ref name="girard20140113"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/quarkxpress-the-demise-of-a-design-desk-darling/ |title=How QuarkXPress became a mere afterthought in publishing |last=Girard |first=Dave |date=2014-01-13 |work=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are two types of pages in desktop publishing, [[electronic page]]s and virtual paper pages to be printed on [[Page (paper)|physical paper pages]]. All computerized documents are technically electronic, which are limited in size only by [[computer memory]] or [[computer data storage]] space. Virtual paper pages will ultimately be [[printing|printed]], and therefore require paper parameters that coincide with [[paper size|international standard physical paper sizes]] such as "A4, " "letter, " etc., if not custom sizes for trimming. Some desktop publishing programs allow custom sizes designated for large format printing used in [[poster]]s, [[billboard]]s and [[trade show displays]]. A virtual page for printing has a predesignated size of virtual printing material and can be viewed on a monitor in [[WYSIWYG]] format. Each page for printing has trim sizes (edge of paper) and a printable area if [[bleed (printing)|bleed printing]] is not possible as is the case with most [[desktop printer]]s. A [[web page]] is an example of an electronic page that is not constrained by virtual paper parameters. Most electronic pages may be dynamically re-sized, causing either the [[content (media and publishing)|content]] to scale in size with the page or causing the [[reflow document|content to re-flow]].

Master pages are templates used to automatically copy or link elements and graphic design styles to some or all the pages of a multipage document. Linked elements can be modified without having to change each instance of an element on pages that use the same element. Master pages can also be used to apply graphic design styles to automatic page numbering. [[Cascading Style Sheets]] can provide the same global formatting functions for web pages that master pages provide for virtual paper pages. [[Page layout]] is the process by which the elements are laid on the page orderly, aesthetically, and precisely. Main types of components to be laid out on a page include [[wikt:text|text]], linked [[image]]s that can only be modified as an external source, and embedded images that may be modified with the layout application software. Some embedded images are [[Artistic rendering|rendered]] in the application software, while others can be placed from an external source image file. Text may be [[typing|keyed]] into the layout, placed, or (with [[database publishing]] applications) linked to an external source of text which allows multiple editors to develop a document at the same time.
[[Graphic design]] styles such as color, transparency, and filters, may also be applied to layout elements. [[Typography]] styles may be applied to text automatically with [[stylÃ© sheet (desktop publishing)|style sheets]]. Some layout programs include style sheets for images in addition to text. Graphic styles for images may be border shapes, colors, transparency, filters, and a parameter designating the way text flows around the object called "wraparound" or "runaround. "

== Comparisons ==

=== With word processing ===

As desktop publishing software still provides extensive features necessary for print publishing, modern word processors now have publishing capabilities beyond those of many older DTP applications, blurring the line between [[word processing]] and desktop publishing. In the early days of [[graphical user interface]]s in the early 1980s, DTP software was in a class of its own when compared to the fairly spartan word processing applications of the time.  Programs such as [[WordPerfect]] and [[WordStar]] were still mainly text-based and offered little in the way of page layout, other than perhaps margins and line spacing.  On the other hand, word processing software was necessary for features like indexing and spell checking, features that are common in many applications today. As computers and operating systems have become more powerful, versatile and user-friendly in the 2010s, vendors have sought to provide users with a single application platform that can meet almost all their publication needs.

=== With other electronic layout software ===

In 2010-era usage, DTP does not usually include digital tools such as [[TeX]] or [[troff]], though both can easily be used on a modern desktop system and are standard with many [[Unix-like]] operating systems and readily available for other systems. The key difference between electronic [[typesetting]] software and DTP software is that DTP software is generally interactive and "What you see [onscreen] is what you get" ([[WYSIWYG]]) in design, while other electronic typesetting software, such as [[TeX]], [[LaTeX]] and other variants, tend to operate in "[[batch mode]]", requiring the user to enter the processing program's [[markup language]] (e.g. [[HTML]]) without immediate visualization of the finished product.  This kind of workflow is less user-friendly than WYSIWYG, but more suitable for conference proceedings and scholarly articles as well as corporate newsletters or other applications where consistent, automated layout is important.  In the 2010s, {{when|date=June 2014}} interactive front-end components of [[TeX]], such as [[TeXworks]] or [[LyX]] have produced "what you see is what you mean" ([[WYSIWYM]]) hybrids of DTP and batch processing. These hybrids are focused more on [[semantics]] than traditional DTP. There is some overlap between desktop publishing and what is known as [[hypermedia]] publishing (e.g. [[web design]], kiosk, [[CD-ROM]]).  Many graphical [[HTML editors]] such as [[Microsoft FrontPage]] and [[Adobe Dreamweaver]] use a layout engine similar to a DTP program. However, many web designers still prefer to write HTML without the assistance of a WYSIWYG editor, for greater control and ability to fine-tune the appearance and functionality. Another reason that some Web designers write in HTML is that WYSIWYG editors often result in excessive lines of code, leading to [[code bloat]] that can make the pages hard to [[troubleshoot]].

=== With web design ===

Desktop publishing produces primarily static print or [[electronic media]], the focus of this article.  Similar skills, processes, and terminology are used in [[web design]].  Digital typography is the specialization of [[typography]] for desktop publishing. [[Web typography]] addresses typography and the use of fonts on the [[World Wide Web]].  [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|Desktop style sheets]] apply formatting for print, web [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) provide format control for web display. Web  [[font family (HTML)|HTML font families]] map [[website]] font usage to the [[computer font|fonts]] available on the user [[web browser]] or display device.

[[File:EscolArtOlot.JPG|thumb|left|265px|School's building]]
'''Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny d'Olot''' is the main Design and Arts &amp; Crafts school of the region of [[Province of Girona|Girona]] ([[Catalonia]], Spain). Since its foundation, it has maintained an active participation in the social, educational, economic and cultural life. The school is in [[Olot]], a city with a population of over 34,000 inhabitants.

==History==
The School was founded as '''Fine Arts School''' on 1 July 1783 by Bishop Tomas Lorenzana. In 1891 was renamed as '''Minor Fine Arts' School''', and during the period 1934â1938 was designed as '''Landscape's School''', depending on the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]].

During the 1986â87 academic year the official teaching of applied arts and crafts began, according to the official plan for 1963 schools; the school at this time depended on Olot's City Council.

On 20 June 1990 the school became part of the Catalonia official network of art schools with the name of '''Escola d'Arts Applicades i Oficis ArtÃ­stics d'Olot'''; human resources and management switched to the Generalitat de Catalunya.

Since the 2003â2004 academic year the school has become '''Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny d'Olot''', by completing the training with a Bachelor in Interior Design. Since the 2007â08 academic year the school also teaches a Bachelor of Graphic Design. Since 2010â11 it became one of seven ESDAP (Escola Superior de Disseny i Arts PlÃ stiques) and began to teach undergraduate Design (adapted to the [[European Higher Education Area]]).

==Location==

The institution is at the "Claustres del Carme" building, the Carmelite Cloisters, which date back to the Renaissance.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
[[Image:Tree of life.svg|right|thumb|A [[phylogenetic tree]] of living things]]
'''Evolutionary ecology''' lies at the intersection of [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. It approaches the study of ecology in a way that explicitly considers the evolutionary histories of species and the interactions between them. Conversely, it can be seen as an approach to the study of evolution that incorporates an understanding of the interactions between the species under consideration. The main subfields of evolutionary ecology are [[Life history theory|life history evolution]], [[sociobiology]] (the [[evolution]] of social [[behavior]]), the evolution of inter specific relations ([[cooperation]], [[Predator-prey interaction|predatorâprey interactions]], [[parasitism]], [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]) and the evolution of [[biodiversity]] and of [[Community|communities]].

Evolutionary ecology mostly considers two things: how interactions (both among species and between species and their physical environment) shape species through selection and adaptation, and the consequences of the resulting evolutionary change.

==Evolutionary models==
{{Evolutionary biology}}
A large part of evolutionary ecology is about utilising models and finding empirical data as proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morozov|first=Andrew|date=2013-12-06|title=Modelling biological evolution: recent progress, current challenges and future direction|journal=Interface Focus|volume=3|issue=6|pages=20130054|doi=10.1098/rsfs.2013.0054|issn=2042-8898|pmc=3915852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the Lack clutch size model devised by [[David Lack]] and his study of [[Darwin's finches]] on the Galapagos Islands. Lack's study of Darwin's finches was important in analyzing the role of different ecological factors in [[speciation]]. Lack suggested that differences in species were adaptive and produced by [[natural selection]], based on the assertion by G.F. Gause that two species cannot occupy the same niche.&lt;ref&gt;"Lack, David Lambert." Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography, vol. 17, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2008, pp. 521â523. Gale Virtual Reference Library, go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;u=tusc49521&amp;v=2.1&amp;id=GALE%7CCX2830905204&amp;it=r&amp;asid=f73ad736d17e749682f6a72c03aeca54. Accessed 10 Nov. 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Levins]] introduced his model of the specialization of species in 1968, which investigated how habitat specialization evolved within heterogeneous environments using the fitness sets an organism or species possesses. This model developed the concept of spatial scales in specific environments, defining fine-grained spatial scales and coarse-grained spatial scales.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Joel S., and Noel B. Pavlovic. âEvolution in heterogeneous environments: Effects of migration on habitat specialization.â Evolutionary Ecology, vol. 6, no. 5, 1992, pp. 360â382. {{doi|10.1007/bf02270698}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of this model include a rapid increase in environmental ecologists' understanding of how spatial scales impact species diversity in a certain environment.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Simon P., et al. âThe spatial scales of species coexistence.â Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution, vol. 1, no. 8, 2017, pp. 1066â1073. {{doi|10.1038/s41559-017-0230-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model is Law and Diekmann's 1996 models on [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], which is defined as a relationship between two organisms that benefits both individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Bronstein, Judith. âMutualisms and Symbioses.â Oxford Bibliographies, 20 Nov 2017, www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0006.xml.&lt;/ref&gt; Law and Diekmann developed a framework called adaptive dynamics, which assumes that changes in plant or animal populations in response to a disturbance or lack thereof occurs at a faster rate than mutations occur. It is aimed to simplify other models addressing the relationships within communities.&lt;ref&gt;AkÃ§ay, Erol. (2015). Evolutionary models of mutualism. In J. L. Bronstein (Ed.), Mutualism (pp. 57â76). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tangled nature model ==
The tangled nature model provides different methods for demonstrating and predicting trends in evolutionary ecology. The model analyzes an individual prone to [[mutation]] within a population as well as other factors such as extinction rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Tangled Nature Model of Evolutionary Ecology: An Overview |author=Laird, Simon |journal=Mathematical Modeling of Biological Systems| volume= II|pages= 49â62 |doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4556-4_5|year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8176-4555-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was developed by Simon Laird, Daniel Lawson, and Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen of the Imperial College London in 2002. The purpose of the model is to create a simple and logical ecological model based on observation. The model is designed such that ecological effects can be accounted for when determining form, and fitness of a population.

== Ecological genetics ==
Ecological genetics tie into evolutionary ecology through the study of how traits evolve in natural populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0021214.html |title=Ecological Genetics |publisher=Wiley |date=September 2016 |access-date=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists are concerned with how the environment and timeframe leads to genes becoming dominant. Organisms must continually adapt in order to survive in natural habitats. Genes define which organisms survive and which will die out. When organisms develop different genetic variations, even though they stem from the same species, it is known as polymorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Polymorphism |title=Polymorphism |publisher=biology online |date=December 6, 2008 |access-date=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms that pass on beneficial genes continue to evolve their species to have an advantage inside of their niche.

==Evolutionary ecologists==
[[Image:Charles Darwin by Julia Margaret Cameron 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julia Margaret Cameron]]âs portrait of Darwin]]

=== Charles Darwin ===

The basis of the central principles of evolutionary ecology can be attributed to [[Charles Darwin]] (1809â1882), specifically in referencing his theory of [[natural selection]] and [[population dynamics]], which discusses how populations of a species change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/ecologyapp/modules/population-dynamics/|title=Population Dynamics {{!}} e-cology|website=sites.nicholas.duke.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ernst Mayr]], professor of Zoology at Harvard University, Darwinâs most distinct contributions to evolutionary biology and ecology are as follows: âThe first is the non-constancy of species, or the modern conception of [[evolution]] itself. The second is the notion of branching evolution, implying the common descent of all species of living things on earth from a single unique origin.â&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/darwins-influence-on-modern-thought/|title=Darwin's Influence on Modern Thought|last=Mayr|first=Ernst|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, âDarwin further noted that evolution must be gradual, with no major breaks or discontinuities. Finally, he reasoned that the mechanism of evolution was natural selection.â&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/darwins-influence-on-modern-thought/|title=Darwin's Influence on Modern Thought|last=Mayr|first=Ernst|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== George Evelyn Hutchinson ===
[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson|George Evelyn Hutchinsonâs]] (1903â1991) contributions to the field of ecology spanned over 60 years, in which he had significant influence in systems ecology, radiation ecology, [[limnology]], and [[entomology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobodkin|first=L.B.|date=1993|title=An Appreciation: George Evelyn Hutchinson|jstor=5370|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=62|issue=2|pages=390â394|doi=10.2307/5370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as the âfather of modern ecologyâ &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobodkin|first=L.B.|date=1993|title=An Appreciation: George Evelyn Hutchinson|jstor=5370|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=62|issue=2|pages=390â394|doi=10.2307/5370}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Stephen Jay Gould]], Hutchinson was one of the first scientists to link the subjects of ecology and mathematics. According to Hutchinson, he constructed âmathematical models of populations, the changing proportions of individuals of various ages, birthrate, the [[ecological niche]], and population interaction in this technical introduction to population ecology.â&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60322007|title=Introduction to population ecology|last=1943-|first=Rockwood, Larry L.,|date=2006|publisher=Blackwell Pub|isbn=9781405132633|location=Malden, MA|oclc=60322007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also had a vast interest in limnology, due to his belief that lakes could be studied as a [[microcosm (experimental ecosystem)|microcosm]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;that provides insight into system behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyland|first=Callen|date=Summer 2011|title=The Art of Ecology, Writings of G. Evelyn Hutchinson|journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine|volume=84|issue=2|pages=175â176|issn=0044-0086|pmc=3117418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchinson is also known for his work Circular Casual Systems in Ecology, in which he states that âgroups of organisms may be acted upon by their environment, and they may react upon it. If a set of properties in either system changes in such a way that the action of the first system on the second changes, this may cause changes in properties of the second system which alter the mode of action of the second system on the first.â &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first=G. Evelyn|date=1948-10-01|title=Circular Causal Systems in Ecology|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1948.tb39854.x/abstract|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=50|issue=4|pages=221â246|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1948.tb39854.x|issn=1749-6632|bibcode=1948NYASA..50..221H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert MacArthur ===

[[Robert H. MacArthur|Robert MacArthur]] (1930â1972) is best known in the field of Evolutionary Ecology for his work ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]'', in which he and his co-author propose âthat the number of species on any island reflects a balance between the rate at which new species colonize it and the rate at which populations of established species become [[Extinction|extinct]].â&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Island_Biogeography.html|title=Island Biogeography|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eric Pianka ===

According to the University of Texas, [[Eric Pianka]]âs (1939âpresent) work in evolutionary ecology includes foraging strategies, reproductive tactics, competition and niche theory, community structure and organization, species diversity, and understanding rarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/ERP-Contributions.html|title=Eric Pianka's Contributions to Ecology|website=www.zo.utexas.edu|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pianka is also known for his interest in lizards to study ecological occurrences, as he claimed they were âoften abundant, making them relatively easy to locate, observe, and capture.â&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/ERP-Contributions.html|title=Eric Pianka's Contributions to Ecology|website=www.zo.utexas.edu|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Michael Rosenzweig ===

[[Michael Rosenzweig|Michael L. Rosenzweig]] (1941âpresent) created and popularized [[Reconciliation ecology]], which began with his theory that designated nature preserves would not be enough land to conserve the [[biodiversity]] of Earth, as humans have used so much land that they have negatively impacted [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and had other ecological impacts that have negatively affected species compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62866022|title=Win-win ecology : how the earth's species can survive in the midst of human enterprise|last=L.|first=Rosenzweig, Michael|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195156041|location=Oxford|oclc=62866022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other notable evolutionary ecologists ===
* [[R. A. Fisher]] (1890â1962), whose 1930 [[fundamental theorem of natural selection]] recognised the power of rigorous application of the theory of natural selection to population biology.&lt;ref&gt;Eric R. Pianka. 2011. Evolutionary Ecology. Seventh Edition â eBook. p. 13. Accessed 7 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Lack]] (1910â1973), a follower of [[Charles Darwin]], worked to merge the fields of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[ecology]], focusing mainly on birds and [[evolution]].
* [[Thierry LodÃ©]] (1956âpresent), a French ecologist whose work focused on how sexual conflict in populations of species impacts evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Thierry LodÃ© 2014. Manifeste pour une Ã©cologie Ã©volutive. Eds Odile Jacob, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LodÃ©, Thierry, et al. âAsynchronous arrival pattern, operational sex ratio and occurrence of multiple paternities in a territorial breeding anuran, Rana dalmatina.â Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, vol. 86, no. 2, 2005, pp. 191â200. {{doi|10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00521.x.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Michael Rosenzweig's idea of [[reconciliation ecology]] was developed based on existing research, which was conducted on the principle first suggested by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] stating that larger areas of land will have increased species diversity as compared to smaller areas. This research focused on [[Speciesâarea relationship|species-area relationships]] (SPARs) and the different scales on which they exist, ranging from sample-area to interprovincial SPARs. Steady-state dynamics in diversity gave rise to these SPARs, which are now used to measure the reduction of species diversity on Earth. In response to this decline in diversity, Rosenzweig's reconciliation ecology was born.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, Michael L. âReconciliation ecology and the future of species diversity.â Oryx, vol. 37, no. 02, 10 Feb. 2003, {{doi|10.1017/s0030605303000371}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary ecology has been studied using symbiotic relationships between organisms to determine the evolutionary forces by which such relationships develop. In symbiotic relationships, the [[symbiont]] must confer some advantage to its host in order to persist and continue to be evolutionarily viable. Research has been conducted using aphids and the symbiotic bacteria with which they coevolve. These bacteria are most frequently conserved from generation to generation, displaying high levels of [[vertical transmission]]. Results have shown that these symbiotic bacteria ultimately confer some resistance to parasites to their host aphids, which both increases the fitness of the aphids and lead to symbiont-mediated coevolution between the species.&lt;ref&gt;Vorburger, Christoph, et al. âComparing constitutive and induced costs of symbiont-Conferred resistance to parasitoids in aphids.â Ecology and Evolution, vol. 3, no. 3, 2013, pp. 706â13. {{doi|10.1002/ece3.491}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color variation in cichlid fish ==
The effects of evolutionary ecology and its consequences can be seen in the case of color variation among [[Cichlid|African cichlid fish]]. With over 2,000 species, cichlid fishes are very species-rich and capable of complex social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-8-133 |title=Functional diversity in the color vision of cichlid fishes |journal=BMC Biology |volume=8 |pages=133 |publisher=BMC Biology, BioMed Central |date=October 28, 2010 |access-date=November 4, 2017|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-8-133 |pmid=21029409 |pmc=2988715 |last1=Sabbah |first1=Shai |last2=Laria |first2=Raico |last3=Gray |first3=Suzanne M |last4=Hawryshyn |first4=Craig W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polychromatism, the variation of color patterns within a population, occurs within cichlid fishes due to environmental adaptations and to increase chances of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1420-9101.1999.00055.x/abstract |title=Evolution of colour patterns in East African cichlid fish |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=514 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |date=December 25, 2001 |access-date=November 4, 2017|doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.1999.00055.x |last1=Seehausen |last2=Mayhew |last3=Alphen |first3=J.

'''Forensic profiling''' is the study of [[trace evidence]] in order to develop [[Offender profiling|information]] which can be used by [[Police|police authorities]]. This information can be used to identify suspects and convict them in a court of law.

The term "[[forensic]]" in this context refers to "information that is used in court as evidence" {{Harv|Geradts|Sommer|2006|p=10}}. The traces originate from criminal or litigious activities themselves. However traces are information that is not strictly dedicated to the court. They may increase knowledge in broader domains linked to security that deal with investigation, intelligence, surveillance, or risk analysis {{Harv|Geradts|Sommer|2008|p=26}}. 

Forensic profiling is different than [[offender profiling]], which only refers to the identification of an offender to the psychological profile of a criminal.

In particular, forensic profiling should refer to [[profiling (information science)|profiling]] in the information sciences sense, i.e., to "The process of 'discovering' correlations between data in data bases that can be used to identify and represent a human or nonhuman subject (individual or group), and/or the application of profiles (sets of correlated data) to individuate and represent a subject or to identify a subject as a member of a group or category"  {{Harv|Geradts|Sommer|2006|p=41}}.

== Profiling techniques ==

Forensic profiling is generally conducted using [[datamining]] technology, as a means by which relevant patterns are discovered, and profiles are generated from large quantities of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://v5.books.elsevier.com/bookscat/samples/9780750676137/9780750676137.pdf|title=Pre-Crime Data Mining|last=|first=|date=|website=cs.brown.edu/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction of forms of profiles that are used in a given context is necessary before evaluating applications of [[data mining]] techniques for forensic profiling.

== Data available ==

The data available to law enforcement agencies are divided into two categories {{Harv|Geradts|Sommer|2008|p=15}}:
* '''Nominal data''' directly designates persons or objects (recidivists, intelligence files and suspect files, stolen vehicles or objects, etc.) and their relations. Nominal data may also be obtained in the framework of specific investigations, for instance a list of calls made with a [[mobile phone]] (card and/or phone) that cover a certain period of time, a list of people corresponding to a certain profile, or data obtained through surveillances;
* '''Crime data''' consist of traces that result from criminal activities: physical traces, other information collected at the scene, from witness or victims or some electronic traces, as well as reconstructed descriptions of cases (modus operandi, time intervals, duration and place) and their relations (links between cases, series).

== Types ==

* [[DNA profiling]]  Used for the identification of individuals on the basis of their respective DNA profiles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/from-the-crime-scene-to-the-courtroom-the-journey-of-a-dna-sample-82250|title=From the crime scene to the courtroom: the journey of a DNA sample|last=Curtis|first=Caitlin|date=August 29, 2017|work=The Conversation|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Hereward|first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* '''Digital Image Forensics'''. This covers: ''image source identification'' (which is based on specific characteristics of the image acquisition device or technology) and ''malicious post-processing or tampering'' (which aim is for instance to verify the integrity of particular features) {{Harv|Popescu|Farid|2005}}.
* '''Illicit drug profiling''', which refers to the systematic extraction and storage of chemical attributes of drugs seized in order to obtain indications on the manufacture and distribution processes, the size and the evolution of the market). {{Harv|Terrettaz-Zufferey|Ratle|Ribaux|Esseiva|Khanevski|2007}}
* '''Forensic Information Technology''' (forensic IT), which refers to the analysis of the [[digital traces]] that people leave when using [[information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forensiccontrol.com/resources/beginners-guide-computer-forensics/|title=An introduction to Computer Forensics by Forensic Control|work=Forensic Control|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Offender profiling''' i.e. psychological profiling of the criminal.

== Issues ==
The use of profiling techniques represents threats to the [[privacy]] of the individual and to the protection of [[Human rights|fundamental freedoms]]. Indeed, criminal data, i.e., data which are collected and processed for suppressing criminal offences, often consists of personal data. One of the issues is the re-use of personal data collected within one criminal investigation for another purpose than the one for which it was collected.

Several methods-including technical, legal, and behavioral-are available to address some of the issues associated with forensic profiling. For instance, in Europe the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] provides a number of instruments for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data.

'''Four Treasures of the Study''', '''Four Jewels of the Study''' or '''Four Friends of the Study''' is an expression used to denote the [[ink brush|brush]], [[inkstick|ink]], [[Xuan paper|paper]] and [[ink stone]] used in [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese]] and other [[East Asia]]n calligraphic traditions.  The name appears to originate in the time of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] (420â589 AD).&lt;ref name="ctoday"&gt;Chinesetoday.com. "[http://www.chinesetoday.com/news/show/id/9689 Chinesetoday.com]." ''è¶£è«ãææ¿åå¯¶ã.'' Retrieved on 2010-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four Treasures==
Chinese culture is very fond of [[Chengyu|four word couplets]], and the '''Four Treasures''' is another example: "ææ¿åå¯¶: ç­ãå¢¨ãç´ãç¡¯," (Pinyin: ''wÃ©n fÃ¡ng sÃ¬ bÇo: bÇ, mÃ², zhÇ, yÃ n'') "''The four jewels of the study: Brush, Ink, Paper, Inkstone.''"&lt;ref name="ctoday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="big5x"&gt;Big5.xinhuanet.com. "[http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/www.godpp.gov.cn/yxzp_/2007-10/23/content_11468094.htm Big5.xinhuanet.com]." ''èµ°è¿ææ¿åå¯¶.'' Retrieved on 2010-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the couplet mentioned, each of the '''Treasures''' is referred to by a single [[epithet]]; however, each of these are usually known by a compound name (''i.e.'' The Brush: æ¯ç­, literally "''hair brush/pen''). The individual treasures have a "treasured" form, each being produced in certain areas of China as a speciality for those scholars who would use them.These are called the 4 SPECIAL Treasures of the Study.

===Brush===
{{Main|Ink brush}}

[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - calligraphy brush with dragon design.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A highly decorative badger hair brush dating to the [[Ming Dynasty]].]] The brush ({{zh|t=æ¯ç­|s=æ¯ç¬|p=mÃ¡o bÇ}}) is the oldest '''Four Treasures''' member, with archaeological evidence dating to [[Zhou dynasty]] (1045 BCâ256 BC) illustrations on ancient bones. The oldest brush so far dates to [[Han dynasty]] (202 BCâ220 AD). Brushes are generally made from animal hair, or âin certain situationsâthe first hair taken from a baby's head (said to bring good luck in the [[Imperial examinations]]). Brush handles are commonly constructed from [[bamboo]], but special brushes may have handles of [[sandalwood]], [[jade]], carved bone/ivory, or other precious materials.

Modern brushes are primarily white goat hair (ç¾æ¯«), black rabbit hair (ç´«æ¯«), yellow weasel hair (é»é¼ æ¯«/ç¼æ¯«), or a combination mix. Ancient brushes, and some of the more valuable ones available on the market may be made with the hair of any number of different types of animals. Each type of hair has a specific ink capacity, giving distinct brush strokes. Different brushes are used for different styles of calligraphy and writing.

Brushes are classed as soft (è»æ¯«), mixed (å¼æ¯«) or hard (ç¡¬æ¯«).  Hair is laboriously sorted by softness, hardness, thickness, &amp; length, then bundled for specific uses. The most famous and highly prized brushes are a mix of yellow weasel, goat and rabbit hair, known as HÃºbÇ (æ¹ç­); highly prized since the [[Ming dynasty]] (late 14th century) they are currently made in [[Shanlian]] (åç), a town in the [[Nanxun District]], [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Huzhou]], of [[Zhejiang province]] (æµæ±).

===Ink===
{{Main|Inkstick}}

[[File:Inkstick.jpg|upright|thumb|An inkstick made in the form of lotus leaves and flowers.]]The Inkstick (Chinese: å¢¨ pinyin: ''{{audio|Zh-mÃ².ogg|mÃ²|help=no}}'') is an artificial ink developed during the [[Han dynasty]]. These first writing inks were based on naturally occurring minerals like [[graphite]] and [[vermilion]]; earliest inks were probably liquids and not preserved. Modern inksticks are generally made of soots from one of three different sources, including [[lacquer]] [[soot]], [[pine]] soot, and [[oil]] soot. Soots are collected, then mixed with glue. Higher quality inksticks also use powdered spices and herbs, adding to aroma and providing some protection to the ink itself.  The glue, soot, and spice mixture is then pressed into shape and allowed to dry. This process can take 6 weeks, depending on an inkstick's dimensions.

The best ink sticks are fine grained and have a light, slightly ringing sound when tapped. They are often decorated with poems, calligraphy, or [[bas relief]], and painted. These particular articles are highly collectable, and often acquired like stamps. The inksticks in highest regard, known as HuÄ«mÃ² (å¾½å¢¨), contain [[musk]], [[borneol]] and other precious [[aromatics]] of [[Chinese medicine]]. They are still produced today in [[She County, Anhui|Shexian]] (æ­å¿) in [[Anhui province]] (å®å¾½).

===Paper===
{{Main|Xuan Paper}}

[[File:Treatise On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|upright|A detail from ''The Treatise on Calligraphy'' by [[Sun Guoting]] (646â691). Ink on Paper.]]Paper (Chinese: ''traditional'' ç´, ''simplified'' çº¸; Pinyin: ''{{audio|Zh-zhÇ.ogg|zhÇ|help=no}}'') was first developed in China in the first decade of 100 AD. Previous to its invention, bamboo slips and silks were used for writing material. Several methods of paper production developed over the centuries in China. However, the paper which was considered of highest value was that of the Jingxian (æ³¾å¿) in Anhui province.

This particular form of paper, known as XuÄnzhÇ (å®£ç´), is soft, fine-textured, moth resistant, has a high tensile strength, and remarkable longevity for such a product â so much so that it has a reputation for lasting "1,000 years". The quality of the paper depends on the processing methods used to produce it. Paper may be unprocessed, half processed or processed. The processing determines how well ink or paint is absorbed into the fibre of the paper, as well as the stiffness of the paper itself. Unprocessed papers are very absorbent and quite malleable, whereas processed papers are far more resistant to absorption and are stiffer.

===Inkstone===
{{Main|Inkstone}}

[[File:Duan Inkstone.JPG|left|thumb|A Duan Inkstone in the shape of a pond.]]The inkstone (Chinese: ''traditional'' ç¡¯ or ç¡¯èº; ''simplified'' ç  or ç å°; Pinyin: ''{{audio|Zh-yÃ n.ogg|yÃ n|help=no}}'' or ''yÃ n tÃ¡i'') is used to grind the ink stick into powder. This powder is then mixed with water in a well in the inkstone in order to produce usable ink for calligraphy. The most ideal water for use in ink is slightly salty. Ink was first prepared using a mortar and pestle, but with the advent of inksticks this method slowly vanished. The stone used is generally of a relatively fine whetstone type.

The earliest known inkstones date back to the [[Han dynasty]]. The production of inkstones reached its zenith in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]] with inkstones becoming extremely intricate works of art. The most highly sought-after inkstones originated in four different locations in China. Duanshi stones (ç«¯ç³ç¡¯) from Duanxi in [[Guangdong]], She stones (æ­ç¡¯) from [[She County, Anhui|Shexian]] in [[Anhui]], Taohe stones (æ´®æ²³ç¡¯) from the [[Tao River]] in South [[Gansu]] and Chengni ceramic stones (æ¾æ³¥ç¡¯) which are manufactured by a process which is said to have been developed in [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]].

==Tools of the Scholar==
Classical scholars had more than just the '''Four treasures''' in their studies. The other "Treasures" include the [[brush-holder]] (ç¬æ¶), brush-hanger (ç¬æ), paperweights (éçº¸), the brush-rinsing pot (ç¬æ´), and the [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]] (åç« ) and seal-ink (å°æ³¥).

For painting, [[Chinese pigment]]s are also used.

'''fraLine''' is a non-profit (research) project of [[Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankfurt-university.de/de/fachbereiche/fb2/forschung_institute_projekte/fraline.html Project on the Website of the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt; Project and research activities focus on IT services management for schools and the use of digital media in educational settings. fraLine is also a joint project between the University of Applied Sciences and the city of [[Frankfurt]] am Main (represented by the "Stadtschulamt" = municipal school-maintaining body).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=4096&amp;_ffmpar_id_inhalt=20557 City of Frankfurt website]&lt;/ref&gt; fraLine and the city of Frankfurt cooperate in the fields of IT support and IT service management in educational contexts as well as technical implementation of digital media in class. fraLine also cooperates with the Hessian state education authority ("[[:de:Staatliches Schulamt|Staatliches Schulamt]]") in the field of media education and digital media training for teachers. 
fraLine was launched in 2001 and employs mainly technical students of the University of Applied Sciences and [[Goethe University Frankfurt]], but also IT professionals, engineers and media educators.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [http://www.thomas-knaus.de Dr. Thomas Knaus] and [http://fraline.de/personen/team fraLine team page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development projects==

===Projects===
fraLine conducts research in the fields of [[IT service management]] according to [[ITIL]] recommendations&lt;ref&gt;cf. e.g. [http://fraline.de/images/Downloads/Qualifikationsarbeiten/diplomarbeit_itil_schmelz_09Aug.pdf "Analysis of ITSM elements in the technical support for schools of a major school-maintaining body as to their consistency with ITIL recommendations" by Anthony Schmelz]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the field of IT support and digital media use in educational contexts including [[educational software]], [[media literacy]] etc. 
Research results and concepts are provided to the city of Frankfurt ("Stadtschulamt") for the improvement of information technology in schools and the establishment of a centrally managed school IT infrastructure in the municipal area. Therefore, fraLine also offers advisory services to the city of Frankfurt, to all municipal schools as well as other educational institutions on topics such as acquisition of computers or computer parts, hardware, IT security, remote service etc.

Research in technical areas is complemented by studies in media education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomas-knaus.de/index.php/en/research Research projects by Dr. Thomas Knaus]&lt;/ref&gt; Results in the field of media education and current media projects are presented on the annual expert conference "fraMediale"&lt;ref&gt;The list of speakers in 2009 included the mayor of Frankfurt Mrs. [[Jutta Ebeling]] and the President of the University of Applied Sciences Frankfurt Dr.-Ing. [[Detlev Buchholz]] as well as several representatives of "Project Lehr@mt" at Frankfurt Goethe University [http://www.zlf.uni-frankfurt.de/wir-ueber-uns/neue-medien/index.html "Project Lehr@mt"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.framediale.de Conference webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; which is hosted and organized by fraLine.&lt;ref&gt;A conference volume is published by "kopaed" (German publishing house) under the title [http://www.kopaed.de/kopaedshop/index.php?PRODUCT_ID=697 "fraMediale - digitale Medien in Bildungseinrichtungen"]&lt;/ref&gt;

fraLine developed the "fraDesk", a multi-user capable [[trouble ticket system]] for coordinating and documenting customer requests, incident reports or general processes based on division of labor. fraLine uses this software in its own everyday routine. The "fraDesk" is free software and was presented at the [[CeBIT]] 2008 in [[Hanover]], Germany.

Other research projects conducted by fraLine employees&lt;ref&gt;cp. [http://www.fraline.de/index.php/en/publications/academic-papers-and-reports List of publications on the project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; include the development of standard resource administration and user management for schools, improvement of school support via remote maintenance and support, but also media educational topics such as content filtering, evaluation of [[educational software]] and media communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kopaed.de/kopaedshop/index.php?PRODUCT_ID=637 "Kommunigrafie - eine empirische Studie zur Bedeutung von Text und Bild in der digitalen Kommunikation" ("An empirical study concerning the meaning of text and image in digital communication") by Dr. Thomas Knaus ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge base for teachers===
fraLine publishes relevant information for schools as well as research results in the form of test reports and academic papers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraline.de/index.php/en/publications Test reports and academic papers]&lt;/ref&gt; a glossary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraline.de/index.php/de/glossar Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; and a large set of FAQ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fraline.de/faq/ fraLine "FAQ" knowledge database"]&lt;/ref&gt; The FAQ database is a practical [[knowledge base]] [[Knowledge base]] and used as a point of reference for local teachers and others. It includes technical tutorials and information on the Frankfurt local school network, operating systems, software, hardware, peripheral equipment, the Internet, licenses and rights of utilization. 
Additionally, fraLine offers tutorials and introductory courses imparting theoretical and practical knowledge to school teachers and school IT representatives in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Online platform for providers of seminars and workshops in Frankfurt hosted by the state education authority ("Staatliches Schulamt fÃ¼r die Stadt Frankfurt am Main") [http://www.medienbildung-frankfurt.de/ "Regionale Medienbildung"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support services for schools==
The fraLine student team offers practical IT support to all 152 schools in Frankfurt by operating a telephone hotline, the Internet-based helpdesk "fraDesk" and through on-site service. Financed by public funds through the city of Frankfurt the service is free of charge for schools. It covers everyday troubleshooting relating to [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]], as well as software installation, actualisation and handling. In order to coordinate its support services, fraLine cooperates with so-called "IT representatives" in every school. They are appointed by their school principals and responsible for collecting IT-incidents and requests in their schools and communicating them to fraLine. Here, fraLine functions as first point of contact ("single-point-of-contact"). If problems cannot be solved by telephone, fraLine employees visit schools on-site or help them to refer their request to the competent authorities (e.g. school maintaining body ("Stadtschulamt"), or the Department of Information and Communicational Technology).&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the Deutschherrenschule (secondary school in Frankfurt) includes fraLine in its [http://www.schuleundzukunft.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Medienschulen/Medienkonzept_Deutschherrenschule.pdf  "media concept" (page 3f.)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes criticized that IT-support carried out by students does not match the schoolsÂ´ need for a "professional" support. On the other hand, only senior students who are identified as possessing the necessary qualifications are accepted at the project. 
In addition to the technical support, fraLine also offers training courses for teachers and school administration staff in the fields of IT-infrastructure and media use in educational contexts.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Online platform for providers of seminars and workshops in Frankfurt hosted by the state education authority ("Staatliches Schulamt fÃ¼r die Stadt Frankfurt am Main") [http://www.medienbildung-frankfurt.de/ "Regionale Medienbildung"]&lt;/ref&gt; 
As another way to support schools, fraLine launched the project "educational-technical assistance". As part of this project, fraLine employees accompany teachers during class offering them technical assistance with the digital media devices they plan to use in their lesson. The project aims at reducing technical insecurities of teachers and wants to promote a broader use of digital media in education.

==Partnerships, cooperations and awards==
fraLine contributes to various multi-organisational and interdisciplinary initiatives in Frankfurt am Main, in the federal state of Hesse and in Germany responding to the growing demand for a sensible use of media in education. Thus, fraLine maintains close partnerships with its sister projects in Bremen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schul-support-service.de/ School support service in the city of Bremen "S3"]&lt;/ref&gt; and Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3s.hh.schule.de/ School support service in the city of Hamburg "3S"]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2007, fraLine was awarded with the "Germany â Land of Ideas" award. "Land of Ideas" is an initiative under the patronage of former German Federal President [[Horst KÃ¶hler]]. Public or private institutions that have developed innovations and ideas are nominated as so-called "landmarks in the land of ideas" for one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.land-of-ideas.org/CDA/landmark_of_the_day,6482,1,,en.html?action=detail&amp;id=3303 ''Land of Ideas'' (June 10, 2008), "A Win-Win Situation"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''girlfriend experience''' ('''GFE''') is a commercial experience that blurs the boundaries between a financial transaction and a romantic relationship. It ranges from a [[transactional sex]] relationship&lt;ref name=Hoefinger&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Negotiating Intimacy: Transactional Sex and Relationships Among Cambodian Professional Girlfriends|url=http://research.gold.ac.uk/3419/|last=Hoefinger|first=Heidi|year=2010|type=Doctoral thesis|publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[John (prostitution)|client]] paying a prostitute to pretend to be his girlfriend during the session.{{sfn|Flowers|2011|p=151}} Within the [[sex industry]], GFE is a common term for a sexual encounter in which both the [[sex worker]] and the client are willing to engage in reciprocal sexual pleasure and some degree of emotional intimacy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Huff|2011|pp=111â125}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "girlfriend experience" generally involves more personal interaction than a traditional [[call girl]] or [[escort agency|escort]] offers. There is a focus on not just having sex, but also having more of a comprehensive experience. The details vary widely from person to person.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite magazine|title = The real-life girlfriend experience|magazine = [[GQ]]|author=Anka Radakovich|date =29 March 2012 |url = http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/girls/articles/2010-05/17/gq-girls-anka-radakovich-on-the-girlfriend-escort-experience|accessdate = 19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of [[sex work]], sex workers impart a sense of authenticity in order to make the experience more pleasurable for their customer, as well as to make the outcome more lucrative for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paying for any sexual act, including GFE, is considered to be a form of prostitution regardless of the type of service involved. Because of this the legality of GFE varies from place to place.

If the sex worker is male, the service is called a boyfriend experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weitzer|2007|pp=28â33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Girlfriend experience and prostitution == 
Indoor prostitution, which includes the use of [[massage parlor]]s, saunas, [[brothel]]s, [[strip club]]s and [[escort agencies]],&lt;ref name=Farley&gt;{{harvnb|Farley|2005|p=952}}&lt;/ref&gt; is more likely than [[street prostitution]] to involve conversation, affection and mutual sexual pleasure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

A GFE may start with dinner at a restaurant followed by [[making out]] on the sofa in an apartment and end with non-rushed sex and cuddling. In 2012 the cost of a GFE was typically between Â£200 and Â£1,200. Escorts traditionally have a reputation for not kissing their clients&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and it used to be the norm for legal prostitutes to never kiss on the mouth.{{sfn|Albert|2011}}{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

Some [[ranch (brothel)|ranch brothels]] in the United States advertise themselves as GFE establishments, including [[Dennis Hof|Dennis Hof's]] [[Dennis Hof's Love Ranch|Love Ranch South]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Menu - Love Ranch Vegas|url=http://www.loveranch.net/menu---love-ranch-vegas.html|website=loveranch.net|accessdate=1 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031213258/http://loveranch.net/menu---love-ranch-vegas.html|archivedate=31 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moonlite BunnyRanch|Moonlite Bunny Ranch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Girlfriend Experience|url=https://www.bunnyranch.com/tag/the-girlfriend-experience/|website=Moonlite Bunny Ranch|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kit Kat Ranch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KitKat Ranch home page|url=http://kitkatranch.com|website=KitKat Ranch website}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sheri's Ranch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheri's Ranch Sex Menu|url=http://www.sherisranch.com/sex-menu/|website=sherisranch.com|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clients or hobbyists==

The term "client" is sometimes used to describe a person who pays prostitutes for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|Kulick|2003|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[escort agency]] code that has grown up around the GFE, clients often call themselves "hobbyists" and refer to a prostitute who provides GFE as a "nice girl".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a GFE situation the client would pay for time spent with the call girl meaning: social interaction, dating, or sexual acts. Clients could come from all different backgrounds (white-collar, blue collar, different races, different ages) therefore there is not a "typical" type of client using the GFE service. Many clients emerge through the need for a feeling of closeness without the commitment of a relationship. To a certain extent it eliminates the feeling of guilt or fear of "addiction" to a relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Southeast Asia==
Research in Cambodia published in 2010 identified a number of waitresses and bartenders who were also working as "professional girlfriends" with "western boyfriends". They relied on these relationships for their livelihood but did not regard themselves as "prostitutes" and often sought love and marriage as well as material comforts. In these relationships there was a performance of intimacy which lay somewhere between the feigned and the genuine.&lt;ref name=Hoefinger/&gt;

In Thailand some independent sex workers are reported to work as "professional girlfriends", providing company and affection to foreign men and middle-class Thai men, and only having sex with their clients occasionally. Their remuneration is provided in the form of things such as clothing and visits to the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|last1=Chia|first1=Jasmine|title=Men and their mistresses|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/special-reports/1330319/men-and-their-mistresses|date=24 September 2017|newspaper=Bangkok Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''historiography of science''' is the study of the history and methodology of the sub-discipline of history, known as the [[history of science]], including its disciplinary aspects and practices (methods, theories, schools) and to the study of its own historical development ("History of History of Science", i.e., the history of the discipline called History of Science).

Since historiographical debates regarding the proper method for the study of the history of science are sometimes difficult to demarcate from historical controversies regarding the very course of science, it is often (and rightly) the case that the early controversies of the latter kind are considered the inception of the sub-discipline. For example, such discussions permeate the historical writings of the great historian and philosopher of science [[William Whewell]]. He is thus often (and rightly) viewed as the grandfather of this discipline; other such distinguished grandfathers are [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Alexandre KoyrÃ©]].

As to the explicit presentation of the Historiography of Science it is usually dated in the early Sixties of the 20th century. Thus for example, in 1965 we find [[Gerd Buchdahl]] reporting "A Revolution in Historiography of Science" referring to the innovative studies of [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Joseph Agassi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Buchdahl Gerd |title= A Revolution in Historiography of Science|journal= History of Science|year= 1965 |pages=55â69|volume=4|bibcode = 1965HisSc...4...55B }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that these two writers had inaugurated the sub discipline by distinguishing clearly between the history and the historiography of science, as they argued that historiographical views greatly influence the writing of the history of science.

== The origins of the discipline ==
Though scholars and scientists had been chronicling the results of scientific endeavors for centuries (such as [[William Whewell]]'s ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' from 1837, and the popular and historical accounts which accompanied the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th century), the development of the distinct [[academia|academic]] discipline of the history of science and technology did not occur until the early 20th century, and was intimately bound to the changing role of science during the same time period. The history of science was once exclusively the domain of retired researchers &amp;mdash; former scientists whose days in the [[laboratory]] had expired but still with a hearty interest in the field &amp;mdash; and the rare specialist. However, in the decades since the end of World War II the field has evolved into a full academic discipline, with [[graduate school]]s, research institutes, public and private patronage, [[peer-review]]ed [[academic journal|journals]], and professional societies.

The study of the history of science has had great effects on the [[philosophy of science]], conceptions of the role of science in society, and [[Public policy#Science Policy|scientific policy]].

The founding figure of the discipline in the [[United States]] was [[George Sarton]], later the founding editor of the journal ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]''. Sarton and his family fled [[Belgium]] after the [[Germany|German]] invasion in World War I, and after a brief stay in [[England]], he arrived in the United States penniless and unemployed. Sarton began lecturing part-time at several academic institutions, and in 1916 began a two-year appointment at [[Harvard University]]. When his appointment did not look like it would be renewed, he appealed to [[Robert S. Woodward]], president of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], for patronage. Woodward gave Sarton a two-year position and in 1920 extended it to a permanent tenured appointment as a Research Associate in the Institution's Department of History.

Though modern scholars do not usually share Sarton's motivations &amp;mdash; Sarton saw the history of science as the only genuine example of human progress &amp;mdash; the tools he left to the field, the journal ''Isis'' and the annual volume ''[[Osiris (journal)|Osiris]]'' (both still in print today), provided the foundation of the discipline in the United States.

== The Hessen thesis and the birth of externalism  ==

Just as the 1930s were a seminal decade for the development of our modern understanding of science, they were a seminal decade for the history and [[historiography]] of science as well. While Sarton taught the first American doctoral students in the discipline, in Europe some of the most influential historians and philosophers of science were first coming into the picture, and the setting of the philosophical battle which is now known as "the [[Science Wars]]" was being set.

In 1931, the Second International Congress of the History of Science was convened in London. The papers delivered by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] delegation, led by [[Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin|N.I. Bukharin]], quickly invigorated the discipline. [[Boris Hessen]] in particular delivered a paper entitled "The Social and Economic Roots of Newton's ''Principia''," in which he asserted that [[Isaac Newton]]'s most famous work was created to cater to the goals and desires of 17th century industry and [[Economic system|economy]]. Hessen asserted that Newton's work was inspired by his economic status and context, that the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was little more than the solution of technical problems of the [[bourgeoisie]].

Present scholarship has revealed that Hessen's motives were not completely academic. At that time in the Soviet Union, the work of [[Albert Einstein]] was under attack by [[Communist Party]] [[philosophers]]; being supposedly motivated by bourgeois values, it was "[[bourgeois science]]" {{Harvcol|Graham|1985|p=&amp;nbsp;711}},  and should henceforth be banned. (In many ways this attack was similar to the ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'' movement in Germany which occurred only a few years later.) Hessen's paper was a lobbying tactic: Party philosophers would not challenge the accuracy of Newton's theories, and to show them as being motivated by bourgeois concerns would, in Hessen's eyes, show that scientific validity could exist whatever the motivations were for undertaking it. However, there is little evidence that his paper had any effect in the internal Soviet philosophical battles over Einstein's work.

Despite its lack of effect in his home country, Hessen's thesis had a wide effect in Western history of science. Though Hessenâs work is now easily dismissed as "vulgar [[Marxism]]" {{Harvcol|Shaffer|1984|p=&amp;nbsp;26}}, its focus on the relationship between society and science was, in its time, seen as novel and inspiring. It was a challenge to the notion that the history of science was the history of individual [[genius]] in action, the dominant view at least since [[William Whewell]]'s ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' in 1837.

Few contemporary Western readers of Hessen took his paper at face value. His rigid connection between economy and [[knowledge]] was not accepted by a majority of historians. However, his assertion that a connection existed between the growth of knowledge and the art of war, and that [[ballistics]] played a central part of physics and Newton's world, was viewed with keen interest. In the shadow of the first war to employ [[chemical weapons]], and as the war machines were again gearing up in preparation for another world war, the role between science, [[technology]], and warfare was becoming more interesting to scholars and scientists. Previous views of science as separate from the mundane or vulgar aspects of practical life &amp;mdash; the disembodiment of the scientific mind from its context &amp;mdash; were becoming less attractive than a view that science and scientists were increasingly embedded in the world in which they worked.

This became reflective in the scholarship of the time as well, with dissertations written on such subjects as "Science and War in the Old Regime," which examined the ways in which military engineering influenced pre-[[French Revolution|Revolution]] [[France|French]] scientists.

This method of doing the history of science became known as ''[[externalism]]'', looking at the manner in which science and scientists are affected, and guided by, their context and the world in which they exist. It is an approach which eschews the notion that the history of science is the development of pure thought over time, one idea leading to another in a contextual bubble which could exist at any place, at any time, if only given the right geniuses.

The contrast to this approach, the method of doing history of science which preceded externalism, became known as ''[[Internalism#Historiography of science|internalism]]''. Internalist histories of science often focus on the [[rational reconstruction]] of scientific ideas and consider the development of these ideas wholly within the scientific world. Although internalist histories of modern science tend to emphasize the norms of modern science, internalist histories can also consider the different systems of thought underlying the development of [[History of astronomy#Mesopotamia|Babylonian astronomy]] or Medieval [[Theory of impetus|impetus]] theory

In practice, the line between [[internalism and externalism]] can be incredibly fuzzy. Few historians then, or now, would insist that either of these approaches in their extremes paint a wholly complete picture, nor would it necessarily be possible to practice one fully over the other. However, at their heart they contain a basic question about the nature of science: what is the relationship between the producers and consumers of scientific knowledge? The answer to this question must, in some form, inform the method in which the history of science and technology is conducted; conversely, how the history of science and technology is conducted, and what it concludes, can inform the answer to the question. The question itself contains an entire host of philosophical questions: what is the nature of scientific truth? What does [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] mean in a scientific context? How does change in scientific theories occur?

The historian/sociologist of science [[Robert K. Merton]] produced many famous works following Hessen's thesis, which can be seen as reactions to and refinements of Hessen's argument. In his work on science, technology, and society in the 17th century [[England]], Merton sought to introduce an additional category &amp;mdash; [[Puritan]]ism &amp;mdash; to explain the growth of science in this period. Merton worked to split Hessen's crude category of economics into smaller subcategories of influence, including transportation, mining, and military technique. Merton also tried to develop [[empirical]], [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] approaches to showing the influence of external factors on science. Despite these changes, Merton was quick to note his indebtedness to Hessen. Even with his emphasis on external factors, though, Merton differed from Hessen in his interpretation: Merton maintained that while researchers may be inspired and interested by problems which were suggested by extra-scientific factors, ultimately the researcher's interests were driven by "the internal history of the science in question.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}" Merton attempted to delineate externalism and internalism along disciplinary boundaries, with ''context'' studied by the [[sociology of science|sociologist of science]], and ''content'' by the historian.

== Ludwik Fleck ==

Around the same period, in 1935, [[Ludwik Fleck]], a Polish medical microbiologist published his [[Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact]] which used a case study in the field of medicine (of the development of the disease concept of Syphilis) to present a thesis about the social nature of knowledge, and in particular science and scientific 'thought styles' (Denkstil) which are the epistemological, conceptual and linguistic styles of scientific (but also non-scientific) 'thought collectives' (Denkkollektiv). This work's importance was not noticed, as [Thaddeus J. Trenn] editor of the English edition published in 1979 writes, 'Fleck's pioneering monograph was published at almost the same time as [[Karl Popper]]'s [[Logik der Forschung]]. But, developed in very different cognitive styles, the books met with contrasting response. In Popper's own words, his book "was surprisingly successful, far beyond Vienna. [...]" [...] It is perhaps most diagnostic that the book received no review notice at all in [[George Sarton]]'s [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'']], by then the leading international journal of the [[history of science]].' [pp. xvii-xviii].

As evident from Fleck's book's title, it revolves around the notion that epistemologically, there is nothing stable or realistically true or false about any scientific fact. A fact has a 'genesis' which is grounded in certain theoretic grounds and many times other obscure and fuzzy notions, and it 'develops' as it is subject to dispute and additional research by other scientists. Fleck's work, unlike Hessen's work focuses more on the epistemological and linguistic factors that affect scientific discovery, innovation and progress or development, while Hessen's work focuses on socio-political factors.

Fleck's work was one of the major influences noted by [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] which led to the writing his ''[[Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''. Kuhn also wrote the foreword to Fleck's English translation.

== Vannevar Bush and World War II ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

The study of the history of science continued to be a small effort until the rise of [[Big Science]] after World War II. The influential bureaucrat [[Vannevar Bush]], and the president of Harvard, [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]], both encouraged the study of the history of science as a way of improving general knowledge about how science worked, and why it was essential to maintain a large scientific workforce.

== Thomas Kuhn and the 1960s ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
From the 1940s through the early 1960s, most histories of science were different forms of a "march of progress" {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, showing science as a triumphant movement towards truth. Many philosophers and historians did of course paint a more nuanced picture, but it was not until the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' that this approach became seriously suspected as being misleading {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Kuhn's argument that scientific revolutions worked by [[paradigm shift]]s seemed to imply that truth was not the ultimate criterion for science, and the book was extremely influential outside of academia as well {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Corresponding with the rise of the [[environmentalism]] movement and a general loss of optimism of the power of science and technology unfettered to solve the problems of the world, this new history encouraged many critics to pronounce the preeminence of science to be overthrown {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

== The discipline today ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The discipline today encompasses a wide variety of fields of academic study, ranging from the traditional ones of history, sociology, and philosophy, and a variety of others such as law, architecture, and literature.

'''Human services''' is an interdisciplinary field with the objective of meeting human needs through an applied knowledge base, focusing on prevention as well as remediation of problems, and maintaining a commitment to improving the overall quality of life of service populations. The process involves the study of social technologies (practice methods, models, and theories), service technologies (programs, organizations, and systems), and scientific innovations that are designed to ameliorate problems and enhance the quality of life of individuals, families and communities to improve the delivery of service with better coordination, accessibility and accountability.&lt;ref name=Herzberg2015&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herzberg |first1=Judith T. |date=2015 |title=Foundations in human services practice: A generalist perspective on individual, agency, and community |edition=1st |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson |oclc=881181908 |isbn=9780205858255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of human services is to promote a practice that involves simultaneously working at all levels of society (whole-person approach) in the process of promoting the autonomy of individuals or groups, making informal or formal human services systems more efficient and effective, and advocating for positive social change within society.

Human services practitioners strive to advance the autonomy of service users through civic engagement, education, health promotion and social change at all levels of society. Practitioners also engage in advocating so human systems remain accessible, integrated, efficient and effective.

Human services academic programs can be readily found in colleges and universities, which award degrees at the associate, baccalaureate, and graduate levels. Human services programs exist in countries all around the world.

==History==

===United States===
Human services has its roots in [[Charitable organizations (Canada)|charitable]] activities of religious and civic organizations that date back to the Colonial period.  However, the academic discipline of human services did not start until the 1960s. At that time, a group of college academics started the new human services movement and began to promote the adoption of a new ideology about human service delivery and [[Professional|professionalism]] among traditional helping disciplines.&lt;ref name="Chenault Burnford 1978"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chenault|first1=Joann|last2=Burnford|first2=Fran|date=1978|title=Human services professional education: Future directions|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|oclc=3650238|isbn=9780070107328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's major goal was to make service delivery more efficient, effective, and humane. The other goals dealt with the reeducation of traditional helping professionals ([[interprofessional education]]), to have a greater appreciation of the individual as a whole person ([[humanistic psychology]]) and to be accountable to the communities they serve ([[postmodernism]]). Furthermore, professionals would learn to take responsibility at all levels of [[government]], use systems approaches to consider human problems, and be involved in progressive social change.

Traditional academic programs such as [[education]], [[nursing]], [[social work]], [[law]] and [[medicine]] were resistant to the new human services movement's ideology because it appeared to challenge their professional status. Changing the traditional concept of professionalism involved rethinking consumer control and the distribution of power. The new movement also called on human service professionals to work for [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dumont|first=M|year=1970|title=The changing face of professionalism|journal=Social Policy|volume=1|pages=26â31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed that the reduction of the monopolistic control of professionals could result in [[democratization of knowledge]] and would lead to professionals advocating on behalf of clients and communities against professional establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reiff |first1=R. |date=1970 |chapter=Community psychology, community mental health and social needs: The need for a body of knowledge in community psychology |editor1-first=Ira |editor1-last=Iscoe |editor2-first=Charles D. |editor2-last=Spielberger |title=Community psychology: Perspectives in training and research |pages=1- |location=New York |publisher=Appleton |oclc=92432 |isbn=9780390477712}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also hoped that human service delivery systems would become integrated, comprehensive, and more accessible, which would make them more humane for service users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Agranoff| first1=R. |chapter=Human services administration: Service delivery, service integration, and training |pages=42â51 |editor-last=Mikulecky |editor-first=Thomas J. |date=1974 |title=Human services integration: a report of a special project conducted by the American Society for Public Administration |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Society for Public Administration |oclc=918115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker1974&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=F |date=June 1974 |title=From community mental health to human service ideology |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=576â581 |pmid=4829069 |pmc=1775477 |doi=10.2105/ajph.64.6.576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the resistance from traditional helping professions served as the impetus for a group of educators in [[higher education]] to start the new academic discipline of human services.

Some maintain that the human services discipline has a concrete identity as a profession that supplements and complements other traditional professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mehr |first1=Joseph J. |last2=Kanwischer |first2=Ronald |date=2004 |title=Human services: concepts and intervention strategies |edition=9th |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson/Allyn and Bacon |oclc=51477841 |isbn=9780205381210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet other professionals and scholars have not agreed upon an authoritative definition for human services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kincaid |first1=Susan O. |date=2009 |title=Defining human services: A discourse analysis |journal=Human service education |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=14â23 |issn=0890-5428 |url=http://www.nationalhumanservices.org/assets/Journal/2009.pdf |format=PDF |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6c80rxEKc?url=http://www.nationalhumanservices.org/assets/Journal/2009.pdf |archive-date=8 October 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic programs==

===United States===

====Development====
Chenault and Burnford argued that human services programs must educate and train students at the graduate or postgraduate level if human services hoped to be considered a professional discipline.&lt;ref name="Chenault Burnford 1978" /&gt; A progressive graduate human services program was established by Audrey Cohen (1932â1996), who was considered an innovative educator for her time. The Audrey Cohen College of Human Services, now called the [[Metropolitan College of New York]], offered one of the first graduate programs in 1974.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=Gerald |last2=Riesman |first2=David |date=1978 |title=The perpetual dream: reform and experiment in the American college |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |oclc=3203327 |isbn=9780226306056}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same time period, [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield College]] in [[Massachusetts]] became a major force in preserving human services as an academic discipline. Currently, Springfield College is one of the oldest and largest human services program in the United States.

Manpower studies in the 1960s and 70s had shown that there would be a shortage of helping professionals in an array of service delivery areas.&lt;ref name=Cohen1969&gt;Cohen, 1969.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kadish1969&gt;Kadish, 1969.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McPheeters&gt;{{citation |last1=McPheeters |first1=Harold L. |last2=King |first2=James B. |author3=Southern Regional Education Board |author3-link=Southern Regional Education Board |date=February 1971 |title=Plans for teaching mental health workers: Community college curriculum objectives |location=Bethesda, MD |publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED065726.pdf |format=PDF |oclc=425565522 |id=[[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]] [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED065726 ED065726]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, some educators proposed that the training of nonprofessionals (e.g., mental health technicians)could bridge this looming personnel shortage.&lt;ref name=McPheeters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweitzer |first1=H.

Professionals of the SREB Undergraduate Social Welfare Manpower Project helped colleges develop new social welfare programs, which later became known as human services.&lt;ref name=McPheetersRyan1971&gt;{{citation |last1=McPheeters |first1=Harold L. |last2=Ryan |first2=Robert M. |author3=Southern Regional Education Board |author3-link=Southern Regional Education Board |date=December 1971 |title=A Core of Competence for Baccalaureate Social Welfare and Curricular Implications |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED079210.pdf |format=PDF |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Social and Rehabilitation Service ([[United States Department of Health and Human Services#Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]]) |id=[[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]] [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED079210 ED079210] |oclc=425729945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believed that [[community college]] human services programs were the most expedient way to train [[paraprofessional]]s for direct service jobs in areas such as mental health.&lt;ref name=True/&gt; Currently, a large percentage of human services programs are run at the community college level.

The development of community college human services programs was supported with government funding that was earmarked for the federal new careers initiatives. In turn, the federally funded [[New Careers|New Careers Program]] was created to produce a nonprofessional career track for economically disadvantaged, underemployed, and unemployed adults as a strategy to eradicate poverty within society&lt;ref name=GrosserEtAl1969&gt;Grosser, Henry, &amp; Kelly, 1969.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haskell1969&gt;Haskell, 1969.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PearlRiessman1965&gt;Pearl &amp; Riessman, 1965.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RiessmanPopper1968&gt;Riessman &amp; Popper, 1968.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to end a critical shortage of health-care personnel.&lt;ref name=SteinbergEtAl1969&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steinberg |first1=Sheldon S. |last2=Shatz |first2=Eunice O. |last3=Fishman |first3=Jacob R. |date=July 1969 |title=New careers: a major solution to the environmental health problem |url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.59.7.1118 |format=PDF |journal=American journal of Public Health and the Nation's Health |volume=59 |issue=7 |pmid=5815750 |pmc=1226583 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.59.7.1118 |pages=1118â1123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates from these programs successfully acquired employment as paraprofessionals,&lt;ref name=True/&gt; but there were limitations to their [[upward mobility]] within social service agencies because they lacked a graduate or professional degree.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;

====Current programs====
Currently, there are academic programs in human services at the associate, baccalaureate, and graduate levels. There are approximately 600 human services programs throughout the United States. An online directory of human services programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Directory of human services programs |url=http://www.drcdata.com/(S(lmu34f45d5bgwr3j0remqo55))/hsReview.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929004524/http://www.drcdata.com/%28S%28coyi11mtscb0hr45dw1rggu5%29%29/hsReview.aspx |archive-date=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists many (but not all) of the programs state by state in conjunction with their [[accreditation]] status from the Council of Standards for Human Services Education (CSHSE).

The CSHSE offers accreditation for human services programs in higher education. The accreditation process is voluntary and labor-intensive; it is designed to assure the quality, consistency, and relevance of human service education through research-based standards and a peer-review process. According to the CSHSE's webpage there are only 43 accredited human services programs in the United States. The Standards for each level of degree accredited by CSHSE can be obtained by clicking on the following links:

Human services curricula are based on an interdisciplinary knowledge foundation that allows students to consider practical solutions from multiple disciplinary perspectives. Across the curriculum human services students are often taught to view human problems from a socioecological perspective (developed by [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]]) that involves viewing human strengths and problems as interconnected to a family unit, community, and society. This perspective is considered a âwhole-person perspectiveâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woodside |first1=Marianne |last2=McClam |first2=Tricia |date=2009 |title=An introduction to human services |edition=6th |location=Bemont, CA |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |oclc=224438780 |isbn=9780495503361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, undergraduate programs prepare students to be human services generalists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burger |first1=William R. |last2=Youkeles |first2=Merrill |date=2004 |title=Human services in contemporary America |edition=6th |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Brooks/Cole--Thomson Learning |oclc=52578972 |isbn=9780534547479}}&lt;/ref&gt; while masterâs programs prepare students to be human services administrators,&lt;ref name="Chenault Burnford 1978" /&gt; and doctoral programs prepare students to be researcher-analysts and college-level educators. Research in this field focuses on an array of topics that deal with direct service issues, [[Case management (mental health)|case management]],&lt;ref name=Herzberg2015/&gt; organizational change, management of human service organizations,&lt;ref name=Kettner2014&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kettner |first1=Peter M. |date=2014 |title=Excellence in human service organization management |edition=2nd |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson Education |oclc=829937218 |isbn=9780205088157}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocacy,&lt;ref name=Martin2014&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Michelle E. |date=2014 |title=Advocacy for social justice: A global perspective |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson |oclc=858610652 |isbn=9780205087396}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[community organizing]], [[community development]], social welfare policy, service integration, [[multiculturalism]], integration of technology, [[Poverty|poverty issues]], [[social justice]], development,&lt;ref name=Dustin2013&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dustin |first1=Jill C. |date=2013 |title=Grant writing and fundraising tool kit for Human Services |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson Education |oclc=793099562 |isbn=9780205088690}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social change strategies.

==Certification and continuing education==

===United States===
The Center for Credentialing &amp; Education (CCE) conceptualized the Human Services-Board Certified Practitioner (HS-BCP) credential with the assistance of the National Organization for Human Services (NOHS) and the Council for Standards in Human Service Education (CSHSE). The credential was created for human services practitioners seeking to advance their careers by acquiring independent verification of their practical knowledge and educational background.&lt;ref name=ExamHSBCP&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Services-Board Certified Practitioner |website=Center for Credentialing and Education |url=http://www.cce-global.org/HSBCP/Exam |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232940/http://www.cce-global.org/HSBCP/Exam |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates from human services programs can obtain a Human Services Board Certified Practitioner (HS-BCP) credential offered by the Center for Credentialing &amp; Education (CCE). The HS-BCP certification ensures that human services practitioners offer quality services, are competent service providers, are committed to high standards, and adhere to the NOHS ''Ethical Standards of Human Service Professionals,'' as well as to help solidify the professional identity of human services practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Council for Standards in Human Services Education |url=http://www.cshse.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; HS-BCPE Experience Requirements for the certification:  HS-BCP applicants must meet post-graduation experience requirements to be eligible to take the examination. However, graduates of a CSHSE accredited degree program may sit for the HS-BCP exam without verifying their human services work experience. Otherwise experience requirements for candidates not from a CSHSE accredited program are as follows:  Associate degree with post degree experience requires three years, including a minimum of 4,500 hours; Bachelorâs Degree with post degree experience requires two years, including a minimum of 3,000 hours; Masterâs or Doctorate with post degree experience requires one year, including a minimum of 1,500 hours.&lt;ref name=ExamHSBCP/&gt;

The HS-BCP exam is designed to verify a candidateâs human services knowledge. The exam was created as a collaborative effort of human services subject-matter experts and normed on a population of professionals in the field. The HS-BCP exam covers the following areas:

# Assessment, treatment planning, and outcome evaluation
# Theoretical orientation/interventions
# Case management, professional practice, and ethics
# Administration, program development/evaluation, and supervision

==Employment outlook==

===United States===
Currently, the three major employment roles played by human services graduates include providing direct service, performing administrative work, and working in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mandell |first1=Betty Reid |last2=Schram |first2=Barbara |date=2006 |title=An introduction to human services: Policy and practice |edition=6th |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson/Allyn and Bacon |oclc=58546150 |isbn=9780205442140}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Occupational Outlook Handbook]], published by the [[US Department of Labor]], the employment of human service assistants is anticipated to grow by 34% through 2016, which is faster than average for all occupations. There will also be excellent job opportunities for individuals with post-secondary degrees. But salaries remain low, which might reflect employersâ lack of understanding of the human services profession.

==Professional organizations==

===North America===
There are several different professional human services organizations for professionals, educators, and students to join across North America.

====United States====
The National Organization for Human Services (NOHS) is a professional organization open to educators, professionals, and students interested in current issues in the field of human services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Organization for Human Services|url=http://www.nationalhumanservices.org/|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NOHS sponsors an annual [[Business conference|conference]] in different parts of the United States. In addition, there are four independent human services regional organizations: (a) Mid-Atlantic Consortium for Human Services, (b) Midwest Organization for Human Services, (c) New England Organization for Human Service, and the (d) Northwest Human Services Association. All of the regional organizations are also open to educators, professionals, students and each regional organization has an annual conference in different locations throughout their region such as universities or institutions. 

Human services special interest groups also exist within the [[American Society for Public Administration]] (ASPA) and the [[American Educational Research Association]] (AERA). The ASPA subsection is named the Section on Health and Human Services Administration and its purpose is to foster the development of knowledge, understanding and practice in the fields of health and human services administration and to foster professional growth and communication among academics and practitioners in these fields. Fields of health and human services administration share a common and unique focus on improving the quality of life through client-centered policies and service transactions.

The AERA special interest group is named the Education, Health and Human Service Linkages. Its purpose is to create a community of researchers and practitioners interested in developing knowledge about comprehensive school health, school linked services, and initiatives that support children and their families. This subgroup also focuses on interpersonal collaboration, integration of services, and interdisciplinary approaches. The groupâs interests encompass interrelated policy, practice, and research that challenge efforts to create viable linkages among these three distinct areas.

The American Public Human Services Association (APHSA) is a nonprofit organization that pursues distinction in health and human services by working with policymakers, supporting state and local agencies, and working with partners to promote innovative, integrative and efficient solutions in health and human services policy and practice. APHSA has individual and student memberships.

====Canada====
The [[Canadian Institute for Human Services]] is an [[Advocacy group|advocacy]], [[education]] and [[action-research]] organization for the advancement of health equity, progressive education and social innovation. The institute collaborates with researchers, field practitioners, community organizations, socially conscious companiesâalong with various levels of government and educational institutionsâto ensure that the Canadian health and human services sector remains accountable to the greater good of Canadian civil society rather than short-term professional, business or economic gains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Canadian Institute for Human Services |url=http://www.humanservices.ca/ |accessdate=16 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416215833/http://www.humanservices.ca/ |archivedate=16 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Board of Education, 05311955.gif|thumb|right|220px|The first page of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] judgement in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the "mother of all impact litigation".{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}}]]
'''Impact litigation''' or '''strategic litigation''' is the practice of bringing [[lawsuit]]s intended to effect societal change.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=103}}{{sfn | Okafor | 2006 | p=81}} Impact litigation cases may be [[class action]] lawsuits or individual claims with broader significance,{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}} and may rely on [[statutory law]] arguments or on [[constitution]]al claims.{{sfn | Tushnet | 2008 | p=383}} Such litigation has been widely and successfully used to influence public policy, especially by [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] groups, and often attracts significant media attention.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=103}}

==History==
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (at times though its [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund|Legal Defense Fund]]) both pursued legal action to advance and protect civil rights in the [[United States of America|United States]]. The ACLU followed a primarily "defensive" strategy, fighting individual violations of rights when they were identified. The NAACP, in contrast, developed a more coordinated plan to actively file suits to challenge discrimination, known as "affirmative" or "strategic" litigation.{{sfn |Tushnet |2008 |p=380}} The NAACP's model became the pattern for "impact litigation" strategies, which applied similar tactics in contexts other than racial discrimination.{{sfn|Tushnet |2008 |p=383}}

Important early impact litigation cases included ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}} ''Brown'', a 1954 U.S. [[school desegregation]] decision, was carefully prepared by [[Thurgood Marshall]] and other NAACP lawyers so that the eventual [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling invalidated official racial discrimination throughout the U.S. government. Many cases since then have closely imitated it, in the course of seeking greater protections for other disadvantaged groups.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}}

==Scope==
Impact litigation has played a major role in the development of American desegregation, [[abortion]],  [[Regulation of tobacco by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration |tobacco regulation]] policy{{sfn | Mason | Leavitt | Chaffee | 2013 | p=547}} and [[gay marriage]].  

Since the 1980s, impact litigation has been used to seek reform in the reform of U.S. [[Child protection|child welfare law]], following earlier work which involved the courts in jail and mental hospital reforms and in school desegregation.{{sfn| Lowry |1986 |p=260}}

Strategic impact litigation has also been used in [[Nigeria]], among other things to push for convictions of perpetrators of [[police brutality]] and to defeat legal attacks on the [[freedom of the press]].{{sfn | Okafor | 2006 | p=81}}

In a few jurisdictions where attorneys are prohibited from bringing class action lawsuits, citizens have filed "grassroots impact litigation" cases and successfully represented their own claims.{{sfn |Freeman |1991 }}

==Debate==
Impact litigation has been criticized by legal scholars and politicians on the bases of judicial legitimacy and competence.

The legitimacy argument holds that, in countries with a constitutional [[separation of powers]], societal changes are to be enacted by democratically elected bodies and are outside the purview of individual judges. The competence argument claims that institutional limitations on the amount and quality of information that can be made available in a court proceeding make the courts poorly prepared to handle complex policy issues. Another version of this argument points out that courts are limited in the scope of their responses, relative to legislative bodies.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | pp=107-111}} These debates overlap with those concerning so-called "[[judicial activism]]".{{sfn| Lowry |1986 |p=260}}

'''International Studies''' ('''IS''') generally refers to the specific university degrees and courses which are concerned with the study of âthe major political, economic, social, and cultural issues that dominate the international agendaâ.&lt;ref&gt;The British International Studies Association (2016). About International Studies. Viewed 3/4/2017 &lt;https://www.bisa.ac.uk/index.php/119-about-international-studies/420-about-international-studies&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Predominant topics are [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[law]] on a global level. The term itself can be more specifically defined as âthe contemporary and historical understanding of global societies, cultures, languages and systems of government and of the complex relationships between them that shape the world we live inâ.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Flinders University. (2010). Bachelor of International Studies. Viewed 21/9/2010 &lt;http://www.flinders.edu.au/courses/undergrad/bis/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The terms and concepts of International Studies and [[international relations]] are strongly related; however, International relations focus more directly on the relationship between countries, whereas International Studies can encompass all phenomena which are globally oriented.

__TOC__

==History==

The history of the discipline of International Studies is strongly linked with the history of the study of international relations, as described in the International Relations entry. However, the study of International Studies as a separate entity to International Relations emerged throughout the 20th century, as an increasingly complex world began to be influenced by [[globalization]], and a greater number of issues emerged (rather than only inter-country relations). The discipline was greatly influenced by the establishment of the International Studies Association,&lt;ref&gt;International Studies Association. (2010). Welcome to ISA. Viewed 21/9/2010  &lt;http://www.isanet.org/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was established in 1959 by a âgroup of academics and practitionersâ&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;International Studies Association. (2010). History and Purpose. Viewed 21/9/2010  &lt; http://www.isanet.org/history_purpose/2007/12/history-of-isa.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of âseeking to pursue mutual interests in world affairs through the organization of a professional associationâ.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The establishment of the association reflected the increasing interest in [[global issue]]s and reflected the need for international academic dialogue.
	Throughout the later stages of the 20th century and into the 21st century, many education institutions worldwide developed International Studies degrees (both undergraduate and postgraduate). The emergence and increasing popularity of these degrees reflect the general patterns of increasing global interconnectedness and globalization, in that education providers, are becoming more aware that the discipline is becoming increasingly relevant and necessary in the context of the 21st century.
	The discipline has become increasingly popular in Australia as well as in East Asian countries. Dr. Hanson and Dr. Weber of the University of Queensland state that;
:âAustralia has become a highly popular destination for students wishing to undertake Coursework, Masters and Ph.D. programs in International Relations, Peace and Conflict Studies and Development. Collectively, these inter-related fields have come to be called International Studies, and many of Australiaâs universities have responded to the increasing demand for programs in this areaâ&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;International Graduate, Australia. (2010). International Studies in Australia. Viewed 21/9/10 &lt; http://www.internationalgraduate.net/country/australia/international-studies-australia.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, the third OCIS conference (Oceanic Conference on International Studies) was held at the University of Queenslandâ.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The conference brought together over 200 academics, with the keynote speaker Andrew Linklater (the Woodrow Wilson Professor of International Politics at the [[University of Aberystwyth]] in Wales) noting âhow vibrant and intellectually stimulating International Studies now is in Australiaââ.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
The increasing popularity of the discipline in Australia led to the International Studies Association to establish an Asia-Pacific Regional Section of the ISA at the University of Queensland in 2009â,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; which was seen as an âindication of the growth of this areaââ&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; in Australia.

==Etymology==

International Studies is sometimes also known as [[global studies]]. The terms can be used interchangeably and may be influenced by left vs right inclinations.

==Purpose/aim of study==

Many educational institutions have developed International Studies degrees and courses in order to engage students with the increasing number of issues and phenomena which have arisen in an increasingly globalized world. As such, most education providers justify the need for the degrees by relating the increasing importance of the discipline with real-world situations and employment opportunities.
For example, the University of Technology Sydney states that the purpose of their International Studies degree is to âprepare graduates for careers and contributions in a world of social and cultural diversity being transformed by globalisation, allowing students to draw connections between global phenomena and local practices in work and lifeâ.&lt;ref&gt;University of Technology Sydney: Arts and Social Sciences. (2010). Global Studies.

Often, universities will relate the study of International studies with other industries. Monash University describes the relevance for International Studies; âas the world globalizes and nations and economies become more integrated, it is important to understand our world and the ideas and beliefs of our neighbors and trading partners. In order to compete in the international marketplaces of products, ideas and knowledge we need to understand and respect the cultures and beliefs of others.&lt;ref&gt;âMonash University: Arts.

==Types of programs==

At many universities, International Studies is offered in both undergraduate and postgraduate pathways. As an undergraduate degree, the discipline is most often offered as part of an Arts Degree, as either a minor or major of straight Arts Degrees&lt;ref&gt;Monash University: Arts. (2010).

==Types of studies==

The International Studies discipline is usually offered as either part of an arts degree or as a specialist arts degree. As such, students are able to select from a very broad range of subjects to undertake. However, some areas of study which are regularly offered include:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*the political, social, economic and cultural relationships within the international system
*foreign policy, diplomacy and other modes of interaction between the countries of the world
*the significance of foreign societies, cultures, and systems of government
*the international movement of people as immigrants, refugees, workers, students, tourists and investors
*the role of international organizations
*the globalization of the world economy
*foreign languages
*history

==Different countries' approaches==

===Australia===

	As discussed, the study of the International Studies discipline in Australia occurs mostly within universities and generally approaches the subject as a holistic study of international affairs and phenomena.
	The study is also offered in some Australian high schools. The VCE system, operating within Victoria, offers International Studies as an elective to year 12 students.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority. (2010). International Studies. Viewed 22/9/2010 &lt;http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/vce/studies/intstudies/internationalindex.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The two units offered in International Studies VCE are âGlobal issues and conflictsâ and âInternational Relationsâ.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

===Canada===

There are several International Studies programs in Canada that offer both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The [http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/internationalstudies/ Glendon College International Studies Program], the [https://www.sfu.ca/internationalstudies School for International Studies at Simon Fraser University], the [http://www.munkschool.utoronto.ca Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto], the [http://www.balsillieschool.ca Balsillie School of International Affairs], the [http://www.huronuc.on.ca/academics/faculty_arts_ss/departments/global_studies/ Centre for Global Studies at Huron University College], [http://www.cerium.ca/ Centre d'Ã©tudes et de Recherches Internationales de l'UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120621101948/http://www.arts.uregina.ca/international-studies International Studies degree at the University of Regina], the [http://www.unbc.ca/internationalstudies International Studies MA Program at the University of Northern British Columbia] and the [http://www.hei.ulaval.ca/ Institut quÃ©bÃ©cois des hautes Ã©tudes internationales] are the leading programs.

===Chile===
In Chile there is two undergraduated program. The oldest, International Studies undergraduate program which is offered by the [[Universidad de Santiago de Chile]]. This programme emphasises four core areas: International Relations, Methodology, International Trade, and Defense and Security. This programme has also been recognized through the participation of their students in different simulations of the United Nations System, like the National Model of United Nations NMUN in New York and Kobe 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usach.cl/news/brillante-desempeno-nuestros-estudiantes-debates-modelo-la-onu|title=Brillante desempeÃ±o de nuestros estudiantes en âDebates Modeloâ de la ONU|website=Universidad de Santiago de Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and in the Modelo Naciones Unidas para Latinoamerica y el Caribe(MONULAC) in Antigua&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fae.usach.cl/fae/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4951:estudiantes-de-la-fae-son-reconocidos-en-conferencia-latinoamericana-de-modelo-de-naciones-unidas&amp;catid=13:noticias-fae|title=Estudiantes de la FAE son reconocidos en conferencia latinoamericana de Modelo de Naciones Unidas|first=Valentina del|last=Campo|website=fae.usach.cl}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The university opened this undergraduate programme in 2008 and it represents a very promising development in the study of the Social Sciences in Latin America. The [[Instituto de Estudios Avanzados]](IDEA) of the same university also offers a Masters in International Studies.
In 2018, the [[Universidad de Chile]] open a same programm in cooperation between different academic units like Facso and &lt;ref&gt;Instituto de Estudios Internacionales&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

In the UK the [[British International Studies Association|British International Studies Association (BISA)]] develops and promotes the study of International Studies, Global Politics and related subjects through teaching, research and the facilitation of contact between scholars.  International Studies is often related to or attached to the study in International Relations. At the [[University of Oxford]], the Centre for International Studies "exists to promote and advance research in International Relations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cis.politics.ox.ac.uk/about/index.asp About Us], University of Oxford: Centre for International Studies, Retrieved December 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the use of the term ''International Studies'' differs to that of the Australian use of the term in that it is tied to the discipline of [[International Relations]], rather than addressing them as separate entities.
The [[Institute of Development Studies]] (IDS)] based in Sussex, is a leading global charity for international development research, teaching, and communications.

===United States===

There exist a number of institutions which promote International Studies in the United States of America. The Centre for Strategic &amp; International Studies is a foreign policy think tank which aims to âprovide strategic insights and policy solutions to decisionmakers in government, international institutions, the private sector, and civil societyâ.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies. (2010). About Us. Viewed 22/9/2010 &lt;http://csis.org/about-us&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies is a research center based at Stanford University which is a âprimary center for innovative research on major international issues and challengesâ.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University. (2010). Introduction. Viewed 22/9/2010 &lt;http://fsi.stanford.edu/docs/about_fsi&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Both institutions focus primarily on the study of international affairs and relations in relation to US foreign policy, and therefore differ in the Australian approach to International Studies.  Alternatively, the undergraduate International Studies program at St. John Fisher College in Rochester, NY is a holistic program that more closely follows the Australian model. &lt;http://www.sjfc.edu/academics/arts-science/departments/international&gt;

===Career prospects===
As stated, many institutions attempt to promote their International Studies degrees by promoting the career prospects for graduates.  The University of Melbourne has stated that graduates of its International Studies major will be âattractive to prospective employees in the public and private sectors including international inter-governmental and non-governmental organizationsâ.&lt;ref&gt;The university of Melbourne, Faculty of Arts. (2007). International Studies. Viewed 21/9/2010&lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unimelb.edu.au/HB/areas/AISTUDY.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305143548/http://www.unimelb.edu.au/HB/areas/AISTUDY.html |archivedate=2011-03-05 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, RMIT University has stated that âthe degree prepares you to apply your knowledge of globalization, language and culture in international workplace settingsâ,&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;RMIT University: Future Students. (2010). International Studies â Bachelor of Arts. Viewed 21/9/2010 &lt;http://www.rmit.edu.au/programs/bp048&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; such as âbusiness, government and non-government organizations in a range of areasâ.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

The discipline is also working under a premise that employment opportunities in the field of International Studies will steadily increase with the increasing level of interconnectedness which is occurring as a result of globalisation; âOpportunities for positions requiring international knowledge and skills are increasing and have created a need for graduates who are highly skilled, interculturally attuned and able to think and act globally/locally, as well as being bilingualâ.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

'''Land cover''' is the physical material at the surface of the earth. Land covers include [[grass]], [[asphalt]], [[tree]]s, bare ground, [[water]], etc. '''Earth cover''' is the expression used by ecologist [[Frederick Edward Clements]] that has its closest modern equivalent being [[vegetation]].&lt;ref name=MAB&gt;Makers of American Botany, [[Harry Baker Humphrey]], Ronald Press Company, Library of Congress Card Number 61-18435&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52}} The expression continues to be used by the Bureau of Land Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Susitna MOA Earth Cover Classification|url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ak/aktest/tr.Par.36173.File.dat/TR%2044.pdf|website=BlM-Alaska Technical Report 44|publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]]|accessdate=15 June 2015|date=September 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231458/http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ak/aktest/tr.Par.36173.File.dat/TR%2044.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two primary methods for capturing information on land cover: field survey and analysis of [[Remote sensing|remotely sensed imagery]]. 

One of the major land cover issues (as with all [[natural resource]] inventories) is that every survey defines similarly named categories in different ways. For instance, there are many definitions of "[[forest]]"âsometimes within the same organisationâthat may or may not incorporate a number of different forest features (e.g., stand height, canopy cover, strip width, inclusion of grasses, and rates of growth for [[wood production|timber production]]). Areas without trees may be classified as forest cover "if the intention is to re-plant" ([[UK]] and [[Ireland]]), while areas with many trees may not be labelled as forest "if the trees are not growing fast enough" ([[Norway]] and [[Finland]]). 

==Distinction from "land use"==
"Land cover" is distinct from "[[land use]]", despite the two terms often being used interchangeably. Land use is a description of how people ''utilize'' the land and of [[Socioeconomic development|socio-economic activity]]. [[Urban area|Urban]] and [[agricultural land]] uses are two of the most commonly known land use classes. At any one point or place, there may be multiple and alternate land uses, the specification of which may have a [[Politics|political]] dimension. The origins of the "land cover/land use" couplet and the implications of their confusion are discussed in Fisher et al. (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NICTA''' (previously known as '''National [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] Australia''' Ltd) was Australia's [[Information and Communications Technology]] (ICT) Research Centre of Excellence. The term "Centre of Excellence" is common [[marketing]] terminology used by some Australian government organisations for titles of science research groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/grants/apply-funding/centres-research-excellence-cre | title=Centres of Research Excellence (CRE) | publisher=National Health and Medical Research Council, [[Australian Government]] | accessdate=18 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  NICTA's role is to pursue potentially economically significant ICT related research for the [[Australian economy]].

[[#Organisation|NICTA]] was structured around groups focused primarily on pure research and the implementation of those ideas within business teams. NICTA merged with [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] to form a new entity called Data61 on 28 August 2015.

== History ==
In 2002, NICTA won a competitive selection process to be established as Australia's national centre of excellence in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) research, under an Australian Government policy initiative to promote science and innovation called [[Backing Australia's Ability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.dcita.gov.au/communications_for_business/funding_programs__and__support/ict_centre_of_excellence | title = DCITA page on ''ICT Centre of ExcellenceâNational ICT Australia (NICTA)'' | date = 2 November 2006 | accessdate = 11 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the centre was intended to address a previously identified weakness in long-term strategic ICT research in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/business/print.htm?TYPE=story&amp;AT=120273444-139023166t-110000004c | title = ZDNet Australia news article ''NICTA: Fighting Australia's brain drain'' | date = 7 April 2003 | accessdate = 12 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NICTA was officially opened on 27 February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dcita.gov.au/Article/0,,0_4-2_4008-4_113643,00.htm | title = Text of speech by Senator the Hon Richard Alston, the Minister for Communications, IT and the Arts | date = 27 February 2003 | accessdate = 11 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding members of NICTA were the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Australian National University]], the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]], and the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|ACT Government]]. NICTA later acquired other university and government partners. In January 2003, [[The University of Sydney]] became a partner. In July 2004, the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Government]] and [[The University of Melbourne]] became partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.mmv.vic.gov.au/uploads/downloads/Resource_Centre/Connvic15.pdf | title = ''Connecting Victoria'' No. 15 (Victorian Government ICT Newsletter) |date=July 2004 | accessdate = 2 May 2007 |format=PDF |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070829065932/http://www.mmv.vic.gov.au/uploads/downloads/Resource_Centre/Connvic15.pdf&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]], the [[University of Queensland]], [[Griffith University]], and the [[Queensland University of Technology]] became partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://statements.cabinet.qld.gov.au/MMS/StatementDisplaySingle.aspx?id=39687 | title = Queensland Ministerial Media Statement ''High Tech Lab To Research E-Security And Counter-Terrorism'' | date = 18 February 2005 | accessdate = 2 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Melbourne]] and the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Government]] became members in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nicta.com.au/media/previous_releases3/2012_media_releases/university_of_melbourne_and_victorian_government_become_nicta_members| title = NICTA Media Statement "University of Melbourne and Victorian Government Become NICTA Members" | date = 4 May 2011 | accessdate = 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since foundation NICTA has created more than six new companies, collaborated on joint projects with a range of ICT industries, developed a substantial technology and intellectual property portfolio and continues to supply new expertise to the ICT industry through a NICTA-supported PhD program.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Australian Federal Government funding of NICTA was due to expire in June 2016 and there was a concerted effort in securing a merger with [[CSIRO]]. Ostensibly this merger would be with the CSIRO Digital Productivity Flagship and there is the potential for up to 200 redundancies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/up-to-200-jobs-could-be-lost-as-nicta-and-csiro-merge/6519828|title=Up to 200 jobs could be lost as science bodies NICTA and CSIRO merge}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to funding cuts to both organizations.

Duane Zitzner (who replaced [[Hugh F. Durrant-Whyte]] as CEO in December 2014 after Durrant-Whyte resigned suddenly due to a disagreement with the NICTA Board &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/national-ict-rules-out-csiro-merger/story-e6frgakx-1227141197068?nk=4294b6cb998b2a14d0adf56731efe20f-1440310434|title=National ICT rules out CSIRO merger}} &lt;/ref&gt;) left NICTA at the end of May 2015 in the hope that the merger with CSIRO would be completed by the end of June 2015. As of August 2015 the merger had not been finalized&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/government-it/200-staff-await-delayed-decision-on-nicta-and-csiro-merger-20150804-girbkx.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Professor Robert (Bob) Williamson (who also heads NICTA's Machine Learning Research Group) is acting and terminal CEO.

NICTA formally merged with [[CSIRO]] to form a new entity called [[Data61]] on 28 August 2015. Mr Adrian Turner was appointed to head the merged unit. He reports to a Deputy Chief Executive of CSIRO and has the positional equivalence of a CSIRO Flagship Director.

==Organisation==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Nicta-CeBIT-crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quadcopter]] at CeBIT 2014]] --&gt;
NICTA research is focused in five scale Research Groups:&lt;ref&gt;http://nicta.com.au/research&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Software Systems]]
* [[Mobile Systems]]
* [[Machine Learning]]
* [[Computer Vision]]
* [[Optimisation]]

NICTA focuses on potential economic opportunities that related to the use of information communication technology.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} NICTA is primarily funded by government and engages in additional industry partnerships to augment its base funding. These may include start-up corporations or other specific Australian government funds. 

Four NICTA business teams&lt;ref&gt;http://nicta.com.au/business&lt;/ref&gt; are responsible for determining potential commercial or [[economic]] outcomes in the following domains for ICT:

* [[Broadband]] and the [[Digital Economy]]
* [[Infrastructure]], [[Transport]] and [[Logistics]]
* [[Security]]
* [[Natural environment|Environment]]

Additionally the Engineering and Technology Development team helps to productize research outcomes.

==Locations==
NICTA has over 700 people (half of whom are graduate students) spread across four cities in [[Australia]]:{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

* Australian Technology Park Laboratory and Headquarters, [[Sydney]]
* Neville Roach Research Laboratory, Kensington, Sydney
* [[Canberra]] Research Laboratory
* [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] Research Laboratory
* [[Queensland]] Research Laboratory

The Neville Roach Laboratory was moved from its standalone location onto the [[University of New South Wales]] main campus in July 2015 as a cost saving measure.

In addition, NICTA collaborates with many Australian universities and research organisations, and has smaller numbers of staff on various non-partner (and non-member) university campuses around the country.

== Funding ==
NICTA is funded by the Australian Government as represented by the [[Department of Communications (Australia)|Department of Communications]] and the [[Australian Research Council]]. NICTA also receives funding from industry and several state governments, and is supported by its member and partner universities.

Stead was a researcher with John Macarthur on the project The Cultural Logic of Queensland Architecture: Place, Taste and Economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Cultural Logic of Queensland Architecture: Place, Taste and Economy - UQ Researchers|url = http://researchers.uq.edu.au/research-project/12477|website = researchers.uq.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession: women, work and leadership ===
Stead initiated and led the [[Australian Research Council]] funded project Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession: Women, Work and Leadership (2011â2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession: Women, Work, and Leadership - Architecture Theory Criticism History - The University of Queensland, Australia|url = http://atch.architecture.uq.edu.au/equity-and-diversity-australian-architecture-profession-women-work-and-leadership|website = atch.architecture.uq.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This involved eight researchers â  Stead, [[Karen Burns (academic)|Karen Burns]], [[Justine Clark]], [[Gill Matthewson]], [[Amanda Roan]], [[Gillian Whitehouse]], [[Julie Willis]] and [[Sandra Kaji-O'Grady]] â and sought map womenâs participation in the architectural profession in Australia, to understand why women are under-represented at senior management level, and to identify concrete strategies for change. The project resulted in scholarly publications and in the advocacy and activism project [[Parlour: women, equity, architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Parlour - women, equity, architecture.|url = http://archiparlour.org/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gender equality: Reading between the lines|url = http://architectureau.com/articles/gender-equality/|website = ArchitectureAU|accessdate = 2015-11-14|first = Michael|last = Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Equity: not just Parlour talk|url = http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/voice/equity-not-just-parlour-talk-20140602-39eh2.html|newspaper = The Age|date = 2014-06-10|access-date = 2015-11-14|first = Niamh|last = Cremins}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also led to the Parlour Guides to Equitable Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Parlour Guides to Equitable Practice Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/topics/parlour-guides-to-equitable-practice/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2807">'''Neo-minimalism''' is an amorphous art movement of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It has alternatively been called "neo-geometric" or "neo-geo" art.  Other terms include: [[Neo-conceptual art|Neo-Conceptualism]], [[Neo-Futurism]], Neo-Op, Neo-Pop, New Abstraction, Poptometry, Post-Abstractionism, Simulationism, and Smart Art.&lt;ref&gt;John Albert Walker, ''Glossary of Art, Architecture, and Design Since 1945'', Third edition, New York, G. K. Hall, 1992; p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
The aspects of "postmodern art" that have been described as neo-minimalism (and related terms) involve a general "reevaluation of earlier art forms."&lt;ref&gt;Fred S. Kleiner and Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective'', Twelfth edition, Thomson / Wadsworth, 2005; Vol. 2, p. 844.&lt;/ref&gt;  As its various titles indicate, the movement draws on earlier mid-to-late-20th century developments in [[Minimalist art]], [[Abstract Expressionism]] and its [[Post-painterly Abstraction|offshoots]], plus [[Pop Art]], [[Op Art]], and other threads of artistic development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/Neo-minimalism&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary artists who have been linked to the term, or who have been included in shows employing it, include [[Peter Halley]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Lorenzo Belenguer]], [[Ashley Bickerton]], David Burdeny, Paul Kuhn, Eve Leader, [[Peter Schuyff]], [[Christopher Willard]] and [[Tim Zuck]]. The steel sculptures of [[Richard Serra]] have been described as "austere neo-Minimalism...."&lt;ref&gt;Casey Nelson Blake, "An Atmosphere of Effrontery," in: ''The Power of Culture: Critical Essays in American History'', Richard Wightman Fox and [[T. J. Jackson Lears]], eds., Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1993; p. 259 n. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and music==
Beyond painting, sculpture and other "museum art," the term has been applied to architecture, design, and music.&lt;ref&gt;''Cadence: The American Review of Jazz and Blues'', Vol. 14 (1988), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In architecture, indeed, neo-minimalism has been identified as a part of "the new orthodoxy...."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Hodge, ed., ''Not Architecture But Evidence That It Exists'', Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press, 1999; p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

"After the bacchanal of [[Postmodernism|post-modernism]], the time has again come for neo-minimalism, neo-ascetism, neo-denial and sublime poverty."&lt;ref&gt;Juhani Pallasmaa, ''Architecture in Miniature'', Museum of Finnish Architecture, 1991; p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The North American Model of Wildlife Conservation rests on two basic principles&amp;nbsp;â fish and wildlife are for the non-commercial use of citizens, and should be managed such that they are available at optimum population levels forever.
&lt;!-------==Historical development==------&gt;

==Significance==
The North American model has no direct legal powers,&lt;ref name=Petersen2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Petersen|first=David|title=The North American Model for Wildlife Conservation Is an Endangered Species in Colorado|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-petersen/the-north-american-model-_1_b_2868149.html|work=Huff-Post Denver|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=5 November 2013|date=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but rather has become the basis for policies developed by the [[Boone and Crockett Club]], the [http://www.fishwildlife.org/ Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies], [[The Wildlife Society]], and other conservation groups. The model has been widely accepted by wildlife professionals, incorporated into U.S. state agencies, and endorsed by professional organizations and teaching institutions.&lt;ref name="Nelson et al 2011"/&gt;

==Tenets==
The core principles of the Model are elaborated upon in the seven major tenets:&lt;ref name="Organ et al 2012"/&gt;

# Wildlife as Public Trust Resources
# Elimination of Markets for Game
# Allocation of Wildlife by Law
# Wildlife Should Only be Killed for a Legitimate Purpose
# Wildlife is Considered an International Resource
# Science is the Proper Tool for Discharge of Wildlife Policy
# Democracy of Hunting

===Wildlife as Public Trust Resources===
In the North American Model, wildlife is held in the public trust. This means that fish and wildlife are held by the public through state and federal governments. In other words, though an individual may own the land up which wildlife resides, that individual does not own said wildlife. Instead, the wildlife is owned by all citizens. With origins in Roman times and English [[Common law]], the public trust doctrine has at its heart the 1842 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling Martin V. Waddell.&lt;ref name="Public Trust"&gt;{{cite web|last=Organ|first= John|author2=Shane Mahoney |
url = http://joomla.wildlife.org/documents/future-of-public-trust.pdf | title = The Future of Public Trust | journal=The Wildlife Professional|date=Summer 2007|pages=18â22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elimination of Markets for Game===
Commercial hunting and the sale of wildlife is prohibited to ensure the sustainability of wildlife population. This principle holds that unregulated economic markets for game and nongame wildlife are unacceptable because they privatize a common resource and lead to declines. The [[Lacey Act of 1900]] effectively made market hunting illegal in the United States, and the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] provided international protections from the market.&lt;ref name="Organ et al 2012"/&gt;

===Allocation of Wildlife by Law===
Wildlife is allocated to the public by law, as opposed to market principles, land ownership, or other status. Democratic processes and public input into law-making help ensure access is equitable. Laws regulating access to wildlife include the 1940 [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]], [[Endangered Species Preservation Act#Act of 1966|Endangered Species Preservation Act]] and Fur Seal Act of 1966, the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972]], and the 1973 [[Endangered Species Act]].&lt;ref name="Organ et al 2012"/&gt;

===Wildlife Should Only be Killed for a Legitimate Purpose===
Under the North American Model, the killing of game must be done only for food, fur, self-defense, and the protection of property (including livestock). In other words, it is broadly regarded as unlawful and unethical to kill fish or wildlife (even with a license) without making all reasonable effort to retrieve and make reasonable use of the resource.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahoney|first=Shane|date=SeptemberâOctober 2004|title=The Seven Sisters|journal=Bugle|publisher=Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation|volume=21|issue=5|url=http://www.rmef.org/NewsandMedia/PubsTV/Bugle/2004/SepOct/Features/SevenSisters.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rmef.org/Hunting/HuntersConservation/model.htm | title = North American Wildlife Conservation Model | accessdate = 2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wildlife is Considered an International Resource===
As wildlife do not exist only within fixed political boundaries, effective management of these resources must be done internationally, through treaties and the cooperation of management agencies.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Science is the Proper Tool for Discharge of Wildlife Policy===
The North American Model recognizes science as a basis for informed management and decision-making processes. This tenet draws from the writings of [[Aldo Leopold]], who in the 1930s called for a wildlife conservation movement facilitated by trained wildlife biologists that made decisions based on facts, professional experience, and commitment to shared underlying principles, rather than strictly interests of hunting, stocking, or culling of predators. Science in wildlife policy includes studies of population dynamics, behavior, habitat, [[adaptive management]], and national surveys of hunting and fishing.&lt;ref name="Organ et al 2012"/&gt;

===Democracy of Hunting===
This tenet is inspired by [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s idea that open access to hunting would result in many benefits to society. This tenet supports access to firearms and the hunting industry, of which much funding for conservation is derived.&lt;ref name="Organ et al 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USFWS Hunting"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service|title=What do hunters do for conservation?|url=http://www.fws.gov/hunting/whatdo.html|work=USFWS Hunting|publisher=United States Fish and Wildlife Service|accessdate=5 November 2013|date=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some authors have questioned whether the North America Model is inclusive of all wildlife conservation interests or exclusively narrow in its application.&lt;ref name="Beuchler &amp; Servheen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beuchler|first= M.|author2=G. Servheen | year=2008|title= The North American Model of Wildlife Conservation: affirming the role, strength, and relevance of hunting in the 21st century|journal=Transactions of the North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference|volume=73|pages=163â179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The North American model has also been criticized as presenting an "inadequate history" and prescribing "inadequate ethics" of conservation, and in giving [[hunting|recreational hunting]] disproportionate credit for its role in conservation.&lt;ref name="Nelson et al 2011"&gt;{{cite journal| title=An Inadequate Construct?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12869">The '''Organizational-Activational Hypothesis''' states that [[steroid hormones]] permanently organize the nervous system during early development, which is reflected in adult male or female typical behaviors.&lt;ref&gt; Phoenix CH, Goy RW, Gerall AA, Young WC. Organizing action of prenatally administered testosterone propionate on the tissues mediating mating behavior in the female guinea pig. Endocrinology. 1959;65:369â382. &lt;/ref&gt; In adulthood, the same steroid hormones activate, modulate, and inhibit these behaviors. &lt;ref&gt; Nelson, R. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (4th ed.). Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates. 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was revolutionary when first published in 1959 because no other previous experiment had demonstrated that adult behaviors could be determined hormonally during early development. &lt;ref&gt; Wallen, Kim. âThe Organizational Hypothesis: Reflections on the 50th anniversary of the publication of Phoenix, Goy, Geral, and Young (1959).â Hormones and Behavior. 561. Web. 24 Mar. 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;

The Phoenix et al. study sought to discover whether [[gonadal hormones]] given during the prenatal period had organizing effects on guinea pigsâ reproductive behavior&lt;ref&gt; Phoenix CH, Goy RW, Gerall AA, Young WC. Organizing action of prenatally administered testosterone propionate on the tissues mediating mating behavior in the female guinea pig. Endocrinology. 1959;65:369â382.  &lt;/ref&gt; It was found that when female controls, gonadectomized (removal of gonads) females, hermaphrodites, and [[castrated]] males were injected prenatally with [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] proprionate, the mean number of mounts increased. This increase in male-typical reproductive behavior shows that prenatal androgens have a masculinizing effect. Moreover, the organizing effects of hormones can have permanent effects. Phoenix et al. found that females injected with testosterone propionate while pregnant, instead of neonatally, did not have any effect on [[lordosis]]. This demonstrates that when testosterone is given postnatally in females, there may not be lasting effects as compared to prenatally administered testosterone. The data from this study supports the organizational hypothesis that states when [[androgens]] are given prenatally there is an organizing effect on sexual behavior, permanently altering normal female mating behavior as adults. &lt;ref&gt; Phoenix CH, Goy RW, Gerall AA, Young WC. Organizing action of prenatally administered testosterone propionate on the tissues mediating mating behavior in the female guinea pig. Endocrinology. 1959;65:369â382.  &lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms in sexual differentiation ==
Sexual behavior in rats is organized prenatally and activated with steroids hormones in adulthood.  &lt;ref&gt; Nelson, R. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (4th ed.). Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates. 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In males high levels of testosterone produced by testes and travel to the brain. Here, testosterone is aromatized to an estradiol and masculinizes and defeminizes the brain. Thus, [[estradiol]] is responsible for many male-typical behavior. In females, the ovaries produce large amounts of [[estrogen]] during gestation. Rats have alpha-fetoprotein that binds to the estrogen before it can reach the brain. The estrogen is eventually metabolized in the liver. This protein has a low affinity for androgens. Therefore, testosterone can reach the brain without being taken up by alpha-fetoprotein. Due to fact that males have different levels of androgens in the brain, this can lead to organizing effects from androgen exposure with the expression of masculine behaviour.

== Main points of organizational-activational theory ==
The organizational-activational theory has three main components.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold A. (1985) âOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.â Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

#Organizational effects are permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold A. (1985) âOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.â Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Gomes et al. showed that organizational effects can last a lifetime. Newborn female mice were exposed to either endured one minute of the neonatal handling stress procedure for the first ten days postpartum or were not handled at all. As adults, sexual receptiveness was recorded and handled female mice showed less [[lordosis]] than non-handled female mice and had less serum progesterone. &lt;ref&gt; Gomes C. (2012). âNeonatal handling induces alteration in progesterone secretion after sexual behavior but not in angiotensin II receptor density in the medial amygdala: implications for reproductive success.â Life Sciences. 2867-2871. Web. 24 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Neonatal handling not only affected reproductive behavior, but also affected sympathetic nerve activity and glucocorticoid levels into adulthood, indicating that emotional stress during developmentally sensitive periods can permanently change behavior. &lt;ref&gt; Nugent BM. (2012). âHormonal Programming Across the Lifespan.â Hormone and Metabolic Research. 577â586. Web. 24 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Organizational effects occur just prior to or after birth, but before neural tissues have matured.&lt;ref&gt; Arnold A. (1985) âOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.â Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Gorski et al. demonstrated the importance of the timing of hormonal influence in a study involving rats and the size of their [[medial preoptic nucleus]] (MPON). MPON size is a [[sexually dimorphic]] trait in that the MPON of male rats is larger than the MPON of female rats. But when male rats were castrated neonatally, their MPON was significantly smaller than male rats that were castrated after their brains were sexually differentiated. Despite both groups of males being castrated, the timing of the castration affected MPON size, indicating that organizational effects occur prior to maturation of neural tissues.&lt;ref&gt; Gorski R. (1978). âEvidence for a morphological sex difference within the medial preoptic area of the rat brain.â Brain Research. 333â346. Web. 24 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Organizational effects take place during a [[critical period]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold A. (1985) âOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.â Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Results from studies indicate that organizational effects are maximized during sensitive periods of brain development. One critical period is weeks 8-24 of gestation. Another sensitive period shortly after birth may exist with a peak in testosterone in male infants during postnatal months 1-5. &lt;ref&gt; Arnold A. (1985) âOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.â Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Auyeung et al. tested for an association between fetal and postnatal testosterone and autism in children. The results supported the idea that there is a critical period during which organizational effects occur. Fetal testosterone levels (taken from amniotic fluid during second trimester amniocentesis) and postnatal testosterone levels (from 18- to 24-month-olds' saliva) were compared with the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT), a measure of autistic traits in children. The authors found that only fetal testosterone was positively associated with Q-CHAT scores, signifying that fetal testosterone exposure during the critical period for sexual differentiation of the brain is associated with the development of autistic traits whereas postnatal androgens are not.&lt;ref&gt; Auyeung B. (2012). âPrenatal versus postnatal sex steroid hormone effects on autistic traits in children at 18 to 24 months of age.â Molecular Autism.17. Web. 25 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
There is evidence that organizational effects are not always permanent. In canaries, only the males produce song. Brain regions associated with bird song, including the hyperstriatum ventrale pars caudale (HVc) and nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA), are larger in male canaries. However, the HVc and RA grow significantly larger in gonadectomized female canaries if given testosterone at 11 months of age and these females even begin to sing. These two brain regions change morphologically due to testosterone, indicating that neural tissue can be changed due to steroid hormones despite being organized to react to sex hormones in a female- or male-specific way.&lt;ref&gt; Nottebohm F. (1980). âTestosterone triggers growth of brain vocal control nuclei in adult female canaries.â Brain Res.429-436. Web. 24 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence ==
=== Facts of [[Digit ratio|2D:4D]] ratio ===
Finger ratio has been examined in relation to a number of physical traits that show sex differences and evidence suggests it is influenced by the prenatal environment, although there is no direct evidence for the latter.&lt;ref&gt; Arnold A. (1985) âOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.â Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in men have been motivated by two conflicting hypotheses. On the one hand, homosexual men were hypothesized to be exposed to high levels of testosterone in utero, which would be associated with a lower 2D:4D ratio than that found in heterosexual men. On the other hand, homosexual men have been hypothesized to have low prenatal testosterone exposure, and data from two studies are consistent with that hypothesis, showing homosexual men to have a higher finger ratio (on both hands) than heterosexual men. &lt;ref&gt; Arnold A. (1985) âOrganizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.â Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
   
=== Ovulation and gonadal secretion ===
The hormonal control of ovulation is also related to the organizational/activational hypothesis.  &lt;ref&gt; Nelson, R. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (4th ed.). Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates. 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Both males and females rats exhibit luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses in which LH is released from the anterior pituitary due to the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Females, however, show an increase in LH pulse frequency around ovulation due to the positive feedback mechanism. When estrogen is increased in the blood, the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) of the hypothalamus causes the release of GnRH. The GnRH surge brings about a surge in LH and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Since females have a cyclic gonadal function, there may be a sexual dimorphism in the gonadal secretion. When female rats are injected with testosterone there is no positive feedback occurring and no LH surge. Moreover, castrated males will exhibit LH surges, similar to female cyclic gonadal behavior.

'''Philip David Radford''' (born January 2, 1976) is an American environmental, clean energy and [[democracy]] leader&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Grist.org]]|url=http://15years.grist.org/|title=15 Years: Lessons Learned|accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; who served as the youngest executive director of [[Greenpeace]] USA.&lt;ref name="The National Journal"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[The National Journal]]|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/greenpeace-leader-moving-on-at-38-20140422 |title=Greenpeace Leader Moving On at 38; Phil Radford has been the youngest executive director in the environmental group's 43-year history, but he's looking for even greener pastures|accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder and President of Progressive Power Lab, an organization that incubates companies and non-profits that build capacity for progressive organizations, including the Progressive Multiplier Fund&lt;ref name="Progressive Multiplier Fund"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Progressive Multiplier Fund|url=https://progressivemultiplier.fund/|title=Progressive Multiplier Fund|accessdate=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Membership Drive.&lt;ref name="MembershipDrive"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=MembershipDrive |url=http://www.membershipdrive.com/team/|title=Our Team|accessdate=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford is a co-founder of the [[Democracy Initiative]], was founder and executive director of Power Shift, and is a board member of the Mertz Gilmore Foundation.&lt;ref name="Mertz Gilmore Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Mertz Gilmore Foundation|url= http://www.mertzgilmore.org/index.php/about/board|title=Board of Directors |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a background in grassroots organizing, [[corporate social responsibility]],&lt;ref name="SustMeme CSR &amp; Business"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=McClelland Media Ltd. |url= https://www.leaderboarded.com/csr-business|title= SustMeme CSR &amp; Business |accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[climate change]], and [[clean energy]].&lt;ref name="SustMeme Climate Change and Energy"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=McClelland Media Ltd. |url= https://www.leaderboarded.com/climate-change-energy |title= SustMeme Climate Change and Energy|accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford lives in Washington, D.C. with his wife Eileen.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/fashion/weddings/eileen-simpson-philip-radford-weddings.html?_r=0 |title= Weddings, Celebrations |accessdate=2013-07-20 |date=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radford's [[theory of change]] shifted from viewing governments as arbitrators between public and private interests on environmental issues, to finding that most governments are captured by industry. Rather than fighting first for new laws, which could be blocked by industries, he has focused on pressuring large companies to change their practices and enlisted them as allies in pushing for strong environmental protections.&lt;ref name="CleanTechIQ"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= CleanTechIQ |url= http://cleantechiq.com/2013/01/activists-invade-the-boardroom/|title= What Greenpeace's New Strategy Means for Investors|accessdate =2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Greenpeace]] campaigns that convinced [[Apple, Inc.]] and similar companies to shift to 100% clean energy and lobby utilities and regulators to make that possible,&lt;ref name="Greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace USA]]|url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/media-center/news-releases/Greenpeace-Executive-Director-Philip-Radford-to-Step-Down/|title=Greenpeace Executive Director Philip Radford to Step Down; Leaves legacy of corporate victories and organizational growth|accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite AV media |publisher=[[Business Insider]]|url= http://www.businessinsider.com/greenpeace-fortune-500-deforestation-global-warming-2014-6 |title=How A 'Bunch Of Commies' Are Forcing The Fortune 500 To Stop Destroying Rain Forests, Killing Too Many Fish, And Burning Coal and Oil|accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as work to protect both the [[Indonesian rainforest]] and the [[Bering Sea Canyons]].&lt;ref name="Environmental Leader"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Environmental Leader|url= http://www.environmentalleader.com/2013/05/31/whole-foods-safeway-trader-joes-top-sustainable-seafood-list/|title=Whole Foods, Safeway, Trader Joe's Top Sustainable Seafood List| accessdate =2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= [[Huffington Post]]|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/philip-radford/a-breakthrough-in-how-we_b_3423516.html | title= A Breakthrough in How We Work to Protect Our Oceans | accessdate =2013-09-02 |first=Philip |last=Radford |date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford argues that the combination of creating industry champions and "outside pressure" focused on the government are the keys to passing new laws to protect the environment.&lt;ref name="CleanTechIQ"/&gt; However, Radford has also been a vocal leader calling for the United States to pass [[campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]] and respect all Americans' voting rights to shift power in politics from corporations towards people and fulfill "the promise of American democracy." Radford is considered by many to be a modern-day transcendentalist, in that he is very focused on nature and the environment, and he is an advocate of democracy.&lt;ref name="C-SPAN"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[C-SPAN]] |url= http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/ProgressiveAgenda |title= Progressive Agenda |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[Huffington Post]] |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/philip-radford/if-you-want-to-breathe-cl_b_3600018.html|title= If You Want to Breathe Clean Air, Senate Reform and Democracy Matter |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Radford received his B.A. from [[Washington University]] in St. Louis in 1998.&lt;ref name="Washington University"/&gt;

== Early activism ==
Radford began his environmental activism as a high school student at [[Oak Park and River Forest High School]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]], a Chicago suburb, volunteering for an [[environmental justice]] campaign to stop the building of trash incinerators in the West Side of Chicago near his family's Oak Park home.&lt;ref name="Oak Park and River Forest High School Tradition of Excellence Past Award Recipients"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Oak Park and River Forest High School]] |url= http://www.oprfhs.org/alumni/Past-Award-Recipients-TOE.cfm|title=Oak Park and River Forest High School Tradition of Excellence Past Award Recipients |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first job as a grassroots organizer came as a canvasser for Illinois [[PIRG]]. While studying political science and business at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], he directed campaign and canvass offices during summers for the [[Fund for Public Interest Research]] for clients including the [[Human Rights Campaign]], [[PIRGIM]], and [[Ohio PIRG]] and worked part-time during school for the [[Sierra Club]].&lt;ref name="Fund for the Public Interest"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Fund for the Public Interest]] |url=http://www.fundforthepublicinterest.org/jobs/alumni/profiles/phillip-d.-radford |title=Phillip D.

After graduating college in 1998, Radford became a lead organizer at [[Green Corps]], the field school for environmental organizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greencorps.org/page/career-placement |title= Career Placement: Growing the Movement |publisher=[[Green Corps]] |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Field director of Ozone Action ===

From 1999 to 2001 Radford was field director for Ozone Action, an organization dedicated to working on the atmospheric threats of global warming and ozone depletion. As field director, Radford planned and executed a number of grassroots campaigns, including a campaign during the 2000 presidential primaries, which was the initial impetus for Senator John McCain sponsoring the Climate Stewardship Act.&lt;ref name="Canvassing Works"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Canvassing Works |url= http://www.canvassingworks.org/canvassingworks/2006/09/alumni_update_p.html |title= Canvassing Works |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Living on Earth"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Living on Earth]] |url= http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=07-P13-00049&amp;segmentID=3 |title= McCain on Climate Change |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radford also managed the grassroots mobilization for the Global Warming Divestiture Campaign, which resulted in [[Ford]], [[General Motors]], [[Texaco]], and other companies ending their funding the [[Global Climate Coalition]], which spread misinformation about global warming.&lt;ref name="Industry Ignored Its Scientists on Climate"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=

=== Founder of Power Shift ===

In 2001, Radford founded Power Shift,&lt;ref name="Fund for the Public Interest"/&gt; a [[non-governmental organization]] dedicated to driving [[clean energy]] market breakthroughs and building the [[grassroots]] base to stop [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="Power Shift"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Volunteermatch.org |url= http://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org22033.jsp|title=Power Shift|accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As executive director of Power Shift, Radford worked closely with the cities of San Diego, Chula Vista, and Berkeley, California, as well as nine other municipalities, to secure investments for installation of solar energy systems and implementation of energy efficiency measures in municipal buildings.&lt;ref name="Fund for the Public Interest"/&gt;  Radford also helped to convince [[Citigroup]] to adopt innovative new means of financing clean energy infrastructure for wind and solar installations that made them affordable to average Americans.&lt;ref name="The National Journal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[Environmental News Service]|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2004/2004-01-23-09.asp|title= Citigroup Sets New Environmental Standards |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leading Greenpeace USA ==

In 2009, at the age of 33, Radford was selected as the youngest ever executive director of [[Greenpeace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Grist.org]]|url= http://grist.org/climate-energy/greenpeace-out-parting-shots-from-a-battle-hardened-climate-leader/#.Uuj53o8Zxb0.twitter|title= Greenpeace out: Parting shots from a battle hardened climate leader |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[The Guardian]] |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/29/interview-greenpeace-phil-radford|title= Greenpeace USA's Phil Radford|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford's tenure at Greenpeace USA is best known for convincing over 100 corporations to change their environmental practices;&lt;ref name="Paper Giant Pledges to Leave the Poor Rainforest Alone.

In September 2013, Radford announced that he would step down on April 30, 2014, once he had completed five years of service as executive director.&lt;ref name="The National Journal"/&gt;

[[New York Times]] reporter [[Andrew Revkin]] referred to a Greenpeace campaign during Radford's tenure as "Activism at Its Best."&lt;ref name="dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/activism-at-its-best-greenpeaces-push-to-stop-the-pulping-of-rain-forests/|title= Activism at Its Best: Greenpeace's Push to Stop the Pulping of Rain Forests|accessdate=2013-07-19|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Andrew C.|last=Revkin|date=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/a-chat-with-greenpeaces-departing-u-s-chief-on-old-and-new-environmentalism/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|title=A Chat With Greenpeace's Departing U.S. Chief on Old and New Environmentalism |accessdate=2014-04-19|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Andrew C. |last=Revkin |date=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Jealous]], former president and chief executive officer of the [[NAACP]] as well as co-founder of the [[Democracy Initiative]] with Radford, described Radford at the helm of Greenpeace as "a modern movement building giant.  He has built powerful diverse coalitions to bolster the fights for the environment and voting rights. In the process he has shown himself to be unmatched in mobilizing everyday people to fund their movements directly." Environmental leader [[Bill McKibben]] stated: "During Radford's tenure, Greenpeace has been helping the whole [[environmental movement]] shift back towards its roots: local, connected, tough."&lt;ref name="Greenpeace"/&gt;

Before becoming executive director of Greenpeace USA, Radford served as the director of the organization's [[Grassroots]] Program.&lt;ref name="Grist.org"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Grist.org]]|url= 
http://grist.org/article/2009-04-14-greenpeaces-new-leader-talks/|title= Greenpeace's new leader talks up need for a green grassroots|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that capacity, he directed and significantly grew the organization's street canvass and launched and directed the door-to-door canvasses, online-to-offline organizing team, social media team, the Greenpeace Student Network, and the Greenpeace Semester.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace USA"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/about/our-staff/phil-radford/|title= Phil Radford|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Radford, the street and door-to-door canvassing programs grew to include nearly 400 canvassers in almost 20 cities across the country and was responsible for doubling the organization's budget.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace USA"/&gt;

==Changing corporate behavior==

===Global Climate Coalition===
Radford managed the grassroots efforts of a national [[divestment]]/[[disinvestment]] campaign,&lt;ref name="Meet Philip Radford, Executive Director of Greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[How Stuff Works]]|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/conservation/conservationists/changemaker-phil-radford.htm|title=Meet Philip Radford, Executive Director of Greenpeace|accessdate=2013-08-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109143521/http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/conservation/conservationists/changemaker-phil-radford.htm|archivedate=November 9, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which forced [[Ford]], [[General Motors]], [[Texaco]], and other companies to stop funding the [[Global Climate Coalition]], which spread misinformation about global warming.&lt;ref name="Industry Ignored Its Scientists on Climate"/&gt; Soon thereafter, the GCC ended operations.&lt;ref name="RIP: Global Climate Coalition; Global Climate Coalition Ends Its Work; Voice for Industry Opposed Global Treaty"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Heat is Online|url=

===Citigroup===
In 2001, while running Power Shift, Radford launched a campaign to push Citibank to offer and promote Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs).&lt;ref name="Last Call"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[In These Times]] |url=http://iatp.org/news/last-call | title= Last Call: In Person with Ben Winters, Save the Ales|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citi was "missing the opportunity to help stop global warming by phasing out fossil fuel investments and promoting clean energy now," Radford said. "The irony is that if Citi financed solar for people's homes, solar energy could be made immediately affordable for millions of Americans today."&lt;ref name=" Multinational Monitor, April 2002 - VOLUME 23 - NUMBER 4"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Multinational Monitor]] |url=http://multinationalmonitor.org/mm2002/02april/april02corp1.html | title= Citigroup: Bankrupting Democracy; The Cost of Living Richly Citigroup's Global Finance and Threats to the Environment |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Citigroup agreed to offer and promote EEMs for residential wind, energy efficiency, and solar installations that would make clean energy affordable for millions of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Environmental News Service]]|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2004/2004-01-23-09.asp| title= Citigroup Sets New Environmental Standards |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kimberly-Clark===
Radford oversaw the grassroots mobilization efforts on the [[Kleercut]] Campaign in the United States and, later, the entire U.S. component of the global campaign when he became Greenpeace's executive director,&lt;ref name="Grist.org"/&gt; targeting Kimberly-Clark for sourcing 22% of its paper pulp from Canadian [[Boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s containing 200-year-old trees. The campaign included intervening in Kleenex commercial shoots,&lt;ref name="Kleenex Gets Punk'd"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZCym0DB7hA |title=Kleenex Gets Punk'd|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; convincing twenty-two universities and colleges to take action such as cancelling contracts,&lt;ref name=" About the Student Network"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/getinvolved/get-involved/student-network/a-brief-history-of-the-greenpe/|title= 2005â2009 â Kleercut-Free Campuses and Victory!|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1718476/exclusive-how-kimberly-clark-ditched-its-forest-destroying-reputation-and-embraced-greenpeac|title= Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; recruiting 500 companies to boycott Kimberly-Clark,&lt;ref name="Forest Friendly 500"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url=http://forestfriendly500.org |title= Forest Friendly 500 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 1,000 protests of the company, and more.&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" More Than Tissues in a Box of Kleenex"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2008-02-16/business/36867371_1_kleenex-kimberly-clark-greenpeace-office |title=More Than Tissues in a Box of Kleenex |accessdate=2013-08-23 |first=Ylan Q. |last=Mui |date=February 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203055353/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2008-02-16/business/36867371_1_kleenex-kimberly-clark-greenpeace-office |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The result: On August 5, 2009, Kimberly-Clark announced that it would source 40% of its paper fiber from recycled content or other sustainable sources â a 71% increase from 2007 levels. The demand created by Kimberly-Clark for sustainably logged fiber was greater than the supply, enabling the company to convince logging companies to change their practices.&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Greenpeace and Kimberly-Clark Settle Feud"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/greenpeace-and-kimberly-clark-settle-feud/?_r=0 |title=Greenpeace and Kimberly-Clark Settle Feud|accessdate=2013-08-23 |first=Leslie |last=Kaufman |date=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia Pulp and Paper===
From 2010 to 2013, Radford managed Greenpeace US team that persuaded major U.S. companies to cancel their contracts with [[Asia Pulp and Paper]] (APP) â the world's third largest paper company&lt;ref name=" Paper Producer to Stop Clearing of Indonesian Forests"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/business/energy-environment/06iht-forest06.html?_r=0 |title=Paper Producer to Stop Clearing of Indonesian Forests |accessdate=2013-08-26 |first=Sara |last=Schonhardt |date=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; â to push APP to stop destroying ancient forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[GreenBiz]] |url= http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2014/05/06/annie-leonard-story-stuff-will-direct-greenpeace |title='Story of Stuff' creator Annie Leonard will lead Greenpeace USA |accessdate=2014-05-06 |date=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace and its allies succeeded in convincing more than 100 corporate customers of APP to sever their ties with the company,&lt;ref name="Paper Giant Pledges to Leave the Poor Rainforest Alone.

===Apple, Facebook, and cloud computing go 100% clean energy===
On April 21, 2011, Greenpeace released a report highlighting data centers, which consumed up to 2% of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase. Radford stated "we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today."&lt;ref name="Dirty Data Report Card"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/Cool%20IT/dirty-data-report-greenpeace.pdf|title=Dirty Data Report Card|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business Insider]] reported that after [[Greenpeace USA]] campaigns, "tech giants like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Salesforce have promised to power their data centers with renewable energy, a pledge that led Duke Energy, the nation's largest power utility and one of the most flagrant emitters of CO2, to begin providing clean energy to win their business."&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt;

===Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate Palmolive, palm oil and Indonesian rainforests===

In 2014, deforestation in Indonesia, which accounts for .1% of the world's surface, caused 4% of global warming pollution. One of the major drivers of deforestation was clearing the forest to grow palm oil plantations.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt; Under Radford, the Greenpeace USA team persuaded [[Procter &amp; Gamble]],&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt; [[Colgate Palmolive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |publisher=Monga Bay | url= http://news.mongabay.com/2014/0606-greenpeace-tiger-challenge.html |title=Greenpeace rates companies' zero deforestation commitments |accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mondelez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |publisher=Confectionery News | url= http://www.confectionerynews.com/Ingredients/Mondelez-announces-palm-oil-action-plan |title=Mondelez Announces Palm Oil Action Plan | accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other major companies to demand sustainably grown palm oil.

===Major U.S. supermarkets===
Under Radford, Greenpeace ran a campaign targeting supermarket chains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/news-and-blogs/campaign-blog/protecting-our-oceans-one-supermarket-at-a-ti/blog/34215/ | title= Protecting our oceans, one supermarket at a time | accessdate =2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; â which sell 50% of all seafood in the U.S. â to convince them to stop selling threatened fish, adopt sustainable seafood policies, and lobby for policies such as [[marine reserve]]s to protect the oceans.

'''Pinkney Near''' (1927 - 1990)  was curator of the [[Cincinnati Museum of Art]] and afterward curator of the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]] for thirty years. He was responsible for the [[VMFA]]'s acquisition of many treasured works of art, including arranging for the museum to purchase from [[John Lee Pratt]] the [[Francisco Goya]] portrait of General Nicolas Guye&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Robert|title=Pinkney Near Left a Mark on the Museum|publisher=Richmond Time-Dispatch|date=September 30, 1990|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barriault|first1=Anne B.|title=Enrich collections: the extraordinary collections of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts|publisher=Apollo on High Beam|date=May 1, 2010|quote=...colleagues from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Dumbarton Oaks, and the American Museum of Natural History . . . consulted with [visionary director Leslie Cheek, Jr.] and curator Pinkney Near to establish the Asian, Ancient Egyptian, Greek Roman, Byzantine, and Pre-Columbian collections.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the collection of [[Karol LanckoroÅski|Count Karol LanckoroÅski]] of Vienna, Austria, a rare marble [[sarcophagus]] dating to the 2nd century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare Marble Funeral Monument Given to Museum|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4653261/sarcophagus_2nd-century_to_vmfa_says/|website=Newspapers.com|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guye portrait was long believed to be the most valuable single work of art in the [[VMFA]]'s collection. The Goya portrait of General Guye is on view prominently in the posthumously created Pinkney Near Gallery at the [[VMFA]]. 
==Biography==

Pinkney Near was born in New York City and was raised in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Pinkney L. Near|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-09-20/news/1990263193_1_pinkney-paul-episcopal-church-rebecca-n|accessdate=26 October 2015|publisher=Baltimore Sun|date=September 20, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 he graduated from [[St. Paul's School (Brooklandville, Maryland)|St. Paul's School]], and in 1950 he became the first art history graduate of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He earned his Master's degree from Harvard in 1951, and he studied [[Romanesque art|French Romanesque]] sculpture in Paris for three years on a [[Fulbright scholarship]]. He remained in Europe an additional year for research on a Sachs fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Robert|title=Pinkney Near left mark on museum|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=September 30, 1990|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He married the former Henrietta Lloyd.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-09-20/news/1990263193_1_pinkney-paul-episcopal-church-rebecca-n&lt;/ref&gt; Every summer Near, a specialist in European art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library|first1=VMFA|title=Special Collections in European Art: The Pinkney Near Collection|url=http://vmfa.museum/library/collections/|website=Virginia Museum of Fine Arts|accessdate=6 January 2016|location=Richmond, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his artist wife Henrietta Lloyd Near, a former colleague at the [[VMFA]], traveled to Europe to acquire art for the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]. Among the cities they visited were Barcelona, London, Rome, and Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People in the Fan: Henrietta Near|publisher=Fan District Newsletter|date=Summer 2015|location=Richmond, Virginia|pages=8, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were sometimes accompanied by philanthropists [[Sydney Lewis|Sydney and Frances Lewis]], donors of major collections to the museum.

Near began his work at the [[VMFA]] in 1958, and, except for three years (1962-1965) when he did graduate work at [[Harvard]] and was a curator at the [[Cincinnati Art Museum]], he served at the VMFA in Richmond the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Robert|title=Curator left lasting mark|work=art critic|issue=March 30, 1990|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years, when the museum was run by a director and a curator with a small staff, Near became the first full-time curator of the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]], one of the first state-supported art museums in the United States.

Pinkney Near died August 29, 1990 of pneumonia at a hospital in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], where he and his wife were visiting relatives. He was 63. His memorial service was held at [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Richmond, Virginia|St. Paul's Episcopal Church]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond,Virginia]], where he lived.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

==Curator of the [[Cincinnati Museum of Art]]==
In 1964 Pinkney Near, curator of paintings, selected American paintings for the Cincinnati Museum's survey exhibition, ranging from early painters such as [[John Trumbull]], [[Gilbert Stuart]], and [[Washington Allston]] to later painters [[John Marin]], [[Max Weber]], [[George Bellows]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Robert Vickrey]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Jane Freilicher]], [[Milton Avery]], and [[Tom Wesselmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darrack|first1=Arthur|title=American Painting Surveyed in Great Style at Museum Show|website=Newspapers.com|publisher=Cincinnati Enquirer|location=Cincinnati Enquirer, Kentucky edition|page=80|date=April 5, 1964|quote=He [Pinkney Near] has done a superb job of selection and I cannot recall a more interesting panorama of American painting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curator of the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]==
Pinkney Near first came to the VMFA in 1954 for a brief visit, when he had just returned from Paris where he studied Romanesque sculpture with his Fulbright Scholarship. A year later, in 1955 he left the museum for a Sachs fellowship which sponsored further study in Europe. However, it was during this brief stay that he began the evolution of the Collections Division, and, when he returned in 1956 at the age of 29, he became curatorial assistant at the museum. Two years later he was promoted to curator but decided to pursue his graduate work at Harvard. When he returned, he became Chief Curator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hiring of chief curator marked start of Collections Division|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=January 12, 1986|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinkney Near served as VMFA curator for 30 years, much of that time as chief administrative curator. In 1988 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Va. Museum chooses curator for Mellon Collection|publisher=The Richmond Afro-American|date=December 24, 1988|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=A6|quote="In selecting Mr. Near to be the first holder of this prestigious title, Mr. Mellon has recognized Mr. Near's lifelong commitment to scholarship and connoisseurship," says Paul N. Perrot, director of the museum.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near was named to the newly created post of Paul Mellon Curator and senior research curator, a post in which he worked closely with the Mellon Collection and with [[Paul Mellon]], who provided important gifts of art, both paintings and sculpture portraying animals, to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond Times-Dispatch, September 30, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-09-20/news/1990263193_1_pinkney-paul-episcopal-church-rebecca-n&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the years Near acquired for the museum some of its greatest treasures, including paintings by [[ThÃ©odore GÃ©ricault]], [[Claude Lorraine]]'s "Battle on a Bridge," [[Aristide Maillol]]'s "The River," [[Claude Monet]]'s "Irises by the Pond," [[Charles Willson Peale]]'s "William Smith and His Grandson," [[Angelica Kauffmann]]'s "Cornelia Pointing to Her Children as Her Treasures," and [[Jean-Baptiste Belin|Jean-Bapiste Blin de Fontenay]]'s monumental "Buffet Under a Trellis."

In 1976 Near announced the [[VMFA|VMFA's]] purchase of American sculptor [[Isamu Noguchi|Isamu Noguchi's]] polished stainless steel sculpture "Open Lock," completed in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Virginia Museum Acquires Sculpture by Isamu Noguchi|publisher=The Danville Register|date=August 9, 1976|location=Danville, Virginia|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the exhibits curated by Near was one called ''Three Masters of Landscape: Fragonard, Robert and Boucher'' which, although small, presented interesting issues due to the variability of the works. The exhibit made use of a recently acquired Fragonard entitled ''Landscape With Three Washerwomen".&lt;ref name=nyt1981&gt;{{cite news |title=Gallery View; THREE FRENCH LANDSCAPISTS WITH A COMMON VISION; RICHMOND, Va.|publisher=New York Times|date=November 29, 1981|first=John |last=Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and publications==
Pinkney Near wrote ''The Whistlers:A Family Reunion'', published in 1965 by the [[Cincinnati Museum of Art]], followed in 1981 by ''Three Masters of Landscape: Fragonard, Robert, and Boucher'', which was published by the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]. While at the [[VMFA]], the museum also published his book ''Apollo''. In 1985, his book ''French Paintings'' was published by the [[University of Virginia Press]].

Near, along with two other art experts, [[Julien Binford]] (professor emeritus at [[Mary Washington College]] in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]) and William Campbell (Curator of American Paintings at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington) selected the paintings by the deceased artist [[Gari Melchers]] for permanent display in the Gari Melchers Memorial Gallery at Belmont, the [[Falmouth, Virginia]] home of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Culbertson|first1=Drena|title=Final Melchers Collection selection is due this week|publisher=The Free Lance Star|date=July 26, 1976|location=Fredericksburg, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an author of many of the VMFA exhibition catalogs and illustrated books including ''French Paintings: The Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon''.

==Pinkney Near memorial lectures in art history==
Following the death of Pinkney Near in 1990 a series of memorial lectures in art history featuring notable art historians was begun at [[Art6|Art6 Gallery]] in Richmond in his honor. All but the last of the series was presented in the main gallery at Art6. Speakers in the series included Mia Genoni, Suzanne Foley, [[Robert Hobbs]], Matthew Affron, Richard Woodward, Joseph Dye III, Mitchell Merling, Belle Pendleton, and Susanne Kilgore Arnold. The final lecture in the series was given by then [[VMFA]] curator of contemporary art [[John Ravenal|John B.

'''Proactive law''' seeks a new approach to legal issues in businesses and societies. Instead of perceiving law as a constraint that companies and people in general need to comply with, '''proactive law''' considers law as an instrument that can create success and foster sustainable relationships, which in the end carries the potential to increase value for companies, individuals, and societies in general.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Ãstergaard, K.: Proactive Law â in a Business Environment. (2012) 1. ed. Tilst, DJÃF Publishing, Jurist- og Ãkonomforbundets Forlag. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The word [[proactive]] is the opposite of reactive, meaning that the approach to law is based on an [[ex ante]] view rather than an [[ex post]] view. According to the dictionary of [[Merriam-Webster]], the word proactive refers to ''acting in anticipation of future problems, needs, or changes''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proactive.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the proactive law approach challenges the traditional backwards and failure oriented approach to law by acting in [[67th World Science Fiction Convention|anticipation]] of legal [[disputes]], taking control of potential problems, providing solutions, and self-initiation, instead of reacting to failures and shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Ãstergaard, K.: Proactive Law â in a Business Environment. (2012) 1. ed. Tilst, DJÃF Publishing, Jurist- og Ãkonomforbundets Forlag. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotbed of the proactive law movement is the Nordic countries and Finland in particular. The movement took off in the late 1990s and is almost similar to the American movement â Law as a Competitive Source. Both of these parallel evolutions are founded on the work of [[Louis M. Brown]], developed in the 1950s known as the [[preventive]] approach to law.

== From Preventive Law to Proactive Law ==
The proactive law movement has become more visible in recent years, but the idea of an [[ex ante]] view is not new. It is generally known that the earlier a dispute or a potential dispute is addressed, the better the chances of a fair, just and prompt solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law â A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy â Juvenes Print. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Louis M. Brown]] was the first to introduce the [[ex ant]]e view in his ground-laying book âPreventive Lawâ.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Louis M.: Preventive Law, (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he identified and organized the preventive law into a distinctive way of thinking, he was not the inventor of this approach. It has been, and still is, well known to many legal professionals and every business manager that:

âIt usually costs less to avoid getting into trouble than to pay for getting out of trouble.â&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Louis M.: Preventive Law, (1950). p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the general principles of proactive law requires understanding the core principles of [[preventive law]], as these principles create the foundation for proactive law and [[proactive contracting]]. [[Edward Dauer]] identifies four core principles of preventive law:&lt;ref&gt;Dauer E. A., Four Principles for a Theory of Preventive Law, p. 13-35&lt;/ref&gt;

* Predicting human behavior to anticipate and account for what people will do, and by doing so, prevents litigation. This improves personal and business relationships, and constitutes an essential part of the preventive law.
* Conflict managementâpreventive law draws parallels from the medical world, e.g., successful medical treatment is prophylactic.
* Embracement of risks: Instead of focusing solely on reducing one or a few risks to zero, the preventive law approach strives to reduce the overall sum of risk.
* Preventive legal service: Lawyers and in-house counsels must participate with others in multi-disciplinary teams in the planning of business ventures. Bringing legal expertise in earlier helps detect and prevent legal problems.

The proactive law movement encompasses the basic principles of preventive law stated above, namely preventing what is not desirable, and keeping problems and risks from materializing.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Ãstergaard, K.: Proactive Law â in a Business Environment. (2012), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, as proactive law consists of preventive law, the characteristics above constitute the foundation of proactive law.

=== The Promotive Dimension ===
To this preventive dimension of law, proactive law adds a second aspect, which is often neglected in traditional law â known as the ''[[promotive]] dimension''.

The nature of the promotive dimension is positive and constructive and promotes what is desirable while encouraging good behavior. This is where we find the distinction to preventive law. 
In a legal context, proactive law emphasizes the importance of collaboration between legal professionals and other disciplines to achieve the desired goals in circumstances where legal expertise collaborates with other disciplines. Proactive law therefore emphasizes the need for dialogue between different understandings. In a medical context, the preventive law prevents ill health, while proactive law promotes well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law â A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy â Juvenes Print. p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proactive law approach is based on legal certainty, [[literacy]], and cross-professional collaboration to âlocalize the mines and preventing them from exploding.â&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law â A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy â Juvenes Print. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to navigating past the mines, the legal professionals should create economic value, and thus must be outcome-orientated to exploit the promotive dimension. Lawyers and [[in-house counsel]] thus must act to achieve results by watching for changes or opportunities and setting improved goals. To do so, legal professionals must highlight opportunities to build a solid business foundation, roadmaps for performance, trust, and better sustainable relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law â A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy â Juvenes Print. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides achieving these business goals, it is important to focus on legal [[risk management]] to prevent disputes. Many legal disputes arise due to misunderstandings and disappointed expectations. However, careful attention to legal clarity along with early warning mechanisms, and enhanced collaboration between business partners, through establishment of common goals, avoids the business from getting to the stage of dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law â A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy â Juvenes Print. p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential in proactive law that legal professionals, managers, and other involved stakeholders collaborate on a cross-professional basis to avoid disputes. In addition to avoiding disputes, it is also important to promote creative thinking. To develop new ideas, and concepts that correspond to the needs, problems or challenges, it is necessary to look towards the future rather than the past, maybe by using already known approaches, but also non-existing approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law â A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy â Juvenes Print. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; This invites businesses, authorities and researchers to develop solutions through creative thinking.

Thus, proactive law is about problem-solving, detecting real-life causes for potential misunderstandings and failures, but most of all it is about fostering and promoting fruitful and sustainable relationships that enables the stakeholders to reach their goals, creating value for business, individuals, and society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Ãstergaard, K.: Proactive Law â in a Business Environment. (2012), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proactive Law in Legislation ==

An indication that Proactive Law is gaining prominence is the fact that the [[European Commission]] has published an [[opinion]] on Proactive Law.

The EESC urges a [[paradigm]] shift, as the time has come to give up the centuries-old reactive approach to law and to adopt a pro active approach. It is time to look at law in a different way: to look forward rather than back, to focus on how the law is used and oper ates in everyday life and how it is received in the community it seeks to regulate. While responding to and resolving problems remain important, preventing causes of problems is vital, along with serving the needs and facilitating the productive interaction of citizens and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

By its very nature, the Community legal system is precisely the type of area in which the proactive approach should be adopted when planning, drawing up and implementing laws; against this backdrop, the EESC would argue that rules and regu lations are not the only way nor always the best way to achieve the desired objectives; at times, the regulator may best support valuable goals by refraining from regulating and, where appropri ate, encouraging self-regulation and co-regulation. This being the case, the fundamental principles of [[subsidiarity]], [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], [[precaution]] and [[sustainability]] take on new importance and a new dimension.

The EESC believes that the single market can benefit greatly when EU law and its makers â [[legislators]] and administrators in the broadest sense â shift their focus from inward, from inside the legal system, rules and institutions, to outward, to the users of the law: to society, citizens and businesses that the legal system is intended to serve.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

While the transposition and implementation of laws are important steps towards better regulation at EU level, regulatory success should be measured by how the goals are achieved at the level of the users of the law, EU citizens and businesses. The laws should be communicated in ways that are meaningful to their intended audience, first and foremost to those whose behaviour is affected and not just to the relevant institutions and administrators.

The application of the Proactive Law approach should be considered systematically in all lawmaking and implementation within the EU. The EESC strongly believes that by making this approach not only part of the Better Regulation agenda, and but also a priority for legislators and administrators at the EU, national and regional levels, it would be possible to build a strong legal foundation for individuals and businesses to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive Law in a Business Context==

While Proactive Law in general has gained increased attention at the highest legislatory authorities, businesses seem to be the first movers in this developing research field.

When Proactive Law is adapted to businesses the approach is called [[Proactive Contracting]] and Proactive [[Contract Management]]. The idea is that [[Proactive Contracting]] may constitute a sustainable [[competitive advantage]], when implemented thoroughly.

In recent years law has gained increased prominence as a source of competitive advantage to businesses. This prominence originated with the work of scholars and professionals in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. In the US, research of Robert Bird has contributed to the movement of Law as a [[Competitive Advantage]]. 
Robert Bird uses a strategy framework to analyze the attributes of law necessary to obtain a competitive advantage. In Europe, the proactive law movement constitutes the same. 
As contracts and contract law are major components of successful [[R&amp;D]], [[Information technology|IT]], [[operations management]], [[outsourcing]] etc., it is important that the contracts and contracting processes involved are successful. 
In the words of [[Tim Cummins]], [[CEO]] of the IACCM, âcontracts lie at the heart of most business relationships, certainly within Western [[cultures]] and [[economies]], and increasingly among all companies or entities that seek to operate in an international marketâ.&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, T. (2006): Best Practices In Commercial Contracting, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

As international trading grows in value and quantity, it is important for businesses to excel in contracting. Businesses that can manage contracting successfully have a competitive advantage [[ceteris paribus]].

By incorporating both a [[preventive]] and a [[promotive]] focus, the proactive law movement encourages both legal goals, which are often preventiveâand business goals, which tend to be promotive.&lt;ref&gt;Siedel, G. J. &amp; Haapio, H.: Using Proactive Law for Competitive Advantages, (2010) p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt;

By combining these two approaches to reaching goals, businesses take advantage of both the preventive focus and the promotive focus.
[[Tory Higgins]] has developed a [[psychological]] theory called the [[Regulatory Focus Theory]] that focuses on motivations and how people tend to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E. T.: Promotion and Prevention: Regulatory Focus as a Motivational Principle. (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The two different orientations towards goal achievement, which have been recognized by [[Tory Higgins]], are:

(1) a preventive focus that emphasizes [[safety]], [[Legal liability|responsibility]] and [[security]], and

(2) a promotive focus that emphasizes [[hopes]], [[accomplishments]], and [[advancements]].

Thus, the way of businesses to pursuing a goal depends on whether their approach is [[preventive]] or [[promotive]]. According to Mayer and [[Weber]], people with a preventive focus view goals as minimal targets that produce a low-intensity response when the goal is achieved.  On the other hand, people with a promotive approach see goals as maximal targets. Thus, âachievement of the goal results in feelings of high-intensity happiness instead of low-intensity calmâ.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, K. J. &amp; Weber, L.: Unpacking Contract Capabilities: Shaping Behavior by Implementing Appropriate Contract Framing, (2009) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

If businesses succeed in incorporating both the preventive and promotive approach in reaching their goals, they may able to utilize the advantages of both legal and business goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/da/studentprojects/overcoming-the-challenges-of-future-contracting-through-the-use-of-proactive-law(7972282c-715c-47cc-911e-d32775a8ed2f).html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054654/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/da/studentprojects/overcoming-the-challenges-of-future-contracting-through-the-use-of-proactive-law(7972282c-715c-47cc-911e-d32775a8ed2f).html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychological biblical criticism''' &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051212143640/http://www.aramaicnt.org/site/index.php?mode=article&amp;entry=95 Psychological Biblical Criticism: An exciting hermeneutic in the study of Scripture]&lt;/ref&gt; is a re-emerging field within [[biblical criticism]] that seeks to examine the psychological dimensions of scripture through the use of the [[behavioral science]]s. The title itself involves a discussion about "the intersections of three fields: [[psychology]], the Bible, and the tradition of rigorous, critical reading of the biblical text." (Kille, 2001). Known figures within biblical scholarship advocating this interdisciplinary field in the United States include [[Rev. D. Andrew Kille]] (2001; 2004), [[J. Harold Ellens]] (2004), [[Wayne G. Rollins]] (1983; 1999; 2004), and, in Europe, [[Eugen Drewermann]] (Beier, 2004), [[Gerd Theissen]] (1983, 1987, 2007).

Rollins was the first to define psychological biblical criticism as having the [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] intent of examining
{{quote|"... texts, their origination, authorship, modes of expression, their construction, transmission, translation, reading, interpretation, their transposition into kindred and alien forms, and the history of their personal and cultural effect, as expressions of the structure, processes, and habits of the human psyche, both in individual and collective manifestations, past and present." (1999:77â78)}}

==The worlds of Scripture==
Unlike many other forms of [[biblical criticism]], psychological biblical criticism is not a particular ''method'' for interpretation, but is rather a ''perspective'' (Kille, 2001). This approach to the biblical text seeks to complement studies on the cultural, sociological, and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] influences on scripture, by discussing the psychological dimensions of: the authors of the text, the material they wish to communicate to their audience, and the reflections and meditations of the reader. As a result, the material under study involves three dimensions of text (Rollins, 1983; Kille, 2001; 2004). 

===The world ''behind'' the text===
What was the author of the text thinking? What was their background, why were they writing? What situations drove them to put pen to paper and produce this work? What is the cultural, historical, and social context of the text? Although traditional uses of psychological theory in the study of ancient texts have sought to generate a complete psychoanalysis of scriptural writers, there has always been the hindrance of temporal and cultural distance between the analyst and analysand. Psychological biblical criticism best serves not as a [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] tool, but as another heuristic for use alongside traditional methods of historical and cultural criticism, illuminating aspects of purpose and meaning in the language and cognition of texts (Kille, 2001: 22â23; 2004: 23â25). In essence, a study of the world behind the text involves such questions as "... what makes them write the way they do and what realities, truths, and insights they want to share with us." (Rollins, 1983: 99).

===The world ''of'' the text===
Why did [[King Saul]] decide try to skewer [[David]]âhis greatest warriorâwith a spear? Why did [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] hand [[Jesus]] over? What is the meaning of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] Chapter 1? To analyze the world of the text is to "describe the qualities of a character as he or she is presented in the text" (Kille, 2001:24), their actions and relationships, as well as develop insight into the motivations the writer has programmed into them. Kille in particular warns that one should be wary of trying to reach beyond the world of the text to the actual historical persons, since one may accidentally perform the function of [[eisegesis]] rather than [[exegesis]]. The world of the text may also shine light on the conditions and intent of the writer. On the one hand the characters and events within the text may reflect more the writer's socio-cultural situation than actual events, while at the same time they may inform us as to what the writer desires from usâtransformation, repentance, enlightenment, etc. (Kille, 2004).

===The world ''in front of'' the text===
{{quote|"... we often come to Scripture with the question 'What is this book?', but discover that this book asks us, 'Who is this that reads it?' ... Each of us carries... a set of values, a list of personal problems, a well seasoned worldview, and a large dose of humanity, wherever we go and to whatever task we undertake. When we approach Scripture we come with the same baggage. It is not possible to come in any other way."|sign=Wayne G. Rollins, 1983:98}}

How do I approach the text? What does the text ask of me? How do I respond to it? What meaning do I give to this relationship? The world in front of the text discusses the interplay between the text before our very eyes and the [[Eisegesis|eisegetical]] processes that take place within our mind. In this exchange the interest is not in the psychological world of the writer, or the original meaning of the text and the characters displayed, but in how the reader manipulates, interprets, and is filled by the text; how they make it relevant to their lives, how it "speaks" to them, and how this relationship reflects their personal world (Rollins 1983: 97â100; Kille, 2001: 25â27; 2004: 27â29).

==The Bible and psychology in transition==
{{quote|"Psychology and Biblical studies are thus inevitably interlinked, regardless of what the immediate focus or concern of either is. Hence, whether we are exploring the biblical text or the living human document, the mutual illumination of psychology and biblical studies is imperative because a properly enlightened anthropology is required for both ... Because both disciplines deal with the psycho-spiritual domains, neither of these can ignore the other or it is not adequately serious about itself."|sign=[[J. Harold Ellens]], 2004:284}}

A psychological study of the [[hermeneutical]] levels of religious texts has the capability of granting a better understanding not only of the text itself, but also of the mind that produced it, the mind that it describes, and the mind that interacts with it. This knowledge has promise for interdisciplinary application as well, by informing the field of [[religious studies]], the [[psychotherapeutic encounter]], and the [[psychology of religion]]. Hence, proponents of psychological biblical criticism argue that it has the potential of crossing the gap between psychology and religion, providing a platform for dialogue without reducing religion to mere drives and internal objects, but by discussing the aspects of this very human mode of meaning ([[J. Harold Ellens|Ellens]], 2004).

[[File:SimpleDiagramPyrolysis.png|alt=Simplified Pyrolysis chemistry on burning wood|thumb|400x400px|Simplified depiction of pyrolysis chemistry]]
'''Pyrolysis''' is the [[thermal]] [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/P/P04961.html |title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology |accessdate=2018-01-10 |year=2009 |page=1824 |publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the change of [[chemical composition]] and is irreversible. The word is coined from the [[Greek language|Greek]]-derived [[morpheme|element]]s ''pyro'' "fire" and ''[[lysis]]'' "separating".

Pyrolysis is most commonly used to the treatment of [[organic compound|organic]] materials. It is one of the processes involved in [[charring]] wood.&lt;ref name=inno&gt;[http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html ''Burning of wood''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209095142/http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html |date=2010-02-09 }}, InnoFireWood's website. Accessed on 2010-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, pyrolysis of organic substances produces volatile products and leaves a solid residue enriched in carbon, [[char]]. Extreme pyrolysis, which leaves mostly [[carbon]] as the residue, is called [[carbonization]].

The process is used heavily in the [[chemical industry]], for example, to produce [[ethylene]], many forms of [[carbon]], and other chemicals from petroleum, coal, and even wood, to produce [[coke (fuel)|coke]] from [[coal]].  Aspirational applications of pyrolysis would convert [[biomass]] into [[syngas]] and [[biochar]],  waste plastics back into usable oil, or waste into safely disposable substances.

==Process terminology and mechanism==
Special cases of pyrolysis include [[dry distillation]], [[destructive distillation]], [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]], and [[thermal depolymerization]].  It generally involves the breaking of chemical bonds in molecules to give smaller molecules; but may also leave residues with larger molecular mass.  The phenomenon involves exceeding the [[decomposition temperature]] of the material.

Pyrolysis differs from other processes like [[combustion]] and [[hydrolysis]] in that it usually does not involve the addition of other reagents such as [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in combustion) or water (in hydrolysis).&lt;ref&gt;Cory A. Kramer, Reza Loloee, Indrek S. Wichman and Ruby N. Ghosh, 2009, [http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1638571 Time Resolved Measurements of Pyrolysis Products From Thermoplastic Poly-Methyl-Methacrylate (PMMA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106220719/http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1638571 |date=2014-11-06 }} ''ASME 2009 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition''&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, it is often not practical to achieve completely O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- or water-free conditions, especially as pyrolysis is often conducted on complex mixtures.  The term has also been applied to the decomposition of organic material in the presence of [[superheated water]] or steam ([[hydrous pyrolysis]]), for example, in the [[Cracking (chemistry)|steam cracking]] of oil. Pyrolysis has been assumed to take place during [[catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]], the conversion of [[kerogen|buried organic matter]] to [[fossil fuels]]. 

Conversely, the starting material may be heated in a [[vacuum]] to decrease the [[boiling point]] of the byproducts and avoid adverse chemical reactions. An example is the process of [[flash vacuum pyrolysis]] used in [[organic synthesis]].

Volatile pyrolysis byproducts can be [[Chemical analysis|analyzed]] through separation by [[gas chromatography]] and identification by [[mass spectrometry]], a process known as [[pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry|Py-GC-MS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Goodacre, R.; Kell, D. B.|title=Pyrolysis mass spectrometry and its applications in biotechnology|journal=Curr. Opin. Biotechnol.|year=1996|volume=7||pages= 20-28|doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(96)80090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Peacock, P. M.; McEwen, C. N.|title=Mass Spectrometry of Synthetic Polymers. Anal. Chem.|year=2006|volume=78|pages=3957-3964|doi=10.1021/ac0606249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrolysis is also used in [[carbon-14 dating]].

== Occurrence and uses ==
===Ethylene===
Pyrolysis is used to produce [[ethylene]], the chemical compound produced on the largest scale industrially (&gt;110 million tons/year in 2005).  In this process, hydrocarbons from petroleum are heated to around 600 Â°C in the presence of steam, i.e. [[steam cracking]].  The resulting ethylene is used to make antifreeze ([[ethylene glycol]]), PVC (via [[vinyl chloride]]), and many polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene.&lt;ref name=UllmannEthylene&gt;{{cite book |first1=Heinz |last1=Zimmermann |first2=Roland |last2=Walz |chapter=Ethylene |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2008 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_045.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars ===
Carbon and carbon-rich materials have desirable properties but are nonvolatile, even at high temperatures.  Consequently, pyrolysis is used to produce many kinds of carbon; these can be used for fuel, as reagents in steelmaking (coke), and as structural materials.

High temperature pyrolysis is used on an industrial scale to convert [[coal]] into [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for [[metallurgy]], especially [[steelmaking]].  Volatile products are often useful, including [[benzene]] and [[pyridine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Ludwig Briesemeister, Andreas GeiÃler, Stefan Halama, Stephan Herrmann, Ulrich Kleinhans, Markus Steibel, Markus Ulbrich, Alan W. Scaroni, M. Rashid Khan, Semih Eser, Ljubisa R. Radovic|title=Coal Pyrolysis|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim| doi=10.1002/14356007.a07_245.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coke can also be produced from the solid residue left from petroleum refining.
[[File:CoalPyrolysisProducts.png|thumb|290px|Typical organic products obtained by pyrolysis of coal (X = CH, N).]]
The coke-making or "coking" process consists of heating the material in "coking ovens" to very high temperatures (up to {{convert|900|C|F|disp=or|sigfig=2}}) so that those molecules are broken down into lighter volatile substances, which leave the vessel, and a porous but hard residue that is mostly carbon and inorganic ash. The amount of volatiles varies with the source material, but is typically 25â30% of it by weight.

The original [[xylem|vascular structure]] of the wood and the pores created by escaping gases combine to produce a light and porous material. By starting with a dense wood-like material, such as [[nutshell]]s or [[peach]] [[endocarp|stone]]s, one obtains a form of charcoal with particularly fine pores (and hence a much larger pore surface area), called [[activated carbon]], which is used as an [[adsorption|adsorbent]] for a wide range of chemical substances.

[[Biochar]] is the residue of incomplete organic pyrolysis, e.g., from cooking fires.  They are a key component of the [[terra preta]] soils associated with ancient [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] communities of the [[Amazon basin]].&lt;ref name="lehmann1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Terra preta is much sought by local farmers for its superior fertility and capacity to promote and retain an enhanced suite of beneficial microbiota than the typical red soil of the region.  Efforts are underway to recreate these soils through [[biochar]], the solid residue of pyrolysis of various materials, mostly organic waste.

[[Carbon fiber]]s are filaments of carbon that can be used to make very strong yarns and textiles. Carbon fiber items are often produced by spinning and weaving the desired item from fibers of a suitable [[polymer]], and then pyrolyzing the material at a high temperature (from {{convert|1500|-|3000|Â°C|F|disp=or|sigfig=3}}).  The first carbon fibers were made from [[rayon]], but [[polyacrylonitrile]] has become the most common starting material.  For their first workable [[electric lamp]]s, [[Joseph Wilson Swan]] and [[Thomas Edison]] used carbon filaments made by pyrolysis of [[cotton]] yarns and [[bamboo]] splinters, respectively.

Pyrolysis is the reaction used to coat a preformed substrate with a layer of [[pyrolytic carbon]]. This is typically done in a fluidized bed reactor heated to {{convert|1000|-|2000|Â°C|F|disp=or|sigfig=3}}. Pyrolytic carbon coatings are used in many applications, including [[artificial heart valve]]s.&lt;ref name="ratner"&gt;Ratner, Buddy D. (2004). Pyrolytic carbon.

Pyrolysis is the basis of several methods for producing fuel from [[biomass]], i.e. [[lignocellulosic biomass]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, G.

Retrieved on 2009-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Crops studied as biomass feedstock for pyrolysis include native North American prairie grasses such as [[Panicum virgatum|''switchgrass'']] and bred versions of other grasses such as [[Miscanthus giganteus|''Miscantheus giganteus'']]. Other sources of [[organic matter]] as feedstock for pyrolysis include greenwaste, sawdust, waste wood, nut shells, straw, cotton trash, rice hulls. Animal waste including poultry litter, dairy manure, and potentially other manures are also under evaluation. Some industrial byproducts are also suitable feedstock including paper sludge and distillers grain.&lt;ref name=bestEnergiesBestPyrol&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher efficiency is sometimes achieved by '''flash pyrolysis''', in which finely divided feedstock is quickly heated to between {{convert|350|and|500|Â°C|F|sigfig=2}} for less than two seconds. 

The low quality of oils produced through pyrolysis can be improved by physical and chemical processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=Jerome|last2=Brown|first2=Richard|last3=Rainey|first3=Thomas|title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels|journal=Energies|date=1 July 2015|volume=8|pages=6765â6794|doi=10.3390/en8076765}}&lt;/ref&gt; which might drive up production costs, but may make sense economically as circumstances change. 

There is also the possibility of integrating with other processes such as [[mechanical biological treatment]] and [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A. T. &amp; Morris, J. M.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Fuel bio-oil can also be produced by [[hydrous pyrolysis]].

=== Semiconductors ===
The process of [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]] (MOCVD) entails pyrolysis of volatile organometallic compounds to give semiconductors, hard coatings, and other applicable materials.  The reactions entail thermal degradation of precursors, with deposition of the inorganic component and release of the hydrocarbons as gaseous waste. Since it is an atom-by-atom deposition, these atoms organize themselves into crystals to form the bulk semiconductor. Silicon chips are produced by the pyrolysis of silane:
:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  â  Si  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Gallium arsenide]], another semiconductor, forms upon co-pyrolysis of [[trimethylgallium]] and [[arsine]].

=== Recycling===
{{See also|Thermal Depolymerisation}}
Pyrolysis can also be used to treat plastic waste.  The main advantage is the reduction in volume of the waste.  In principle, pyrolysis will regenerate the monomers (precursors) to the polymers that are treated, but in practice the process is neither a clean nor an economically competitive source of monomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Walter |last1=Kaminsky |title=Plastics, Recycling |encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2000 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a21_057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.J.

==Fine chemical synthesis==
Pyrolysis is used in the production of chemical compounds, mainly, but not only, in the research laboratory.  

The area of boron-hydride clusters started with the study of the pyrolysis of [[diborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) at ca. 200 Â°C.  Products include the clusters  [[pentaborane]] and [[decaborane]].  These pyrolyses involve not only cracking (to give H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but also re[[condensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}} gives Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan (1997).

==History==
Pyrolysis has been used for turning wood into [[charcoal]] since ancient times. Many important chemical substances, such as [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfuric acid]], were first obtained by this process. In their embalming process, the ancient Egyptians used methanol, which they obtained from the pyrolysis of wood.  The dry distillation of wood remained the major source of methanol into the early 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authors=E. Fiedler, G. Grossmann, D. B. Kersebohm, G.

"On Queer of Color Criticism, Communication Studies, and Corporeality. ''Kaleidoscope: A Graduate Journal of Qualitative Communication Research ''14 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In his critique of canonical sociology, Ferguson argues that racialized heteronormativity and heteropatriarchy has played a conspicuous role in shaping sociology and social policy, and recognizes its intersection with revolutionary nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Albertine, Susan. "Aberrations in Black: Toward a Queer of Color Critique (Book Review)." ''American Literature ''77.3 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Queer of color critique operates as a method for building unlikely coalitions across different identity categories. In framing queer of color critique, Ferguson draws from [[Barbara Smith]] and the [[Combahee River Collective|Combahee River Collective's]] use of coalitional politics to address gender, race, and sexuality in context with capitalist expansion.

== Influences  ==

Queer of color critique has been taken up by multiple scholars as an attempt at a more intersectional framework on which to build and extend their work in various, sometimes intersecting academic subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MuÃ±oz, JosÃ©Â Esteban. Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queerness and indigeneity ===

Though most references at the intersection of queerness and indigeneity fall on [[Two-Spirit]] identity and ideas surrounding it, queer of color critique extends the discussion to settler colonialism, future potentialities of Native identity and life, and general discourse about how [[Native American studies|Native Studies]] as an academic study can benefit from a sort of "queering". According to scholar [[Andrea Smith (academic)|Andrea Smith]], looking at indigeneity from this perspective questions the limitations of a "subjectless" or "postidentity" analysis in regards to the shedding of a particular ethnic identity, which in itself has roots in colonialist and nationalist ideology. On the other hand, even this sort of critique does not fully acknowledge the extent of the absence of indigeneity in the context of direct and indirect investment in settler colonialism by those of color doing the critiquing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Smith, Andrea. "Queer Theory and Native Studies: The Heteronormativity of Settler Colonialism." GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 16.1-2 (2010): 41-68. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgensen, Scott Lauria. ''Spaces between Us: Queer Settler Colonialism and Indigenous Decolonization''. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== De-colonial Studies ===
The unraveling of colonialist ideology,âthe belief in a normative societyâaccording to scholar [[Emma Perez]], is necessary to fully understand national histories and identities, specifically of queer individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez|first=Emma|date=2003|title=Queering the Borderlands: The Challenges of Excavating the Invisible and Unheard|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/50898|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=24|pages=122â131|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queer diasporic critique ===

Queer [[Diaspora|diasporic]] critique can be considered an extension of and complement to queer of color critique in that it considers ethnic and cultural identity as an underlying context when analyzing and critiquing arguments based on [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], white centered [[Queer theory|queer theories]], as well as critiquing the heteronormativity of [[area studies]]. Oftentimes, these ideas are connected to ideas of [[nationhood]] and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puar|first=Jasbir K.|date=2008-06-01|title='the Turban Is Not a Hat': Queer Diaspora and Practices of Profiling|journal=Sikh Formations|volume=4|issue=1|pages=47â91|doi=10.1080/17448720802075439|issn=1744-8727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lesk, Andrew. "Queerly Canadian: An Introductory Reader in Sexuality Studies Ed. by Maureen FitzGerald and Scott Rayter (review)." ''University of Toronto Quarterly''. University of Toronto Press, 28 Oct. 2015. Web. 29 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of scholar [[Gayatri Gopinath]], "While both queer of color and queer diasporic analysis are part of a collective endeavor to reshape queer studies through a thorough engagement with questions of race, nationalism, and transnationalism, it may also be useful to explore some of the points at which the interventions and emphases of each project both intersect and diverge." In this respect, critique emphasizing diaspora tends to focus more on a "global restructuring of capital and its attendant gender and sexual hierarchies" and the creation of "home" in regards to diaspora and [[transnationalism]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gopinath, Gayatri. "Bollywood Spectacles: Queer Diasporic Critique in the Aftermath of 9/11." Social Text 23.3-4 84-85 (2005): 157-69. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Queer Muslims ====

An example of queer of color critique in practice can be seen in the analysis of queer Muslims in Europe done by scholar [[Fatima El-Tayeb]], which touches on the larger themes explored in [[queer theory]]. Among these is the idea of "[[Coming out|coming-out]]" as a person of diaspora, which challenges the currently held notion of its role in the creation of a "normative, healthy and desirable LGBT identity". Another describes how the idea of [[Islamophobia]] permeates into the [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] oppressions faced by queer Muslims in the west. The ideas of migration and "home" are also critiqued in that the ethnic migrant laborer lives amongst an "increasingly segregated, criminalized and policed multi-ethnic population of color". These queer diasporic and queer of color critiques therefore act as a lens through which to view homonormativity and the various facets through which is functions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;El-Tayeb, F. "'Gays Who Cannot Properly Be Gay': Queer Muslims in the Neoliberal European City." European Journal of Women's Studies 19.1 (2012): 79-95. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Puar, Jasbir K. Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer times. Durham, NC: Duke UP, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a type of community manifestation of this type of critique, the queer of color activist group [[Strange Fruit: A Dutch Queer Collective]] takes an intersectional, colored approach to queer activism. This helps undermine binaries such as the "Muslim/European dichotomy to the normative coming out narrative", which, according to [[Fatima El-Tayeb|El-Tayeb]], perpetuate homonormativity and racism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Philosophical problems ==
Some of the problems considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] are the following:

*Explain the effectiveness of mathematics in the study of the physical world: "At this point an enigma presents itself which in all ages has agitated inquiring minds. How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?" â[[Albert Einstein]], in ''Geometry and Experience'' (1921).&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]], [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Einstein_geometry.html Geometry and Experience].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Clearly delineate mathematics and physics: For some results or discoveries, it is difficult to say to which area they belong: to the mathematics or to physics.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre BergÃ©, [https://books.google.com/books?id=umFTtQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Des+rythmes+au+chaos%22&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=65aEU7LAKeHL8AHc74HwBg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Des rythmes au chaos].&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is the geometry of physical space?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Carl Hatfield|title=The Natural and the Normative: Theories of Spatial Perception from Kant to Helmholtz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JikeeDbYeUQC&amp;pg=PA223|year=1990|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-08086-6|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is the origin of the axioms of mathematics?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gila Hanna|author2=Hans Niels Jahnke|author3=Helmut Pulte|title=Explanation and Proof in Mathematics: Philosophical and Educational Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bLHye8kSAwC&amp;pg=PA29|date=4 December 2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-0576-5|pages=29â30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Is arithmetic ''a priori'' or synthetic? (from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], see [[Analyticâsynthetic distinction]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Van Cleve Professor of Philosophy Brown University|title=Problems from Kant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6WHAgt-Mg1AC&amp;pg=PA22|date=16 July 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-534701-2|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is essentially different between doing a physical experiment to see the result and making a mathematical calculation to see the result?

*Do [[GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems]] imply that physical theories will always be incomplete? (from [[Stephen Hawking]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pavel|last=PudlÃ¡k|title=Logical Foundations of Mathematics and Computational Complexity: A Gentle Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=obxDAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA659|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-319-00119-7|page=659}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawking.org.uk/godel-and-the-end-of-physics.html Stephen Hawking. "Godel and the End of the Universe"]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is math invented or discovered? (millennium-old question, raised among others by [[Mario Livio]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Mario Livio | authorlink = Mario Livio| doi =  | title = Why math works? | journal = Scientific American | volume =  | pages = 80â83 | year = August 2011 | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-math-works/| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
In recent times the two disciplines have most often been taught separately, despite all the interrelations between physics and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Karam; Pospiech; &amp; Pietrocola (2010). "[http://www.univ-reims.fr/site/evenement/girep-icpe-mptl-2010-reims-international-conference/gallery_files/site/1/90/4401/22908/29476/30505.pdf Mathematics in physics lessons: developing structural skills]"&lt;/ref&gt; This led some professional mathematicians who were also interested in [[mathematics education]], such as [[Felix Klein]], [[Richard Courant]], [[Vladimir Arnold]] and [[Morris Kline]], to strongly advocate teaching mathematics in a way more closely related to the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Stakhov "[http://www2.fisica.unlp.edu.ar/materias/algebralineal/documentos/mathharm.pdf Diracâs Principle of Mathematical Beauty, Mathematics of Harmony]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Lesh|author2=Peter L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5135">The '''Savory brittleness scale''' is used to describe the position on a simple 1 to 10 scale of any environment based upon the distribution of humidity throughout each year, to assist with management decisions. It was developed by [[Allan Savory]], a [[Zimbabwe]]an biologist, because scientists were only recognizing desertification taking place in low rainfall or âfragileâ environments. Savory recognized that desertification was the extreme or terminal form of man-made [[land degradation]], but that this began with simple biodiversity loss that was occurring at all levels of rainfall from high to low. Fragile environments did not cover the situation because Savory thought all environments were fragile. The scale is used in land management because the annual distribution of humidity affects the way entire biological communities function on the land, and in particular to conservation or resting the environment to maintain or restore biodiversity. He also noted that the distribution of humidity and thus position on the brittleness scale influenced the effects of such things as fire and grazing by large herbivores.

==Scale==

The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with 1 being non-brittle and 10 being very brittle. The scale is subjective; there is no formula for its calculation. A [[tropical rainforest]] is considered a 1 on the scale, and an arid [[desert]] such as the [[Namib]] or [[Gobi]] is considered a 10.

Position on the scale is determined not from rainfall records but from field observation because humidity is influenced by several factors such as altitude or prevailing winds. Savory used the term brittleness because an easy practical observation is whether or not a dead grass stem or small dead twig is soft and easily bent by hand or so brittle it snaps. For these reasons it differs from an  [[aridity index]]. Thus, some high rainfall environments, e.g., Zambia, with 2,000&amp;nbsp;mm annual rainfall and distinct wet and dry seasons, is higher on the brittleness scale because of the long portions of the year without rainfall. An environment with lower total rainfall distributed fairly evenly throughout the year, such as parts of England with 600&amp;nbsp;mm annually, are lower on the brittleness scale.

==Effect of brittleness==

Grass leaves and stems that die off above ground every year following the growing season break down slowly and mainly through oxidation in sunlight and physical weathering in the more brittle environments. And trees dying in such environments tend to remain standing for many years again gradually breaking down through oxidation and weathering from the top down. At the opposite end of the scale where humidity distribution is more even dead plant material tends to break down rapidly through high micro-organism activity or biological decay. Commonly a dead tree will decay at the base, fall and decay on the ground. Other observations Savory made were that at the lower end of the scale most herbivores naturally were insects with few large herbivores and solitary predators, while moving toward the higher end large herding herbivores and pack-hunting predators increased.

The effect of resting the environment to allow recovery and maintenance of biodiversity is different across the brittleness scale. At the low end resting the environment as in establishing wilderness or conservation is the most powerful action possible to restore biodiversity. Moving across the scale the same practice can become increasingly damaging to the health of entire communities. This is why Savory argued that abandoned cities of past ages low on the scale are today found under recovered tropical forest, while abandoned cities at the other end in former savannas are today found under desert sands. Total protection by removing all livestock leads to recovery of biodiversity in the perennially humid environments in the US, but the same practice in places such as New Mexico has led to severe desertification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6874">The '''Wayne State University School of Information Sciences (SIS)''' is a school of [[information science]] at [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit]].  Prior to August 2017, the school was known as the School of Library and Information Science. The school has been accredited by the [[American Library Association]] since 1967 and offers programs leading to master's degrees in both library and information science and the science of information management.  In 2017, the school was ranked 22nd by the [[U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Global University Ranking]] among library and information science studies programs.

==History==
The school dates to 1918 when the Detroit Normal Training School, as Wayne was then known, began offering librarianship classes.  In the 1930s, the school's teacher training program began issuing bachelor's degrees with a minor in library science.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

In 1967, Wayne's library and information science program, then part of Wayne's College of Education, was accredited by the American Library Association to grant master's degrees in library and information science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School of Library and Information Science|publisher=Wayne State University|accessdate=March 26, 2018|url=https://wayne.edu/facts/2016/schools-colleges/lis/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Wayne's library and information science program gained independence as the Library and Information Science Program.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; Robert Holley served as the director of the program from approximately 1993 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Holley|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=August 16, 1999|page=2B|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18671093/robert_holley/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Patricia Senn Breivik. She, in turn, was succeeded by Joseph J. Mika.

In 1997, Wayne opened a new 300,000-square foot undergraduate library, built at a cost of $37-million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A place for undergrads: Wayne State's newest library will aim for informed beginnings|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=August 27, 1997|page=3B|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18671435/a_place_for_undergrads_wayne_states/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program became the School of Library and Information Science in 2009.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the School|publisher=Wayne State University|accessdate=March 23, 2018|url=http://sis.wayne.edu/about/history.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, the school changed its name to the School of Information Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: SLIS is now the School of Information Sciences|publisher=Wayne State University|date=August 21, 2017|url=http://sis.wayne.edu/news.php?id=26979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandra Yee was the school's dean from 2001 until her retirement in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandra (Sandy) Yee|publisher=[[OCLC|OCLC Online Computer Library Center]]|accessdate=March 26, 2018|url=https://www.oclc.org/en/about/leadership/profiles/yee-sandra.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandra Yee|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=March 26, 2018|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=60041459&amp;privcapId=957934&amp;previousCapId=278614&amp;previousTitle=HUNTINGTON%20BANCSHARES%20INC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Yee spoke in opposition to the Patriot Act, arguing that it "could have a chilling effect on research and intellectual freedom, which are critical to our nationâs freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miller Canfield, Wayne State University Present "The Impact of the USA PATRIOT Act on the University"|publisher=Miller Canfield|date=September 8, 2004|url=https://www.millercanfield.com/newsevents-news-569.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jon Cawthorn was appointed as dean of the school effective August 1, 2017. Cawthorn was previously the dean of libraries at [[West Virginia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jon E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25916">A '''sensory cue''' is a statistic or signal that can be extracted from the sensory input by a perceiver, that indicates the state of some property of the world that the perceiver is interested in perceiving.

A cue is some organization of the data present in the signal which allows for meaningful extrapolation. For example, [[Senses|sensory]] cues include visual cues, auditory cues, haptic cues, olfactory cues and environmental cues. Sensory cues are a fundamental part of theories of perception, especially theories of appearance (how things look).

== Concept ==
There are two primary theory sets used to describe the roles of sensory cues in perception. One set of theories are based on the Constructivist theory of perception, while the others are based on the Ecological theory.

Basing his views on the Constructivist theory of perception, [[Helmholtz]] (1821-1894) held that the visual system constructs visual percepts through a process of ''[[unconscious inference]]'', in which cues are used to make probabilistic inferences about the state of the world. These inferences are based on prior experience, assuming that the most commonly correct interpretation of a cue will continue to hold true.&lt;ref name="Perception of Space 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=edited by William Epstein, Sheena|title=Perception of space and motion|year=1995|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=0080538614|pages=3â5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A visual [[Perception#Process and terminology|percept]] is the final manifestation of this process. [[Egon Brunswik|Brunswik]] (1903-1955) later went on to formalize these concepts with the ''lens model'', which breaks the system's use of a cue into two parts: the [[ecological validity (perception)|ecological validity]] of the cue, which is its likelihood of correlating with a property of the world, and the system's ''utilization'' of the cue.&lt;ref name="Perception of Space 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=edited by William Epstein, Sheena|title=Perception of space and motion|year=1995|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=0080538614|pages=5â7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these theories, accurate perception requires both the existence of cues with sufficiently high ecological validity to make inference possible, and that the system actually utilizes these cues in an appropriate fashion during the construction of percepts.

A second set of theories was posited by [[James J. Gibson|Gibson]] (1904-1979), based on the Ecological theory of perception. These theories held that no inferences are necessary to accomplish accurate perception. Rather, the visual system is able to take in sufficient cues related to objects and their surroundings. This means that a one:one mapping between the incoming cues and the environment they represent can be made. These mappings will be shaped by certain computational constraints; traits known to be common in an organism's environment.&lt;ref name="Perception of Space 3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=edited by William Epstein, Sheena|title=Perception of space and motion|year=1995|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=0080538614|pages=7â9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate result is the same: a visual precept is manifested by the process.

''Cue combination'' is an active area of research in [[perception]], that seeks to understand how information from multiple sources is combined by the brain to create a single perceptual experience or response.  Recent [[cue recruitment]] experiments have shown that the adult human visual system can learn to utilize new cues through [[classical conditioning|classical (Pavlovian) conditioning]].

== Visual cues ==

Visual cues are sensory cues received by the [[eye]] in the form of light and processed by the [[visual system]] during [[visual perception]]. Since the visual system is dominant in many species, especially humans, visual cues are a large source of information in how the world is [[Perception|perceived]].&lt;ref name="VisualDominance"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Posner|first=Michael I.|author2=Nissen, Mary J. |author3=Klein, Raymond M. |title=Visual dominance: An information-processing account of its origins and significance.|journal=Psychological Review|date=March 1976|volume=83|issue=2|pages=157â171|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.83.2.157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of cues ===

==== Depth ====
{{Main|Depth perception}}
The ability to perceive the world in three dimensions and estimate the size and distance to an object depends heavily on depth cues. The two major depth cues, [[Stereopsis]] and motion parallax, both rely on [[parallax]] which is the difference between the perceived position of an object given two different viewpoints. In stereopsis the distance between the eyes is the source of the two different viewpoints, resulting in a [[Binocular disparity]]. Motion parallax relies head and body movement to produce the necessary viewpoints.&lt;ref name="Binocular Vision"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Steinman | first=Scott B. | last2=Garzia | first2=Ralph Philip | year=2000 | title=Foundations of Binocular Vision: A Clinical perspective |  publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn=0-8385-2670-5 | pages=2&amp;ndash;5 | ref=harv | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Motion ====
{{Main|Motion perception}}
The visual system can detect motion both using a simple mechanism based on information from multiple clusters of neurons as well as by aggregate through by integrating multiple cues including contrast, form, and texture. One major source of visual information when determining self-motion is [[optic flow]]. Optic flow not only indicates whether an agent is moving but in which direction and at what relative speed.

===== Biological motion =====
{{Main|Biological motion}}
Humans in particular have evolved a particularly keen ability to detect if motion is being generated by biological source, even with '''point light displays''' where dots representing the joints of an animal.&lt;ref name="Biological Motion"&gt;{{cite journal| author=G. Johansson | title=Visual perception of biological motion and a model for its analysis | journal=Percept. Psychophys. | volume=14 | year=1973 | pages=201â211| doi=10.3758/BF03212378| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests that this mechanism can also reveal the gender, emotional state, and action of a given human light point model.&lt;ref name="Point Light Displays"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alaerts|first=Kaat|author2=Nackaerts, Evelien |author3=Meyns, Pieter |author4=Swinnen, Stephan P. |author5=Wenderoth, Nicole |author6= Valdes-Sosa, Mitchell |title=Action and Emotion Recognition from Point Light Displays: An Investigation of Gender Differences|journal=PLoS ONE|date=June 9, 2011|volume=6|issue=6|pages=e20989|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0020989 |pmid=21695266 |pmc=3111458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Color ====
{{Main|Color vision}}
The ability to distinguish between colors allows an organism quickly and easily recognize danger since [[Aposematism|many brightly colored plants and animals pose some kind of threat]], usually harboring some kind of toxin. Color also serves as an inferential cue that can [[Priming (psychology)|prime]] both motor action&lt;ref name="Schmidt13"&gt;Schmidt, T.: ''The finger in flight: Real-time motor control by visually masked color stimuli.'' In: ''Psychological Science'', Nr. 13, 2002, S. 112-118.&lt;/ref&gt; and interpretation of a persuasive message.&lt;ref name="Threat cues"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerend|first=Mary A.|author2=Sias, Tricia |title=Message framing and color priming: How subtle threat cues affect persuasion|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=July 2009|volume=45|issue=4|pages=999â1002|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2009.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Contrast =====
{{Main|Contrast (vision)}}
Contrast, or the difference in luminance and/or color that helps make an object distinguishable, is important in [[edge detection]] and serves as a cue.

== Auditory Cues ==
An auditory cue is a sound signal that represents an incoming sign received through the ears, causing the brain to hear. The results of receiving and processing these cues are collectively known as the sense of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]],  and are the subject of research within the fields of [[psychology]], [[Cognitive Science|cognitive science]], and [[neurobiology]].

=== Auditory system ===
{{Main|Hearing}}
The auditory system of humans and animals allows individuals to assimilate information from the surroundings, represented as sound waves. Sound waves first pass through the [[pinnae]] and the auditory canal, the parts of the ear that comprise the outer ear.  Sound then reaches the tympanic membrane in the [[Middle Ear|middle ear]] (also known as the eardrum). The tympanic membrane sets the [[malleus]], [[incus]], and [[stapes]] into vibration. The stapes transmits these vibrations to the [[inner ear]] by pushing on the membrane covering the [[oval window]], which separates the middle and inner ear. The inner ear contains the [[cochlea]], the liquid-filled structure containing the hair cells. These cells serve to transform the incoming vibration to electrical signals, which can then be transmitted to the brain.
The auditory nerve carries the signal generated by the hair cells away from the inner ear and towards the auditory receiving area in the cortex. The signal then travels through fibers to several subcortical structures and then to the primary [[Primary auditory cortex|auditory receiving area]] in the temporal lobe

=== Cues for sound locating ===
Humans use several cues to determine the location of a given stimuli, mainly by using the timing difference between ears. These cues allow individuals to identify both the elevation, the height of the stimuli relative to the individual, and [[azimuth]], the angle of the sound relative to the direction the individual is facing.

==== Interaural time and level difference ====
Unless a sound is directly in front of or behind the individual, the sound stimuli will have a slightly different distance to travel to reach each ear. This difference in distance causes a slight delay in the time the signal is perceived by each ear. The magnitude of the interaural time difference is greater the more the signal comes from the side of the head. Thus, this time delay allows humans to accurately predict the location of incoming sound cues. Interaural level difference is caused by the difference in sound pressure level reaching the two ears. This is because the head blocks the sound waves for the further ear, causing less intense sound to reach it. This level difference between the two ears allows humans to accurately predict azimuth of an auditory signal. This effect only occurs at sounds that are high frequency.

==== Spectral cue ====
A spectral cue is a monaural (single ear) cue for locating incoming sounds based on the distribution of the incoming signal. The differences in distribution (or spectrum) of the sound waves are caused by  interactions of the sounds with the head and the outer ear before entering the ear canal.

=== Principles of auditory cue grouping ===
The auditory system uses several [[Heuristics#Psychology|heuristics]] to make sense of incoming cues, based on the properties of auditory stimuli that usually occur in the environment. Cue grouping refers to how humans naturally perceive incoming stimuli as organized patterns, based on certain rules.

==== Onset time ====
If two sounds start at different times, they are likely to have originated from different sources. Sounds that originate simultaneously likely come from the same source.

==== Location ====
Cues originating at the same or slowly changing positions usually have the same source. When two sounds are separated in space, the cue of location (see: [[sound localization]]) helps an individual to separate them perceptually. If a sound is moving, it will move continuously. Erratically jumping sound is unlikely to come from the same source.

==== Similarity of timbre ====
[[Timbre]] is the tone quality or tone character of a sound, independent of pitch. This helps us distinguish between musical instruments playing the same notes. When hearing multiple sounds, the timbre of each sound will be unchanging (regardless of pitch), and thus we can differentiate between sounds from different sources over time.&lt;ref name="Audio Order"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bregman|first=Albert|title=Primary Auditory Stream Segregation and Perception of Order in Rapid Sequences of Tones|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1971|volume=89|issue=2|pages=244â249|doi=10.1037/h0031163|pmid=5567132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Similarity of pitch ====
[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] refers to the frequency of the sound wave reaching us. Although a single object could produce a variety of pitches over time, it is more likely that it would produce sounds in a similar range. Erratic changes in pitch are more likely to be perceived as originating from different sources.

==== Auditory continuity ====
Similar to the Gestalt principle of good continuation (see: [[principles of grouping]]), sounds that change smoothly or remain constant are often produced by the same source. Sound with the same frequency, even when interrupted by other noise, is perceived as continuous. Highly variable sound that is interrupted is perceived as separate.&lt;ref name="Auditory induction"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=R. M.|author2=Obusek, C. J. |author3=Ackroff, J. M. |title=Auditory Induction: Perceptual Synthesis of Absent Sounds|journal=Science|date=9 June 1972|volume=176|issue=4039|pages=1149â1151|doi=10.1126/science.176.4039.1149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors affecting auditory cue perception ===

==== The precedence effect ====
When one sound is presented for a long interval before the introduction of a second one originating from a different location, individuals will hear them as two distinct sounds, each originating from the correct location. However, when the delay between the onset of the first and second sound is shortened, listeners are unable to distinguish between the two sounds. Instead, they perceive them as both coming from the location of the lead sound. This effect counteracts the small disparity between the perception of sound caused by the difference in distance between each ear and the source of the auditory stimuli.

==== The interaction between auditory and visual cues ====
There are strong interactions between visual and auditory stimuli. Since both auditory and [[visual cues]] provide an accurate source of information about the location of an object, most times there will be minimal discrepancy between the two. However, it is possible to have a disparity in the information provided by the two sets of cues.
Visual capture, also known as the ventriloquism effect, occurs when an individual's visual system locates the source of an auditory stimulus at a different position than where the auditory system locates it. When this occurs, the visual cues will override the auditory ones. The individual will perceive the sound as coming from the location where the object is seen.
Audition can also affect visual perception. Research has demonstrated this effect by showing two objects on a screen, one moving diagonally from top-right to bottom-left and the other from top-left to bottom-right, intersecting in the middle. The paths of these identical objects could have been interpreted as crossing over each other, or as bouncing off each other.  Without any auditory cue, a vast majority of subjects saw the objects crossing paths and continuing in their original trajectory. But with the addition of a small "click" sound, a majority of subjects perceived the objects as bouncing off each other. In this case, auditory cues help interpret visual cues.&lt;ref name="Sound and Vision"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sekuler|first=Robert|author2=Sekuler, Allison B. |author3=Lau, Renee |title=Sound alters visual motion perception|journal=Nature|volume=385|issue=6614|pages=308â308|doi=10.1038/385308a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Haptic cues ==
A haptic cue is either a tactile sensation that represents an incoming signal received by the somatic system, or a relationship between tactile sensations which can be used to infer a higher level of information.&lt;ref name="Sensation_Perception" /&gt;   The results of receiving and processing these cues are collectively known as the sense of [[Somatosensory system|touch]], and are the subject of research in the fields of [[psychology]], [[Cognitive Science|cognitive science]], and [[neurobiology]].

The word "haptic" can refer explicitly to [[Haptic perception|active exploration]] of an environment (particularly in experimental psychology and physiology), but is often used to refer to the whole of the somesthetic experience.&lt;ref name="Touch Importance"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robles-De-La-Torre|first=G.|title=The Importance of the Sense of Touch in Virtual and Real Environments|journal=IEEE Multimedia|date=1 July 2006|volume=13|issue=3|pages=24â30|doi=10.1109/MMUL.2006.69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Somatosensory system ===
{{Main|Somatosensory system}}

The somatosensory system assimilates many kinds of information from the environment: temperature, texture, pressure, proprioception, and pain. The signals vary for each of these perceptions, and the receptor systems reflect this: [[Thermoreceptor]]s, [[mechanoreceptors]], [[nociceptors]], and [[chemoreceptors]].

=== Haptic cues in research ===

==== The interaction between haptic and visual cues ====
In addition to the interplay of [[haptic communication]] and [[nonverbal communication]], haptic cues as primers have been looked at as a means of decreasing reaction time for identifying a visual stimulus.&lt;ref name="Haptic Visual Priming"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Validity of Haptic Cues and Its Effect on Priming Visual Spatial Attention|year=2003|doi=10.1109/HAPTIC.2003.1191265|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/hirl/projects/papers/back/C36_Young_HS2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subjects were placed in a chair fitted with a back which provided haptic cues indicating where the stimulus would appear on a screen. Valid haptic cues significantly decreased reaction time while invalid cues increased reaction time.&lt;ref name="Haptic Visual Priming" /&gt;

==== Use in technology for the visually impaired ====
Haptic cues are used frequently to allow those who have impaired vision to have access to a greater wealth of information. [[Braille]] is a tactile written language which is read via touch, brushing the fingers over the raised patterns. [[Braille technology]] is the attempt to extend Braille to digital media and developing new tools to aid in the reading of web pages and other electronic devices often involves a combination of haptic and auditory cues.&lt;ref name="Structure recognition"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jay|first=Caroline|author2=Stevens, Robert |author3=Hubbold, Roger |author4= Glencross, Mashhuda |title=Using haptic cues to aid nonvisual structure recognition|journal=ACM Transactions on Applied Perception|date=1 May 2008|volume=5|issue=2|pages=1â14|doi=10.1145/1279920.1279922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major issue that different technologies in this area attempt to overcome is sensory overload. The amount of information that can be quickly related via touch is less than that of vision and is limited by current technology. As a result, multi-modal approaches, converting the visual information into both haptic and auditory output, often have the best results. For example, an electronic pen can be drawn across a tablet mapped to the screen and produce different vibrations and sounds depending on what is at that location.&lt;ref name="Structure recognition" /&gt;

== Olfactory cues ==
An olfactory cue is a chemical signal received by the olfactory system that represents an incoming signal received through the nose. This allows humans and animals to smell the chemical signal given off by a physical object. Olfactory cues are extremely important for sexual reproduction, as they trigger [[Animal sexual behavior|mating behavior]] in many species, as well as maternal bonding and survival techniques such as detecting spoiled food. The results of receiving and processing this information is known as the sense of smell.

=== Olfactory system ===
{{Main|Olfactory System}}
The process of smelling begins when chemical molecules enter the nose and reach the [[olfactory mucosa]], a dime-sized region located in the nasal cavity that contains olfactory receptor neurons. There are 350 types of olfactory receptors, each sensitive to a narrow range of odorants. These neurons send signals to the glomeruli within the [[olfactory bulb]]. Each glomerulus collects information from a specific olfactory receptor neuron. The olfactory signal is then conducted to [[piriform cortex]] and the [[amygdala]], and then to the [[Orbitofrontal cortex|orbitalfrontal cortex]], where higher level processing of the odor occurs.

=== Olfactory memory ===
{{Main|Olfactory Memory}}
Olfactory memory is the recollection of a given smell. Research has found that [[odor]] memory is highly persistent and has a high resistance to interference, meaning these memories remain within an individual for long times despite possible interference of other olfactory memories. These memories are mostly [[Explicit memory|explicit]], though implicit forms of odor memory do provide some understanding of memory.  Mammalian olfactory cues play an important role in the coordination of the mother infant bond, and the following normal development of the offspring.
Olfactory memory is especially important for maternal behavior. Studies have shown that the fetus becomes familiar with olfactory cues in the within the uterus. This is demonstrated by research that suggests that newborns respond positively to the smell of their own amniotic fluid, meaning that fetuses learn from these cues in the womb.&lt;ref name="Odour preferences"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Varendi|first=H|author2=Porter, RH |author3=Winberg, J |title=Natural odour preferences of newborn infants change over time|journal=Acta Paediatrica|date=1 September 1997|volume=86|issue=9|pages=985â990|doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.1997.tb15184.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental cues ==
'''Environmental cues''' are all of the sensory cues that exist in the environment.

With [[Attention|directed attention]] an environmental cue becomes an attended cue.&lt;ref name=Sensation_Perception&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Bruce E.|title=Sensation and Perception|year=2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-60149-4|pages=5â6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most environmental cues are assimilated subconsciously, as in [[Contextual cueing effect|visual contextual cueing]].

Environmental cues serve as the primary context that shapes how the world is perceived and as such they can [[Priming (psychology)|prime]] prior experience to influence memory recall&lt;ref name = "Context_Dependent_Memory"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Godden | first1 = D | last2 = Baddeley | first2 = A. | year = 1975 | title = Context dependent memory in two natural environments | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 3| pages = 325â331 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8295.1975.tb01468.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and decision making.&lt;ref name="Food_Choice"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/605327 |title=The Effects of Advertising Copy on Sensory Thoughts and Perceived Taste |year=2010 |last1=Elder |first1=Ryan S. |last2=Krishna |first2=Aradhna |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=748â56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has applied use in [[marketing]] as there is evidence to suggest a store's atmosphere and layout can influence purchasing behavior.&lt;ref name="Marketing_Influence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Julie|author2=Parasuraman, A. |author3=Grewal, Dhruv |author4= Voss, Glenn B. |title=The Influence of Multiple Store Environment Cues on Perceived Merchandise Value and Patronage Intentions|journal=Journal of Marketing|date=1 April 2002|volume=66|issue=2|pages=120â141|doi=10.1509/jmkg.66.2.120.18470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental cues play a direct role in mediating the behavior of both plants&lt;ref name="Plant_Environment"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=Jonah A.|author2=Heath, Chip |title=Idea Habitats: How the Prevalence of Environmental Cues Influences the Success of Ideas|journal=Cognitive Science |date= MarchâApril 2010 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages= 195â221 |doi= 10.1207/s15516709cog0000_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and animals. For example, environmental cues, such as temperature change or food availability affect the [[Spawning triggers|spawning behavior]] of fish. In addition to cues generated by the environment itself, cues generated by other agents, such as ant pheromone trails, can influence behavior [[Stygmergy|to indirectly coordinate actions between those agents]].

In the study of perception environmental cues play a large role in experimental design since these mechanisms evolved within a natural environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Geisler | first1 = W.

If the experimental environment is too artificial it can damage external validity in an [[Ideal observer analysis#Natural and pseudo-natural tasks|ideal observer]] experiment that makes use of natural scene statistics.

An '''oil skimmer''' is a device that is designed to remove oil floating on a liquid surface. Depending on the specific design they are used for a variety of applications such as [[oil spill]] response, as a part of oily water treatment systems, removing oil from machine tool coolant and aqueous parts washers, and collecting fats oils and greases in wastewater treatment in food manufacturing industries.

Oil skimmers were used to great effect to assist in the remediation of the [[Exxon Valdez]] [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|spill]] in 1989. Oil skimmers are different to [[Swimming pool sanitation]] skimmers that are designed for a related but different purpose.

==Limitation and design factors==
There are many different types of oil skimmer. Each type has different design features and therefore results in different applications and use. It is important to understand the design features before employing a particular skimmer type.

Some factors to consider are:
* Oil removal flow rate: Alternative Skimmer designs have different oil removal flow rates. Volume removal rates for Oleophilic skimmer types (drum, brush, disc, belt) are comparatively low. Weir type skimmers are capable of very high oil and water removal rates. ASTM F2709 standard establishes the test procedure for determining oil recovery rate (ORR).
* Oil removal concentration: It is a common misconception that oil skimmers remove concentrated or pure 'oil'; when in fact they remove a mixture of oil and water. In most situations the 'oil' mixture removed is an emulsion of oil and water more like a 'mousse'. Oleophilic and Non-Oleophilic skimmers can provide a more concentrated oil in the removal stream, however still collect entrained water.
* Effectiveness with different oils: Oleophilic and Non-Oleophilic skimmers are not equally effective with all oil types due to the changing nature of the attraction forces with different oils and materials.
* Effectiveness with chemicals in the water: Oleophilic skimmers may not work as effectively if there are detergents, cleaners or other surfactants in the water that interfere with the oleophilic attraction. Weir skimmers are not affected by chemicals.
* Effects of trash and debris: Trash and debris may block or interfere with the operation of oil skimmers.
* Skimming direction: Some skimmers only remove oil from one direction. In some situations, such as skimming from pits and tanks, it can be important to remove oil from all directions.
* Service Access: Some skimmers such as disc skimmers, or weir skimmers with skimmer mounted pumps, contain heavy serviceable items of equipment mounted on the skimmer. This may require special lifting equipment and confined space entry safety considerations before servicing.

==Applications==
The use of skimmers in industrial applications is often required to remove oils, grease and fats prior to further treatment for environmental discharge compliance. By removing the top layer of oils, water stagnation, smell and unsightly surface scum can be reduced. Placed before an [[Oilâwater separator|oily water treatment system]] an oil skimmer may give greater overall oil separation efficiency for improved discharge wastewater quality. It should be noted that all oil skimmers will pick up a percentage of water with the oil which will need to be decanted to obtain concentrated oil.

==Types==
There are four main types of oil skimmer: weir (manual or self-adjusting) and belt and oleophilic and non-oleophilic (disc, drum, belt, tube, brush,mop, grooved disc, grooved drum):

===Weir===
Weir skimmers function by allowing the oil floating on the surface of the water to flow over a [[weir]]. There are two main types of weir skimmer, those that require the weir height to be manually adjusted and those where the weir height is automatic or self-adjusting.&lt;ref name="Weir Oil Skimmers"&gt;[http://www.ultraspin.com.au/products/skimmers/. Weir Type Oil Skimmers]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst manually adjusted weir skimmer types can have a lower initial cost, the requirement for regular manual adjustment makes self-adjusting weir types more popular in most applications. Weir skimmers will collect water if operating when oil is no longer present. To overcome this limitation most weir type skimmers contain an automatic water drain on the oil collection tank. [[File:Self adjusting weir type oil skimmer, Ultraspin.jpg|thumbnail|Industrial weir type oil skimmer]].
===Belt===
Belt oil skimmers is one of the most reliable and economical equipment removing liquid surface floating oil, low electric consumption, no need any consumable, can effective remove all kinds of floating oil (contain machine oil, kerosene, diesel oil, lubricating oil,plant oil and other liquid specific weight less than water, no matter the water surface oil layer thick or thin, all can absorb), can make oil-water separation and waste oil reuse, its principle is adopt different gravity and surface tension etc characteristic, when the oil skimming belt pass water surface can absorb and take away the surface all kinds of floating oil.

===Oleophilic===
Oleophilic skimmers function by using an element such as a drum, disc, rope or mop to which the oil [[adhesion|adheres]]. The oil is wiped from the oleophilic surface and collected in a tank. As the oil is adhering to a collection surface the amount of water collected when oil is not present will be limited.

===Non-oleophilic===
[[File:Oil Skimmer for StingRay Parts Washer.jpg|thumbnail|Smooth industrial disc oil skimmer]]
Non-oleophilic skimmers are distinguished by the component used to collect the oil. A metal disc, belt or drum is used in applications where an oleophilic material is inappropriate, such as in a hot alkaline aqueous parts washer.&lt;ref name="non-oleophilic"&gt;[http://www.stingraypartswasher.com/Parts_Washer_Option_Oil_Skimmer.html non-oleophilic parts washer skimmer]&lt;/ref&gt; The skimmer is generally turned off whenever there is no oil to skim thus minimizing the amount of water collected.  Metal skimming elements are nearly as efficient as oleophilic skimmers when oil is present.

==Wendy Schmidt Challenge==
Some oil skimming designs entered the Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup X CHALLENGE in 2011. The winning technology utilized Grooves placed on the surface of rotating discs manufactured by Elastec Inc of the USA.

==History==
Since 1959, the U.S. Army has been investing a considerable amount of resources into technology-based development of training procedures. In 1968 the U.S. Army officially introduced a training doctrine known as "Systems Engineering of Training" covered in the document CON Reg 350-100-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| publisher=UNITED STATES CONTINENTAL ARMY COMMAND| location=Fort Monroe, Virginia| year=1968| title=''CON Reg 350-100-1''| url=https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:tv440px2527/tv440px2527.pdf| format=PDF| access-date =November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silber, K.H. &amp; Foshay, W.R., ''Handbook of Improving Performance in the Workplace, Instructional Design and Training Delivery'', John Wiley &amp; Sons 2009, {{ISBN|9780470190685}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ybtiAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 p.63]&lt;/ref&gt; 

PG Whitmore cited the CON Reg 350-100-1 definition: "job related skills involving actions affecting primarily people and paper, e.g., inspecting troops, supervising office personnel, conducting studies, preparing maintenance reports, preparing efficiency reports, designing bridge structures."&lt;ref&gt;CON Reg 350-100-1, as cited in Whitmore, Paul G., "What are soft skills?"&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1972 [[CONARC]] Soft Skills Conference Dr. Whitmore presented a report&lt;ref name=wth&gt;Whitmore, Paul G., "What are soft skills?", Paper presented at the [[CONARC]] Soft Skills Conference, Texas, 12-13 December, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fry, John P., "Procedures for Implementing Soft-Skill Training in CONARC Schools,"  Paper presented at the [[CONARC]] Soft Skills Conference, Texas, 12-13 December, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wf&gt;Whitmore, Paul G.; Fry, John P., "Soft Skills: Definition, Behavioral Model Analysis, Training Procedures. Professional Paper 3-74.", Research Report [[ERIC]] Number: ED158043, 48pp.&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at figuring out how the term "soft skills" (in the areas of command, supervision, counseling and leadership) is understood in various CONARC schools. After designing and processing a questionnaire, the following tentative definition was formulated: "Soft skills are important job-related skills that involve little or no interaction with machines and whose application on the job is quite generalized."&lt;ref name=wth/&gt;&lt;ref name=wf/&gt;

They further criticized state of the concept then as vague with a remark "in other words, those job functions about which we know a good deal are hard skills and those about which we know very little are soft skills." Another immediate study by them also concluded in a negative tone.&lt;ref name=wth/&gt;

Psychologist [[Nicholas Humphrey]] famously stated that it is social intelligence that defines humans rather than quantitative intelligence. Many industries today give prominence to soft skills of their employees. It is through a 1972 US Army training manual identified formal usage of the term "soft skills" began.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine S. Newman, ''Chutes and Ladders: Navigating the Low-wage Labor Market'', Harvard University Press 2006, {{ISBN|0674023366}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ERptWNyIsIkC&amp;pg=PA351 p.351]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Soft skills are a cluster of productive personality traits that characterize one's relationships in a milieu. These skills can include social graces, communication abilities, [[language]] skills, personal habits, cognitive or emotional empathy, time management, teamwork and leadership traits. A definition based on review literature explains soft skills as an umbrella term for skills under three key functional elements: people skills, social skills, and personal career attributes.&lt;ref name=marcel/&gt; National Business Education Association deems soft skills as critical for being industrious in todayâs workplace.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nbea.org/newsite/curriculum/policy/no_67.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Soft skills complement hard skills also known as technical skills, for productive workplace performance and everyday life competencies (Arkansas Department of Education, 2007). Hard skills were the only skills necessary for career employment and were generally quantifiable and measurable from educational background, work experience or through interview.{{cn|date=September 2016}} In the 20th century soft skills are a major differentiator, a [[sine qua non]] for [[employability]] and success in life.&lt;ref&gt;Heckman and Kautz, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612993/ Hard Evidence on Soft Skills], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by Harvard University noted that 80% of achievements in career are determined by soft skills and only 20% by hard skills. Experts say soft skills training should begin for a person when they are students, to perform efficiently in their academic environment as well as in their future workplace.{{cn|date=September 2016}} A public interest study conducted by McDonaldâs in UK predicted over half a million people will be held back from job sectors by 2020 due to lack of soft skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backingsoftskills.co.uk/|title=McDonald's Backing Soft Skills|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Enumeration and categorization==
A person's soft skill is an important part of their individual contribution to the success of an organization.{{cn|date=September 2016}} Organizations which deal with customers face-to-face are generally more successful if they promote activities for staffs to develop these skills through [[Workplace wellness|wellness enhancing programs]].{{cn|date=September 2016}} Training or rewarding for personal habits  or traits such as dependability and conscientiousness can yield significant return on investment for an organization.{{cn|date=September 2016}} For this reason, soft skills are increasingly sought out by employers in addition to standard qualifications.{{cn|date=September 2016}} Studies by Stanford Research Institute and the Carnegie Mellon Foundation among Fortune 500 CEOs established that 75% of long term job success resulted from soft skills and only 25% from technical skills (Sinha, 2008). Hence, soft skills are as important as cognitive/technical skills (John, 2009; Zehr, 1998).

===Soft skills for business executives===
Following is a "top ten" list of soft skills compiled by [[Eastern Kentucky University]] from executive listings.&lt;ref name=marcel&gt;Marcel M.

'''Sustainable regional development''' is the application of [[sustainable development]] at a [[regional]], rather than local, national or global level.  It differs to [[regional development]] per se, as the latter is a term used more generally to describe economic development that emphasises the alleviation of regional disparities.  While regional development has an economic and equity emphasis, sustainable regional development seeks to incorporate ecological concerns.

Sustainable regional development has particular currency in Australia, where the [[Institute for Sustainable Regional Development]] has been established (1997) for the purpose of developing integrated, multi- and inter-disciplinary strategies for environmental and socio-economic change in regional Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Sustainable Regional Development: [http://www.isrd.cqu.edu.au/FCWViewer/view.do?page=1191 About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synthetic phonics''' (UK) or '''blended phonics''' (US), also known as '''inductive phonics''',&lt;ref name="sedl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/glossary.html |title=Glossary of Reading Terms - The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of teaching reading which first teaches the letter sounds and then builds up to blending these sounds together to achieve full pronunciation of whole words. This article relates to the [[English language]] only.
{{toc limit|3}}

==Overview==

Synthetic phonics refers to a family of programs which aim to teach literacy through the following methods:&lt;ref name="phonicsplay Glossary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.phonicsplay.co.uk/SubjectKnowledge.htm |title=Subject Knowledge: Glossary |work= |accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Teaching students the correspondence between graphemes and phonemes.
* Teaching students to read words by '''blending''': identifying the graphemes in the word, recalling the corresponding phonemes, and saying the phonemes together to form the sound of the whole word.
* Teaching students to write words by '''segmenting''': identifying the phonemes of the word, recalling the corresponding graphemes, then writing the graphemes together to form the written word.

Synthetic phonics programs have some or all of the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="vanderbilt Phonics"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://my.vanderbilt.edu/specialeducationinduction/files/2011/09/1-Literacy-teaching-guide-phonics.pdf |title=Literacy teaching guide: Phonics |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Teaching grapheme-phoneme correspondence out of alphabetic order, following an order determined by perceived complexity (going from easiest to hardest to learn).
* Teaching the reading and writing of words in order of increasing irregularity, teaching words which follow typical grapheme-phoneme correspondence first, and teaching words with idiosyncratic or unusual grapheme-phoneme correspondence later.

Synthetic phonics programs do not have the following characteristics:
* Encouraging students to guess the meaning of words from contextual clues (see [[whole language]] method). 
* Encouraging students to memorise the shape of words, to recall them by sight (see [[Look say]] method). 
* Teaching grapheme-phoneme correspondence on an ad-hoc basis and as applied to particular groups of words, when these words arise in other forms of reading instruction (see embedded phonics).

==Methodology==

Synthetic [[phonics]] teaches the [[phoneme]]s (sounds) associated with the [[grapheme]]s (letters) at the rate of about six sounds per week. The sounds are taught in isolation then blended together (i.e. synthesised), all-through-the-word. For example, learners might be taught a short [[vowel sound]] (e.g. /a/) in addition to some [[consonant]] sounds (e.g. /s/, /t/, /p/). Then the learners are taught words with these sounds (e.g. sat, pat, tap, at). They are taught to pronounce each phoneme in a word, then to blend the phonemes together to form the word (e.g. /s/ - /a/ - /t/; "sat"). Sounds are taught in all positions of the words, but the emphasis is on all-through-the-word segmenting and blending from week one. It does not teach whole words as shapes ([[Sight words|initial sight vocabulary]]) prior to learning the alphabetic code.

Synthetic phonics develops [[phonemic awareness]] along with the corresponding letter shapes. It involves the learners rehearsing the writing of letter shapes alongside learning the letter/s-sound correspondences preferably with the tripod pencil grip. [[Dictation (exercise)|Dictation]] is a frequent teaching technique from letter level to word spelling, including [[pseudoword|nonsense word]]s (e.g. choy and feep)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasponline.org/publications/spr/pdf/spr373fien.pdf |title=Using Nonsense Word Fluency to Predict Reading Proficiency in Kindergarten Through Second Grade for English Children and Native English Speakers |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ByrneFielding-Barnsley1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byrne|first1=Brian|last2=Fielding-Barnsley|first2=Ruth|title=Evaluation of a program to teach phonemic awareness to young children.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=83|issue=4|year=1991|pages=451â455|issn=1939-2176|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.83.4.451}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually extending to [[Written language|text]] level. It does not teach letter names until the learners know their letter/s-sound correspondences thoroughly and how to blend for reading and [[segment (linguistics)|segment]] for spelling. Often when letter names are introduced it is through singing an alphabet song.

Synthetic phonics teaches phonics at the level of the individual phoneme from the outset; not [[syllable]]s and not [[Syllable onset#Onset|onset]] and [[Syllable rhyme|rime]]. Synthetic phonics does not teach anything about reading as a meaning-focused process. It highlights decoding and pronunciation of words only. Teachers are to put accuracy before speed, because [[fluency]] (i.e. speed, accuracy,expression, and comprehension) will come with time.&lt;ref name="nichd findings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ontario"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/reports/reading/reading.pdf |title=Ontario Early Reading Strategy 2003 |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic phonics involves the teaching of the transparent alphabet (e.g. /k/ as in "cat") before progressing onto the opaque alphabet (e.g. /k/ as in "school"). In other words, learners are taught steps which are straightforward and 'work' before being taught the complications and variations of [[pronunciation]] and [[spelling]] of the full alphabetic code. It introduces irregular words and more tricky words (defined as words which cannot be pronounced phonically â English has a surprisingly large number of these, usually the commonest words of all such as 'to', 'of', etc.) slowly and systematically after a thorough introduction of the transparent alphabet code (learning the 44 letter/s-sound correspondences to [[automaticity]] and how to blend for reading and segment for spelling). Phonics application still works at least in part in such words.

Synthetic phonics involves a heavy emphasis on hearing the sounds all-through-the-word for spelling and not an emphasis on "look, cover, write, check".  This latter, visual form of spelling plays a larger part with unusual spellings and spelling variations although a phonemic procedure is always emphasised in spelling generally.  Teachers read a full range of literature with the learners and ensure that all learners have a full range of experience of activities associated with literacy such as [[role play]], [[drama]], [[poetry]], but the learners are not expected to 'read' text which is beyond them, and the method does not involve guessing at words from context, picture and initial letter clues.

==Systematic phonics==
'''Systematic phonics''' is not one specific method of teaching phonics; rather, it is a family of phonics instruction that includes the methods of both synthetic phonics and analytical phonics. They are "systematic" because the letters, and the sounds they relate to, are taught in a specific sequence; as opposed to incidentally or on a 'when-needed' basis. However, it should be noted that, in most instances, the term systematic phonics appears to refer to synthetic phonics because of the specific instruction methods it uses. (In the United Kingdom, the term "systematic phonics" is "generally understood as synthetic phonics" according to the reading review which was conducted in 2006.&lt;ref name="UK Gov PDF-EN-01"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/0201-2006PDF-EN-01.pdf |title=Independent review of the teaching of early reading |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Systematic phonics does ''not'' include methods such as ''embedded phonics'' and ''phonics mini lessons'' which are found in [[Whole language|the ''Whole Language'' approach]] and the [[Balanced Literacy|''Balanced Literacy'' approach]].

===Analytical phonics===
'''[[Analytical phonics]]''' practitioners do not teach learners to pronounce sounds "in isolation" as is the practice with Synthetic Phonics. Furthermore, consonant blends (separate, adjacent consonant phonemes) are taught as units (e.g., in the word 'shrouds' the shr would be taught as a unit). Some analytical phonics programs (referred to as analogy phonics) teach learners to break-down words into their common components which are referred to as the "onset" and the "rime". In the word "ship", "sh" is the "onset"  and "ip" is the "rime" (the part starting with the vowel). In other words, analytical phonics teaches the learner to say /sh/ - /ip/ (ship) and /sh/ - /op/ (shop), whereas synthetic phonics, teaches the learner to say /sh/ - /i/ - /p/ (ship) and /sh/ - /o/ - /p/ (shop). In analytical phonics, learners are also taught to find the similarities among words (e.g. man, can, tan, fan, and ran), whereas synthetic phonics devotes most of its time to learning the letter/sound relationships (i.e. grapheme/phoneme).

===Synthetic phonics===
Synthetic Phonics uses the concept of 'synthesising', which means 'putting together' or 'blending'. Simply put, the sounds prompted by the letters are synthesised (put together or blended) to pronounce the word.&lt;ref name="sedl"/&gt;

==Common terminology==
Some common terminology used within this article includes:
*'''alphabetic code''' (in synthetic phonics): The relationship between sounds (phonemes) and the letter/s (graphemes) that represent them are referred to as a "code". For example, the sound /ay/ can be represented in many ways (e.g. cake, may, they, eight, aid, break, etc.).&lt;ref name="NELP 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lincs.ed.gov/publications/pdf/NELPReport09.pdf |title=Developing Early Literacy |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Alphabetic principle]]
*'''decoding skills''' (in phonics): Without the use of context, to pronounce and '''read''' words accurately by using the relationship between the letter(s) and the sounds they represent. (i.e. "cat" is /k/-/a/-/t/, "plough" is /p/-/l/-/ow/, and "school" is /s/-/k/-/oo/-/l/.

==History==
The teaching of reading and writing has varied over the years from [[spelling]] and [[phonetic]] methods to the fashions for [[look-say]] and [[whole language]] methods. In America in the eighteenth century, [[Noah Webster]] introduced spelling approaches with syllabaries and in England the use of [[James Pitman]]'s [[Initial Teaching Alphabet]] was popular in the 1960s. Recently phonic methods have been revived.

===Australia===
In December 2005 the Department of Education, Science and Training of the Australian Government published a report entitled a National Inquiry into the Teaching of Reading.&lt;ref name="dest AU Gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dest.gov.au/nitl/documents/report_recommendations.pdf |title=Teaching Reading |format=PDF |work=Australian Government Department of Education, Science and Training. |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024503/http://www.dest.gov.au/nitl/documents/report_recommendations.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report recommends direct and systematic instruction in phonics as the foundation of early reading instruction. Some of the findings (not always supported by reliable evidence){{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} are:

* Among the successful schools visited, there were a number of key similarities. Three of those similarities are:
:# a belief that each child can learn to read and write regardless of background;
:# an early, systematic, and "explicit" (i.e. specific and clear) teaching of phonics;
:#the phonics instruction was followed by "direct teaching".
* Students learn best from an approach that includes phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary knowledge and comprehension. (Executive Summary)
* A whole-language approach, "on its own, is not in the best interests of children, particularly those experiencing reading difficulties". (Pg. 12)
* Where there is unsystematic or no phonics instruction, children do not perform as well in such areas as reading accuracy, fluency, writing, spelling and comprehension. (Pg. 12)
* A recommendation that teachers provide "systematic, direct and explicit phonics instruction".(Pg. 14)

===Canada===

In Canada, public education is the responsibility of the Provincial and Territorial governments.  There is no evidence that ''systematic phonics (including synthetic phonics)'' has been specifically adopted by any of these jurisdictions. However, the curriculum of all of the Canadian provinces include most or all of the following: phonics, phonological awareness, segmenting and blending, decoding, phonemic awareness, graphophonic cues, and letter-sound relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/k-12/teach/curriculum	|title=British Columbia Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.alberta.ca/k-12-education.aspx	|title=Alberta Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edonline.sk.ca/webapps/moe-curriculum-BBLEARN/CurriculumHome?id=28	|title=Saskachewan Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/cur/ela/docs/outcomes/index.html	|title=Manitoba Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/language.html|title=Ontario Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/site_web/documents/PFEQ/educprg2001-051.pdf|title=Quebec Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/education/k12/content/anglophone_sector/curriculum_anglophone.html|title=New Brunswick Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/education-early-learning-and-culture/language-arts-curriculum|title=Prince Edward Island Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ednet.ns.ca/files/curriculum/AYRP-3-RAR.pdf|title=Nova Scotia Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov.nl.ca/edu/k12/curriculum/guides/index.html|title=Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, systematic phonics and synthetic phonics received attention in the following publications:

* In 2005 the Ministry of Education for the government of [[Ontario]] published a report entitled ''Early Reading Strategy: The Report of the Expert Panel on Early Reading in Ontario and Early Math Strategy:''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oafccd.com/documents/educationforall.pdf  |title=Early Reading Strategy - The Report of the Expert Panel on early Reading in Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report states "This Expert Panel supports the position of the National Reading Panel (2000) that phonics instruction should be integrated into a comprehensive and balanced reading program. Instruction in phonics and decoding should not be conceived of as a total reading program, but neither should it be neglected." Pg 104
* In 2009, the Ministry of Education for the province of [[British Columbia]] posted a discussion paper on their Read Now website entitled ''Reading: Breaking Through the Barriers.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readnowbc.ca/assets/pdfs/k12/reading_breaking_through_the_barriers.pdf |title=Reading: Breaking Through the Barriers A Discussion Guide |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper states that explicit and synthetic phonics needs to be taught directly in the classroom because it works "for all students but are particularly helpful for students at risk for reading difficulty".  (Pg. 8) There appears to be no evidence, however, that systematic phonics (or synthetic phonics) is a part of the teaching pedagogy.
* Dr. Robert Savage, formerly of [[McGill University]] and now at [[UCL Institute of Education]], [[University College London]], concludes that, with respect to remedial programs, we should not wait for children to fail before using phonics programs. He also recommends the teaching of such skills as segmenting and blending alongside the [[Direct instruction|"explicit teaching"]] of letter sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.literacyencyclopedia.ca/index.php?fa=items.show&amp;topicId=247 |title=Word Reading Instruction Methods: The Evidence Concerning Phonics |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also says there is a need for more [[Randomized controlled trial]]s in order to produce more definitive conclusions.

===United Kingdom===
A review of the teaching of early reading was undertaken by Sir Jim Rose at the request of the [[Department for Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/0201-2006pdf-EN-01.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130401151715/http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/0201-2006pdf-EN-01.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-01 |title=Independent review of the teaching of early reading |format=PDF |year=2006|accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the report often uses the term "''Systematic'' Phonic work", it appears to support "''Synthetic'' Phonics" as evidenced in the Rose Review.  In fact, the Department of Education, England uses the term "systematic synthetic phonics". The following is a summary of the report's observations and recommendations concerning phonics:
#The skills of speaking, listening, reading and writing are used by (and are supported by) what it refers to as "high quality, systematic phonics".
#Young children should receive sufficient pre-reading instruction so they are able to start systematic phonics work "by the age of five".
#High quality phonics work should be taught as "the prime approach" to teaching reading, writing, and spelling.
#Phonics instruction should form a part of "a broad and rich language curriculum". Note: critics of this report point out that the report does not explain what they mean by this, nor does it offer any details on how to achieve this within the framework of synthetic phonics' instruction.

====Critics of the report====
* In a report dated April 2007,&lt;ref name="Wyse, Styles, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wyse|first1=Dominic|last2=Styles|first2=Morag|title=Synthetic phonics and the teaching of reading: the debate surrounding England's ?Rose Report? |journal=Literacy |volume=41|issue=1 |year=2007|pages=35â42|issn=1741-4350|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9345.2007.00455.x |url=http://www.edalive.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/RoseEnquiryPhonicsPaperUKLA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; professors Dominic Wyse&lt;ref name="Wyse, Goswami, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wyse|first1=Dominic |last2=Goswami |first2=Usha |title=Synthetic phonics and the teaching of reading|journal=British Educational Research Journal|volume=34|issue=6 |year=2008 |pages=691â710|issn=0141-1926|doi=10.1080/01411920802268912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ioe.ac.uk/staff/EYPE/59721.html |title=Professor Dominic Wyse |work=Institute of Education University of London |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Morag Styles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/people/staff/styles/ |title= Morag Styles |format= |work=Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; conclude that the evidence "supports" systematic phonics; however, the Rose Report's assertion that synthetic phonics should be the "preferred method" is "not supported by research evidence".  This criticism is based on the way the research was conducted and how the results were interpreted.&lt;ref name="Wyse, Styles, 2007"/&gt;
* In October 2011, The ''National Campaign for Real Nursery Education'' web site (U.K.) comments on the U.K. government's intent to impose a specific type of phonics teaching (i.e. systematic, synthetic phonics) in the nursery and reception years, and suggests that this decision was not supported by the "research evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncne.co.uk/|title=National Campaign for Nursery Education and Childrens Rights and Needs|format=|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919060517/http://www.ncne.co.uk/|archivedate=2011-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developments following the Rose Review====

* Following the adoption of the phonics approach in its schools, the Department of Education, England provided a great deal of online support for teachers wishing to learn more.
* In March 2011 the Department of Education, England released its White paper entitled "The Importance of Teaching". In the Executive Summary, item 12 of the curriculum section states their commitment to support "systematic synthetic phonics, as the best method for teaching reading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/schoolswhitepaper/b0068570/the-importance-of-teaching/executive-summary/curriculum |title=Curriculum, assessment and qualifications (2012) |format= |work=Department of Education, England |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS 2016) report was released in December 2017. It reports on the reading abilities of students aged 9 and 10 in 50 countries, and shows that England has risen to Joint 8th place in 2016; its best since 2001. This confirms "that our approach is working", according to Minister Nick Gibb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/12/04/phonics-revolution-reading-standards-england-best-generation/ | title= Telegraph 2017/12/04}}&lt;/ref&gt; PIRLS 2016 has a summary of England's Language/Reading Curriculum in the Fourth Grade that shows the increased emphasis on "phonic knowledge and skills as the route to decode words until automatic decoding has become embedded and reading is fluent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/encyclopedia/countries/england/languagereading-curriculum-in-the-fourth-grade/ |title=England's language reading curriculum in the fourth grade}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016 the London School of Economics published a paper that supports the teaching of synthetic phonics to disadvantaged children because it helps to close the literacy gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/25/phonics-method-helps-close-attainment-gap-study-finds|title=Phonics helps to close the attainment gap:The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1425.pdf|title=Teaching to teach literacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
[[Education Scotland]] found that explicit, systematic phonics programs, usually embedded in a rich literacy environment, give an additional four months progress over other programs such as whole language, and are particularly beneficial for young learners (aged 4â7). There is evidence, though less secure, that synthetic phonics programs may be more beneficial than [[analytical phonics]] programs; however it is more important to systematically teach to the children's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://education.gov.scot/improvement/pages/EEF-Toolkit-Results.aspx?911459f09ef0012d8e7c32f03e32d003d881d45febd1eba332753219e922d8f5|title=National Improvement Hub:Phonics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic phonics in Scotland has its roots in the Clackmannanshire Report, a seven-year study that was published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2005/02/20682/52383|title=Insight: A Seven Year Study of the Effects of Synthetic Phonics Teaching on Reading and Spelling Attainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the report claim that the results were exaggerated and due to more than just synthetic phonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://reclaimingschools.org/2016/06/04/the-scottish-phonics-miracle-myths-and-evidence/|title=The Scottish phonics miracle, myths and evidence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States has a long history of debate concerning the various methods used to teach reading, including [[Phonics]]. In 1999, The [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|''National Institute of Child Health and Human Development'']] (NICHD) appears to conclude that systematic phonics programs are "significantly more effective" than non-phonics programs. It also concludes that they found no significant difference between the different phonics approaches, while suggesting that more evidence may be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/upload/ch2-II.pdf |title=Phonics Instruction |format=pdf |work=National Reading Panel |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NICHD has come out in support of phonics instruction. The institute conducts and supports research on all stages of human development. The institute conducted a [[meta-analysis]] and, in 2000 it published a report entitled ''Report of the [[National Reading Panel]]: Teaching Children to Read''.&lt;ref name="nichd findings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |title=Findings and Determinations of the National Reading Panel by Topic Areas |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194256/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/nrp|title=NICHD Archive January 2018, National Reading Panel Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''findings and determinations'' of this report are:

*Teaching [[phonemic awareness| phonemic awareness(PA)]] to children was "highly effective" with a variety of children under a variety of conditions. (Note: Phonemic Awareness/PA is the ability to manipulate [[phoneme]]s in spoken [[syllable]]s and words. Phonemes are the smallest units composing spoken language. For example, the words "go" and "she" each consist of two sounds or phonemes, /g/-/oe/ and /sh/-/ee/.)
*Reading instruction that taught PA improved the children's reading ability significantly more than those that lacked this instruction.
*PA helped normally achieving children to spell, but was not effective in helping disabled readers to spell better.
*"Systematic synthetic phonics" instruction had a positive and significant effect on helping disabled readers, low achieving students, and students with low socioeconomic status to read words more effectively than instruction methods that lacked this approach.
*Systematic Phonics instruction improved the ability of good readers to spell. Poor readers experienced a small improvement in spelling.

Other findings of this report are:

* Guided Oral Reading (reading out loud and receiving systematic and explicit feedback from a teacher) "had a significant and positive impact on word recognition, fluency, and comprehension".
* The value of Independent Silent Reading is unclear; however it is clear that it should not be the only type of reading instruction to develop fluency and other reading skills.
* Vocabulary, both oral and print, should be taught directly and indirectly because it leads to gains in comprehension.
* Teaching a combination of reading comprehension techniques is the most effective, however more research is needed to determine which techniques are the most effective.

In 2014 the California Department of Education stated "Ensuring that children know how to decode regularly spelled one-syllable words by mid-first grade is crucial". It goes on to say that "Children need to be phonemically aware (especially able to segment and blend phonemes)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/rl/cf/documents/elaeldfwchapter3.pdf|title= EnglishâLanguage Arts, Transitional Kindergarten to Grade 1, California Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skills of segmenting and blending phonemes are a central aspect of synthetic phonics. In grades two and three children receive explicit instruction in advanced phonic-analysis and reading multi-syllabic and more complex words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/rl/cf/documents/elaeldfwchapter4.pdf|title= EnglishâLanguage Arts, Pedagogy Grades Two and Three, California Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the New York State Public School system began a process to revise its English Language Arts Learning Standards. The new standards call for teaching involving "reading or literacy experiences" as well as [[phonemic awareness]] from prekindergarten to grade 1 and phonics and word recognition from grade 1 to grade 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.engageny.org/resource/new-york-state-next-generation-english-language-arts-learning-standards|title=2015 New York State Next Generation English Language Arts Learning Standards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Ohio Legislature set minimum standards requiring the use of phonics as a technique in teaching reading. It includes guidelines for teaching phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Operating-Standards/Table-of-Contents/Instruction/Phonics|title=Rules for Phonics, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Early-Learning/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee-District-Resources/Approved-List-of-Research-Based-Reading-Instructio/Reading_Competencies.pdf.aspx|title=Reading Competencies, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Literacy/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee-Teacher-Resources|title=Third grade reading guarantee, Ohio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Art of Biblical Narrative''''' is a 1981 book by [[Robert Alter]]. In it, Alter outlines a literary approach to the [[Hebrew Bible]]. He proposes that "the Bible in its final form constitutes an artistic document with a full texture of interconnected unity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trible|first1=Phyllis|author-link=Phyllis Trible|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Context, Method, and the Book of Jonah|date=1994|publisher=[[Fortress Press]]|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIp0zV_tqaAC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Art of Biblical Narrative'' has been very influential: it "revolutionized the way that scholars read the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiss|first1=Anthony|title=An Alter-ed Perspective on the Bible|url=http://forward.com/articles/146729/an-alter-ed-perspective-on-the-bible/|accessdate=4 September 2016|work=[[The Forward]]|date=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Weitzman suggests that "By the most conventional measuresânumber of books sold, favorable reviews, frequency of citationâit is hard to imagine a more successful academic book than Alter's ''The Art of Biblical Narrative''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2979/pft.2007.27.2.191| issn = 0272-9601| volume = 27| issue = 2| pages = 191â210| last = Weitzman| first = Steven| title = Before and After The Art of Biblical Narrative| journal = Prooftexts |date = 2007| jstor = 10.2979/pft.2007.27.2.191}} Quotation on p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''theta-criterion''' (also named '''Î¸-criterion''') is a constraint on [[x-bar theory]] that was first proposed by {{harvs|txt|first=Noam|last=Chomsky|author-link=Noam Chomsky|year=1981}} as a rule within the system of principles of the [[government and binding theory]], called theta-theory (Î¸-theory).  As theta-theory is concerned with the distribution and assignment of [[theta roles|theta-roles]] (a.k.a. thematic roles), the theta-criterion describes the specific match between [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] and theta-roles (Î¸-roles) in [[logical form]] (LF):
{|
|-
|
{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''Î¸-criterion:''' ''Each argument bears one and only one Î¸-role, and each Î¸-role is assigned to one and only one argument.''
 |source = {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=35}}
 |align  = center
 |fontsize=14
}}
|}

Being a constraint on x-bar theory, the criterion aims to parse out ill-formed sentences. Thus, if the number or categories of arguments in a sentence does not meet the theta-role assigner's requirement in any given sentence, that sentence will be deemed ungrammatical. {{harv|Carnie|2007|p=224}}. In other words, theta-criterion sorts sentences into grammatical and ungrammatical bins based on [[Selection (linguistics)|c-selection and s-selection]].

== Applied ==

=== Theta grid ===
A [[Theta role|theta-role]] is a status of [[thematic relation]] {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=35}}. In other words, a theta-role describes the connection of meaning between a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] or a [[verb]] and a [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] selected by this predicate. The number, types and positions of theta-roles that a lexicon assigns is encoded in its lexical entry {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=38}} and must be satisfied in syntactic structure following [[Projection Principle]].{{efn|Note that this doesn't mean that all theta-roles are obligatorily assigned. If a structural position that can be theta-marked is obligatory, then the theta-role assignment is also obligatory. Otherwise it is not {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=40}}. See Transitivity section}} The [[Selection (linguistics)|selection]] of a constituent by a head based on meaning is called s-selection (semantic-selection) and those based on grammatical categories are called c-selection.{{efn|Such selection (theta-role assignment) is strictly local and only occurs between sister nodes. A lexical head assigns a theta-role to its complement, and the subject of this XP can receive a theta-role from the [[X']] including the head and its complement. The argument in subject position is called external argument, and the one in object position is called internal argument.{{harv|Williams|1981}} Adjuncts don't receive theta-roles so are not restricted by theta-criterion.}} {{harv|Sportiche|Koopman|Stabler|2014|p=141}} Such information can be expressed with a theta grid.

In the example below the verb 'love' has two theta-roles to assign: [[Thematic relation|agent]] (the entity who loves) and [[Thematic relation|theme]] (the entity being loved). In accordance with the theta-criterion, each theta-role must have its argument counterpart.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;       |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1a)
|Megan
|loves
|Kevin
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harv|Carnie|2007|p=225 (22)}}
|}
In Example 1a, '''Megan''' and '''Kevin''' are the arguments that the verb assigns the agent and theme theta-roles to, respectively. Because there is a one-to-one mapping of argument to theta-role, the theta-criterion is satisfied and the sentence is deemed [[Grammaticality|grammatical]] {{harv|Carnie|2007|p=225}}. Below are two examples where the theta-criterion has not been fulfilled and are thus ungrammatical.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;       |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1b)
|Megan

|
|-

|}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;        |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;    |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1c)
|Megan
|loves
|Jason
|Kevin
|-
| colspan="5" |{{harv|Carnie|2007|p=226 (26)}}
|}
Example 1b is ungrammatical (marked with '''*''') because there are more theta-roles available than there are arguments. The theta-role '''theme''' does not have an argument matched to it. On the other hand, in example (1c), there are more arguments than theta-roles. Both theta-roles are matched to arguments ('''Megan''' with '''Agent''' and '''Jason''' with '''theme'''), but there is an argument left without a corresponding theta-role (Kevin has no theta-role) {{harv|Carnie|2007}}. Thus for reasons of inequality in number between theta-roles and arguments, with either having more than the other, the result will be ungrammatical.

=== Consequence on movement ===
Since [[Trace (linguistics)|trace]] transmits theta-role, [[Syntactic movement|movements]] resulting in non-local relations between theta-role assigners and receivers in [[Transformational grammar|surface structure]] don't violate theta-criterion. This allows us to generate sentences with [[Raising (linguistics)|DP-raising]], head movement, [[wh-movement]], etc. However, if a phrase occupies a theta-position (complement or selected subject) in [[D-structure]], it can no longer move to another theta-position or it will receive two theta-roles {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=46}}.

== Special cases ==

=== Transitivity ===

[[Verb]]s that can be either [[Transitive verb|transitive]] or [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] at the first glance could present a problem for the theta-criterion. For a transitive verb, such as "hit," we assign the [[theta role|theta-role]]s agent and theme to the arguments, as shown in (2b), (2c), and (2d):
[[File:MaryArrived-D.jpg|thumb|(3c). The underlying representation of "Mary arrived." by a [[Concrete syntax tree|syntactic tree]].]]
[[File:MaryArrived-S.png|thumb|(3d). The surface representation of "Mary arrived." by a syntactic tree. "Mary" is projected to the spec-TP position by the [[Extended Projection Principle|extended projection principle]] triggered by the [+tense] tense morpheme.]]
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;

|-
| colspan="5" |(adapted from {{harv|Rice|1988|p=207}})
|}
The action of hitting here requires an animate subject, an [[Thematic relation|agent]], carry out the action. The [[Thematic relation|theme]] is then someone or something that undergoes the action.
For an intransitive verb, such as "arrive," we assign the theta-role theme to the sole argument, since "Mary" is the one the undergoes the action:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;

|*Mary
|arrived
|an arrival.
|-
| colspan="4" |adapted from {{harv|Pesetsky &amp; Torrego|2002|p=22 (36a)}}
|}

The theta-criterion assigns the theta-role in the [[underlying structure]], as shown by (3c). The past-tense morpheme then requires a subject at the spec-TP position and forces the [[Syntactic movement|movement]] of "Mary," as shown by (3d).
A verb like "eat" can choose to take an object, as shown in (4):
{|
|-
|
 (4) a. ''John ate.''
     b. ''John ate something.''
     c. ''John ate a big lunch.''
         {{harv|Rice|1988|p=203 (1b-d)}}
|}
For this type of verb, the potential object is usually semantically limited and therefore can be inferred from the verb at a default value {{harv|Rice|1988|pp=203â4}}. For instance, for (4a), the listener/reader automatically assumes that John ate "something." What necessitates the object in (4c) is the distinction from the default meaning achieved by specifying what John ate {{harv|Rice|1988|p=208}}. As a result, this type of verbs can be treated the same as transitive verbs. The theta-roles of "agent" and "theme" can be assigned:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!(&lt;THEME&gt;)
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;(|)&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(4a)
|John
|ate.
|
|-
|(4b)
|John
|ate
|something.
|-
|(4c)
|John
|ate
|a big lunch.
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harv|Rice|1988|p=203 (1b-d)}}
|}

In summary, by assigning the correct theta-roles, theta-criterion is able to tell the real intransitive verbs, such as "arrive" apart from verbs that can appear intransitive, such as "eat."

=== PRO and pro ===

==== PRO ====
[[PRO (linguistics)|PRO]] (pronounced 'big pro') is a null pronoun phrase that occurs in a position where it does not get case (or gets null case){{efn|There are exceptions. For example, Icelandic PRO is argued to bear normal cases {{harv|SigurÃ°sson|2008}}}} but takes the theta-role assigned by the [[Nonfinite verb|non-finite verb]] to its subject. PRO's meaning is determined by the precedent DP that [[Control (linguistics)|controls]] it {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=429}}. As theta criterion states that each argument is assigned a theta-role, and those theta-roles must consist of a syntactic category that the verb selects even when there is no overt subject. This is where PRO comes in to help satisfy theta-criterion by appearing as the null subject attaining the appropriate theta role {{harv|Camacho|2013}}.
Below is an example containing PRO in a sentence:

 (5) a. ''Jean&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is likely  [t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to leave]''.
     b. ''Jean is reluctant [PRO to leave]''.
        {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430 (1)}}

Example (5a) is a [[Raising (linguistics)|raising]] sentence,and in contrast, (5b) is a [[Control (linguistics)|control]] sentence, meaning it does not involve any DP [[Syntactic movement|movement]]. The PRO, which is a "null DP" is in the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] position of the [[Dependent clause|embedded clause]].

 (6) a. ''Jean wants Brian&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; [t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to leave]''.
     b. ''Jean persuaded Brian [PRO to leave]''.
       {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430 (4}}

Similarly, example (6a) is a raising-to-object sentence; "Brian" raises to the object position of the verb ''want.''{{efn|This movement won't cause ''Brian'' to get a theta-role from the verb ''want'' because 1) ''want'' only assigns a proposition role to its complement, and that role is already assigned to the clause ''Brain to leave''. 2) ''Brian'' in such cases moved to the specifier position of AgrOP rather than directly into the complement position of ''want''. {{harvtxt|Carnie|2007|page=411}}}} In contrast, (6b) is an object control sentence.{{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430}} The verb ''persuade'' has three theta-roles to assign: "agent" to ''Jean'', "theme" to ''Brian'', and "proposition" to the clause [''PRO to leave'']. There is no raising, but there is a PRO in the subject position of the embedded clause that takes the verb leave's only theta-role, "agent". Since Brian does not receive theta-role from ''leave'', it only bears one theta-role, nor does PRO receive a second theta-role from ''persuade''. Every argument only receives one theta-role, and every theta-role of the two predicates is assigned to only one argument. The sentence is thus grammatical.

==== pro ====
[[Empty category#pro (little pro)|pro]], also known as little pro, is an [[empty category]] that occurs in a subject or object position of a [[finite clause]] (finite clauses must contain a verb which shows tense) in languages like Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and some Arabic dialects ({{harvnb|Jaeggli|Safir|1989}}; {{harvnb|Rizzi|1986}}). pro differs from PRO in that it contains [[Case (linguistics)|case]]. The meaning of pro is determined not by its [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] but by verb [[Agreement (grammar)|agreement]] in the sentence. The DP is 'dropped' from a sentence if its reference can be recovered from the context.{{harv|Carnie|2012|p=429}} For example:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!&lt;GOAL&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(7a)
|Un bravo psicanalista
(A good psychoanalyst)
|puÃ² restituire
(can give back)
|'''pro'''
|a se stessi
(to themselves)
|-
| colspan="5" |'A good psychoanalyst can return people to themselves'.
|-
| colspan="5" |(Adapted from {{harvtxt|Rizzi|1986|page=504 (11b)}})
|}
The verb ''restituire'' 'give back' assigns three theta-roles, but there are only two overt arguments in the sentence. It ultimately satisfies theta-criterion because the role, theme, is taken by a pro, whose existence can be proved by the properly [[Binding (linguistics)|bound]] reflexive pronoun ''se stessi''. Compare (7a) with (7b) below:
 (7b) *''Un bravo psicanalista puÃ² dare aiuto a  se stessi''.
       A  good  psychoanalyst can give help  to oneself.
       'A good psychoanalyst can give help to themselves'.
      (Adapted from {{harvtxt|Rizzi|1986|page=504 (13b)}})
When the reflexive pronoun ''se stessi'' 'themselves' doesn't have a proper [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] to co-refer to, the sentence can't be grammatical. This indicates that in (7a) ''se stessi'' must have a proper antecedent in the sentenceâthe pro that takes the theme role.

=== Cognate object ===
[[Cognate object]]s are nominal complements of their cognate verbs that are normally [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]. For example,
 (8) ''John died a gruesome death.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=89 (1a)}}
Such a structure posed a problem for theta-criterion because normally the verb assigns only one theta-role, theme, which is already taken by the [[Determiner phrase|DP]], "John." The sentence should be thus predicted ill-formed. To explain the phenomenon, one way is to re-categorize such a verb as "die" so as to change the way it assigns theta-roles. For that purpose, (8) can be interpreted as follows:
 (9) ''John met a gruesome death.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=91 (5a)}}
Or John ''underwent'' a gruesome death. If the verb "die" is essentially similar to the operation-verb "meet," the cognate objects should be assigned a theta-roleâone restricted to the nominal form of the verb head {{harv|Jones|1988}}. In other words, "die" is now classified as a potentially transitive verb, assigning two theta-roles, agent to "John" and theme to "a gruesome death." Such a possibility is falsified, however, because cognate object constructions cannot be passivized {{harv|Jones|1988}}.
[[File:JohnDiedAGruesomeDeath.jpg|thumb|(11c) Tree structure of (11a) "John died a gruesome death." The adjunct phrase is highlighted in yellow. Substituting the adjunct DP "a gruesome death" with the [[adverbial phrase]] "gruesomely" will derive (11b).]]
 (10) a. ''A gruesome death was met by John.''
      b. ''*A gruesome death was died by John.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=91 (6a), p=92 (11a)}}
As we can no longer consider verbs that take cognate objects the same as potentially transitive verbs, {{harvtxt|Jones|1988}} argues, based on the framework of {{harvtxt|Zubizarreta|1982}}, that cognate objects are [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]] rather than [[Argument (grammar)|arguments]], having the same meaning and structure as the manner [[adverb]]s in (12b).
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-role
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|
|-
|(11a)
|John
|died
|a gruesome death.
|-
|(11b)
|John
|died
|gruesomely.
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harvtxt|Jones|1988|p=89 (1a), p. 93 (12a)}}
|}

Such an analysis restores cognate objects to the group of arguments satisfying the theta-criterion, as adjuncts, by definition, are not counted as arguments and therefore need not be restricted by theta criterion. The tree form (11c) shows the adjunct DP in its relative position.

=== Deverbal nouns ===

[[Deverbal noun]]s are derived from verbs and thus assign theta-roles as their verb stems do. For example,

 (12) (i) ''the barbarians' destruction of Rome''
     (ii) ''Rome's destruction (by the barbarians)''
    (iii) ''the destruction of Rome (by the barbarians)''
     (iv) ''*the barbarian's destruction''
    ({{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=104 (7)}})

According to {{harvtxt|Chomsky|1981|p=104}}, the constructions in (10) are analogous to "the barbarians destroyed Rome" and ''destruction'' needs to assign theta-roles in line with theta-criterion. It assigns "agent" to ''the barbarians'' and "theme" to ''Rome'' so (i) is fine. The verb "destroy" alone doesn't obligatorily assign theta-role to its subject so (ii) and (iii) is well-formed, too. However, "destroy" must assign a "theme", so (iv) is ruled out.

== Alternative approaches ==
Theta-criterion experienced its golden age in the 1980s when people discussed its application to various languages and structures and developed many other theories from it. However, after the [[minimalist program]] challenged some cornerstones of government and binding theory, people started to question the validity of this criterion, especially the number of theta-roles allowed to be taken by an argument. Hornstein and Boeckx, for example, proposed that there is no upper limit on the number of theta-roles an argument can receive during derivation. In their theory, the function of selecting correct number of arguments is shouldered by [[case theory]], and theta-roles are just features on verbs that needs to be checked {{harv|Hornstein|1999}}.

'''''Torrey's Topical Textbook''''' is a reference book or [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] for topics found in the [[Holy Bible]].  It contains subject index guides to topics found throughout the scriptures.  The work contains 628 entries and over 20,000 scripture references.

It was published long enough ago that the original edition is believed to be out of copyright, but the exact year of publication is not known from sources cited here.

Reverend [[Reuben Archer Torrey|R.A. Torrey]] was known for his prolific writings on religious subjects including ''Methods of Bible Study''.

It is currently available in print from Sword of the Light Publishers, where it has {{ISBN|978-0-87398-607-6}}. Due to the text not being under copyright, it is also popular for inclusion on CD-ROMs such as Cokesbury's ''Bible Discovery Library'' CD-ROM, {{UPC|72798501118}}.

The '''unity of science''' is a thesis in [[philosophy of science]] that says that all the sciences form a unified whole.

==Overview==
Even though, for example, [[physics]] and [[sociology]] are distinct disciplines, the thesis of the unity of science says that in principle they must be part of a unified intellectual endeavor: science. The unity of science thesis is usually associated with the view of levels of organization in nature, where physics is the most basic, [[chemistry]] the level above physics, [[biology]] above chemistry, sociology above biology, and so forth. Further, [[Cell (biology)|cells]], [[organism]]s, and [[culture]]s are all biological, but they represent three different levels of biological organization.

It has also been suggested (for example, in [[Jean Piaget]]'s 1918 work ''Recherche'') that the unity of science can be considered in terms of a circle of the sciences, where logic is the foundation for mathematics, which is the foundation for mechanics and physics, and physics is the foundation for chemistry, which is the foundation for biology, which is the foundation for sociology, the moral sciences, psychology, and the theory of knowledge, and the theory of knowledge is based on logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|website=www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch|title=Recherche|last=Piaget|first=Jean|authorlink=Jean Piaget|date=2006|origyear=1918|access-date=9 February 2017|url=http://www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch/fjp/site/textes/VE/JP_18_Recherche.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesis of a unity of science simply says that common scientific laws apply everywhere and on all levels of organization.  On some levels of organization, the scientists there will call these laws by another name, or emphasize the importance of one over another.  For example, thermodynamics or the laws of energy seem to be universal across a number of disciplines.  That is almost certainly because nearly all systems in nature operate using transactions in energy.  However, this does not rule out the possibility of some laws being particular to specific domains of inquiryâperhaps characterized by increasing complexity of those domains, as suggested by Henriques' (2003) [[tree of knowledge system]] that proposes four degrees of complexity (Matter, Life, Mind, and Culture). Of course, his tree might equally be a circle, with culture necessarily framing people's understanding of matter.

Science is a human endeavor, a part of human culture.  It is unified in the sense that it is understood as a single endeavor, and there are no scientists studying alternative realities. To the extent that they do, however, one could argue that they are not unified. It is the perception of a single reality that results in a unity of science.

Separately, science is also apparently on a path toward simplification or actually a "universalization" of discrete scientific theories about energy that physicists call unification. This has led to several theory among which [[string theory]], and is probably related to the notion that, at bottom, there is only the energy that was released in the big bang, and really nothing else. 
 
The unity of science thesis is most famously clarified and tentatively argued for by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]'s [[General System Theory]], Sir Jagdish Chandra Bos ,[[Paul Oppenheim]] and [[Hilary Putnam]]. It is most famously argued against by [[Jerry Fodor]], [[John Dupre]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]].
