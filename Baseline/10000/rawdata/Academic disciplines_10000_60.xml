The '''Professor Abdus Salam Centre for Physics''' ({{lang-ur|عبداسلام ادارہ برائے طبیعیات}}), previously known as the '''Riazzudin National Centre for Physics''' is an academic [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)|national research institute]] for physics and mathematical sciences located in [[Islamabad, Pakistan]]. The [[Government of Pakistan]] had the jurisdiction of the institute from 1999 until April 2004, when the institute was made a scientific organization. However, the institute is still funded in large by the Pakistani federal government&lt;ref name="ncp.edu.pk"&gt;http://www.ncp.edu.pk/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. The proposal for the establishment of the centre was first put forward in 1951. It is under the ''de facto'' control of the Strategic Plans Division of the Pakistani [[National Command Authority (Pakistan)|National Command Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoodbhoy |first1=Pervez |title=A Pakistani's candid report after visiting India's IITs |url=https://scroll.in/article/802345/a-pakistani-visitors-report-after-returning-from-india-the-enemy-country |website=Scroll.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in 1999, the institute operates quadripartite supervision of [[ICTP]], [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]], [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics|INSC]], and [[CERN]], and main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] and [[high-energy physics]] research. As of today, the NCP emerged as world's leading particle physics institute producing hundreds of papers by world's scientists who joined this institute, and numerous scientific experiments have been constructed at NCP by national and international collaborations to make use of them.

==History==

===Origins===
Establishing world-class physics research institutes was proposed by a number of scientists. The roots of NCP institutes go back to when Nobel laureate professor [[Abdus Salam]], after receiving his doctorate in physics, came back to Pakistan in 1951. Joining his alma mater, [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]] as Professor of Mathematics in 1951, Salam made an effort to establish the physics institute but was unable to do so. The same year, he became chairman of the Mathematics [[Academic department|Department]] of the [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]] where he tried to revolutionise the department by introducing the course of [[Quantum Mechanics]] necessary for undergraduate students, but it was soon reverted by the vice-chancellor. He soon faced the choice between intellectual death or migration to the stimulating environment of a [[Education in Europe|western institutions]]. This choice, however, left a deep impression on him and was behind his determination to create an institution to which physicists from developing countries would come as a right to interact with their peers from industrially advanced countries without permanently leaving their own countries. This resulted in founding to the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] (ICTP) by Professor Abdus Salam in Italy.

===INSC and INP===
In 1974, Prof. Abdus Salam visualised the need of an institution where experts from the industrialised nations and learners from the developing countries could get together for a couple of weeks once a year to exchange views on various subjects of current interest in Physics and allied sciences. His suggestion was accepted by Chairman of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] and it was the year 1976 when the first [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and Contemporary Needs]] (INSC) was inaugurated at Nathiagali, with co-sponsorship of [[ICTP]] and [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]], under the directorship of Prof. [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]], a pupil student of Abdus Salam. The same year, Ishfaq Ahmad established the [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Physics|Institute of Nuclear Physics]] at the [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore|University of Engineering and Technology]] of Lahore where Abdus Salam was invited to give first lectures on particle physics and quantum mechanics.

Since then, it has been regularly held without break and it is a great credit to Prof. Riazuddin for his dedication and commitment as such type of international scientific gathering in a developing country like Pakistan presents a major step for the promotion of science. A major aim and goal, Prof. Abdus Salam had in his mind when he made his original proposal to PAEC in 1974 that Nathiagali Summer College would evolve into a full-fledged Centre for Physics on the pattern of ICTP. To transform his vision to reality, his student Prof. Riazuddin played a major role.

===Foundation===
The National Centre for Physics came into reality when Prof. Riazuddin arranged a one-day symposium on ''Frontiers of Fundamental Physics'' on 27 January 1999 at the Institute of Physics of Quaid-e-Azam University, only seven months before the recent tests, (''[[Chagai-I]]''). All the leading scientists of the country and some visitors from [[CERN]] attended this symposium and they provided their support. Prof. Riazuddin being the founding father of NCP, was its first Director-General and it was inaugurated by Dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]], Chairman of [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] during this period, on 16 May 2000. The Director General of [[European Organization for Nuclear Research]] (CERN), Dr. [[Luciano Maiani]] and distinguished members of his delegation, the Vice-Chancellor of Quaid-i-Azam University, Dr. Tariq Saddiqui and other dignitaries, witnessed the inauguration.&lt;ref name="ncp.edu.pk"/&gt; The first academic faculty of this institute were included [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], [[Pervez Hoodbhoy]], [[Fayyazuddin|Fiazuddin]], [[Masud Ahmad]], and Ishfaq Ahmad, who first presented their physics papers to the institutes and CERN.

In 2008, Dr. Hamid Saleem became its Director-General after, his predecessor and founding father of NCP, Prof. Riazuddin, who was made lifetime Director General Emeritus. The vision of Prof. Riazuddin to make NCP one of the leading Physics institute of Pakistan is now being carried by Dr. Hamid Saleem.

NCP offers research in different branches of Physics such as [[particle Physics]], [[computational physics]], [[Astrophysics]], [[Cosmology]], [[Atmospheric physics]], [[Atomic, molecular, and optical physics]], [[Chemical physics]], [[Condensed matter physics]], ([[Fluid dynamics]], [[Laser Physics]], [[Mathematical physics]], [[Plasma Physics]]·, [[Quantum field theory]], Nano Physics, [[Quantum information]] theory

==Collaboration with CERN==
NCP is collaborating with CERN in the field of [[Particle physics#Experimental_laboratories|experimental high-energy physics]]. NCP and CERN are involved in the development, testing and fabrication of 432 [[Resistive plate chamber|Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC)]] required for the [[Compact Muon Solenoid#Layer_5_–_The_muon_detectors_and_return_yoke|CMS muon detector]] at CERN. The RPC has an excellent time resolution i.e. of the order of 1–2 nanoseconds and it will be used for the bunch tagging at [[LHC]]. At the national level, this project is a joint collaboration of NCP and PAEC, whereas at international level, NCP also collaborating with Italy, China, [[South Korea]] and US.

The RPC is a gaseous detector made using two parallel-plates of bakelite with high resistivity. Each RPC for CMS will be equipped with 96 electronic channels, which will be readout are based on 0.14 micrometre BiCMOS technology. For the complete system, number of readout channels are around 50,000. RNCP has an experimental high energy physics laboratory which is equipped with the high speed and advanced data acquisition system based on VME standards. This laboratory is used for prototyping and testing of RPCs at present.

===Advanced Scientific Computing===

High performance and data intense computing is the back bone of modern-day science. There are stringent requirements for computing at LHC. To exploit the full physics potential of LHC data in comprehensive manner. NCP will require high performance computing for accelerator physics, computational condensed matter physics and theoretical particle physics. For accessing and managing the LHC data novel techniques like the concept of data and computing grids are used. CERN has evolved a new project called the [[Worldwide LHC Computing Grid|LHC Computing Grid (LCG)]]. NCP is a partner of CERN in this project and it is the only LCG node in [[Pakistan]].

===International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)===
NCP signed a memorandum of understanding during dr. [[K. R. Sreenivasan]], Director ICTP's visit to Pakistan from 26 to 30 June 2005. In addition, the Centre carries out research in areas that are not covered by any institute of Physics. One such area being pursued by the Centre involves a number of activities in Experimental High-Energy Physics through a co-operative agreement with CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. Besides this, NCP has collaborations with several international institutes and universities in the field of theoretical physics including AS-ICTP, Trieste, Italy; Centre for Plasma Astrophysics (CPA), K-Leuven University, Belgium; Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan; Ruhr University, Bochum (RUB), Germany and many others. Several research papers are published in reputed international journals each year from NCP through national and international collaborations.

'''Alan Charles Heyman''' (16 March 1931 – 1 March 2014) was a South Korean musicologist and composer. Born in the United States, he first came to South Korea in 1953 with the United States Army during the Korean War, and after completing a graduate degree in music education at [[Columbia University]], moved to South Korea permanently in 1960 to devote himself to research and composition. He led traditional Korean music troupes on tours of North America and Europe, and made significant contributions to the preservation of Korean traditional music, for which he was recognised with awards from national and international organisations. He [[relinquishment of United States nationality|gave up his U.S. citizenship]] to become a South Korean citizen in 1995, and remained in the country until his death in 2014.

==In the Korean War==
Heyman was born in [[New York City]] on 16 March 1931 to Charles and Lillian Heyman.&lt;ref name="KT20140304"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/issues/2014/03/178_152651.html|first=Fred Jeremy|last=Seligson|title=Korean music expert Heyman dies at 83|work=The Korea Times|date=2014-03-03|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to attend the [[University of Colorado]], where he majored in music while also studying a [[pre-medical]] course, graduating in 1952.&lt;ref name="KT20140304"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SeoulShinmun20120802"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20120802025002|title='푸른 눈' 원로 국악학자 해의만의 국악사랑 50년|trans-title='Blue-eyed' elder Korean music scholar Hae Eui-man's 50 years of love for Korean music|work=[[Seoul Shinmun]]|date=2012-08-02|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his graduation, Heyman was drafted into the United States Army.&lt;ref name="KH20110210"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20110210000860|first=Hahish|last=Boland-Rudder|title=Alan Heyman donates his collection of musical treasures to National Gugak Center|work=The Korea Herald|date=2011-02-10|accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially knew nothing about [[Korea]]; when informed by his senior officer that he would be stationed in [[Uijeongbu]] near the South Korean capital [[Seoul]], he asked, "Excuse me sir, in what part of Japan is Uijeongbu?" He would go on to serve as an army medic and lab technician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://einfo.usembassy.or.kr/koreanwar/his6.html|title=Interview with Mr. Alan Heyman, Army Medic and Lab Technician, Korean War|work=60th Anniversary of the Korean War {{ndash}} Oral Histories &amp; Video Files|publisher=Public Affairs Section, U.S. Embassy Seoul|accessdate=2014-03-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615021004/http://einfo.usembassy.or.kr/koreanwar/his6.html|archivedate=2015-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heyman was first exposed to East Asian music during his Korean War service.&lt;ref name="KH20110210"/&gt; In 1953, he was attached to a [[field hospital]] unit stationed in [[Gangwon Province (South Korea)|Gangwon Province]]. Chinese and North Korean forces stationed on a nearby mountain would often play loud drum, gong, and ''[[taepyeongso]]'' music over a loudspeaker late at night, using the sound as a [[non-lethal weapon]] to try to keep their enemies [[sleep deprivation|sleep-deprived]].&lt;ref name="KH20110617"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20110617000531|author=Kim Yoon-mi|title=Half a century with Korean music|work=The Korea Herald|date=2011-06-17|accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Heyman's comrades found the noise irritating.&lt;ref name="KH20110210"/&gt; However, it had the opposite effect on Heyman himself, who was enthralled by the music, describing it as "refreshing and interesting". During the war, he also met the woman who would become his first wife, a nurse.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt;

Heyman returned to the U.S. in 1954.&lt;ref name="SBS20110610"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sbs.co.kr/section_news/news_read.jsp?news_id=N1000928376|title=푸른 눈의 국악원로 해의만|trans-title=Blue-eyed Korean traditional musician Hae Eui-man|work=Seoul Broadcasting System|date=2011-06-10|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, Heyman did not know the name of the instrument that had so fascinated him, the ''taepyeongso''. He would not find out until after his tour of duty had ended and he had entered [[Columbia University]] to start studying towards his master's degree in [[music education]]: a fellow graduate student from South Korea informed Heyman, based on the description he provided, that the sound he heard was that of the ''taepyeongso'', which he analogised to a "conical [[oboe]]".&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt; That same friend would encourage Heyman to go back to South Korea and pursue his interest in Korean music.&lt;ref name="Wade215"&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Wade|title=One Man's Korea|publisher=Hollym|year=1967|oclc=900499|page=215|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to South Korea==
In 1960, the year after U.S. civilians could officially live in South Korea again, Heyman moved to [[Insa-dong]] in [[Seoul]]. He states that he was the only passenger on the [[Northwest Airlines]] flight which brought him back to the country.&lt;ref name="KH20110210"/&gt; He enrolled in the Korea Traditional Musical Arts Conservatory near his house, offering free English lessons in exchange for his studies. He also married the nurse whom he had met during the war.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt; He took on a variety of other odd jobs to support his family.&lt;ref name="Wade216"/&gt; As he was not yet fluent in the [[Korean language]] at the time, he faced numerous difficulties in his studies, though he later stated, "Luckily, in music one can learn much by example and observation, without the need for language."&lt;ref name="Wade216"&gt;{{harvnb|Wade|1967|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the ''taepyeongso'', he also learned to play a number of other [[traditional Korean musical instruments]], including the  ''[[gayageum]]'', the ''[[piri]]'', and the ''[[janggu]]'', as well as [[Korean dance]]s such as the ''[[talchum]]'' and dances related to ''[[nongak]]''.&lt;ref name="KT20140304"/&gt; Among his teachers was Im Bang-ul ([[:ko:임방울|임방울]]).&lt;ref name="Sisa20100908"/&gt; Though he eventually attained fluency in Korean, he later admitted he did not read [[hanja]] very well.&lt;ref name="KH20110210"/&gt;

Heyman was initially nervous whether he could find success in his chosen field, but his confidence and reputation grew after a 1962 performance he gave, the first in which a foreigner had performed Korean traditional music on stage. He recalled that "the audience was flabbergasted. They couldn't believe that they were seeing a foreigner perform Korean music."&lt;ref name="KH20110210"/&gt; He even performed for South Korean president [[Yun Bo-seon]].&lt;ref name="KT20140304"/&gt; In 1964, with the sponsorship of the [[Asia Society]], he organised a twenty-seven city tour of the U.S. for traditional Korean music group Sam Chun Li. Among the highlights, they performed at the [[Lincoln Center]] and on national television on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.&lt;ref name="Wade216"/&gt; However, the tour's success was damaged by negative rumours about their shows  spread by a rival musical group, which resulted in cancellations by 17 out of 27 universities where they had scheduled performances; their sponsors refused to pay the musicians their contracted wages, and Heyman had to make up the difference out of his own pocket.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt;

In 1973, Heyman led another troupe of [[National Gugak Center]] musicians on a tour of Europe. Again he ended up incurring unexpected expenses: the troupe arrived in [[Berlin]] and took a bus through [[East Germany]] on the way to the rest of Europe, but on the way back  to Berlin a South Korean consular official in Paris demanded they fly instead of taking the bus, fearing that East German authorities might detain the musicians and turn them over to the [[North Korea]]ns. Around that time, Heyman also considered moving back to the United States to take a position as an instructor in traditional Korean music and dance at [[Brown University]], but the university cancelled its plans to hire him at the last minute. Instead he chose to remain in South Korea. His first wife died after a protracted struggle with [[liver cancer]] in 1985, leaving him with large debts as the couple had lacked medical insurance to pay for her treatments.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt;

==Naturalisation and later life==
Heyman applied for naturalisation as a South Korean citizen in 1995, after more than thirty years of living in the country. He first faced a grueling naturalisation test, in which only two students passed the written portion; however, the oral portion was much simpler for him, as his interviewer asked him only to tell the tale of [[Heungbu and Nolbu]], which he knew quite well from his ''[[pansori]]'' studies.&lt;ref name="KH20110210"/&gt; As South Korea did not permit [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] at the time, he then gave up his U.S. citizenship. He took the [[Korean name]] Hae Eui-man.&lt;ref name="Sisa20100908"/&gt; In September 2010, he donated a large amount of the research materials he had collected over the years to the National Gugak Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=103&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0004836139|title=사람들: 국악 자료 기증한 해의만 씨|trans-title=People: Mr. Hae Eui-man, who donated materials on Korean music|work=Yonhap News|date=2010-12-24|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his old age, Heyman suffered from declining health, in particular spinal problems, but maintained good humour about his physical limitations.&lt;ref name="KT20140304"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt; Heyman died at his home in [[Hwagok-dong]], Seoul on the evening of 1 March 2014.&lt;ref name="Yonhap20140302"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/society/2014/03/02/0701000000AKR20140302034751004.HTML|title='푸른눈'의 원로 국악학자 해의만 선생 별세|trans-title='Blue-eyed' elder Korean music scholar Professor Hae Eui-man passes away|work=Yonhap News|date=2014-03-02|accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wake was held at [[Severance Hospital]] in [[Sinchon-dong, Seoul|Sinchon-dong]] two days later. He was survived by his second wife Choi Ok-ja, son Seong-gwang, also a scholar of Korean music, another son Seon-ju, an entrepreneur, and daughter Hay Laam, a professor at [[York University]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="KT20140304"/&gt;

==Music and scholarship==
In the 1960s, Heyman also began taking an interest in the music of [[Donald Sur]], a Hawaii-born composer whose works drew inspiration from the traditional music of his [[Korean immigration to Hawaii|Korean immigrant forebears]], as well as that of [[Alan Hovhaness]] and [[Lou Harrison]], who had both visited South Korea and were influenced by the music they encountered there. However, he was an opponent of attempts to adapt Korean music to Western sensibilities in the name of modernisation.&lt;ref name="Wade216"/&gt; In 1985, he was particularly critical of [[Hwang Byungki]]'s efforts in this regard in the composition ''Migung'', calling it "Hwang's one and only venture into the abstract madness of modern music, and it is surely hoped that it will remain just that", and recounting an anecdote of a woman who ran "screaming from the concert hall" upon hearing it performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Keith|last=Howard|title=Perspectives on Korean Music: Creating Korean music : tradition, innovation and the discourse of identity|work=Ashgate Publishing|year=2006|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AXd9i2YPlJUC&amp;pg=PA96 96]|isbn=9780754657293|postscript=}}. {{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Killick|title=Hwang Byungki: Traditional Music and the Contemporary Composer in the Republic of Korea|work=Ashgate Publishing|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WgPsQhVg_SAC&amp;pg=PA146 146]–148]|year=2013|isbn=9781409420309|postscript=}}.

Among the odd jobs that Heyman took to support himself and his wife during his music studies in the 1960s, he composed [[film score]]s for various films set in South Korea; by 1968, he had nearly a dozen such credits to his name, mostly documentaries.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt; One non-documentary one was ''[[Northeast of Seoul]]'', a 1972 thriller directed by [[David Lowell Rich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmsdefrance.com/revs/FDF_Northeast_of_Seoul_1972_review.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140304095048/http://filmsdefrance.com/revs/FDF_Northeast_of_Seoul_1972_review.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-04 |title=Film Review: Northeast of Seoul (1972) |work=Films de France |accessdate=2014-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His English translation of Im Sok-jae's ''Mu-ga: The Ritual Songs of Korean Mudangs'', sponsored by the Korea Literature Translation Association, was published by Asian Humanities Press in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=108&amp;oid=044&amp;aid=0000039762|author=Kim Jin|title=Translation agency unveils more works|work=The Korea Herald|date=2003-12-13|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25075864|first=Keith|last=Howard|title=Book Review: ''Mu-ga: The Ritual Songs of the Korean Mudangs'' by Im Sok-jae; Alan C.

Heyman received various awards recognising his contributions to the study, preservation, and documentation of Korean traditional music. He received a [[UNESCO]] cultural award in 1991.&lt;ref name="SeoulShinmun20120802"/&gt; In 1995, he was awarded the South Korean government's [[Order of Cultural Merit (Korea)|Order of Cultural Merit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=103&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0003980305|title=국악발전 유공자 표창|trans-title=표창 for contributors to development of Korean music|work=Yonhap News|date=1995-03-31|accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Lee Myung-bak]] awarded Heyman the Silver Crown Order of Cultural Merit in April 2011 in recognition of his contributions to the National Gugak Center.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt; That month he also received an award from the National Gugak Center on the occasion of their 60th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20110413/36369359/1|title=국립국악원 개원 60주년 해의만 씨 등 29명 포상|trans-title=National Gugak Center awards prizes to Hae Eui-man and 28 others on their 60th anniversary|work=The Dong-A Ilbo|date=2011-04-13|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, he was inducted into the [[Royal Asiatic Society Korea Branch]] as an honorary lifetime member.&lt;ref name="KH20110617"/&gt;

The '''Anthropocene''' is a proposed [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] dating from the commencement of significant human impact on the [[Earth]]'s [[geology]] and [[ecosystem]]s, including, but not limited to, [[anthropogenic climate change]].&lt;ref name="AP-20141014-SB"&gt;{{cite news |last= Borenstein |first= Seth |title= With their mark on Earth, humans may name era, too |url= http://apnews.excite.com/article/20141014/us-sci-age-of-humans-961f501908.html |date= 14 October 2014 |agency= Associated Press |accessdate= 14 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science2016"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Anthropocene is functionally and stratigraphically distinct from the Holocene|authors=Waters CN|journal=Science|volume=351|issue=6269|page=aad2622|doi=10.1126/science.aad2622|date=8 January 2016|pmid=26744408|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6269/aad2622.long|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{cite news |title= What is the Anthropocene? |journal= Eos |first= Lucy E. |last= Edwards |volume= 96 |date= 30 November 2015 |doi= 10.1029/2015EO040297 |url= https://eos.org/opinions/what-is-the-anthropocene}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castree|first=Noel|year=2015|title=The Anthropocene: a primer for geographers.|url=https://2017.moodle.maynoothuniversity.ie/pluginfile.php/487483/mod_resource/content/1/Castree%20The%20Anthropocene.pdf|journal=Geography|volume= 100 part 2|pages=66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Erle|title=Anthropocene: A Very Short Introduction|date=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198792987|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/actrade/9780198792987.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2016|8}}, neither the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] nor the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] has yet officially approved the term as a recognized subdivision of [[Geologic time scale|geological time]],&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Subcomission on Quaternary Stratigraphy, ICS » Working Groups |url = http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/ |website = quaternary.stratigraphy.org |accessdate = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gixmodo001" /&gt; although the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) of the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)]], voted to proceed towards a formal [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|golden spike (GSSP)]] proposal to define the Anthropocene epoch in the [[Geologic time scale|Geologic Time Scale]] and presented the recommendation to the [[International Geological Congress]] on 29 August 2016.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth |title= The Anthropocene epoch: scientists declare dawn of human-influenced age|first= Damian |last= Carrington|date= 29 August 2016|work= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= August 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various different start dates for the Anthropocene have been proposed, ranging from the beginning of the [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] 12,000–15,000 years ago, to as recent as the [[Trinity test]] in 1945. {{As of|2018|02}}, the ratification process continues and thus a date remains to be decided definitively, but the latter date has been more favored than others.

The most recent period of the Anthropocene has been referred to by several authors as the [[Great Acceleration]] during which the socioeconomic and earth system trends are increasing dramatically, especially after the [[Second World War]]. For instance, the [[Geological Society]] termed the year 1945 as ''The Great Acceleration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/anthropocene|title=The Anthropocene|publisher=The Geological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
An early concept for the Anthropocene was the [[Noosphere]] by [[Vladimir Vernadsky]], who in 1938 wrote of "scientific thought as a geological force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.larouchepac.com/_the_anthropocene|title='The Anthropocene' viewed from Vernadsky's Noosphere|date=29 February 2016|publisher=Larouche Pac}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists in the [[Soviet Union]] appear to have used the term "anthropocene" as early as the 1960s to refer to the [[Quaternary]], the most recent [[Period (geology)|geological period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Akademii͡a nauk SSSR|title= Doklady: Biological sciences sections, Volumes 132-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=URL? Looks like a journal, not a website}} Ecologist [[Eugene F. Stoermer]] subsequently used "anthropocene" with a different sense in the 1980s&lt;ref name="revkin2011"&gt;{{cite web|last= Revkin|first= Andrew C.|title= Confronting the 'Anthropocene'|url= http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/confronting-the-anthropocene/|work= New York Times|accessdate= 25 March 2014|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term was widely popularized in 2000 by [[Atmospheric chemistry|atmospheric chemist]] [[Paul J. Crutzen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Dawson|first= Ashley|authorlink = Ashley Dawson |title= Extinction: A Radical History|date= 2016|publisher= [[OR Books]]|url= http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/extinction-by-ashley-dawson/|page= 19 |isbn= 978-1944869014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who regards the influence of human behavior on Earth's atmosphere in recent centuries as so significant as to constitute a new [[geological epoch]].

In 2008, the Stratigraphy Commission of the [[Geological Society of London]] considered a proposal to  make the Anthropocene a formal unit of geological epoch divisions.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zalasiewicz08"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Zalasiewicz |first= Jan |title = Are we now living in the Anthropocene? |journal = [[GSA Today]] |volume = 18 |issue = 2 |pages= 4–8 |year = 2008 |url = http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/18/2/pdf/i1052-5173-18-2-4.pdf |doi = 10.1130/GSAT01802A.1|display-authors= etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of the commission decided the proposal had merit and should be examined further. Independent working groups of scientists from various geological societies have begun to determine whether the Anthropocene will be formally accepted into the [[Geologic time scale|Geological Time Scale]].&lt;ref name="Zalasiewicz10"&gt;{{Cite journal |author = Zalasiewicz, J. |title = The New World of the Anthropocene |journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume = 44 |issue = 7 |pages= 2228–2231 |date = 2010 |url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es903118j |doi = 10.1021/es903118j |bibcode = 2010EnST...44.2228Z |display-authors= etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of relative human impact – such as the [[Human overpopulation#Effects of human overpopulation|growing human influence]] on land use, ecosystems, [[biodiversity]], and [[Holocene extinction|species extinction]] – is substantial; scientists think that human impact has significantly changed (or halted) the growth of biodiversity.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author= Sahney, S. | author2= Benton, M.

[[File:Trinity Test Fireball 16ms.jpg|thumb|The [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] in 1945 has been proposed as the start of the Anthropocene.]]
In January 2015, 26 of the 38 members of the International Anthropocene Working Group published a paper suggesting the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] on 16 July 1945 as the starting point of the proposed new epoch.&lt;ref name=trinity&gt;"[http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2015/01/16/was-first-nuclear-test-dawn-of-new-human-dominated-epoch-the-anthropocene/ Was first nuclear test the start of new human-dominated epoch, the Anthropocene?]" [[University of California, Berkeley]] News Centre, 16 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, a significant minority supports one of several alternative dates.&lt;ref name=trinity /&gt; A March 2015 report suggested either 1610 or 1964 as the beginning of Anthropocene.&lt;ref name="Lewis &amp; Maslin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lewis |first1= Simon L. |last2= Maslin |first2= Mark A. |title= Defining the Anthropocene |journal= Nature |volume= 519 |date= March 2015 |pages= 171–180 |url= http://www.realtechsupport.org/UB/MCC/Lewis_DefiningAnthropocene_2015.pdf |doi= 10.1038/nature14258 |bibcode= 2015Natur.519..171L |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151224052554/http://www.realtechsupport.org/UB/MCC/Lewis_DefiningAnthropocene_2015.pdf |archivedate= 2015-12-24 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars point to the [[diachronous]] character of the physical strata of the Anthropocene, arguing that onset and impact are spread out over time, not reducible to a single instant or date of start.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Diachronous beginnings of the Anthropocene: The lower bounding surface of anthropogenic deposits |url= http://anr.sagepub.com/content/2/1/33 |journal= The Anthropocene Review |date=1 April 2015 |issn= 2053-0196 |pages= 33–58 |volume= 2 |issue= 1 |doi = 10.1177/2053019614565394 |first1= Matt |last1= Edgeworth |first2= Dan deB |last2= Richter |first3= Colin |last3= Waters |first4= Peter |last4= Haff |first5= Cath |last5= Neal |first6= Simon James |last6= Price}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2016 report on the climatic, biological, and geochemical signatures of human activity in sediments and ice cores suggested the era since the mid-20th century should be recognised as a distinct geological epoch from the [[Holocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = The Anthropocene is functionally and stratigraphically distinct from the Holocene |url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6269/aad2622 |journal = Science |date = 8 January 2016 |issn = 0036-8075 |pmid = 26744408 |pages = aad2622 |volume = 351 |issue = 6269 |doi = 10.1126/science.aad2622 |first = Colin N. |last = Waters |first2 = Jan |last2 = Zalasiewicz |first3 = Colin |last3 = Summerhayes |first4 = Anthony D. |last4 = Barnosky |first5 = Clément |last5 = Poirier |first6 = Agnieszka |last6 = Gałuszka |first7 = Alejandro |last7 = Cearreta |first8 = Matt |last8 = Edgeworth |first9 = Erle C. |last9 = Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anthropocene Working Group met in Oslo in April 2016 to consolidate evidence supporting the argument for the Anthropocene as a true geologic epoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/|title= Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy – Working Group on the 'Anthropocene'|publisher= [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]]|accessdate= 28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence was evaluated and the group voted to recommend "Anthropocene" as the new geological age in August 2016.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Should the International Commission on Stratigraphy approve the recommendation, the proposal to adopt the term will have to be ratified by the International Union of Geological Sciences before its formal adoption as part of the [[geologic time scale]].&lt;ref name="Gixmodo001"&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Human timeline}}{{Life timeline}}
The name ''Anthropocene'' is a combination of ''[[wikt:anthropo-#English|anthropo-]]'' from ''anthropos'' ({{lang-grc|ἄνθρωπος}}) meaning "human" and ''[[wikt:-cene#English|-cene]]'' from ''kainos'' ({{lang-grc|καινός}}) meaning "new" or "recent."&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/nqrwpos|ἄνθρωπος}}, {{LSJ|kaino/s|καινός|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|-cene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1873, the Italian geologist [[Antonio Stoppani]] acknowledged the increasing power and effect of humanity on the Earth's systems and referred to an 'anthropozoic era'.&lt;ref name="Crutzen02"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crutzen | first=P. J. | title=Geology of mankind | journal=Nature | volume=415 | date=2002 | page=23 | url=http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038%2F415023a | doi=10.1038/415023a | pmid=11780095 | issue=6867|bibcode = 2002Natur.415...23C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the biologist [[Eugene Stoermer]] is often credited with coining the term "anthropocene", it was in informal use in the mid-1970s. [[Paul Crutzen]] is credited with independently re-inventing and popularizing it. Stoermer wrote, "I began using the term 'anthropocene' in the 1980's, but never formalized it until Paul contacted me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steffen |first=Will |last2=Grinevald |first2=Jacques |last3=Crutzen |first3=Paul |last4=McNeill |first4=John |date=2011 |title=The Anthropocene: conceptual and historical perspectives |url=ftp://ftp.iluci.org/Evan/GEOG415/Reading_Assignments/Anthropocene.pdf |journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A |volume=369 |page=843 |accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crutzen has explained, "I was at a conference where someone said something about the [[Holocene]]. I suddenly thought this was wrong. The world has changed too much. So I said: 'No, we are in the Anthropocene.' I just made up the word on the spur of the moment. Everyone was shocked. But it seems to have stuck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pearce |first=Fred |author-link=Fred Pearce |title=With Speed and Violence: Why Scientists fear tipping points in Climate Change |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston, Massachusetts |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-8070-8576-9 |url=http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/wsav.pdf |access-date=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} In 2008, Zalasiewicz suggested in ''[[GSA Today]]'' that an anthropocene [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] is now appropriate.&lt;ref name="Zalasiewicz08"/&gt;

===Homogenocene===
'''Homogenocene''' (from old Greek: [[wikt:Homo-#English|homo-]], ''same'' [[wikt:geno-#English|geno-]], ''kind'', '''kainos-''', ''new'' and [[wikt:-cene#English|-cene]], ''period'') is a more specific term used to define our current [[Geologic time scale|geological]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]], in which [[#Biodiversity|biodiversity]] is diminishing and [[#Biogeography|biogeography]] and [[ecosystems]] around the globe seem more and more similar to one another mainly due to [[invasive species]] that have been introduced around the globe either on purpose (crops, livestock) or inadvertently.

The term Homogenocene was first used by Michael Samways in his editorial article in the ''Journal of Insect Conservation'' from 1999 titled "Translocating fauna to foreign lands: here comes the Homogenocene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Biogeography===

Permanent changes in the distribution of organisms from human influence will become identifiable in the [[geologic record]].

===Climate===
{{main|Anthropogenic climate change}}
{{main|Anthropocene extinction}}
One geological symptom resulting from human activity is increasing [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[carbon dioxide]] (CO{{sub|2}}) content. During the [[ice age|glacial–interglacial]] cycles of the past million years, natural processes have varied CO{{sub|2}} by approximately 100 [[Parts per million|ppm]] (from 180 ppm to 280 ppm). {{As of|2013}}, anthropogenic net emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increased atmospheric concentration by a comparable amount from 280 ppm (Holocene or pre-industrial "equilibrium") to approximately 400 ppm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/global.html|title=ESRL Global Monitoring Division - Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network|author=ESRL Web Team|work=noaa.gov|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 2015&amp;ndash;16 monthly monitoring data of CO{{sub|2}} displaying a rising trend above 400 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/|title=NASA Global Climate Change - Vital Signs of the Planet - Facts - Carbon Dioxide|date=7 November 2016|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This signal in the Earth's climate system is especially significant because it is occurring much faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5314592.stm|date=4 September 2006|title=Deep ice tells long climate story|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to a greater extent, than previous, similar changes. Most of this increase is due to the [[combustion]] of [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]], [[Petroleum|oil]], and [[Natural gas|gas]], although smaller fractions are the result of [[cement]] production and land-use changes (e.g. [[deforestation]]).

===Geomorphology===
Changes in drainage patterns traceable to human activity will persist over geologic time in large parts of the continents where the geologic regime is erosional.  This includes the paths of roads and highways defined by their grading and drainage control. Direct changes to the form of the Earth's surface by human activities (e.g., quarrying, landscaping) also record human impacts.

It has been suggested the deposition of [[calthemite]] formations are one example of a natural process which has not previously occurred prior to the human modification of the Earth's surface, and therefore represents a unique process of the Anthropocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Simon J|last2=Viles|first2=Heather A|last3=Garrett|first3=Bradley L|title=Ozymandias in the Anthropocene: the city as an emerging landform|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/area.12358/abstract|date=21 June 2017|journal=Area|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/area.12358|issn=1475-4762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calthemite is a secondary deposit, derived from [[concrete]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or other calcareous material ''outside the [[cave]] environment''.&lt;ref name=SmithGK2016&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=G.

===Stratigraphy===

====Sedimentological record====
Human activities like deforestation and road construction are believed to have elevated average total sediment fluxes across the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt; However, construction of dams on many rivers around the world means the rates of sediment deposition in any given place do not always appear to increase in the Anthropocene. For instance, many [[river delta]]s around the world are actually currently starved of sediment by such dams, and are subsiding and failing to keep up with sea level rise, rather than growing.&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giosan|first1=L.|last2=Syvitski|first2=J.

M.|last3=Constantinescu|first3=S.|last4=Day|first4=J.|date=3 December 2014|title=Climate change: Protect the world's deltas|work=Nature|volume=516|pages=31–33|doi=10.1038/516031a|bibcode=2014Natur.516...31G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fossil record====
Increases in erosion due to farming and other operations will be reflected by changes in sediment composition and increases in deposition rates elsewhere. In land areas with a depositional regime, engineered structures will tend to be buried and preserved, along with litter and debris. Litter and debris thrown from boats or carried by rivers and creeks will accumulate in the marine environment, particularly in coastal areas. Such manmade artifacts preserved in stratigraphy are known as "technofossils."&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=H.V.|last1=Cabadas-Báez|first2=S.|last2=Sedov|first3=S|last3=Jiménez-Álvarez|first4=D|last4=Leonard|first5=B.|last5=Lailson-Tinoco|first6=R.|last6=García-Moll|first7=I.|last7=Ancona-Aragón|first8=L.|last8=Hernández|date=2017|title=Soils as a source of raw materials for ancient ceramic production in the Maya region of Mexico: Micromorphological insight|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/7001/%282%29Cabadas.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|volume=70|issue=1|pages=21–48|doi=10.18268/BSGM2018v70n1a2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in biodiversity will also be reflected in the fossil record, as will species introductions.  An example cited is the domestic chicken, originally the [[red junglefowl]] ''Gallus gallus'', native to south-east Asia but has since become the world's most common bird through human breeding and consumption, with over 60 billion consumed a year and whose bones would become fossilized in landfill sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/domestic-chicken-anthropocene-humanity-influenced-epoch |title=How the domestic chicken rose to define the Anthropocene |first=Damian |last=Carrington|date= 31 August 2016 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trace elements====
In terms of trace elements, there are distinct signatures left by modern societies. For example, in the [[Upper Fremont Glacier]] in Wyoming, there is a layer of [[chlorine]] present in ice cores from 1960's atomic weapon testing programs, as well as a layer of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] associated with [[coal]] plants in the 1980s. From 1945 to 1951, [[nuclear fallout]] is found locally around atomic device test sites, whereas from 1952 to 1980, tests of [[thermonuclear]] devices have left a clear, global signal of excess {{SimpleNuclide2|carbon|14}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|plutonium|239}}, and other artificial [[radionuclide]]s. The highest global concentration of radionuclides was in 1965, one of the dates which has been proposed as a possible benchmark for the start of the formally defined Anthropocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global peak in atmospheric radiocarbon provides a potential definition for the onset of the Anthropocene Epoch in 1965|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20970-5|website=[[Scientific Reports]]|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human burning of [[fossil fuel]]s has also left distinctly elevated concentrations of black carbon, inorganic ash, and spherical carbonaceous particles in recent sediments across the world. Concentrations of these components increases markedly and almost simultaneously around the world beginning around 1950.&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt;

{{Main|Early anthropocene}}
While much of the environmental change occurring on Earth is suspected to be a direct consequence of the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[William Ruddiman]] has argued that the proposed Anthropocene began approximately 8,000 years ago with the development of farming and sedentary cultures. At this point, humans were dispersed across all of the continents (except [[Antarctica]]), and the [[Neolithic Revolution]] was ongoing. During this period, humans developed [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]] to supplement or replace [[hunter-gatherer]] subsistence. Such innovations were followed by a wave of [[extinction]]s, beginning with large [[mammal]]s and land [[bird]]s. This wave was driven by both the direct activity of humans (e.g. hunting) and the indirect consequences of land-use change for agriculture.

From the past to present, some authors consider the Anthropocene and the Holocene to be the same or coeval geologic time span,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The onset of the Anthropocene |author= Smith, B.

Furthermore, the argument that "something" is needed to explain the differences in the Holocene is challenged by more recent research showing that all interglacials differ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v2/n11/abs/ngeo660.html|title=Interglacial diversity |accessdate=28 November 2015|volume=2|doi=10.1038/ngeo660|pages=751–755|journal=Nature Geoscience|bibcode=2009NatGe...2..751T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
A plausible starting point of the Anthropocene could be at ''ca.'' 2,000 years ago,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} which roughly coincides with the start of the final phase of [[Holocene]], the [[Subatlantic]].&lt;ref name="Certini01"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Anthropogenic soils are the golden spikes for the Anthropocene |author= Certini, G. |author2= Scalenghe, R. |last-author-amp= yes |date= 2011 |doi= 10.1177/0959683611408454|journal= The Holocene|volume= 21 |issue= 8 |pages= 1269–1274|bibcode= 2011Holoc..21.1269C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the [[Roman Empire]] encompassed large portions of [[Europe]], the Middle East, and North Africa. In [[China]] the [[Han Dynasty|classical dynasties]] were flowering. The [[Middle kingdoms of India]] had already the [[largest economy]] of the ancient and medieval world. The Napata/Meroitic kingdom extended over the current [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]]. The [[Olmec]]s controlled central [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]], and the pre-Incan Chavín people managed areas of northern [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/world-history-beginnings/ancient-americas/a/andean-and-chavn-civilizations-article|title=Andean and Chavín civilizations|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often apart from each other and intermixed with buffering ecosystems, the areas directly impacted by these civilizations and others were large. Additionally, some activities, such as mining, implied much more widespread perturbation of natural conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Greenland ice evidence of hemispheric lead pollution two millennia ago by Greek and Roman civilizations |author= Hong, S. |author2= Candelone, J-P. |author3= Patterson, C.

They have taken advantage of global environmental conditions not of their own making.The end of the [[last glacial period]] – when as much as 30% of Earth's surface was ice-bound – led to a warmer world with more water ({{H2O}}). Although humans existed in the previous Pleistocene epoch, it is only in the recent Holocene period that they have flourished. Today there are more humans alive than at any previous point in Earth's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castree|first=Noel|year=2015|title=The anthropocene: a primer for geographers|url=https://2017.moodle.maynoothuniversity.ie/pluginfile.php/487483/mod_resource/content/1/Castree%20The%20Anthropocene.pdf|journal=geography|volume= 100|pages=66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===
Crutzen proposed the [[Industrial Revolution]] as the start of Anthropocene.&lt;ref name="Crutzen02" /&gt; Lovelock proposes that the Anthropocene began with the first application of the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine]] in 1712. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] takes the pre-industrial era (chosen as the year 1750) as the baseline related to changes in long-lived, well mixed greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html|title=NOAA/ESRL Global Monitoring Division - THE NOAA ANNUAL GREENHOUSE GAS INDEX (AGGI)|last=Laboratory|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, Earth System Research|website=www.esrl.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is apparent that the Industrial Revolution ushered in an unprecedented global human impact on the planet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Industry, environment and health through 200 years in Manchester |author= Douglas, I. |author2= Hodgson, R. |author3= Lawson, N. |last-author-amp= yes |year= 2002 |doi= 10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00029-0 |journal= Ecological Economics |volume= 41 |issue= 2 |pages= 235–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of Earth's landscape already had been profoundly modified by human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Holocene record |author= Kirch, P.

=== Anthropocene marker ===
A marker that accounts for a substantial global impact of humans on the total environment, comparable in scale to those associated with significant perturbations of the geological past, is needed in place of minor changes in atmosphere composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Response to 'The Anthropocene forces us to reconsider adaptationist models of human-environment interactions' |author= Zalasiewicz, J. |author2= Williams, M. |author3= Steffen, W. |author4= Crutzen, P.

A useful candidate for this purpose is the [[pedosphere]], which can retain information of its climatic and geochemical history with features lasting for centuries or millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Humanity's transformation of Earth's soil: pedology's new frontier |author= Richter, D. deB. |year= 2007 |doi= 10.1097/ss.0b013e3181586bb7 |journal= Soil Science |volume= 172 |issue= 12 |pages= 957–967|bibcode= 2007SoilS.172..957R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human activity is now firmly established as the sixth factor of soil formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The place of humans in the state factor theory of ecosystems and their soils |author= Amundson, R. |author2= Jenny, H. |last-author-amp= yes |date= 1991 |journal= Soil Science |volume= 151 |issue= 1 |pages= 99–109 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199101000-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It affects pedogenesis either directly, by, for example, land levelling, trenching and embankment building for various purposes, organic matter enrichment from additions of manure or other waste, organic matter impoverishment due to continued cultivation, compaction from overgrazing or, indirectly, by drift of eroded materials or pollutants. Anthropogenic soils are those markedly affected by human activities, such as repeated ploughing, the addition of fertilizers, contamination, sealing, or enrichment with artefacts (in the [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] they are classified as [[Anthrosols]] and [[Technosols]]). They are recalcitrant repositories of artefacts and properties that testify to the dominance of the human impact, and hence appear to be reliable markers for the Anthropocene. Some anthropogenic soils may be viewed as the 'golden spikes' of geologists ([[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]]), which are locations where there are strata successions with clear evidences of a worldwide event, including the appearance of distinctive fossils.&lt;ref name="Certini01" /&gt; Drilling for fossil fuels has also created holes and tubes which are expected to be detectable for millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldofideas.wbur.org/2015/03/29/mcneill|title=The Advent of the Anthropocene: Was That the Big Story of the 20th Century?|work=worldofideas|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archaeoacoustics''' is the use of acoustical study as a methodological approach within the field of [[archaeology]]. Archaeoacoustics examines the acoustics of archaeological sites and artifacts. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes archaeology, [[ethnomusicology]], acoustics and digital modelling, and is part of the wider field of [[music archaeology]], with a particular interest in [[prehistoric music]]. Since many cultures explored through archaeology were focused on the oral and therefore the aural, researchers believe that studying the sonic nature of archaeological sites and artefacts may reveal new information on the civilizations scrutinized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=‘Sound Archaeology: An Interdisciplinary Perspective’, in Archaeoacoustics: The Archaeology of Sound, Linda Einix (ed).|last=Till|first=Rupert|publisher=OTS Foundation|year=2014|isbn=1497591260|location=Malta|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable work==
===Disciplinary methodology===
Damian Murphy of the University of York has studied measurement techniques in acoustic archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.422.5265&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf| title=Archaeological acoustic space measurement for convolution reverberation and auralization applications|author=Damian T.

===Ancient sites===
[[File:Stonehenge2007_07_30.jpg|thumb|Stonehenge in 2007.]]
Aaron Watson (1999) undertook work on the acoustics of numerous archaeological sites, including that of [[Stonehenge]], investigated numerous chamber tombs and other stone circles.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Keating, D. 1999. Architecture and sound: an acoustic analysis of megalithic monuments in prehistoric Britain.

Miriam Kolar and colleagues ([[University of Stanford|Stanford]]) studied various spatial and perceptual attributes of [[Chavín de Huantar]]. They identified within the site held the same resonance produced by [[pututu]] shells (also used as instruments in the [[Chavín culture]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/chavin/kolardissertation.html| title=Chavín de Huántar Archaeological Acoustics Project: Stanford Ph.D. Dissertation in Archaeoacoustics| access-date=2017-09-04| website=ccrma.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencesnews fantastical"/&gt;

[[File:Chichen_Itza_3.jpg|thumb|Chichen Itza in 2009.]]
Scientific research led since 1998 suggests that the [[Kukulkan pyramid]] in [[Chichen Itza]] mimics the chirping sound of the [[quetzal]] bird when humans clap their hands around it. The researchers argue that this phenomenon is not accidental, that the builders of this pyramid felt divinely rewarded by the echoing effect of this structure. Technically, the clapping noise rings out and scatters against the temple's high and narrow limestone steps, producing a chirp-like tone that declines in frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Jennie Cohen, [https://www.history.com/news/did-the-maya-build-chirping-pyramids Did the Maya Build Chirping Pyramids?], ''History.com'', 17 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lubman, [http://acoustics.org/pressroom/httpdocs/136th/lubman.htm Archaeological acoustic study of chirped echo from the Mayan pyramid at Chichen Itza, in the Yucatan Region of Mexico ...

===Lithophony===
Archaeologist [[Paul Devereux]]'s work (2001) has looked at [[ringing rocks]], [[Avebury]] and various other subjects, that he details in his book ''Stone Age Soundtracks''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Devereux and Tony Richardson, 'Stone Age Soundtracks: The Acoustic Archaeology of Ancient Sites', Vega, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Ian Cross of [[University of Cambridge]] has explored lithoacoustics, the use of stones as musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/~ic108/lithoacoustics/| title=Faculty of Music - Dr Ian Cross| access-date=2017-09-04| website=www.mus.cam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and acoustics===
Iegor Reznikoff and Michel Dauvois studied the prehistoric painted caves of France, and found links between the artworks' positioning and acoustic effects.&lt;ref&gt;Iegor Reznikoff and Michel Dauvois, Bulletin de Ia Societe Prehistonque Francaise (85. 238-246; 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; An AHRC project headed by Rupert Till of Huddersfield University, Chris Scarre of Durham University and Bruno Fazenda of Salford University, studies similar relationships in the prehistoric painted caves in northern Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://songsofthecaves.wordpress.com| title=Songs of the Caves| access-date=2017-09-04| website=Songs of the Caves| language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists Margarita Díaz-Andreu, Carlos García Benito and Tommasso Mattioli have undertaken work on rock art landscapes in Italy, France and Spain, paying particular attention to echolocation and augmented audibility of distant sounds that is experienced in some rock art sites.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz-Andreu, M. and García Benito, C. 2012.

===Greek and Roman structures===
[[File:Basement_of_Necromanteion.jpg|thumb|Basement of Necromanteion of Acheron in 2005.]]
Steven Waller has also studied the links between rock art and sound. Panagiotis Karampatzakis and Vasilios Zafranas investigated the Acoustic Properties of the [[Necromanteion of Acheron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020225035/http://invenio.lib.auth.gr/record/124480| title=Aristotle University of Thessaloniki - Psifiothiki: Record#124480: Did Hades accept visitors?

==Study groups==
The [[International Study Group on Music Archaeology]] (ISGMA), which includes archaeoacoustical work, is a pool of researchers devoted to the field of music archaeology. The study group is hosted at the Orient Department of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] Berlin (DAI, Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, Orient-Abteilung) and the Department for Ethnomusicology at the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] (Ethnologisches Museum Berlin, SMB SPK, Abteilung Musikethnologie, Medien-Technik und Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv). The ISGMA comprises research methods of musicological and anthropological disciplines (archaeology, organology, acoustics, music iconology, philology, ethnohistory, and ethnomusicology).

The Acoustics and Music of British Prehistory Research Network was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, led by Rupert Till and Chris Scarre, as well as Professor Jian Kang of Sheffield University's Department of Architecture. It has a list of researchers working in the field, and links to many other relevant sites. An e-mail list has been discussing the subject since 2002 and was set up as a result of the First Pan-American/Iberian Meeting on Acoustics by Victor Reijs.&lt;ref&gt;Reijs, V.M.M., MegaSound: Sound in Irish megalithic buildings, First Pan-American/Iberian Meeting on Acoustics, 2002, Session 3aAA2, page 2284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based in the US, the OTS Foundation has conducted several international conferences specifically on Archaeoacoustics, with a focus on the human experience of sound in ancient ritual and ceremonial spaces. The published papers represent a broader multidisciplinary study and include input from the realms of archaeology, architecture, acoustic engineering, rock art, and psycho-acoustics, as well as reports of field work from Gobekli Tepe and Southern Turkey, Malta, and elsewhere around the world.

The European Music Archeology Project is a multi-million euro project to recreate ancient instruments and their sounds, and also the environments in which they would have been played.&lt;ref&gt;” Alex Marshall, [http://ebook-dl.com/magazine/wired-august-20169632.pdf Music of the ages], ''Wired'', August 2016, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past interpretations controversy==
An early interpretation of the idea of archaeoacoustics was that it explored [[acoustics|acoustic]] phenomena encoded in ancient artifacts. For instance, the idea that a pot or vase could be "read" like a [[gramophone record]] or [[phonograph cylinder]] for messages from the past, sounds encoded into the turning clay as the pot was thrown. There is little evidence to support such ideas, and there are few publications claiming that this is the case. In comparison, the more contemporary approach to the field now has many publications and a growing significance. This earlier approach was first raised in the 6 February 1969 issue of ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine, where it was discussed in [[David E. H. Jones]]'s light-hearted "[[Daedalus (Ariadne)|Daedalus]]" column. He wrote:
{{quote|[A] trowel, like any flat plate, must vibrate in response to sound: thus, drawn over the wet surface by the singing plasterer, it must emboss a gramophone-type recording of his song in the plaster. Once the surface is dry, it may be played back.|Jones, 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = David E.H. | first = Jones | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Inventions of Daedalus: A Compendium of Plausible Schemes | publisher = W.H. Freeman &amp; Company | year = 1982 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7167-1412-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jones subsequently received a letter from one Richard G. Woodbridge III who claimed to have already been working on the idea and said that he had sent a paper on the subject to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. The paper never appeared in ''Nature'', but the August 1969 edition of the journal ''[[Proceedings of the IEEE]]'' printed a letter from Woodbridge entitled "Acoustic Recordings from Antiquity". In this communication, the author stated that he wished to call attention to the potential of what he called "Acoustic Archaeology" and to record some early experiments in the field. He then described his experiments with making clay pots and oil paintings from which sound could then be replayed, using a conventional record player cartridge connected directly to a set of headphones. He claimed to have extracted the hum of the potter's wheel from the grooves of a pot, and the word "blue" from an analysis of patch of blue color in a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Acoustic Recordings from Antiquity | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 57 | issue = 8 | pages = 1465–1466 | date = August 1969 | year = | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1449244 | doi = 10.1109/PROC.1969.7314| id = | last1 = Woodbridge | first1 = R.G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, archeology professor [[Paul Åström]] and acoustics professor Mendel Kleiner performed similar experiments in [[Gothenburg]], and reported that they could recover some sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kleiner | first = Mendel | author-link = | last2 = Åström | first2 = Paul | author2-link = | title = The Brittle Sound of Ceramics - Can Vases Speak? | journal = Archeology and Natural Science | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 66–72 | year = 1993 | url = | doi = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An episode of ''[[MythBusters]]'' explored the idea: [[MythBusters (2006 season)#Pottery Record .28Archaeoacoustics.29|Episode 62: Killer Cable Snaps, Pottery Record]] found that while ''some'' generic acoustic phenomena can be found on pottery, it is unlikely that any discernible sounds (like someone talking) could be recorded on the pots unless ancient people had the technical knowledge to deliberately put the sounds on the artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/ancient-voices-recorded-into-pottery/ Ancient Voices Recorded Onto Pottery], ''Discovery.com'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] wrote: "Give science only a hundred more centuries of increase in geometrical progression, and she may be expected to find that the sound waves of Aristotle's voice have somehow recorded themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (manuscript circa 1902), "Reason's Rules," ''Collected Papers'' vol. 5 (1934), paragraph 542. The quote is from near the end.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[Nigel Kneale]]'s 1972 BBC television play ''[[The Stone Tape]]'' helped to popularize the term 'stone tape theory'.
*An episode of ''Mysteryquest'' on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] called Stonehenge featured Rupert Till and Bruno Fazenda conducting acoustic tests at Stonehenge and at the Maryhill Monument, a full-sized replica of Stonehenge in the USA.
* [[Gregory Benford]]'s 1979 short story "Time Shards" concerns a researcher who recovers thousand-year-old sound from a piece of pottery thrown on a wheel and inscribed with a fine wire as it spun. The sound is then analyzed to reveal conversations between the potter and his assistant in [[Middle English]].
* [[Rudy Rucker]]'s 1981 short story "Buzz" includes a small section of audio recovered from ancient Egyptian pottery.
*A 2000 episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'', "[[Hollywood A.D. (The X-Files)|Hollywood A.D.]]", features "The Lazarus Bowl", a mythical piece of pottery reputed to have recorded on it the words that [[Jesus Christ]] spoke when he raised [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] from the dead.
*In the 1996 game ''[[Amber: Journeys Beyond]]'', this phenomenon is referred to as 'stone tape theory' and a key part of the game's plot.
* ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' used this in 2005 episode "Committed", where an inmate's conversation is partially recorded on a clay jar.
* In the first-season episode of ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' entitled "The Road Not Taken", an electron microscope is used to reproduce sounds captured on a partially melted window.

An '''art movement''' is a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a restricted period of time, (usually a few months, years or decades) or, at least, with the heyday of the movement defined within a number of years. Art movements were especially important in [[modern art]], when each consecutive movement was considered as a new [[avant-garde]].

== Concept ==
According to theories associated with [[modernism]] and the concept of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]], art movements are especially important during the period of time corresponding to [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;''Man of his words: Pepe Karmel on Kirk Varnedoe&amp;nbsp;— Passages'' – Critical Essay [[Artforum]],  Nov, 2003  by Pepe Karmel&lt;/ref&gt; The period of time called "modern art" is posited to have changed approximately halfway through the 20th century and art made afterward is generally called [[contemporary art]].

Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths'', pp.8–171&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to that period after the "modern" period called contemporary art.&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp218-221"&gt;''The Citadel of Modernism Falls to Deconstructionists'', – 1992 critical essay, ''The Triumph of Modernism'', 2006, [[Hilton Kramer]], pp 218–221.&lt;/ref&gt; The postmodern period began during [[late modernism]] (which is a contemporary continuation of modernism), and according to some theorists postmodernism ended in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Post-Modernism: The New Classicism in Art and Architecture'' [[Charles Jencks]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William R.

Also during the period of time referred to as "modern art" each movement was seen corresponding to a somewhat grandiose rethinking of all that came before it, concerning the visual arts. Generally there was a commonality of visual style linking the works and artists included in an art movement. Verbal expression and explanation of movements has come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an [[art manifesto]],&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;[http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/i8066.html "Poetry of the Revolution.

In the [[visual arts]], many artists, theorists, art critics, art collectors, art dealers and others mindful of the unbroken continuation of modernism and the continuation of modern art even into the contemporary era, ascribe to and welcome new philosophies of art as they appear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], seventh paragraph of the essay.

The term refers to tendencies in [[visual art]], novel ideas and [[architecture]], and sometimes [[literature]]. In [[music]] it is more common to speak about [[genre]]s and [[fashion|styles]] instead. See also [[cultural movement]], a term with a broader connotation.

As the names of many art movements use the -ism suffix (for example [[cubism]] and [[futurism (art)|futurism]]), they are sometimes referred to as ''isms''.

'''Ashton Nichols''' is the current Walter E. Beach ’56 Distinguished Chair in Sustainable Studies and Professor of English Language and Literature at [[Dickinson College]]. His interests are in literature, contemporary [[ecocriticism]], [[Romanticism]], and [[nature writing]]. Nichols teaches courses in [[Romanticism]], 19th century literature, literature and the environment, and nature writing. He is especially well-known for his study of [[James Joyce]]'s literary concept of "epiphany" and his coinage of the phrase "urbanatural roosting," an idea which links urban with natural modes of existence and argues for ways of living more lightly on the earth, for inhabiting our planet the way birds do, by altering our environments without harming those same environments.

== Academic background ==

Nichols graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] with a B.A. with high honors in Philosophy in 1975. As an undergraduate, he received a four-year full academic scholarship as a DuPont Regional Scholar and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He was also selected for an Honors Program in philosophy, a program which allowed him to sit in on any class at the university and work individually with a separate tutor for each of three semesters: in epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics, and then to write an honors thesis in his final semester. On the advice of Cora Diamond,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cora Diamond]]&lt;/ref&gt; he attended [[University College London]] in from 1973 to 1974 to study philosophy. He served as a staff reporter for the [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] ''Free Lance-Star'', where he received awards from the [[Associated Press|AP]] and the Virginia Press Association, and as an editor for the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] before returning to the University of Virginia for an M.A. and later a Ph.D. in English Literature, specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature. He spent time as a Visiting Researcher at [[Cambridge University]] with John Beer.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Beer]]&lt;/ref&gt; His Ph.D. dissertation, supervised by Robert Langbaum&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Langbaum]]&lt;/ref&gt; was entitled, “The Poetics of Epiphany: Nineteenth-Century Origins of the Modern Literary Moment.” It was later revised for publication with the same title, as his first book.

Nichols's time at Dickinson is punctuated by active membership on the President's Commission on Environmental Sustainability (PCES)--and before that, on the steering committee of the Center for Sustainability Education (CSE)--as a member of the Climate Change Curriculum Task Force, and a recipient of the Willoughby Institute Award for Teaching with Technology;&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/willoughby/about/2008-2010-willoughby-fellows/ |accessdate=July 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703180319/http://blogs.dickinson.edu/willoughby/about/2008-2010-willoughby-fellows/ |archivedate=July 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he has also served on the Science Advisory Committee and the General Education Committee of the college. In 1994-95, he was a Visiting Lecturer at the [[University of East Anglia]] and Director of the Dickinson Programs in the Humanities and Sciences in [[Norwich]], U.K. He is a member of the selection committee for the Sam Rose '58 and Julie Walters Prize at Dickinson College for Global Environmental Activism,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/749/the_sam_rose_58_and_julie_walters_prize_at_dickinson_college_for_global_environmental_activism&lt;/ref&gt; a $100,000 a year award to a major environmentalist whose impact has been powerful and fully international. Recipients so far have included Bill McKibben&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill McKibben]]&lt;/ref&gt; (author and climate activist), Lisa P. Jackson&lt;ref&gt;[[Lisa P. Jackson]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Barack Obama's first EPA administrator), James Balog&lt;ref&gt;[[James Balog]]&lt;/ref&gt; (video and still photographer of melting glaciers and icecaps), Mark Ruffalo&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Ruffalo]]&lt;/ref&gt; (actor and river activist), Elizabeth Kolbert&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Kolbert]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Pulitzer Prize-winning environmental writer for ''The New Yorker'' and professor at Williams College), Brett Jenks&lt;ref&gt;[[Rare (conservation organization)|Rare]]&lt;/ref&gt; (CEO and president of conservation organization ''Rare''), and Our Children's Trust&lt;ref&gt;[[Our Children's Trust]]&lt;/ref&gt; the organization that supports 21 young people--aged 11-22--who have brought suit against the federal U. S. government, claiming that the climate of the earth is being damaged in ways that threaten the youths' rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness). In addition to his current joint appointment in the Environmental Studies and Sciences, as well as the English, departments, Nichols has also served terms as Chair of both of these departments. He has also been an Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Dickinson.

== Recognition ==

Nichols was awarded the Ganoe Award for Inspirational Teaching&lt;ref name="archives.dickinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dickinson.edu/lists-rosters/ganoe-award-inspirational-teaching |title=Ganoe Award for Inspirational Teaching &amp;#124; Dickinson College |publisher=Archives.dickinson.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1993-1994). Speaking to his ability to reach students, this award is given by members of the senior class prior to graduation. He has also won the Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching&lt;ref name="dickinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickinson.edu/academics/programs/english/Faculty/ |accessdate=July 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006135309/http://www.dickinson.edu/academics/programs/english/Faculty/ |archivedate=October 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1992-1993); selected by fellow faculty members, it recognizes superior educators in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia. His most recent book, ''Beyond Romantic Ecocriticism: Toward Urbanatural Roosting''&lt;ref&gt;http://us.macmillan.com/beyondromanticecocriticism/AshtonNichols&lt;/ref&gt; has been widely praised, from ''Choice'': "Combining literary, anecdotal, and philosophical perspectives, this invaluable book crossbreeds political, spiritual, scientific, and aesthetic elements within the outworn dichotomy of town and country.

Relying heavily on poetic examples, Nichols also envisions an 'urbanatural' future in which we see ourselves as part of the earth.";&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson.edu"/&gt; the book was released in paperback in 2012. Nichols is now at work on a follow-up to ''Urbanatural Roosting'', entitled ''Humanature: 21st-Century Challenges to ''Homo sapiens'' in a World of Plants and Animals''.

[[The Teaching Company]] selected Nichols as one of the approximately 100 professors chosen to video and audio tape (also download) as part of their ''Great Courses''&lt;ref&gt;[[The Great Courses]]&lt;/ref&gt; Program; he has so far produced 24 lectures on "Emerson, Thoreau and American Transcendentalism."&lt;ref&gt;[[Transcendentalism]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was included in ''Who's Who in America'' in 2000 and ''Who's in the World'' in 2002. In recent years, he has delivered keynote speeches and lectures in countries around the world: in England, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Portugal, France, Italy, Morocco, Cameroon, India, China, and Japan.

== Research ==

His ongoing writing and research includes a website that organizes and analyzes sources of eco-criticism and natural history to explore the definition of nature.&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/romnat |title=Romantic Natural History &amp;#124; A survey of relationships between literary works &amp; natural history in the century before Charles Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'' (1859) |publisher=Blogs.dickinson.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sarah Freierman, of ''The New York Times'', says of the project:

:''A Romantic Natural History, maintained by Dr. Ashton Nichols, a professor of English at Dickinson College, examines the way artists, writers and scientists viewed nature in the century before Charles Darwin published ''On the Origin of Species'' in 1859. The timeline offers wonderful juxtapositions, like the publication of Jane Austen’s ”Sense and Sensibility” and the ”New Idea of the Anatomy of the Brain,” a paper by Charles Bell, in 1811; and the 1832 posthumous publication of ”Faust, Part II,” by Goethe, followed by an 1834 entry noting the invention of the first computer, an ”analytical engine” by Charles Babbage.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|author=Shelly Freierman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/21/technology/news-watch-views-of-nature-before-darwin-jumped-into-the-debate.html |title=NEWS WATCH; Views of Nature Before Darwin Jumped Into the Debate - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-09-21 |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;''
  
The multidisciplinary application of Nichols' research has been praised not only by literary critics and environmentalists but also by urban planners and architects such as Charles Morris Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Anderson Landscape Architecture#Charles Anderson Landscape Architecture]]&lt;/ref&gt; This link between "urbanature" and architecture is evident in urban design projects such as The Olympic Sculpture Park&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=801 |title=Olympic Sculpture Park, Seattle Art Museum |publisher=World Buildings Directory |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217034444/http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=801 |archivedate=2014-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Seattle, WA and Project Phoenix,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/327179/world-class-soccer-stadium-underway-in-haiti/ |title=World-Class Soccer Stadium Underway in Haiti |publisher=ArchDaily |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a soccer stadium in Haiti.

Most recently, Nichols has established a blog on [http://blogs.dickinson.edu/urbanaturalroosting/ urbanatural roosting], also accessible at this superscript&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/urbanaturalroosting/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This site offers practical applications and descriptions of urbanatural roosting in cities ([[Boston]], [[New York City]], and [[Baltimore]], for example) as well as in natural areas (The [[Adirondacks]], [[Cape Cod]], the [[Chesapeake Bay]], and the like). These examples show how modern cities have naturalized themselves to produce sustainable forms of energy (sunlight electricity, wind energy, hydroelectric power), to grow food (greenroofs, greenwalls), and to increase the size of natural environment in urban spaces ([[Central Park]], [[Boston Common]], the [[Baltimore Inner Harbor]], etc.). Likewise, the site shows how human culture and urban ideas have helped to make natural spaces more livable: strict architectural regulations in the Adirondacks and in national and state parks, careful use of roads and trails throughout natural areas nationwide, and detailed rules for living with nonhuman species in wild and wilderness areas (hunting and trapping regulations, catch-and-release fishing streams, and strict protections for even the wildest species: rattlesnakes, wolves, and grizzly bears). In addition to other nature writing—currently for the [http://thoreaufarm.org/?s=ashton+nichols Thoreau Farm blog "The Roost"] in Concord, Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;http://thoreaufarm.org/?s=ashton+nichols&lt;/ref&gt;—Nichols has also published poetry and short fiction.

'''Asteroseismology''' or '''astroseismology''' is the study of oscillations in stars.  Because a star's different oscillation modes are sensitive to different parts of the star, they inform astronomers about the internal structure of the star, which is otherwise not directly possible from overall properties like brightness and surface temperature.  Asteroseismology is closely related to [[helioseismology]], the study of stellar oscillations specifically in the [[Sun]].  Though both are based on the same underlying physics, more and qualitatively different information is available for the Sun because its surface can be resolved.

== Theoretical background ==

Between about 100 and 400 µHz, modes would potentially have two oscillating regions: these are known as ''mixed'' modes.  The dashed line shows the acoustic cut-off frequency, computed from more precise modelling, and above which modes are not trapped in the star, and roughly-speaking do not resonate.]]

By linearly perturbing the equations defining the mechanical equilibrium of a star (i.e. mass conservation and [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]) and assuming that the perturbations are adiabatic, one can derive a system of four [[differential equations]] whose solutions give the frequency and structure of a star's modes of oscillation.  The stellar structure is usually assumed to be spherically symmetric, so the horizontal (i.e. non-radial) component of the oscillations is described by [[spherical harmonics]], indexed by an angular degree &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and azimuthal order &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  In non-rotating stars, modes with the same angular degree must all have the same frequency because there is no preferred axis.  The angular degree indicates the number of nodal lines on the stellar surface, so for large values of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, the opposing sectors roughly cancel out, making it difficult to detect light variations. As a consequence, modes can only be detected up to an angular degree of about 3 in intensity and about 4 if observed in radial velocity.

By additionally assuming that the perturbation to the gravitational potential is negligible (the ''Cowling'' approximation) and that the star's structure varies more slowly with radius than the oscillation mode, the equations can be reduced approximately to one second-order equation for the radial component of the displacement eigenfunction &lt;math&gt;\xi_r&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\xi_r}{dr^2}=\frac{\omega^2}{c_s^2}\left(1-\frac{N^2}{\omega^2}\right)
\left(\frac{S_\ell^2}{\omega^2}-1\right)\xi_r&lt;/math&gt;

where
&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radial co-ordinate in the star,
&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency of the oscillation mode,
&lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the sound speed inside the star,
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the Brunt-Vaisala or buoyancy frequency and
&lt;math&gt;S_\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the Lamb frequency.
The last two are defined by

&lt;math&gt;N^2=g\left(\frac{1}{\Gamma_1P}\frac{dp}{dr}-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{d\rho}{dr}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;S_\ell^2=\frac{\ell(\ell+1)c_s^2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

respectively.  By analogy with the behaviour of simple harmonic oscillators,
this implies that oscillating solutions exist when the frequency is either
greater or less than both &lt;math&gt;S_\ell&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.  We identify the former case
as high-frequency pressure modes (p-modes) and the latter as low-frequency
gravity modes (g-modes).

This basic separation allows us to determine (to reasonable accuracy)
where we expect what kind of mode to resonate in a star.  By plotting the
curves &lt;math&gt;\omega=N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega=S_\ell&lt;/math&gt; (for given
&lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;), we expect p-modes to resonate at frequencies below both
curves or frequencies above both curves.

== Excitation mechanisms ==

=== &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-mechanism ===

{{main|Kappa mechanism}}

Under fairly specific conditions, some stars have regions where heat is transported by radiation and the opacity is a sharply decreasing function of temperature.  This opacity ''bump'' can drive oscillations through the &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-mechanism (or ''Eddington valve''). Suppose that, at the beginning of an oscillation cycle, the stellar envelope has contracted. By expanding and cooling slightly, the layer in the opacity bump becomes more opaque, absorbs more radiation, and heats up. This heating causes expansion, further cooling and the layer becomes even more opaque. This continues until the material opacity stops increasing so rapidly, at which point the radiation trapped in the layer can escape. The star contracts and the cycle prepares to commence again. In this sense, the opacity acts like a valve that traps heat in the star's envelope.

Pulsations driven by the &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-mechanism are coherent and have relatively large amplitudes.  It drives the pulsations in many of the longest-known variable stars, including the [[Cepheid variable|Cepheid]] and [[RR Lyrae variable|RR Lyrae variables]].

=== Surface convection ===

In stars with surface convection zones, turbulent fluids motions near the surface simultaneously excite and damp oscillations across a broad range of frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Goldreich | first1 = Peter | authorlink1 = Peter Goldreich | last2 = Keeley | first2 = Douglas A. | title = Solar seismology.

Because the modes are intrinsically stable, they have low amplitudes and are relatively short-lived.  This is the driving mechanism in all solar-like oscillators.

=== Convective blocking ===

If the base of a surface convection zone is sharp and the convective timescales slower than the pulsation timescales, the convective flows react too slowly perturbations{{clarify |date=April 2018}} that can build up into large, coherent pulsations.  This mechanism is known as ''convective blocking''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Pesnell | first1 = W.

and is believed to drive pulsations in the &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; Doradus variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Guzik | first1 = Joyce A. | last2 = Kaye | first2 = Anthony B. | last3 = Bradley | first3 = Paul A. | last4 = Cox | first4 = Arthur N. | last5 = Neuforge | first5 = Corinne | title = Driving the Gravity-Mode Pulsations in γ Doradus Variables | date = 10 October 2000 | journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]] Letters | volume = 542 | issue = 1 | pages = L57–L60 | bibcode = 2000ApJ...542L..57G | doi=10.1086/312908 | doi-access=free | url = http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/312908/pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tidal excitation ===

Observations from the ''Kepler'' satellite revealed eccentric binary systems in which oscillations are excited during the closest approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Thompson | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Everett | first2 = M. | last3 = Mullally | first3 = F. | last4 = Barclay | first4 = T. and | title = A Class of Eccentric Binaries with Dynamic Tidal Distortions Discovered with Kepler | year = 2012 | journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]] | volume = 753 | pages = 86| bibcode = 2012ApJ...753...86T | doi=10.1088/0004-637x/753/1/86|arxiv = 1203.6115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are known as ''heartbeat'' stars because of the characteristic shape of the lightcurves.

== Types of oscillators ==

=== Solar-like oscillators ===

{{main|Solar-like oscillations}}

Because solar oscillations are driven by near-surface convection, any stellar oscillations caused similarly are known as ''solar-like oscillations'' and the stars themselves as ''solar-like oscillators''.  However, solar-like oscillations also occur in evolved stars (subgiants and red giants), which have convective envelopes, even though the stars are not ''Sun-like''.

=== Cepheid variables ===

{{main|Cepheid variable}}

Cepheid variables are one of the most important classes of pulsating star.  They are core-helium burning stars with masses above about 5 solar masses.  They principally oscillate at their fundamental modes, with typical periods ranging from days to months.  Their pulsation periods are closely related to their luminosities, so it is possible to determine the distance to a Cepheid by measuring its oscillation period, computing its luminosity, and comparing this to its observed brightness.

Cepheid pulsations are excited by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization zone of helium.

=== RR Lyrae variables ===

{{main|RR Lyrae variable}}

RR Lyraes are similar to Cepheid variables but of lower metallicity (i.e. [[Population II]]) and much lower masses (about 0.6 to 0.8 time solar).  They are core helium-burning giants that oscillate in one or both of their fundamental mode or first overtone.  The oscillation are also driven by the kappa mechanism acting through the second ionization of helium.  Many RR Lyraes, including RR Lyrae itself, show long period amplitude modulations, known as the [[Blazhko effect]].

=== Delta Scuti and Gamma Doradus stars ===

{{main|Delta Scuti variable|Gamma Doradus variable}}

Delta Scuti variables are found roughly where the classical instability strip intersects the main sequence.  They are typically A- to early F-type dwarfs and subgiants and the oscillation modes are low-order radial and non-radial pressure modes, with periods ranging from 0.25 to 8 hours and magnitude variations anywhere between. Like Cepheid variables, the oscillations are driven by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization of helium.

SX Phoenicis variables are regarded as metal-poor relatives of Delta Scuti variables.

Gamma Doradus variables occur in similar stars to the red end of the Delta Scuti variables, usually of early F-type.  The stars show multiple oscillation frequencies between about 0.5 and 3 days, which is much slower than the low-order pressure modes.  Gamma Doradus oscillations are generally thought to be high-order gravity modes, excited by convective blocking.

Following results from ''Kepler'', it appears that nearly all Delta Scuti stars also show Gamma Doradus oscillations and are therefore hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Grigahc\`ene | first1 = A. | last2 = Antoci | first2 = V. | last3 = Balona | first3 = L. | last4 = Catanzaro | first4 = G. and | title = Hybrid $\gamma$ Doradus-$\delta$ Scuti Pulsators: New Insights into the Physics of the Oscillations from Kepler Observations | year = 2010 | journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]] Letters | volume = 713 | pages = L192| bibcode = 2010ApJ...713L.192G|arxiv = 1001.0747 |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/713/2/L192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Balona | first1 = L. A. | title = Low frequencies in Kepler $\delta$ Scuti stars | year = 2014 | journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume = 437 | pages = 1476| bibcode = 2014MNRAS.437.1476B | doi=10.1093/mnras/stt1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars ===

{{main|Rapidly oscillating Ap star}}

Rapidly oscillating Ap stars have similar parameters to Delta Scuti variables, mostly being A- and F-type, but they are also strongly magnetic and chemically peculiar (hence the ''p'' spectral subtype).  Their dense mode spectra are understood in terms of the ''oblique pulsator model'': the modes frequencies are modulated by the magnetic field, which is not necessarily aligned with the star's rotation (as is the case in the Earth).  The oscillation modes have frequencies around 1500 μHz and amplitudes of a few mmag.

=== Slowly-pulsating B stars and Beta Cephei variables ===

{{main|Slowly pulsating B-type star|Beta Cephei variable}}

Slowly-pulsating B (SPB) stars are B-type stars with oscillation periods of a few days, understood to be high-order gravity modes excited by the kappa mechanism.  Beta Cephei variables are slightly hotter (and thus more massive), also have modes excited by the kappa mechanism and additionally oscillate in low-order gravity modes with periods of several hours.  Both classes of oscillators contain only slowly-rotating stars.

=== Variable subdwarf B stars ===

{{main|Subdwarf B star}}

Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are in essence the cores of core-helium burning giants who have somehow lost most of their hydrogen envelopes, to the extent that there is no hydrogen burning shell.  They have multiple oscillation periods that range between about 1 and 10 minutes and amplitudes anywhere between 0.001 and 0.3 mag in visible light.  The oscillations are low-order pressure modes, excited by the kappa mechanism acting on the iron opacity bump.

=== White dwarfs ===

{{main|Pulsating white dwarf}}

White dwarfs are characterized by spectral type, much like ordinary stars, except that the relationship between spectral type and effective temperature does not correspond in the same way.  Thus, white dwarfs are known by types DO, DA and DB.  Cooler types are physically possible but the Universe is too young for them to have cooled enough.  White dwarfs of all three types are found to pulsate.  The pulsators are known as GW Virginis stars (DO variables, sometimes also known as PG 1159 stars), V777 Herculis stars (DB variables) and ZZ Ceti stars (DA variables).  All pulsate in low-degree, high-order g-modes.  The oscillation periods broadly decrease with effective temperature, ranging from about 30 min down to about 1 minute.  GW Virginis and ZZ Ceti stars are thought to be  excited by the kappa mechanism; V777 Herculis stars by convective blocking.

==Space missions==

A number of past, present and future spacecraft have asteroseismology studies as a significant part of their missions (order chronological). 

*[[Wide Field Infrared Explorer|WIRE]] – A [[NASA]] satellite launched in 1999. A failed large infrared telescope, the two-inch aperture star tracker was used for more than a decade as a bright-star asteroseismology instrument. Re-entered Earth's atmosphere 2011.
*[[Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope|MOST]] –  A [[Canadian Space Agency|Canadian]] satellite launched in 2003. The first spacecraft dedicated to asteroseismology.
*[[CoRoT]] – A [[CNES|French]] led [[ESA]] planet-finder and asteroseismology satellite launched in 2006.
*[[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'']] – A [[NASA]] planet-finder spacecraft launched in 2009, repurposed as ''K2'' since the failure of a second reaction wheel prevented the telescope from continuing to monitor the same field.
*[[BRITE]] – A constellation of nanosatellites used to study the brightest oscillating stars. FIrst two satellites launched Feb 25, 2013.
*[[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] – An [[NASA]] planet-finder that will survey bright stars across most of the sky launched in 2018.
*[[PLATO (spacecraft)|PLATO]] – A planned [[ESA]] mission that will specifically exploit asteroseismology to obtain accurate masses and radii of transiting planets.

The '''Bavarian School of Public Policy''' (German: ''Hochschule für Politik München'') - is an independent institution within the [[Technical University of Munich]]. The Bavarian School of Public Policy is a unique institution, focusing on future-oriented, transdisciplinary, and applied research and teaching. In cooperation with the Technical University of Munich (TUM), the Bavarian School of Public Policy is dedicated to educating the next generation of political scientists. Technological progress in areas like energy, the environment, climate change, big data, data security, and mobility is having an increasingly important impact on the society. To keep up with tomorrow’s key technologies, the course program at HfP provides an opportunity for students to combine the traditional content of a political science degree with technology modules run by diverse TUM departments.

== History ==

The Bavarian School of Public Policy was founded during the period of upheaval that followed the end of World War II. Prompted by the US military government, and with the participation of constitutional law lecturer Prof. Hans Nawiasky, a decision was made in fall 1948 to set up an institution with the primary goal of teaching the principles of democracy. The discipline of “political science”, already well-established in the US, would serve as the school’s model. On July 14, 1950 the “Hochschule für Politische Wissenschaften” was founded – as a corporation under private law.

On October 27, 1970, the Bavarian Parliament enacted the “Law governing the Bavarian School of Public Policy”. This gave the school the status of an “institutionally autonomous institution at the University of Munich”. This made HfP the only institution of higher education in the Federal Republic of Germany whose legal basis is a higher education act unique to that institution. Moreover, the law was also the first higher education act in the Federal Republic of Germany.

In a law dated February 16, 1981, the Bavarian School of Public Policy was given the legal status of a public body. The main advantage for students was the opportunity to earn a full academic qualification and potentially carry on to complete a PhD.

The Bavarian Parliament instigated the reform process that is currently underway in October 2013. In July 2014, it decided to make the Technical University of Munich (TUM) the new host university for the Bavarian School of Public Policy. This landmark decision opens up new opportunities to develop the discipline of political science by incorporating insights from TUM’s excellent work in the social sciences, the natural sciences and engineering.

The law governing the Bavarian School of Public Policy was enacted in early December 2014, and the Constitution in January 2015. On December 18, 2014 the appointment procedure for the new HfP professorships began. Out of 350 applications from Germany and abroad, seven professors were appointed, who took up their duties at the Bavarian School of Public Policy on 1 March / 1 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/detail/article/33035/|title=Bavarian School of Public Policy ready for takeoff|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tum.de|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, the Bavarian School of Public Policy moved to its new premises in the Briennerforum at Königsplatz.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hfp.tum.de/en/studies/bachelors-program/|title=Hochschule für Politik: Bachelor’s Program|website=www.hfp.tum.de|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies ==

&lt;big&gt;Bringing Politics and Technology together&lt;/big&gt;

The Bachelor’s degree in Political Science (B.Sc.) started in the 2016/17 Winter Semester. In the 2017/18 Winter Semester the Bavarian School of Public Policy established the new Master's program in Politics &amp; Technology (M.Sc.). Both study programs based on a unique concept worldwide. This provides a "full-scale political science education with possible emphasis in policy areas at the interface between politics and technology". &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Interdisciplinary study program
* Comprehensive grounding in political science with the opportunity to specialize in focus areas at the interface of politics and technology
* Strong practical element, with a three-month, supervised internship requirement
* Diverse optional modules, allowing students to develop a personal academic profile and facilitating study abroad opportunities

According to the [[International Panel on Climate Change|IPCC's]] 2014 [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|assessment report]], "Mitigation is a public good; climate change is a case of the '[[tragedy of the commons]]'. Effective climate change mitigation will not be achieved if each agent (individual, institution or country) acts independently in its own selfish interest (see [[International cooperation]] and [[Emissions trading]]), suggesting the need for collective action. Some [[climate change adaptation|adaptation]] actions, on the other hand, have characteristics of a private good as benefits of actions may accrue more directly to the individuals, regions, or countries that undertake them, at least in the short term. Nevertheless, financing such adaptive activities remains an issue, particularly for poor individuals and countries."&lt;ref name="AR5-WG3-Chap3"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of mitigation include reducing energy demand by increasing [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[fossil fuel phase-out|phasing out fossil fuels]] by switching to [[low-carbon power|low-carbon energy]] sources, and [[Carbon dioxide removal|removing carbon dioxide]] from Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="ipcc mitigation options"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

One of the issues often discussed in relation to climate change mitigation is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) has the ultimate objective of [[Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change|preventing "dangerous" anthropogenic (i.e., human) interference of the climate system]]. As is stated in Article 2 of the Convention, this requires that greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where [[climate change and ecosystems|ecosystems]] can adapt naturally to climate change, [[climate change and agriculture|food production]] is not threatened, and [[economics of global warming|economic development]] can proceed in a sustainable fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The reason for this is that human activities are adding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it (see [[carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere]] for a complete explanation).&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt; This is analogous to a flow of water into a bathtub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of the other greenhouse gasses humans emit also depends on how fast their emissions are added to the atmosphere, and how fast the GHGs are removed. Stabilization for these gases is described in the later section on [[#Non-CO2 greenhouse gases|non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; GHGs]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 2018 an international team of scientist published research saying that the current mitigation policy in [[Paris Agreement]] is insufficient to limit the temperature rise to 2 degrees. They say that even if all the current pledges will be accomplished there is a chance for a 4.5 degree temperature rise in decades.  To preventing that, restoration of natural [[Carbon sink]]s, [[Carbon dioxide removal]], changes in society and values will be necessary.&lt;ref name="Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steffen |first1=Will |last2=Rockström |first2=Johan |last3=Richardson |first3=Katherine |last4=M.

To create lasting climate change mitigation, the replacement of high carbon [[emission intensity]] power sources, such as conventional [[fossil fuel]]s—[[oil]], [[coal]], and [[natural gas]]—with [[low-carbon power]] sources is required. Fossil fuels supply humanity with the vast majority of our energy demands, and at a growing rate. In 2012 the IEA noted that coal accounted for half the increased energy use of the prior decade, growing faster than all renewable energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/English.pdf World energy outlook 2012 (IEA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[hydroelectricity]] and [[nuclear power]] together provide the majority of the generated [[low-carbon power]] fraction of global total power consumption.

In general, higher consumption lifestyles have a greater environmental impact. Several scientific studies have shown that when people, especially those living in [[developed country|developed countries]] but more generally including all countries, wish to reduce their carbon footprint, there are four key "high-impact" actions they can take:&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017&gt;{{cite journal |title= The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions |journal= Environmental Research Letters |first1= Seth |last1= Wynes |first2= Kimberly A |last2= Nicholas |date= 12 July 2017 |volume= 12 |page= 074024 |number= 7 |doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541 |bibcode= 2017ERL....12g4024W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul P |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114.full|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089–E6096|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich.

:2. Living [[car-free movement|car-free]] (2.4 tonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

:3. Avoiding one round-trip transatlantic flight (1.6 tonnes)

:4. Eating a [[plant-based diet]] (0.8 tonnes)

These appear to differ significantly from the popular advice for “greening” one's lifestyle, which seem to fall mostly into the “low-impact” category: Replacing a typical car with a hybrid (0.52 tonnes); Washing clothes in cold water (0.25 tonnes); Recycling (0.21 tonnes); Upgrading light bulbs (0.10 tonnes); etc. The researchers found that public discourse on reducing one's carbon footprint overwhelmingly focuses on low-impact behaviors, and that mention of the high-impact behaviors is almost non-existent in the mainstream media, government publications, K-12 school textbooks, etc.&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name="PimmJenkins"/&gt;

The researchers added that “Our recommended high-impact actions are more effective than many more commonly discussed options (e.g. eating a plant-based diet saves eight times more emissions than upgrading light bulbs). More significantly, a US family who chooses to have one fewer child would provide the same level of emissions reductions as 684 teenagers who choose to adopt comprehensive recycling for the rest of their lives.”&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name="PimmJenkins"/&gt;

Overall, food accounts for the largest share of consumption-based GHG emissions with nearly 20% of the global carbon footprint, followed by housing, mobility, services, manufactured products, and construction.

====Energy efficiency and conservation====
{{Main|Efficient energy use|Energy conservation}}
[[File:Led-lampa.jpg|thumb|A 230-volt LED light bulb, with an [[Edison screw|E27]] base (10 [[watt]]s, 806 [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s).]]

Efficient energy use, sometimes simply called "energy efficiency", is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[LED lamp|LED lighting]], [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]], or natural [[skylight|skylight windows]] reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional [[incandescent light bulb]]s. [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s use only 33% of the energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; LED lamps use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires.

Energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]]. For example, the state of [[California]] began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s, including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements. During the following years, California's energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national US consumption doubled. As part of its strategy, California implemented a "loading order" for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first, renewable electricity supplies second, and new fossil-fired power plants last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses using less energy to achieve a lesser energy demanding service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter, driving less, or working in a less brightly lit room. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=2929&amp;language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Demand-side switching sources====
Fuel switching on the demand side refers to changing the type of fuel used to satisfy a need for an energy service. To meet deep decarbonization goals, like the 80% reduction by 2050 goal being discussed in California and the European Union, many primary energy changes are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate Change |publisher=California Air Resources Board |accessdate=2015-04-29 |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/cc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy in 2050 – European Commission |accessdate= 2015-04-29 |url= http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/roadmap/index_en.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150511100639/http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/roadmap/index_en.htm |archive-date= 2015-05-11 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy efficiency alone may not be sufficient to meet these goals, switching fuels used on the demand side will help lower carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/014038 |issn= 1748-9326 |volume= 8 |issue= 1 |page= 014038 |last1= Wei |first1= Max |last2= Nelson |first2= James H |last3= Greenblatt |first3= Jeffery B |last4= Mileva |first4= Ana |last5= Johnston |first5= Josiah |last6= Ting |first6= Michael |last7= Yang |first7= Christopher |last8= Jones |first8= Chris |last9= McMahon |first9= James E |last10= Kammen |first10= Daniel M |title= Deep carbon reductions in California require electrification and integration across economic sectors |journal= Environmental Research Letters |accessdate= 2015-03-21 |date= 2013-03-01 |url= http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/8/i=1/a=014038?key=crossref.37ef0d9dff3c11bf4c176aa87e4f5831|bibcode= 2013ERL.....8a4038W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Williams |first= James H. |title= The technology path to deep greenhouse gas emissions cuts by 2050: The pivotal role of electricity |journal= Science |volume= 335 |issue= 6064 |pages= 53–9 |accessdate= 2015-03-21 |date= 2012 |url= https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2mz2472z.pdf |bibcode= 2012Sci...335...53W |doi= 10.1126/science.1208365|pmid= 22116030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Progressively coal, oil and eventually natural gas for space and water heating in buildings will need to be reduced. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 45 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning [[coal]].&lt;ref name=gasdotorg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp#greenhouse/ |title=Natural Gas and the Environment |publisher=Naturalgas.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503132200/http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp#greenhouse/ |archivedate=2009-05-03 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways in which this could happen, and different strategies will likely make sense in different locations. While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very efficient [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.

At the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.

The economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. The EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2014 suggests that domestic gas prices will rise faster than electricity prices which will encourage electrification in the coming decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/ |title=Annual Energy Outlook 2015 – Energy Information Administration |publisher=Eia.gov |date=2015-04-14 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.

Alternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]]. A 2015 study by Energy+Environmental Economics shows that a hybrid approach of decarbonizing pipeline gas, electrification, and energy efficiency can meet carbon reduction goals at a similar cost as only electrification and energy efficiency in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= E3 Decarbonizing Pipeline 01-27-2015.pdf |accessdate= 2015-04-14 |url= https://ethree.com/documents/E3_Decarbonizing_Pipeline_01-27-2015.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150717182053/https://ethree.com/documents/E3_Decarbonizing_Pipeline_01-27-2015.pdf |archive-date= 2015-07-17 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Demand side grid management====
Expanding intermittent electrical sources such as [[wind power]], creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittentcy, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].

[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.

[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers would need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.

[[Demand response]] devices could receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This would allow electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. The [[vehicle-to-grid]] suggestion would use a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.

A [[Yale University]] review published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology analyzing {{CO2}} [[life cycle assessment]](LCA) emissions from nuclear power([[light water reactor]]s) determined that: "The collective LCA literature indicates that life cycle [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies."&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE"/&gt;
While some have raised uncertainty surrounding the future GHG emissions of nuclear power as a result of an extreme potential decline in uranium ore grade without a corresponding increase in the [[enriched uranium|efficiency of enrichment methods]]. In a scenario analysis of future global nuclear development, as it could be effected by a decreasing global [[uranium market]] of average ore grade, the analysis determined that depending on conditions, median life cycle nuclear power GHG emissions could be between 9 and 110&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh by 2050, with the latter high figure being derived from a "worst-case scenario" that is not "considered very robust" by the authors of the paper, as the "ore grade" in the scenario is lower than the uranium concentration in many lignite coal ashes.&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Warner |first1= E.

Although this future analyses primarily deals with extrapolations for present [[Generation II reactor]] technology, the same paper also summarizes the literature on "FBRs"/[[Fast Breeder Reactor]]s, of which two are in operation as of 2014 with the newest being the [[BN-800 reactor|BN-800]], for these reactors it states that the "median life cycle GHG emissions&amp;nbsp;...

Analysis in 2015 by Professor and Chair of Environmental Sustainability [[Barry Brook (scientist)|Barry W. Brook]] and his colleagues on the topic of replacing fossil fuels entirely, from the electric grid of the world, has determined that at the historically modest and proven-rate at which nuclear energy was added to and replaced fossil fuels in France and Sweden during each nation's building programs in the 1980s, within 10 years nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely, "allow[ing] the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Potential for Worldwide Displacement of Fossil-Fuel Electricity by Nuclear Energy in Three Decades Based on Extrapolation of Regional Deployment Data|first1=Staffan A.|last1=Qvist|first2=Barry W.|last2=Brook|date=13 May 2015|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=5|page=e0124074|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124074|pmid=25970621|pmc=4429979|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1024074Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar analysis, Brook had earlier determined that 50% of all [[world energy consumption|global energy]], that is not solely electricity, but transportation [[synfuels]] etc. could be generated within approximately 30 years, if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to each of these nation's already proven decadal rates(in units of installed [[nameplate capacity]], [[gigawatt|GW]] per year, per unit of global [[GDP]](GW/year/$).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511009189|title=Could nuclear fission energy, etc., solve the greenhouse problem?

Natural gas emits far fewer greenhouse gases (i.e. {{CO2}} and methane—CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) than coal when burned at power plants, but evidence has been emerging that this benefit could be completely negated by methane leakage at gas drilling fields and other points in the supply chain.

A study performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of [[methane emissions]] from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. More recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged the findings of this study, with researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas fields.

A 2011 study&lt;ref name="usclimatenetwork.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/resource-database/report-coal-to-gas-the-influence-of-methane-leakage |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102222215/http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/resource-database/report-coal-to-gas-the-influence-of-methane-leakage |archive-date=2015-01-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by noted climate research scientist, Tom Wigley,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Wigley]]&lt;/ref&gt; found that while carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) emissions from fossil fuel combustion may be reduced by using natural gas rather than coal to produce energy, it also found that additional methane (CH4) from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in {{CO2}} forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. The study looked at methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced {{CO2}} emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0%, and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10%. The overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century, however, are small. Petron et al.

These studies indicate that the exploitation of natural gas as a "cleaner" fuel is questionable. A 2014 meta-study of 20 years of natural gas technical literature shows that methane emissions are consistently underestimated but on a 100-year scale, the climate benefits of coal to gas fuel switching are likely larger than the negative effects of natural gas leakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume= 343 |issue= 6172 |pages= 733–35 |last1= Brandt |first1= A.

====Heat pump====
{{Main|Heat pump}}
[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]
A heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.

While [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term "heat pump" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction—releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.

It has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market. With a market share of 30% and (potentially) clean electricity, heat pumps could reduce global {{CO2}} emissions by 8% annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Staffell Iain ''et al.'' |year= 2012 |title= A review of domestic heat pumps |url= |journal= [[Energy and Environmental Science]] |volume= 5 |issue= 11 |pages= 9291–9306 |doi= 10.1039/c2ee22653g}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using ground source heat pumps could reduce around 60% of the [[primary energy]] demand and 90% of {{CO2}} emissions in Europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Carvalho |first1= |display-authors= 1 |last2= et al |year= 2015 |title= Ground source heat pump carbon emissions and primary energy reduction potential for heating in buildings in Europe—results of a case study in Portugal |url= |journal= [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] |volume= 45 |issue= |pages= 755–768 |doi= 10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sternberg André, Bardow André |year= 2015 |title= ''Power-to-What? – Environmental assessment of energy storage systems''.

With significant amounts of fossil fuel used in electricity production, demands on the electrical grid also generate greenhouse gases. Without a high share of low-carbon electricity, a domestic heat pump will produce more carbon emissions than using natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysolutionscenter.org/assets/1/Page/GHP_Position_Paper_and_apndx_031710.pdf pg 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinks and negative emissions===
{{Main|Carbon sink|Negative carbon dioxide emission}}

A [[carbon sink]] is a natural or artificial reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period, such as a growing [[forest]]. A [[negative carbon dioxide emission]] on the other hand is a permanent removal of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Examples are [[carbon capture and storage|direct air capture]], [[enhanced weathering]] technologies such as storing it in [[geologic sequestration of CO2|geologic formations]] underground and [[biochar]]. These processes are sometimes considered as variations of sinks or mitigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Reforestation and afforestation====
[[File:Shennongjia virgin forest.jpg|thumb|Transferring [[land rights]] to indigenous inhabitants is argued to efficiently conserve forests.]]
{{Main|Deforestation|Reforestation|Biosequestration}}

Almost 20 percent (8{{nbsp}}GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/year) of total greenhouse-gas emissions were from deforestation in 2007. It is estimated that avoided deforestation reduces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions at a rate of 1{{nbsp}}tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per $1–5 in [[opportunity costs]] from lost agriculture. [[Reforestation]] could save at least another 1{{nbsp}}GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/year, at an estimated cost of $5–15/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt; [[Afforestation]] is where there was previously no forest - such plantations are estimated to have to be prohibitively massive to be reduce emissions by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Lena R.

With increased [[intensive agriculture]] and [[urbanization]], there is an increase in the amount of abandoned farmland. By some estimates, for every half a hectare of original [[old-growth forest]] cut down, more than 20 hectares of new [[secondary forest]]s are growing, even though they do not have the same biodiversity as the original forests and original forests store 60% more carbon than these new secondary forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/science/earth/30forest.html?pagewanted=all|title=New Jungles Prompt a Debate on Rain Forests|publisher=New York Times |accessdate=18 July 2016|date=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, E.

Restoring grasslands store CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air into plant material. Grazing livestock, usually not left to wander, would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth.

[[File:Carbon sequestration-2009-10-07.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic showing both terrestrial and geological sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions from a coal-fired plant]]
{{Main|Carbon capture and storage}}

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a method to mitigate climate change by capturing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from large point sources such as power plants and subsequently storing it away safely instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. The IPCC estimates that the costs of halting global warming would double without CCS.&lt;ref name=guardian0916&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/09/co2-turned-into-stone-in-iceland-in-climate-change-breakthrough|title=CO2 turned into stone in Iceland in climate change breakthrough|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Energy Agency says CCS is "the most important single new technology for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; savings" in power generation and industry.&lt;ref name=futureenergysummit&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson |first=Simon |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1954176_1954175,00.html |title=How to Reduce Carbon Emissions: Capture and Store it? |publisher=[[Time.com]] |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it requires up to 40% more energy to run a CCS coal power plant than a regular coal plant, CCS could potentially capture about 90% of all the carbon emitted by the plant.&lt;ref name=futureenergysummit/&gt; Norway's [[Sleipner gas field]], beginning in 1996, stores almost a million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a year to avoid penalties in producing natural gas with unusually high levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/sleipner.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=futureenergysummit/&gt; As of late 2011, the total planned {{CO2}} storage capacity of all 14 projects in operation or under construction is over 33 million tonnes a year.

====Enhanced weathering====
Enhanced weathering is the removal of carbon from the air into the earth, enhancing the natural carbon cycle where carbon is mineralized into rock. The [[CarbFix]] project couples with carbon capture and storage in power plants to turn carbon dioxide into stone in a relatively short period of two years, addressing the common concern of leakage in CCS projects. While this project used [[basalt]] rocks, [[olivine]] has also shown promise.&lt;ref name=guardian0916/&gt;

===Geoengineering===
{{Main|Climate engineering}}

Geoengineering is seen by Olivier Sterck as an alternative to mitigation and adaptation, but by Gernot Wagner as an entirely separate response to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00635487/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climatecentral.org/news/harvard-scientists-taking-geoengineering-into-the-field-21362&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[scientific literature|literature]] assessment, Barker ''et al.''

Chapter 28 of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] report ''Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base'' (1992) defined geoengineering as "options that would involve large-scale engineering of our environment in order to combat or counteract the effects of changes in atmospheric chemistry."&lt;ref name="nas_policy_implications"&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1605&amp;page=433 Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base] (1992), [[Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy]] (COSEPUP)&lt;/ref&gt; They evaluated a range of options to try to give preliminary answers to two questions: can these options work and could they be carried out with a reasonable cost. They also sought to encourage discussion of a third question&amp;nbsp;— what adverse side effects might there be. The following types of option were examined: reforestation, increasing ocean absorption of carbon dioxide (carbon sequestration) and screening out some sunlight. NAS also argued "Engineered countermeasures need to be evaluated but should not be implemented without broad understanding of the direct effects and the potential side effects, the ethical issues, and the risks.".&lt;ref name="nas_policy_implications"/&gt; In July 2011 a report by the [[United States Government Accountability Office]] on geoengineering found that "[c]limate engineering technologies do not now offer a viable response to global climate change."&lt;ref&gt;GAO (2011).

====Carbon dioxide removal====
{{Main|Carbon dioxide removal|Greenhouse gas remediation|Carbon sequestration}}
{{See also|Carbon air capture}}

[[Carbon dioxide removal]] has been proposed as a method of reducing the amount of radiative forcing. A variety of means of artificially capturing and storing carbon, as well as of enhancing natural sequestration processes, are being explored. The main natural process is [[photosynthesis]] by plants and single-celled organisms (see [[biosequestration]]). Artificial processes vary, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of some of these processes.&lt;ref name=RoyalSociety&gt;The Royal Society, (2009) [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=35151 "Geoengineering the climate: science, governance and uncertainty"]. Retrieved 2009-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is notable that the availability of cheap energy and appropriate sites for [[carbon capture and storage|geological storage]] of carbon may make [[carbon dioxide air capture]] viable commercially. It is, however, generally expected that carbon dioxide air capture may be uneconomic when compared to [[carbon capture and storage]] from major sources&amp;nbsp;— in particular, fossil fuel powered power stations, refineries, etc. As in the case of the US [[Kemper Project]] with carbon capture, costs of energy produced will grow significantly.

The emissions caps agreed to by most developed countries under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] regulate the emissions of almost all the anthropogenic GHGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These gases are CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), the [[halocarbon|hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), and [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).

Stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of the different anthropogenic GHGs requires an understanding of their different physical properties. Stabilization depends both on how quickly GHGs are added to the atmosphere and how fast they are removed. The rate of removal is measured by the atmospheric lifetime of the GHG in question (see the [[greenhouse gas#Global warming potential|main GHG article]] for a list). Here, the lifetime is defined as the time required for a given perturbation of the GHG in the atmosphere to be reduced to 37% of its initial amount.&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt;
Methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 12 years, while N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O's lifetime is about 110 years. For methane, a reduction of about 30% below current emission levels would lead to a stabilization in its atmospheric concentration, while for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, an emissions reduction of more than 50% would be required.&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt;

[[Methane]] is a significantly more potent greenhouse gas than [[carbon dioxide]] in the amount of heat it can trap, especially in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Methane vs. Carbon Dioxide: A Greenhouse Gas Showdown|url= http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/|website= One Green Planet|accessdate= 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burning one molecule of methane generates one molecule of carbon dioxide, indicating there may be no net benefit in using gas as a fuel source.&lt;ref name="usclimatenetwork.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt; Reducing the amount of waste methane produced in the first place and moving away from use of gas as a fuel source will have a greater beneficial impact, as might other approaches to productive use of otherwise-wasted methane. In terms of prevention, vaccines are being developed in Australia to reduce the significant global warming contributions from [[methane]] released by livestock via [[flatulence]] and [[eructation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6431 Burp vaccine cuts greenhouse gas emissions] ''Rachel Nowak'' for NewScientist September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Another physical property of the anthropogenic GHGs relevant to mitigation is the different abilities of the gases to trap heat (in the form of [[infrared radiation]]). Some gases are more effective at trapping heat than others, e.g., SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is 22,200 times more effective a GHG than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a per-kilogram basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Transport===
{{Main|Sustainable transport}}
Transportation emissions account for roughly 1/4 of emissions worldwide, and are even more important in terms of impact in developed nations especially in North America and Australia. Many citizens of countries like the United States and Canada who drive personal cars often, see well over half of their climate change impact stemming from the emissions produced from their cars. Modes of mass transportation such as bus, light rail (metro, subway, etc.), and long-distance rail are far and away the most energy-efficient means of motorized transportation for passengers, able to use in many cases over twenty times less energy per person-distance than a personal automobile. Modern [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient technologies]], such as [[plug-in hybrid]] electric vehicles and [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral synthetic gasoline &amp; Jet fuel]] may also help to reduce the consumption of [[petroleum]], land use changes and emissions of [[carbon dioxide]]. Utilizing [[rail transport]], especially electric rail, over the far less efficient [[environmental impact of aviation|air transport]] and [[road transport|truck transport]]
significantly reduces emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Urban planning===
{{Main|Urban planning}}

Effective [[urban planning]] to reduce [[urban sprawl|sprawl]] aims to decrease Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT), lowering emissions from transportation. Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Between 1982 and 1997, the amount of land consumed for [[urban development]] in the United States increased by 47 percent while the nation's population grew by only 17 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.

At the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.

Approaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through "medium-density", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.&lt;!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book "Sustainability and Cities" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.--&gt;

Smarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.

====Building design====

For institutions of higher learning in the United States, greenhouse gas emissions depend primarily on total area of buildings and secondarily on climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fetcher|first=Ned|title=Effects of climate and institution size on greenhouse gas emissions from colleges and universities in the United States|journal=Sustainability: The Journal of Record|date=December 2009|volume=2|issue=6|pages=362–67|doi=10.1089/SUS.2009.9820}}&lt;/ref&gt; If climate is not taken into account, annual greenhouse gas emissions due to energy consumed on campuses plus purchased electricity can be estimated with the formula, ''E=aS''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''a'' =0.001621 metric tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent/square foot or 0.0241 metric tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent/square meter and ''b''= 1.1354.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Colleges and Universities|url=http://www.wilkes.edu/pages/4243.asp|accessdate=2 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106105803/http://www.wilkes.edu/pages/4243.asp|archive-date=2011-01-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources. Existing buildings can be made more efficient through the use of insulation, high-efficiency appliances (particularly [[hot water heater]]s and [[furnaces]]), [[insulated glazing|double- or triple-glazed gas-filled windows]], external window shades, and building orientation and siting. Renewable heat sources such as [[geothermal heat pump|shallow geothermal]] and [[passive solar]] energy reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted. In addition to designing buildings which are more energy-efficient to heat, it is possible to design buildings that are more energy-efficient to cool by using lighter-coloured, more reflective materials in the development of urban areas (e.g. by painting roofs white) and planting trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Climate change and agriculture}}
According to the [[EPA]], agricultural [[soil management]] practices can lead to production and emission of [[nitrous oxide]] (N2O), a major [[greenhouse gas]] and air pollutant. Activities that can contribute to {{chem|N|2|O}} emissions include [[fertilizer]] usage, [[irrigation]], and [[tillage]]. The management of soils accounts for over half of the emissions from the Agriculture sector. Cattle livestocks account for one third of emissions, through methane emissions. Manure management and rice cultivation also produce gaseous emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources/agriculture.html|title=Agriculture: Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions|year=2015|publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study found that farming can deplete soil carbon and render soil incapable of supporting life; however, the study also showed that [[conservation farming]] can protect carbon in soils, and repair damage over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://eos.org/research-spotlights/conservation-farming-shown-to-protect-carbon-in-soil|title=Conservation Farming Shown to Protect Carbon in Soil|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences|authors=A.

===Societal controls===
{{Main|Personal carbon credits}}

Another method being examined is to make carbon a new currency by introducing tradeable "[[personal carbon credits]]". The idea being it will encourage and motivate individuals to reduce their 'carbon footprint' by the way they live. Each citizen will receive a free annual quota of carbon that they can use to travel, buy food, and go about their business. It has been suggested that by using this concept it could actually solve two problems; pollution and poverty, old age pensioners will actually be better off because they fly less often, so they can cash in their quota at the end of the year to pay heating bills and so forth.{{citation needed|reason=previous source deadlink|date=April 2009}}

===Costs===
The [[Stern Review]] proposes stabilising the concentration of greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere at a maximum of 550ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e by 2050. The Review estimates that this would mean cutting total greenhouse-gas emissions to three quarters of 2007 levels. The Review further estimates that the cost of these cuts would be in the range −1.0 to +3.5% of World [[GDP]], (i.e. [[Gross world product|GWP]]), with an average estimate of approximately 1%.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt; Stern has since revised his estimate to 2% of GWP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/26/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange |title=Cost of tackling global climate change has doubled, warns Stern |first= Juliette |last=Jowit |first2= Patrick |last2=Wintour |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 June 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the Gross World Product (GWP) at [[purchasing power parity|PPP]] was estimated at $74.5 trillion in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mitigation costs will also vary according to how and when emissions are cut: early, well-planned action will minimise the costs.&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;Stern, N. (2006). ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change: Part III: The Economics of Stabilisation.'' HM Treasury, London: http://hm-treasury.gov.uk/sternreview_index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of estimating the cost of reducing emissions is by considering the likely costs of potential technological and output changes. Policy makers can compare the [[marginal abatement costs]] of different methods to assess the cost and amount of possible abatement over time. The marginal abatement costs of the various measures will differ by country, by sector, and over time.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt;

This was judged to be especially the case when combined with enhanced adaptation. By 2100, however, it was still judged likely that there would be significant [[effects of global warming]]. This was judged to be the case even with aggressive mitigation and significantly enhanced [[adaptive capacity]].

|doi=10.2277/0521568544|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealth, as measured by per capita income (i.e., income per head of population), varies widely between different countries. Activities of the poor that involve emissions of GHGs are often associated with basic needs, such as [[heating]] to stay tolerably warm. In richer countries, emissions tend to be associated with things like [[car]]s, [[central heating]], etc. The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human [[welfare economics|welfare]] according to wealth.

====Distributing emissions abatement costs====
There have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–105):&lt;ref name=banuri/&gt;
*'''[[Egalitarianism]]''': this system interprets the problem as one where each person has equal rights to a global resource, i.e., polluting the atmosphere.
*'''Basic needs''': this system would have emissions allocated according to basic needs, as defined according to a minimum level of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.
*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the "polluter-pays principle", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:
**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;29).&lt;ref name=goldemberg&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-521-56854-8
|doi=10.2277/0521568544|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**''Comparable burdens and ability to pay'': with this approach, countries would reduce emissions based on comparable burdens and their ability to take on the costs of reduction. Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].
**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit from reducing their emissions.
**''Carbon inheritance'':&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Insurance companies should collect a carbon levy |journal=Nature |volume=549 |issue=7671 |pages=152-154 |first1=Anthony J. |last1=Webster |last2=Clarke |first2=Richard H. |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/549152a }}&lt;/ref&gt; Is the notion that we have inherited the (technological) benefits of past emissions, and those who benefit most from them should pay the most. An energy levy has been suggested as a proxy for technological development. Rather than allocating blame for historical emissions, an energy levy pays back the benefits these technologies have brought&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Insurance companies should collect a carbon levy |journal=Nature |volume=549 |issue=7671 |pages=152-154 |first1=Anthony J. |last1=Webster |last2=Clarke |first2=Richard H. |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/549152a }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Specific proposals====
*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;106),&lt;ref name=banuri/&gt; for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.
*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;106–107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.
*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;27).&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of these technologies aids mitigation and could result in substantial reductions in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Policies include targets for emissions reductions, increased use of renewable energy, and increased energy efficiency. It is often argued that the results of climate change are more damaging in poor nations, where infrastructures are weak and few social services exist. The [[Commitment to Development Index]] is one attempt to analyze rich country policies taken to reduce their disproportionate use of the global commons. Countries do well if their greenhouse gas emissions are falling, if their gas taxes are high, if they do not subsidize the fishing industry, if they have a low fossil fuel rate per capita, and if they control imports of illegally cut tropical timber.

===Kyoto Protocol===
{{Main|Kyoto Protocol}}

The main current international agreement on combating climate change is the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. On the 11th of December 1997 it was implemented by the 3rd conference of parties, which was coming together in kyoto, which came into force on 16 February 2005. The Kyoto Protocol is an [[wikt:amendment|amendment]] to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|Countries that have ratified this protocol]] have committed to reduce their emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in [[emissions trading]] if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases. For Kyoto reporting, governments are obliged to be told on the present state of the countries forests and the related ongoing processes.

*Policies adopted by parties to the UNFCCC are too weak to meet a 2 or 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C target. However, these targets might still be achievable if more stringent mitigation policies are adopted immediately.
*Cost-effective 2&amp;nbsp;°C scenarios project annual global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before the year 2020, with deep cuts in emissions thereafter, leading to a reduction in 2050 of 41% compared to 1990 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alcamo|others|2013|pp=xiii–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Discussion on other targets
Scientific analysis can provide information on the impacts of climate change and associated policies, such as reducing GHG emissions. However, deciding what policies are best requires value judgements.&lt;ref name="wg 2 ch19 dangerous climate change"/&gt; For example, limiting global warming to 1&amp;nbsp;°C relative to pre-industrial levels may help to reduce climate change damages more than a 2&amp;nbsp;°C limit.&lt;ref&gt;"Implication for Carbon Emissions Target," in: {{harvnb|Hansen|others|2013|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1&amp;nbsp;°C limit may be more costly to achieve than a 2&amp;nbsp;°C limit.&lt;ref&gt;"4.

Emission taxes can be both cost-effective and environmentally effective.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt; Difficulties with emission taxes include their potential unpopularity, and the fact that they cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions reduction.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt; Emissions or energy taxes also often fall disproportionately on lower income classes. In developing countries, institutions may be insufficiently developed for the collection of emissions fees from a wide variety of sources.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt;

====Subsidies====
According to [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], a program of subsidization balanced against expected flood costs could pay for conversion to 100% renewable power by 2030.&lt;ref name="wws-review"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jacobson |first1= M.Z. |year= 2009 |title= Review of solutions to global warming, air pollution, and energy security |url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/PDF%20files/ReviewSolGW09.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100424234910/http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/PDF%20files/ReviewSolGW09.pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2010-04-24 |format= PDF |journal= Energy and Environmental Science |volume= 2 |issue= 2 |pages= 148–73 |doi= 10.1039/b809990c|citeseerx= 10.1.1.180.4676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobson, and his colleague Mark Delucchi, suggest that the cost to generate and transmit power in 2020 will be less than 4 cents per kilowatt hour (in 2007 dollars) for wind, about 4 cents for wave and hydroelectric, from 4 to 7 cents for geothermal, and 8 cents per kWh for solar, fossil, and nuclear power.&lt;ref name=wws&gt;{{cite journal|last1= [[Mark Z.

====Investment====
{{See also|Fossil fuel divestment}}

Another indirect method of encouraging uses of renewable energy, and pursue sustainability and environmental protection, is that of prompting investment in this area through legal means, something that is already being done at national level as well as in the field of international investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=Journal of World Energy Law and Business|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbon emissions trading====
{{Main|Carbon emissions trading}}

With the creation of a [[market (economics)|market]] for [[carbon emissions trading|trading carbon dioxide emissions]] within the Kyoto Protocol, it is likely that London financial markets will be the centre for this potentially highly lucrative business; the [[NYSE|New York]] and [[Chicago]] stock markets may have a lower trade volume than expected as long as the US maintains its rejection of the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,,1509761,00.html How high-pressure politics threatens action on climate] The Observer June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

However, emissions trading may delay the phase-out of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;''StoryOfStuff.com'' (2009) [http://storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/ "The Story of Cap and Trade"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722034154/http://www.storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/ |date=2010-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the north-east United States, a successful cap and trade program has shown potential for this solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceprogress.org/2013/02/success-of-northeast-cap-and-trade-system-shows-market-based-climate-policy-is-well-within-reach/|title=Success of Northeast Cap-and-Trade System Shows Market-Based Climate Policy Is Well Within Reach|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission.htm Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS)] from ''ec.europa.eu''&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest multi-national, greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world. It commenced operation on 1 January 2005, and all 28 member states of the [[European Union]] participate in the scheme which has created a new market in carbon dioxide allowances estimated at 35&amp;nbsp;billion Euros (US$43&amp;nbsp;billion) per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/2570.jsp The $20,000,000,000,000 question] ''Robins, Nick'' for Opendemocracy&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] was the first (voluntary) emissions market, and is soon to be followed by Asia's first market ([[Asia Carbon Exchange]]). A total of 107 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent have been exchanged through projects in 2004, a 38% increase relative to 2003 (78 Mt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e).&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbonfinance.org/docs/CarbonMarketStudy2005.pdf State and Trends of the Carbon Market] International Emissions Trading Association 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty three [[multinational corporation]]s have come together in the [[G8 Climate Change Roundtable]], a business group formed at the January 2005 [[World Economic Forum]]. The group includes [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Toyota]], [[British Airways]], and [[BP]]. On 9 June 2005 the Group published a statement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf Statement of G8 Climate Change Roundtable] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508123035/http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf |date=May 8, 2013}} Convened by the World Economic Forum June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; stating that there was a need to act on climate change and claiming that market-based solutions can help. It called on governments to establish "clear, transparent, and consistent price signals" through "creation of a long-term policy framework" that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases.

The [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] is a proposed carbon trading scheme being created by nine North-eastern and Mid-Atlantic [[United States|American]] states; [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]]. The scheme was due to be developed by April 2005 but has not yet been completed.

===Implementation===
Implementation puts into effect climate change mitigation strategies and targets. These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funding====
Implementation requires funding sources but is often beset by disputes over who should provide funds and under what conditions.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; A lack of funding can be a barrier to successful strategies as there are no formal arrangements to finance climate change development and implementation.&lt;ref name="IHDP"&gt;Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat. P, Klostermann.J.E.M (unpublished) Institutional governance barriers for the development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies, Working paper for the International Human Dimensions Programme (IHDP) conference "Earth System Governance: People, Places, and the Planet", December 2–4, Amsterdam, the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; Funding is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Mee. L. D, Dublin. H. T, Eberhard. A. A (2008) Evaluating the Global Environment Facility: A goodwill gesture or a serious attempt to deliver global benefits?, Global Environmental Change 18, 800–810&lt;/ref&gt;

====Problems====
There are numerous issues which result in a current perceived lack of implementation.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; It has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are Uncertainty, Fragmentation, Institutional void, Short time horizon of policies and politicians and Missing motives and willingness to start adapting. The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.&lt;ref name="IHDP"/&gt; The issues that arise with a system which involves international government cooperation, such as [[emissions trading|cap and trade]], could potentially be improved with a polycentric approach where the rules are enforced by many small sections of authority as opposed to one overall enforcement agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www10.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/pe/2009/04268.pdf |title=A Polycentric Approach for Coping with Climate Change |publisher=World Bank |date=October 2009 |author=Elinor Ostrom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101164212/http://www10.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/pe/2009/04268.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-01 |series=Policy Research Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about metal requirement and/or availability for essential decarbonization technoloqies such as [[photovoltaics]], [[nuclear power]], and (plug-in hybrid) [[electric vehicle]]s have also been expressed as obstacles.&lt;ref name="Tokimatsu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tokimatsu|first1=Koji|last2=Wachtmeister|first2=Henrik|last3=McLellan|first3=Benjamin|last4=Davidsson|first4=Simon|last5=Murakami|first5=Shinsuke|last6=Höök|first6=Mikael|last7=Yasuoka|first7=Rieko|last8=Nishio|first8=Masahiro|title=Energy modeling approach to the global energy-mineral nexus: A first look at metal requirements and the 2 °C target|journal=Applied Energy|date=December 2017|volume=207|pages=494–509|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occurrence====
Despite a perceived lack of occurrence, evidence of implementation is emerging internationally. Some examples of this are the initiation of NAPA's and of joint implementation. Many developing nations have made National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs) which are frameworks to prioritize adaption needs.&lt;ref name="EMJ"&gt;Preston. B. L, Westaway. R. M, Yuen. E. Y (2004) Climate adaptation planning in practice: an evaluation of adaptation plans from three developed nations, European Management Journal, 22(3) 304–314&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of many of these is supported by GEF agencies.&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (2011) Report on the twentieth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group, Subsidiary Body for Implementation, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt; Many developed countries are implementing 'first generation' institutional adaption plans particularly at the state and local government scale.&lt;ref name="EMJ"/&gt; There has also been a push towards joint implementation between countries by the UNFCCC as this has been suggested as a cost-effective way for objectives to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (2011) Annual report of the Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main|Climate change in the United States}}
Efforts to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions by the United States]] include [[energy policy of the United States|energy policies]] which encourage efficiency through programs like [[Energy Star]], [[Commercial Building Integration]], and the [[Industrial Technologies Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/index.html |title=Industrial Technologies Program: BestPractices |publisher=Eere.energy.gov |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 1998, Vice President [[Al Gore]] symbolically signed the Kyoto Protocol, but he indicated participation by the developing nations was necessary prior its being submitted for ratification by the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/12/11/kyoto/ |date=1997-12-11 |title=Clinton Hails Global Warming Pact|work= All Politics|publisher= CNN|accessdate=2006-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Transportation Secretary [[Mary Peters (politician)|Mary Peters]], with White House approval, urged governors and dozens of members of the House of Representatives to block California's first-in-the-nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks, according to e-mails obtained by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/09/25/4099/ "How the White House Worked to Scuttle California's Climate Law"], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], September 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Climate Change Science Program|US Climate Change Science Program]] is a group of about twenty federal agencies and US Cabinet Departments, all working together to address global warming.

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] pressured American scientists to suppress discussion of global warming, according to the testimony of the Union of Concerned Scientists to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the US House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Reuters, January 30, 2007, free archived version at http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0130-10.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202012017/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0130-10.htm |date=2007-02-02 }}, last visited Jan. 30, '07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Written testimony of Dr. Grifo before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the US House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at {{cite web|url=http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805213620/http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-05 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "High-quality science" was "struggling to get out," as the Bush administration pressured scientists to tailor their writings on global warming to fit the Bush administration's skepticism, in some cases at the behest of an ex-oil industry lobbyist. "Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change,' 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications." Similarly, according to the testimony of senior officers of the [[Government Accountability Project]], the White House attempted to bury the report "National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change," produced by US scientists pursuant to US law.&lt;ref&gt;written testimony of Rick Piltz before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the US House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at {{cite web |url=http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131202854/http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-31 |df=}} last visited Jan. 30, 07&lt;/ref&gt; Some US scientists resigned their jobs rather than give in to White House pressure to underreport global warming.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;

In the absence of substantial federal action, state governments have adopted emissions-control laws such as the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] in the Northeast and the [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/science/earth/in-california-a-grand-experiment-to-rein-in-climate-change.html |work=The New York Times |first=Felicity |last=Barringer |title=In California, a Grand Experiment to Rein in Climate Change |date=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developing countries====
In order to reconcile [[economic development]] with mitigating carbon emissions, [[developing countries]] need particular support, both financial and technical. One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.

An important point of contention, however, is how overseas development assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&amp;title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&amp;nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];
# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;
# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and
# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.
The main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

However, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.

In an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] "which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&amp;Cr=trade&amp;Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-governmental approaches==
While many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.

===Choices in personal actions and business operations===
Environmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]]. Common recommendations include lowering home heating and cooling usage, burning less gasoline, supporting renewable [[energy sources]], buying local products to reduce transportation, turning off unused devices, and various others.

A [[geophysicist]] at [[Utrecht University]] has urged similar institutions to hold the vanguard in voluntary mitigation, suggesting the use of communications technologies such as [[videoconferencing]] to reduce their dependence on long-haul flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Part of the difficulty is that when [[environmental impact of aviation|aviation emissions]] are made at high altitude, the climate impacts are much greater than otherwise. Others have been raising the related concerns of the increasing [[hypermobility (travel)|hypermobility]] of individuals, whether traveling for business or pleasure, involving frequent and often long distance air travel, as well as air shipment of goods.&lt;ref name="gossling"&gt;Gössling S, Ceron JP, Dubois G, Hall CM, Gössling IS, Upham P, [[Earthscan]] London (2009).

===Business opportunities and risks===
{{Main|Business action on climate change}}

On 9 May 2005 [[Jeff Immelt]], the [[chief executive]] of [[General Electric]] (GE), announced plans to reduce GE's global warming related emissions by one percent by 2012. "GE said that given its projected growth, those emissions would have risen by 40 percent without such action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7791657/ |title=Green Electric? GE unveils eco-strategy |publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2005 a group of leading [[airline]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[aerospace]] [[manufacturer]]s pledged to work together to reduce the negative [[environmental impact of aviation]], including limiting the impact of air travel on climate change by improving [[fuel efficiency]] and reducing carbon dioxide emissions of new aircraft by fifty percent per seat kilometre by 2020 from 2000 levels. The group aims to develop a common reporting system for carbon dioxide emissions per aircraft by the end of 2005, and pressed for the early inclusion of aviation in the [[European Union]]'s carbon emission trading scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/747d20ea-e1ff-11d9-bf18-00000e2511c8.html |title=Aviation groups set targets to limit their environmental impact |publisher=FT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investor response===
{{Main|Fossil fuel divestment}}
Climate change is also a concern for large institutional investors who have a long term time horizon and potentially large exposure to the negative impacts of global warming because of the large geographic footprint of their multi-national holdings. SRI ([[Socially responsible investing]]) Funds allow investors to invest in funds that meet high ESG (environmental, social, governance) standards as such funds invest in companies that are aligned with these goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/T041-C016-S001-5-mutual-funds-for-socially-responsible-investors.html |title=5 Mutual Funds for Socially Responsible Investors |publisher=Kiplinger}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proxy firm]]s can be used to draft guidelines for [[investment manager]]s that take these concerns into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ussif.org/files/publications/institutional_climate.pdf |title=Investing to Curb Climate Change |publisher=USSIF |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a legal action for [[negligence]] (or similar) to succeed, "Plaintiffs ... must show that, more probably than not, their individual injuries were caused by the risk factor in question, as opposed to any other cause. This has sometimes been translated to a requirement of a relative risk of at least two."&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Columbia J. of Env. Law, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Another route (though with little legal bite) is the [[World Heritage Convention]], if it can be shown that climate change is affecting [[World Heritage Site]]s like [[Mount Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=4950&amp;method=full |title=Climate change 'ruining' Everest |publisher=Heatisonline.org |date=2004-11-17 |access-date=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2004/11/041117_climate-belize.shtml Climate change 'ruining' Belize] BBC November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides countries suing one another, there are also cases where people in a country have taken legal steps against their own government. Legal action for instance has been taken to try to force the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatelaw.org/cases Climate Justice] Ongoing Cases&lt;/ref&gt; and against the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] and [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation|OPIC]] for failing to assess environmental impacts (including global warming impacts) under [[NEPA]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In the Netherlands and Belgium, organisations such as [[Urgenda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/dutch-government-ordered-cut-carbon-emissions-landmark-ruling|title=Dutch government ordered to cut carbon emissions in landmark ruling|first=Arthur Neslen The|last=Hague|date=24 June 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urgenda.nl/themas/klimaat-en-energie/klimaatzaak/|title=Klimaat en Energie – Thema's – Urgenda – Samen Sneller Duurzaam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tegenlicht.vpro.nl/afleveringen/2015-2016/de-klimaatzaak.html|title=VPRO Tegenlicht|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[vzw Klimaatzaak]] in Belgium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/binnenland/2.36678|title=Klimaatzaak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://klimaatzaak.eu/nl/about/|title=Over ons – Klimaatzaak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also sued their governments as they believe their governments aren't meeting the emission reductions they agreed to. Urgenda have already won their case against the Dutch government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

According to a 2004 study commissioned by [[Friends of the Earth]], [[ExxonMobil]], and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002. The group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action.&lt;ref&gt;Press release (29 January 2004). [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/exxonmobils_contribution_t_28012004.html Archived press release: Exxonmobil's contribution to global warming revealed]. Friends of the Earth Trust. Retrieved May 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Exxon]] received a subpoena. According to the ''Washington Post'' and confirmed by the company, the attorney general of New York, [[Eric Schneiderman]], opened an investigation into the possibility that the company had misled the public and investors about the risks of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/11/05/exxonmobil-under-investigation-for-misleading-the-public-about-climate-change/ |title=New York is investigating Exxon Mobil for allegedly misleading the public about climate change |publisher=The Washington Post |date=November 5, 2015 |access-date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A consumer-led response to climate change===

Low carbon investment and [[ethical banking]] has been suggested as a tactic to allow consumers to drive a low-carbon transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A.J.Webster|title=A global consumer-led strategy to tackle climate change|date=July 2018|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03364}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Roughly 5% of OECD disposable income is saved[https://data.oecd.org/hha/household-savings.htm], and could alternately be saved in low-carbon investment funds to substantially increase overall low-carbon investment. 

Voluntarily funded, low-carbon investment funds have been suggested as a way to provide revenue for adaptation costs in the post-fossil fuel era&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A.J.Webster|title=A global consumer-led strategy to tackle climate change|date=July 2018|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03364}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is suggested that voluntary donations can be invested, rather than spent, and long-term returns used to pay for adaptation costs.

==Post Democracy==

Crouch coined the term "[[post-democracy]]" in 2000 in his book ''Coping with Post-Democracy''. It designates [[State (polity)|states]] that are conducted by fully operating [[Democracy|democratic system]]s (elections are being held, governments fall and there is [[freedom of speech]]), but whose application is progressively limited. A small elite is making the tough decisions and co-opts the democratic institutions. Crouch developed the idea in an article called ''Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?''&lt;ref&gt;Colin Crouch. [http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=3997&amp;title=Is+there+a+liberalism+beyond+social+democracy%3f Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?] [[Policy Network]] , 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[think tank]] [[Policy Network]] and in his subsequent book ''The Strange Non-Death of Neo-Liberalism''. The term appeared to define a running evolution within democracies during the 21st century and is [[polemic]]al because it calls attention to recognized democracies losing some of their foundations and evolving towards an [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] regime.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Colonization resistance was first identified in 1967, and it was initially referred to as antibiotic associated susceptibility. It was observed that animals being treated with the antibiotic [[streptomycin]] were susceptible to ''[[Salmonella enterica]]'' at doses 10,000 fold lower than the standard minimal infectious dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bohnhoff M, Miller CP|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/111/2/117.long|title=Enhanced Susceptibility to Salmonella Infection in Streptomycin-Treated Mice|journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases|volume=111|issue=2|pages=117–127|year=1962|doi=10.1093/infdis/111.2.117}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to investigations about the mechanisms utilized by endogenous microbial populations that conferred protection against exogenous pathogens attempting to colonize the [[gut flora]].

It has been observed that colonization resistance can occur within the host in a 'direct' or 'indirect' manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Buffie CG, Pamer EG|title=Microbiota-mediated colonization resistance against intestinal pathogens|url=http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v13/n11/pdf/nri3535.pdf|journal=Nature Reviews Immunology|year=2013|volume=13|pages=790–801|doi=10.1038/nri3535|pmc=4194195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former refers to particular components of the microbiota directly competing with exogenous pathogens for nutritional niches (e.g. ''Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron'' directly competes with ''[[Citrobacter rodentium]]'' for [[carbohydrates]] in the [[intestinal lumen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6086/1325.long|title=Regulated virulence controls the ability of a pathogen to compete with the gut microbiota|journal=Science|year=2012|volume=336|number=6086|pages=1325–1329|doi=10.1126/science.1222195|pmid=22582016|pmc=3439148|author=Kamada N, Kim YG, Sham HP, Vallance BA, Puente JL, Martens EC, Núñez G}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or by producing growth inhibitors (e.g. ''Bacteroides thuringiensis'' can secrete [[bacteriocin]] that directly targets spore-forming ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'', thus inhibiting its growth through an unknown mechanism),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/107/20/9352.long|title=Thuricin CD, a posttranslationally modified bacteriocin with a narrow spectrum of activity against ''Clostridium difficile''|authors=Rea, MC, Sit CS, Clayton E, O'Connor PM, Whittal RM, Zheng J, Vederas JC, Ross RP, Hill C|doi=10.1073/pnas.0913554107|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=107|number=20|pages=9352–9357|pmid=20435915|pmc=2889069}}&lt;/ref&gt; that directly inhibits the colonizing pathogen. Indirect colonization resistance is thought to be mediated through the induction of [[immune]] responses in the host that concomitantly inhibit the colonizing pathogen. An example of this has been observed with ''B. thetaiotaomicron'', which can induce the host to produce antimicrobial C-type lectins [[REG3G|REGIIIγ]] and [[REGIIIβ]], both anti-microbial peptides that target [[gram-positive]] bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313/5790/1126.long|authors=Cash HL, Whitham CV, Behrendt CL, Hooper LV|title=Symbiotic bacteria direct expression of an intestinal bactericidal lectin|journal=Science|date=25 August 2006|volume=313|number=5790|pages=1126–1130|doi=10.1126/science.1127119|pmid=16931762|pmc=2716667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}} "The colours represent creative energy, and the layers of the tower imply that a conlang is built piece by piece, never completed. The tower itself also alludes to the Tower of Babel, as it has long been a tradition to demonstrate a constructed language by translating the Babel legend. The Conlang flag was decided on by a vote between many competing designs, and one of my own contributions to the conlanging world is that I was the person who facilitated this election. The winning design was drawn by Christian Thalmann, who introduced the layers. The idea of including the Tower of Babel on the flag had been introduced by Jan van Steenbergen, and the idea of placing the sun on the horizon behind it by Leland Paul. The idea of having the rising sun on the flag had been introduced by David Peterson, who saw it as representing the rise of conlanging from obscurity to popularity and notoriety."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''constructed language''' (sometimes called a '''conlang''') is a [[language]] whose [[phonology]], [[grammar]], and [[vocabulary]] are, instead of having developed [[natural language|naturally]], consciously devised for communication between intelligent beings, most commonly for use by humanoids. Constructed languages may also be referred to as '''artificial''', '''planned''' or '''invented languages'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ishtar for Belgium to Belgrade |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=554&amp;_t=ishtar_for_belgium_to_belgrade |publisher= European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases [[fictional language|fictional languages]].  There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as to ease human [[communication]] (see [[international auxiliary language]] and [[code]]), to give [[fiction]] or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism, for experimentation in the fields of [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], and [[machine learning]], for [[artistic language|artistic creation]], and for [[language game]]s. 

The expression ''planned language'' is sometimes used to indicate international auxiliary languages and other languages designed for actual use in human communication. Some prefer it to the adjective ''artificial'', as this term may be perceived as pejorative. Outside [[Esperanto culture]], the term [[language planning]] means the prescriptions given to a natural language to standardize it; in this regard, even a "natural language" may be artificial in some respects, meaning some of its words have been crafted by conscious decision. [[Linguistic prescription|Prescriptive grammar]]s, which date to ancient times for classical languages such as Latin and Sanskrit, are rule-based codifications of natural languages, such codifications being a middle ground between naïve natural selection and development of language and its explicit construction.  The term ''glossopoeia'' &lt;!--, coined by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], {see talk page; can anyone cite a use by Tolkien? Sarah Higley uses the word but does not attribute its coinage to him.}--&gt; is also used to mean language construction, particularly construction of [[artistic language]]s.&lt;ref name="higley2007"&gt;Sarah L. Higley: ''Hildegard of Bingen's Unknown Language''.  Palgrave Macmillan, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conlang speakers are rare. For example, the Hungarian census of 2001 found 4570 speakers of [[Esperanto]], 10 of [[Romanid]], two each of [[Interlingua]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]] and one each of [[Idiom Neutral]] and [[Mundolinco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepszamlalas2001.hu/hun/kotetek/18/tables/load2_39_1.html Ethnic affiliation, attachment of cultures, languages and language systems Hungarian statistical office]&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian census of 2010 found 992 speakers of Esperanto, nine of Ido, one of Edo and no speakers of [[Slovio]] or Interlingua.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sezonoj.ru/2011/12/censo/ Russian census (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planned, constructed, artificial==
The terms "planned", "constructed", and "artificial" are used differently in some traditions. For example, few speakers of [[Interlingua]] consider their language artificial, since they assert that it has no invented content: Interlingua's vocabulary is taken from a small set of natural languages, and its grammar is based closely on these source languages, even including some degree of irregularity; its proponents prefer to describe its vocabulary and grammar as standardized rather than artificial or constructed.  Similarly, [[Latino sine flexione]] (LsF) is a simplification of Latin from which the [[inflection]]s have been removed. As with Interlingua, some prefer to describe its development as "planning" rather than "constructing". Some speakers of [[Esperanto]] and [[Esperantido]]s also avoid the term "artificial language" because they deny that there is anything "unnatural" about the use of their language in human communication.

By contrast, some philosophers have argued that all human languages are conventional or artificial. [[François Rabelais]], for instance, stated: "C'est abus de dire que nous avons une langue naturelle; les langues sont par institution arbitraires et conventions des peuples."  (''It's an abuse to say that we have a natural language; languages are arbitrary and conventions of peoples by institution.'')&lt;ref&gt;[[François Rabelais]], Œvres complètes, III, 19 (Paris: Seuil, 1973), cited in Claude Piron, ''Le Defi des Langues'' (L'Harmattan, 1994) {{ISBN|2-7384-2432-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An artificial language can also refer to a language that emerges naturally out of experimental studies within the framework of [[artificial language|artificial language evolution]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Furthermore, fictional and experimental languages can be naturalistic in that they are meant to sound natural and have realistic amounts of irregularity. If a naturalistic conlang is derived ''a posteriori'' from a real-world natural language, a real-world reconstructed [[proto-language]] (such as [[Vulgar Latin]] or [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]) or a fictional proto-language, it should imitate natural processes of [[phonology|phonological]], lexical, and [[grammar|grammatical]] change. In contrast with Interlingua, they are not usually intended for easy learning or communication, and most artlangers do not consider Interlingua to be naturalistic in the sense in which this term is used in artlang criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0908E&amp;L=CONLANG&amp;D=0&amp;T=0&amp;P=5208 "Re: "Naturalistic" for auxlangers vs artlangers?"]  AUXLANG mailing list post by Jörg Rhiemeier, 30 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a naturalistic fictional language tends to be more difficult and complex. While Interlingua has simpler grammar, syntax, and orthography than its source languages (though more complex and irregular than Esperanto or its descendants), naturalistic fictional languages typically mimic behaviors of natural languages like [[irregular verbs]] and nouns and complicated phonological processes.

==Overview==

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

In terms of purpose, most constructed languages can broadly be divided into:

*''[[Engineered language]]s'' (''engelangs'' {{IPA|/ˈɛnd͡ʒlæŋz/}}), further subdivided into logical languages (''loglangs''), [[philosophical language]]s and [[experimental language]]s; devised for the purpose of experimentation in [[logic]], [[philosophy]], or [[linguistics]];
*''[[International auxiliary language|Auxiliary language]]s'' (''auxlangs'') devised for international communication (also IALs, for International Auxiliary Language);
*''[[Artistic language]]s'' (''artlangs'') devised to create aesthetic pleasure or humorous effect, ''just for fun''; usually secret languages and mystical languages are classified as artlangs.

The boundaries between these categories are by no means clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Glosso/Glossopoeia.html The "Conlang Triangle"] by Raymond Brown.  Accessed 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  A constructed language could easily fall into more than one of the above categories. A logical language created for [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] reasons would also be classifiable as an artistic language, which might be created by someone with philosophical motives intending for said conlang to be used as an auxiliary language. There are no rules, either inherent in the process of language construction or externally imposed, that would limit a constructed language to fitting only one of the above categories.

A constructed language can have native speakers if young children learn it from parents who speak it fluently. According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there are "200–2000 [[native Esperanto speakers|who speak Esperanto as a first language]]". A member of the [[Klingon Language Institute]], [[d'Armond Speers]], attempted to raise his son as a native (bilingual with English) [[Klingon language|Klingon]] speaker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.08/mustread.html?pg=8 Gavin Edwards: ''Babble On Revisited'', Wired Magazine, Issue 7.08, August 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2018}}

As soon as a constructed language has a community of fluent speakers, especially if it has numerous native speakers, it begins to evolve and hence loses its constructed status. For example, [[Modern Hebrew]] and its pronunciation norms were developed from existing traditions of [[Hebrew]], such as [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] and [[Biblical Hebrew]] following a general [[Sephardic]] pronunciation, rather than engineered from scratch, and has undergone considerable changes since the state of [[Israel]] was founded in 1948 (Hetzron 1990:693). However, linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] argues that Modern Hebrew, which he terms "Israeli", is a Semito-European hybrid based not only on Hebrew but also on [[Yiddish]] and other languages spoken by revivalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns], Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Journal of Language Contact, Varia 2, pp. 40-67 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckermann therefore endorses the translation of the Hebrew Bible into what he calls "Israeli".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212397385&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Let my people know!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916161700/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212397385&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=2011-09-16 }}, Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Jerusalem Post, May 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Esperanto]] as a living spoken language has evolved significantly from the prescriptive blueprint published in 1887, so that modern editions of the ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', a 1903 collection of early texts in the language, require many footnotes on the syntactic and lexical differences between early and modern Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', ed. L. L. Zamenhof, 1903; 18th edition with footnotes by Gaston Waringhien, UEA 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of constructed languages often have many reasons for using them. The famous but disputed [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is sometimes cited; this claims that the language one speaks influences the way one thinks. Thus, a "better" language should allow the speaker to think more clearly or intelligently or to encompass more points of view; this was the intention of [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in creating [[Láadan]], a feminist language&lt;ref name="foer-2012" /&gt; embodied in her [[feminist science fiction]] series ''[[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|Native Tongue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"My hypothesis was that if I constructed a language designed specifically to provide a more adequate mechanism for expressing women's perceptions, women would (a) embrace it and begin using it, or (b) embrace the idea but not the language, say "Elgin, you've got it all wrong!" and construct some other "women's language" to replace it."  {{cite web|title=Interview With Suzette Haden Elgin |last=Glatzer |first=Jenna |work= |url=http://www.absolutewrite.com/novels/suzette_haden_elgin.htm |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612005757/http://www.absolutewrite.com/novels/suzette_haden_elgin.htm |archivedate=2007-06-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A constructed language could also be used to ''restrict'' thought, as in [[George Orwell]]'s [[Newspeak]], or to ''simplify'' thought, as in [[Toki Pona]]. In contrast, linguists such as [[Steven Pinker]] argue that ideas exist independently of language. For example, in the book ''[[The Language Instinct]]'', Pinker states that children spontaneously re-invent slang and even grammar with each generation. These linguists argue that attempts to control the range of human thought through the reform of language would fail, as concepts like "freedom" will reappear in new words if the old words vanish.

Proponents claim a particular language makes it easier to express and understand concepts in one area, and more difficult in others.  An example can be taken from the way various [[programming language]]s make it easier to write certain kinds of programs and harder to write others.

Another reason cited for using a constructed language is the telescope rule, which claims that it takes less time to first learn a simple constructed language and then a natural language, than to learn only a natural language. Thus, if someone wants to learn English, some suggest learning [[Basic English]] first. Constructed languages like Esperanto and Interlingua are in fact often simpler due to the typical lack of [[regular and irregular verbs|irregular verbs]] and other grammatical quirks. Some studies have found that learning Esperanto helps in learning a non-constructed language later (see [[propaedeutic value of Esperanto]]).

[[Codes for constructed languages]] include the [[ISO 639-2]] "&lt;tt&gt;[[Codes for constructed languages|art]]&lt;/tt&gt;" for conlangs; however, some constructed languages have their own [[ISO 639]] language codes (e.g. "&lt;tt&gt;eo&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;epo&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Esperanto]], "jbo" for [[Lojban]], "&lt;tt&gt;ia&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;ina&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Interlingua]], "&lt;tt&gt;tlh&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Klingon language|Klingon]] and "&lt;tt&gt;io&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;ido&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Ido (language)|Ido]]).

==''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' languages==

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

An ''a priori'' constructed language is one whose features (including vocabulary, grammar, etc.) are not based on an existing language, and an ''a posteriori'' language is the opposite. This categorization, however, is not absolute, as many constructed languages may be both ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' depending on which linguistic factors of them are observed.

===''A priori'' language===

An ''a priori'' language (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''a priori'', "from the former") is any constructed language of which all or a number of features are not based on existing languages, but rather invented or elaborated as to work in a different way or to allude different purposes. Some ''a priori'' languages are designed to be [[international auxiliary language]]s that remove what could be considered an unfair learning advantage for native speakers of a source language that would otherwise exist for ''a posteriori'' languages. Others, known as [[philosophical language|philosophical]] or [[taxonomic languages]], try to categorize their vocabulary, either to express an underlying philosophy or to make it easier to recognize new vocabulary.

====Experimental====
There have been many languages constructed to test linguistic hypotheses (such as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]) and/or to explore innovative or invented linguistic features. They are therefore necessarily designed with ''a priori'' features. Examples include [[Ithkuil]], [[Kotava]], [[Lojban]] (and its predecessor [[Loglan]], both of which are also schematic), and even the fictional-setting [[Láadan]].

====Artistic====
Most [[artistic language]]s, i.e. those created for amusement or to serve as natural languages of fictional worlds, are largely ''a priori'' in both vocabulary and grammar. Among classical "fictional natural languages" are [[Klingon language|Klingon]] from the science-fiction franchise ''[[Star Trek]]'' and [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|the languages created]] by fantasy writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Other examples include [[Dothraki]] and [[Valyrian]] from ''[[Game of Thrones]]', '[[The 100 (TV series)|Trigedasleng]] from [[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]], [[Atlantean language|Atlantean]] from ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', [[Kēlen]] by Sylvia Sotomayor and [[aUI (language)|aUI]] by W. John Weilgart. [[Láadan]] is both experimental and artistic.

===''A posteriori'' language===
An '''''a posteriori'' language''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''a posteriori'', "from the latter"), according to [[Louis Couturat]], is any constructed language whose elements are borrowed from or based on existing languages. The term can also be extended to [[controlled language|controlled versions]] of existing languages, and is most commonly used to refer to vocabulary despite other features. In distinguishing whether the language is ''a priori'' or ''a posteriori'', the prevalence and distribution of respectable traits is often the key. They may be controlled, naturalistic or schematic.

====Controlled====
A [[controlled language]] is a version of a [[natural language]] with improvements intended to make it easier to learn and to use, such as reduced vocabulary, simplified grammar, etc. These include:
*[[Latino sine flexione]]
*Controlled versions of English:
**[[Basic English]] 
**[[Special English]]
**[[Globish (Gogate)|Globish]]

====Naturalistic====
Naturalistic languages are constructed languages which largely imitate the grammar and vocabulary of a particular group of related languages within a [[language family|family]], thus being potentially [[zonal constructed language|zonal]], i.e. auxiliary between speakers of these languages.
*[[Occidental language|Occidental]] (also called Interlingue)
*[[Interlingua de IALA]]
*[[Interslavic language|Interslavic]]
*[[Folkspraak]]
*[[Lingua Franca Nova]]

===Schematic===
A constructed language is considered schematic when it features a more original grammar, which is usually precise and regular to avoid ambiguities and other obstacles to an easy study, and a vocabulary coming from languages of different families, to make it as recognizable as possible for potential [[international auxiliary language|international auxiliary]] purposes. For that they can be described as half ''a priori'', half ''a posteriori''. There have been many attempts of developing languages with these characteristics, including:
*[[Volapük]]
*[[Esperanto]] and the [[Esperantido]]s:
**[[Ido (language)|Ido]]
**[[Mundolinco]]
*[[Lojban]] (and [[Loglan]])
*[[Glosa]] (and [[Interglossa]])
*[[Lingwa de planeta]]
*[[Sambahsa]]
*[[Toki Pona]]
*[[Sona language (artificial)|Sona]]

==History==

===Ancient linguistic experiments===
Grammatical speculation dates from [[Classical Antiquity]], appearing for instance in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' in Hermogenes's contention that words are not inherently linked to what they refer to; that people apply "a piece of their own voice&amp;nbsp;... to the thing". [[Athenaeus]] of Naucratis, in Book III of [[Deipnosophistae]], tells the story of two figures: Dionysius of Sicily and Alexarchus. Dionysius of Sicily created [[neologism]]s like ''menandros'' "virgin" (from ''menei'' "waiting" and ''andra'' "husband"), ''menekratēs'' "pillar" (from ''menei'' "it remains in one place" and ''kratei'' "it is strong"), and ''ballantion'' "javelin" (from ''balletai enantion'' "thrown against someone"). Incidentally, the more common Greek words for those three are ''parthenos'', ''stulos'', and ''akon''. [[Alexarchus of Macedon]], the brother of King Cassander of Macedon, was the founder of the city of Ouranopolis. Athenaeus recounts a story told by Heracleides of Lembos that Alexarchus "introduced a peculiar vocabulary, referring to a rooster as a "dawn-crier," a barber as a "mortal-shaver," a drachma as "worked silver"...and a herald as an ''aputēs'' [from ''ēputa'' "loud-voiced"]. "He once wrote something...to the public authorities in Casandreia...As for what this letter says, in my opinion not even the [[Apollo|Pythian god]] could make sense of it." While the mechanisms of grammar suggested by classical philosophers were designed to explain existing languages ([[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Sanskrit]]), they were not used to construct new grammars. Roughly contemporary to Plato, in his descriptive grammar of Sanskrit, [[Pāṇini]] constructed a set of rules for explaining language, so that the text of his grammar may be considered a mixture of natural and constructed language.

===Early constructed languages===
[[File:68r.jpg|thumb|Page 68r of the [[Voynich manuscript]]. This three-page foldout from the manuscript includes a chart that appears astronomical.]]

A legend recorded in the seventh-century [[Irish language|Irish]] work [[Auraicept na n-Éces]] claims that [[Fénius Farsaid]] visited [[Shinar]] after the [[confusion of tongues]], and he and his scholars studied the various languages for ten years, taking the best features of each to create ''in Bérla tóbaide'' ("the selected language"), which he named [[Old Irish|''Goídelc'']]—the Irish language. This appears to be the first mention of the concept of a constructed language in literature.

The earliest non-natural languages were considered less "constructed" than "super-natural", mystical, or divinely inspired. The [[Lingua Ignota]], recorded in the 12th century by St. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] is an example, and apparently the first entirely artificial language.&lt;ref name="foer-2012"&gt;Joshua Foer, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/12/24/121224fa_fact_foer "John Quijada and Ithkuil, the Language He Invented"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Dec. 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a form of private mystical [[cant (language)|cant]] (see also [[Enochian|language of angels]]). An important example from Middle-Eastern culture is [[Balaibalan]], invented in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="higley2007"/&gt;  [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] grammatical speculation was directed at recovering the original language spoken by [[Adam and Eve]] in [[Paradise]], lost in the [[confusion of tongues]]. The first [[Christian]] project for an ideal language is outlined in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', where he searches for the ideal [[Italian language|Italian]] vernacular suited for literature. [[Ramon Llull]]'s ''[[Ramon Llull#Ars generalis ultima (Ars Magna)|Ars Magna]]'' was a project of a perfect language with which the infidels could be convinced of the truth of the Christian faith. It was basically an application of [[combinatorics]] on a given set of concepts.{{Vague|date=October 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} During [[the Renaissance]], Lullian and Kabbalistic ideas were drawn upon in a magical context, resulting in [[cryptography|cryptographic]] applications. The [[Voynich manuscript]] may be an example of this.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Perfecting language===
Renaissance interest in [[Ancient Egypt]], notably the discovery of the ''[[Hieroglyphica]]'' of [[Horapollo]], and first encounters with the [[Chinese script]] directed efforts towards a perfect written language. [[Johannes Trithemius]], in ''Steganographia'' and ''Polygraphia'', attempted to show how all languages can be reduced to one. In the 17th century, interest in [[Magical thinking|magical]] languages was continued by the [[Rosicrucians]] and [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] (like [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and his [[Enochian]]). [[Jakob Boehme]] in 1623 spoke of a "natural language" (''Natursprache'') of the senses.

[[Musical language]]s from the Renaissance were tied up with [[mysticism]], magic and [[alchemy]], sometimes also referred to as the [[language of the birds]]. The [[Solresol]] project of 1817 re-invented the concept in a more pragmatic context.

===17th and 18th century: advent of philosophical languages===
The 17th century saw the rise of projects for "philosophical" or "a priori" languages, such as:

*[[Francis Lodwick]]'s ''A Common Writing'' (1647) and ''The Groundwork or Foundation laid (or So Intended) for the Framing of a New Perfect Language and a Universal Common Writing'' (1652)
* Sir [[Thomas Urquhart]]'s ''Ekskybalauron'' (1651) and ''Logopandecteision''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/urquhart/index.html|title=Logopandecteision|work=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1652)
* [[George Dalgarno]]'s ''Ars signorum'', 1661
* [[John Wilkins]]' ''Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language'', 1668

These early taxonomic conlangs produced systems of hierarchical classification that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression.  [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] had a similar purpose for his ''lingua generalis'' of 1678, aiming at a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically, as a side-effect developing [[binary calculus]]. These projects were not only occupied with reducing or modelling grammar, but also with the arrangement of all human knowledge into "characters" or hierarchies, an idea that with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] would ultimately lead to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''.  Many of these 17th−18th centuries conlangs were [[Pasigraphy|pasigraphies]], or purely written languages with no spoken form or a spoken form that would vary greatly according to the native language of the reader.&lt;ref name="einstein1884"&gt;[[Leopold Einstein]], "Al la historio de la Provoj de Lingvoj Tutmondaj de Leibnitz ĝis la Nuna Tempo", 1884.  Reprinted in ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', UEA 1992 [1903].&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally in a tree diagram, and consequently to construct an ''a priori'' language based on such a classification of concepts. Under the entry ''Charactère'', [[D'Alembert]] critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century. After the ''Encyclopédie'', projects for ''a priori'' languages moved more and more to the lunatic fringe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early 20th century (e.g. [[Ro (language)|Ro]]), but most recent [[engineered language]]s have had more modest goals; some are limited to a specific field, like mathematical formalism or calculus (e.g. [[Lincos (artificial language)|Lincos]] and [[programming language]]s), others are designed for eliminating syntactical ambiguity (e.g., [[Loglan]] and [[Lojban]]) or maximizing conciseness (e.g., [[Ithkuil]]&lt;ref name="foer-2012" /&gt;).

===19th and 20th centuries: auxiliary languages===
{{main article|International auxiliary language}}
Already in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' attention began to focus on ''a posteriori'' auxiliary languages. [[Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve]] in the article on ''Langue'' wrote a short proposition of a "laconic" or regularized grammar of [[French (language)|French]]. During the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) were proposed, so that [[Louis Couturat]] and [[Léopold Leau]] in ''Histoire de la langue universelle'' (1903) reviewed 38 projects.

The first of these that made any international impact was [[Volapük]], proposed in 1879 by [[Johann Martin Schleyer]]; within a decade, 283 Volapükist clubs were counted all over the globe. However, disagreements between Schleyer and some prominent users of the language led to schism, and by the mid-1890s it fell into obscurity, making way for [[Esperanto]], proposed in 1887 by [[L. L. Zamenhof|Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof]], and its [[Esperantido|descendants]].  [[Interlingua]], the most recent auxlang to gain a significant number of speakers, emerged in 1951, when the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] published its [[Interlingua–English Dictionary]] and an accompanying [[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|grammar]]. The success of Esperanto did not stop others from trying to construct new auxiliary languages, such as Leslie Jones' [[Eurolengo]], which mixes elements of English and Spanish.

[[Loglan]] (1955) and its descendants constitute a pragmatic return to the aims of the ''a priori'' languages, tempered by the requirement of usability of an auxiliary language. Thus far, these modern ''a priori'' languages have garnered only small groups of speakers.

[[Robot Interaction Language]] (2010) is a spoken language that is optimized for communication between machines and humans. The major goals of ROILA are that it should be easily learnable by the human user, and optimized for efficient recognition by computer [[speech recognition]] algorithms.

===Artlangs===
{{main article|Artistic language}}
Language can be artistic to the extent that artists use language as a source of creativity in art, poetry, calligraphy or as a metaphor to address themes as cultural diversity and the vulnerability of the individual in a globalizing world. 

Some people prefer however to take pleasure in constructing, crafting a language by a conscious decision for reasons of literary enjoyment or aesthetic reasons without any claim of usefulness. Such [[Artistic language|artistic languages]] begin to appear in Early Modern literature (in [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]], and in [[Utopia]]n contexts), but they only seem to gain notability as serious projects beginning in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="higley2007" /&gt;  ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'' (1912) by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] was possibly the first fiction of that century to feature a constructed language. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] developed a family of related fictional languages and discussed artistic languages publicly, giving a lecture entitled "''[[A Secret Vice]]''" in 1931 at a congress. (Orwell's Newspeak is considered a satire of an [[International auxiliary language|IAL]] rather than an artistic language proper.)

By the beginning of the first decade of the 21st century, it had become common for science-fiction and fantasy works set in other worlds to feature constructed languages, or more commonly, an extremely limited but defined vocabulary which ''suggests'' the existence of a complete language, and constructed languages are a regular part of the genre, appearing in ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Lord of the Rings]] ([[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish]])'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]] ([[Dothraki language]] and [[Valyrian languages]])'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' and the ''[[Myst]]'' series of computer adventure games.

==Modern conlang organizations==
Various paper zines on constructed languages were published from the 1970s through the 1990s, such as ''Glossopoeic Quarterly'', ''Taboo Jadoo'', and ''The Journal of Planned Languages''.&lt;ref name="rosta2007"&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/ge/bhaelvhua/vhurtaethuan.html "How did you find out that there were other conlangers?"] Conlang list posting by And Rosta, 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
The Conlang Mailing List was founded in 1991, and later split off an AUXLANG mailing list dedicated to international auxiliary languages. &lt;!-- to do: find exact date of Conlang/Auxlang split --&gt;  In the early to mid-1990s a few conlang-related zines were published as email or websites, such as ''Vortpunoj''&lt;ref name="vortpunoj"&gt;[http://revo.bierfaristo.com/vortpunoj.html Archives of ''Vortpunoj''] at Steve Brewer's website&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Model Languages''.  The Conlang mailing list has developed a community of [[List of language inventors|conlangers]] with its own customs, such as translation challenges and [[translation relay]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0003/languages.php Audience, Uglossia, and Conlang: Inventing Languages on the Internet] by Sarah L. Higley. M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 3.1 (2000). ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050616085932/http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0003/languages.php |date=June 16, 2005 }}, media-culture.org.au site sometimes has problems.)&lt;/ref&gt; and its own terminology.  Sarah Higley reports from results of her surveys that the demographics of the Conlang list are primarily men from North America and western Europe, with a smaller number from Oceania, Asia, the Middle East, and South America, with an age range from thirteen to over sixty; the number of women participating has increased over time.

More recently founded online communities include the [[Zompist]] Bulletin Board (ZBB; since 2001) and the Conlanger Bulletin Board.  Discussion on these forums includes presentation of members' conlangs and feedback from other members, discussion of natural languages, whether particular conlang features have natural language precedents, and how interesting features of natural languages can be repurposed for conlangs, posting of interesting short texts as translation challenges, and meta-discussion about the philosophy of conlanging, conlangers' purposes, and whether conlanging is an art or a hobby.&lt;ref name="higley2007"/&gt;  Another 2001 survey by Patrick Jarrett showed an average age of 30.65, with the average time since starting to invent languages 11.83 years.&lt;ref name="jarrett2001"&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/bhe/gherque/chivirchein.html "Update mailing list statistics—FINAL"], Conlang list posting by Patrick Jarrett, 13 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent thread on the ZBB showed that many conlangers spend a relatively small amount of time on any one conlang, moving from one project to another; about a third spend years on developing the same language.&lt;ref name="avg_age"&gt;[http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=28831 "Average life of a conlang"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614035040/http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=28831 |date=2011-06-14 }} thread on Zompist Bulletin Board, 15 August 2008; accessed 26 August 2008.&lt;br/&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/wu/seifi/phirqondal.html "Average life of a conlang"] thread on Conlang mailing list, 27 August 2008 (should be archived more persistently than the ZBB thread)&lt;/ref&gt;{{portal|Constructed languages}}

'''Critical university studies (CUS)''' is a new field examining the role of [[higher education]] in contemporary society and its relation to culture, politics, and labor. Arising primarily from [[Cultural Studies]], it takes a [[Critical theory|critical stance]] toward changes to the university since the 1970s, particularly the shift away from a strong [[Public university|public model]] of higher education to a [[neoliberal]] [[privatized]] model. Emerging largely in the United States, which has the most extensive system of higher education, the field has also seen significant work in the United Kingdom, as well as in other countries confronting neoliberalism. Key themes of CUS research are [[corporatization]], academic labor, and [[student debt]], among other issues.

Like those doing research under the banner of [[Critical Legal Studies]] (CLS), scholars of Critical University Studies often have an activist bent.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''[http://www.robertounger.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-critical-legal-studies-movement-another-time-a-greater-task.pdf The Critical Legal Studies Movement]''. New York: Verso, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; CLS and CUS both analyze powerful institutions in order to draw attention to structural inequalities and embedded practices of exploitation and marginalization. In addition, both fields seek to move beyond abstract theorizing, targeting institutional practices and making proposals for policy changes.

In contrast to CLS, which has roots in elite institutions like [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]], CUS largely comes out of public colleges and universities. While CLS has tended to seek remedies in the legal system, CUS has gravitated toward student and labor union movements. Moreover, CUS has emphasized investigative reportage and exposés of current institutional policies and practices alongside academic work. Rather than a uniform group, CUS includes a range of scholars, critics, and activists, among them [[Tenure|tenured professors]], graduate students, and [[Adjunct professors in North America|adjunct instructors]].

== History ==
The term “Critical University Studies” was first defined in print by Jeffrey J. Williams in a 2012 article in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''.&lt;ref name= "Jeff"&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. "[http://www.chronicle.com/article/An-Emerging-Field-Deconstructs/130791 An Emerging Field Deconstructs Academe]." ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', February 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaschik, Scott.

This new work has primarily come from [[Literary Studies|literary]] and cultural critics, as well as those in [[Education Studies|education]], history, [[sociology]], and [[labor studies]].&lt;ref name= "Jeff"/&gt; As Williams notes, criticism of higher education has a strong tradition, and scholars like Heather Steffen have traced CUS's lineage at least to the early 20th century, for example to [[Thorstein Veblen]]’s ''The Higher Learning in America: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Business Men'' (1918) and [[Upton Sinclair]]’s ''The Goose-Step: A Study of American Education'' (1923), which criticize the influence of business principles and [[Gilded Age]] wealth on the emerging university system.&lt;ref&gt;Steffen, Heather. “[https://www.academia.edu/426574/Intellectual_Proletarians_in_the_20th_Century Intellectual Proletarians in the 20th Century.]” ''Chronicle of Higher Education.''

''[https://archive.org/details/goosestepstudyof00sinc The Goose-Step: A Study of American Higher Education.] Whitefish: Kessinger, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the 1960s saw a great deal of criticism of social institutions, and much focused on university campuses. [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) started with a strong statement about higher education, and [[anti-war]] and [[civil rights]] protests were a major presence on US campuses. The [[Critical Pedagogy]] movement, inspired by [[Paolo Freire]] and furthered by [[Henry Giroux]] and others, arose from this moment.&lt;ref&gt;Loughead, Tanya. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WXy9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=critical+university+studies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I1dhTaSq6V&amp;sig=Ed4JM6WKR5X2zpM4LelCM5t0nkc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU-oGAnfbVAhWJq1QKHVi3D-I4KBDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=critical%20university%20studies&amp;f=false Critical University: Moving Higher Education Forward]''. Lanham: MD, Lexington Books, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[feminist movement]] also played a role in criticism of the university during the ‘60s and ‘70s, with activists like [[Adrienne Rich]] calling for “a women-centered university.”&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Adrienne. “Toward a Woman-Centered University.” ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Lies_Secrets_and_Silence_Selected_Pro.html?id=wSm6BwAAQBAJ On Lies, Secrets, and Silence: Selected Prose]'' 1966-1978. New York: Norton, 1979. 125-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[Bayh-Dole Act]] granted universities the right to patent their inventions, thereby encouraging them to conduct research with business aims in mind. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, critics began to address the new direction of higher education, often coming from the graduate student unionization movement.&lt;ref name= "Williams"/&gt; Some met in conferences such as “Reworking/Rethinking the University” at the [[University of Minnesota]] (2008–11), or came out of groups such as Edu-factory, which was inspired by the Italian [[autonomist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://rethinkingtheu.wordpress.com/ Conference – Beneath the University, the Commons]." Reworking/Rethinking the University. November 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Edu-factory Collective, ed.

New York, NY: Autonomedia, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This first wave of CUS publications addressed the corporatization of higher education, along with the exploitation of academic labor and the rise of student debt. Key texts from this period include Sheila Slaughter and Larry Leslie's ''Academic Capitalism: Politics, Policies, and the Entrepreneurial University'' (1997), [[David F. Noble|David Noble's]] ''Digital Diploma Mills: The Automation of Higher Education'' (2001), Marc Bousquet's “The Waste Product of Graduate Education” (2002) and ''How the University Works: Higher Education and the Low-Wage Nation'' (2008).&lt;ref name= "Ethos"&gt;Walker, Katherine, and Benjamin Mangrum.

More recently, a second wave of CUS scholars have widened the field's scope to address issues including universities’ reliance on proprietorial technology, the dominance of [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial values]], and [[globalization]]. Notable texts in this vein include Newfield's ''The Great Mistake: How We Wrecked Public Universities and How We Can Fix Them'' (2016), [[Benjamin Ginsberg (political scientist)|Benjamin Ginsberg's]] ''The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters'' (2011), Robert Samuels’ ''Why Public Higher Education Should Be Free: How to Decrease Cost and Increase Quality at American Universities'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;Newfield, Christopher.

In addition, after Britain adopted neoliberal policies and raised tuitions from minor fees to major levels, critics such as Stefan Collini, in “Browne’s Gamble” (2010), and Andrew McGettigan, in ''The Great University Gamble: Money, Markets, and the Future of Higher Education'' (2013), focused on the United Kingdom. Meng-Hsuan Chou, Isaac Kamola, and Tamson Pietsch's edited volume ''The Transnational Politics of Higher Education'' (2016) looks at globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Collini, Stefan. “[https://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n21/stefan-collini/brownes-gamble Browne’s Gamble],” ''London Review of Books'', 32(21): 23-25, 4 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGettigan, Andrew.

London: Routledge, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key themes ==
Although continually responding to new trends in higher education, Critical University Studies has so far concerned itself with several key themes:

* [[Privatization]] and Corporatization: CUS research shows the various ways that public investment in universities has decreased as costs have been shifted to students and their families. As a 2014 report from public policy organization [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] shows, state funding for higher education has progressively decreased since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Hiltonsmith, Robert, and Tamara Draut. "[http://www.demos.org/publication/great-cost-shift-continues-state-higher-education-funding-after-recession The Great Cost Shift Continues: State Higher Education Funding After the Recession]." Demos. March 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, universities appear to be acting more and more like corporations, enhancing managerial administration, cutting full-time faculty labor, and treating students like customers. The result is a higher education system that functions as “a mercantile market rather than a public realm apart from the market,” with those attending reconfigured “as job seekers rather than as citizens” — a dramatic alteration from the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Humanism|humanistic]] university of the postwar US.&lt;ref name ="Williams"&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. “The Need for Critical University Studies,” in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=23SwCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=A+New+Deal+for+the+Humanities:+Liberal+Arts+and+the+Future+of+Public+Higher+Education&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s A New Deal for the Humanities: Liberal Arts and the Future of Public Higher Education]''. Edited by Gordon Hutner and Feisal G. Mohamed. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2016. 145-157.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wage labour|Labor]]: According to the New Faculty Majority, a US-based adjunct advocacy group that formed in 2009, three quarters of college faculty are now off the tenure track, with no access to the job stability that universities historically provided.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newfacultymajority.info/facts-about-adjuncts/ Facts about adjuncts]." New Faculty Majority. January 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this group, over half are adjunct or part-time workers, positions characterized by low wages and lack of [[job security]]. CUS takes issue with this new norm of [[Precarious work|precarious labor]], as well as with the increasing burden on graduate students to take on heavy teaching loads. As such, CUS has organic connections to [[graduate student unionization]] and adjunct labor organization efforts.&lt;ref name= "Jeff" /&gt;
* Student Debt: In 2015, 68% of graduating students in the US left college with some student loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Zack. "[https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2017/02/21/student-loan-debt-statistics-2017/#48b00e25daba Student Loan Debt In 2017: A $1.3 Trillion Crisis]." Forbes, February 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a dramatic increase from student debt during previous eras of higher education, a development that CUS attributes to the effects of neoliberal policies on universities. For one thing, higher education now tends to be framed as a private endeavor rather than as a public service, a shift that has resulted in reductions to state funding and subsequent increases in tuition costs.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, Michael J. “State Preferences for Higher Education Spending: A Panel Data Analysis, 1977-2001.” ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/What_s_Happening_to_Public_Higher_Educat.html?id=9dFLSnKeKP8C What’s Happening to Public Higher Education? The Shifting Financial Burden]''. Ed. Ronald G. Ehrenberg. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006. 3-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, college student loan debt has increased nearly 1000% (while the price of consumer goods has increased only about 250%).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/cost-of-college-degree-increase-12-fold-1120-percent-bloomberg_n_1783700.html Cost Of College Degree In U.S. Has Increased 1,120 Percent In 30 Years, Report Says]." HuffPost. August 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been exacerbated by a shift in policy for [[For-profit higher education in the United States|for-profit institutions]]: Since the late 1990s, they have been able to receive up to 90% of their funding from federal aid, and they now represent around 25% of loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;Shen, Lucinda. "[http://fortune.com/2016/09/29/student-loan-defaults-2/ For-Profit Colleges Account for a Third of All Federal Student Loan Defaults]." Fortune. September 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelchen, Robert. "[https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2017/01/11/how-much-do-for-profit-colleges-rely-on-federal-funds/ How Much Do For-Profit Colleges Rely on Federal Funds?]" Brookings. January 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to raising awareness about the issue of growing student debt, CUS scholars push for policy changes, such as loan forgiveness and debt-free college.&lt;ref name= "JeffW" /&gt;
* Globalization: American universities are increasingly being exported to locations around the globe through the opening of [[Satellite campus|satellite and affiliate campuses]]. This practice—exemplified by schools like [[New York University]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and [[Duke University]]—often seems to be profit-driven rather than beneficent, with universities receiving large sums of money from local governments in exchange for the presence of the school's brand. For many scholars, the so-called “global university” is merely a perpetuation of Western [[hegemony]].&lt;ref name= "Globe" /&gt;
* [[Innovation]] and Entrepreneurship: A new wave of CUS research has drawn attention to the increasing emphasis that universities place on values of innovation and entrepreneurship. While this focus may seem harmless or even beneficial to students, CUS scholars point out the damaging effects of structuring student's college experience around these buzzwords. Both terms reflect the infiltration of a business mindset into academics, with “innovation” often entailing the mechanization of teaching and a subsequent increase in inequality among student populations.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. "[https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/innovation-for-what-the-politics-of-inequality-in-higher-education Innovation for What? The Politics of Inequality in Higher Education.]" ''Dissent'', Winter 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, entrepreneurship encourages students to adopt a corporate work ethos, with science and tech companies—and increasingly Silicon Valley billionaires—reaping the benefits of student labor.&lt;ref&gt;Wiscomb, Avery J. "[http://www.chronicle.com/article/Hyperserfs/239433 Hyperserfs: How Silicon Valley Exploits Students and Their Universities.]" ''The Chronicle for Higher Education'', March 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Critical University Studies research has contributed to student and faculty movements across US campuses, including the aforementioned New Faculty Majority, the graduate student union movement, Oregon's CORE faculty-student advocacy group, and the [[Occupy movement|Occupy]] Student Debt Campaign (on which cultural critic [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]] has worked).&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Andrew. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G0LzAgAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Creditocracy and the Case for Debt Refusal]''. New York: OR Books, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrina, Stephen. "[http://ices.library.ubc.ca/index.php/workplace/article/view/184777/184351. Critical University Studies: Workplace, Milestones, Crossroads, Respect, Truth]." Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor 23 (2014): 62-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

CUS scholars often publish outside of traditional academic outlets, through blogs like Michael Meranze and Christopher Newfield's Remaking the University, as well as through contributions to new media like [[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]], the [[Los Angeles Review of Books]] (LARB), [[Salon (website)|Salon]] and [[HuffPost]].&lt;ref&gt;Newfield, Christopher, and Michael Meranze. [http://utotherescue.blogspot.com/. Remaking the University].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethos"/&gt; Through such non-traditional outlets, as well as through book publications and academic journal articles, CUS has helped to bring issues like student debt into the mainstream political conversation.&lt;ref name= "Williams"/&gt;

=== Unionization ===

Alongside CUS criticism and activism in the 1990s, U.S. campuses saw a rise in unionization efforts. This culminated in a 2000 decision by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) that graduate employees were protected by the [[National Labor Relations Act]] and could unionize.&lt;ref&gt;United Automobile Workers. "[https://uaw.org/uaw-graduate-workers-harvard-reach-historic-union-election-agreement/ UAW Graduate Workers and Harvard Reach Historic Union Election Agreement.]" News release, October 18, 2016. UAW.&lt;/ref&gt; Union efforts proliferated following this decision, with organizations like the [[United Automobile Workers]] (UAW) and the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU) allying with graduate students and adjunct instructors in the fight for employee status and collective bargaining rights. Despite setbacks, including a 2004 reversal of the 2000 ruling, student and adjunct unions have made significant headway. In August 2016, the NLRB reversed itself again, ruling that graduate research and teaching assistants at private universities do have the right to unionize (UAW vs. Columbia).&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, Richard."[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/23/491090762/nlrb-rules-graduate-students-are-employees-with-the-right-to-unionize NLRB Rules Graduate Students Are Employees With The Right To Unionize]." NPR, August 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==
The journal ''Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor'', co-founded by Bousquet, stemmed from early efforts in the field and continues to publish open-access issues around themes of academic labor and higher education activism.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ices.library.ubc.ca/index.php/workplace/index Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 2015 saw the formation of ''Academic Labor: Research and Artistry'', a journal devoted to issues of tenure and contingency in the university.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://journals.colostate.edu/labor Academic Labor: Research and Artistry]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In book publishing, The [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] initiated a book series on Critical University Studies, edited by Jeffrey J. Williams and Christopher Newfield, and In the UK, [[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]] also launched a series on CUS, edited by John Smyth.&lt;ref&gt;The Johns Hopkins University Press. "[http://ihum.innovate.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.engl.d7_ih/files/sitefiles/CUS%20Announcement.pdf Critical University Studies]." News release, January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.palgrave.com/gb/series/14707 Palgrave Critical University Studies]." Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the whole, the stance of CUS against the status quo of US universities puts it at odds with individuals and administrators who are in favor of the continued privatization, corporatization, and globalization of the university.

Scholars like Williams, Steffen, and others continue to call for the incorporation of CUS into the undergraduate curriculum, encouraging students to think critically about the institutions in which they find themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Jeffrey J. “[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/229021 Teach the University!]” ''Pedagogy'' (8)1: 25-42, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, Robert. "[https://radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/radicalteacher/article/view/382/287 Introduction: Teaching Critical University Studies]." ''Radical Teacher'', Spring 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Biochemistry at Oxford University began as the [[physiological chemistry]] section of the Physiology Department, and acquired its own separate department and building in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="chemistry"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=faf1nMjVRYwC&amp;pg=PA277 |title=Chemistry at Oxford: A History from 1600 to 2005|author1=Robert Joseph Paton Williams |author2=Allan Chapman |author3=John Shipley Rowlinson |page=277 | publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |date=6 November 2008|isbn= 978-0854041398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1920, [[Benjamin Moore (biochemist)|Benjamin Moore]] was elected to the position of the [[Whitley Professor of Biochemistry]], the newly established Chair of Biochemistry at Oxford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The New School of Biochemistry at Oxford |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v120/n3026/abs/120634a0.html |journal=Nature |volume=120 |issue= 634–635 |date=29 October 1927 | doi=10.1038/120634a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.biochemistry.org/Portals/0/SciencePolicy/Docs/Chapter_01.pdf |title=History of the Biochemical Society 1911-1986 |chapter= Chapter 1: The Emergence of Biochemistry in the United Kingdom |author=T. W. Goodwin | publisher= The Biochemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was followed by [[Rudolph Peters]] in 1923, and an endowment of £75,000 was soon granted by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] for the construction of a new building for the Department of Biochemistry, purchase of its equipment, and its maintenance.  The Biochemistry Department building opened in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OP5ePl7i5EIC&amp;pg=PA321|title=The History of the University of Oxford: Volume VIII: The Twentieth Century: The Twentieth-century |date= 7 April 1994|editor= Brian Harrison |page=321 |publisher= Clarendon Press (7 April 1994|isbn= 978-0198229742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:New Biochemistry Building.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The New Biochemistry Building]]

In 1954, [[Hans Adolf Krebs|Hans Krebs]] was appointed the Whitley Chair of Biochemistry, and his appointment brought greater prominence to the department. He brought with him the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] unit established to conduct research on cell metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.biochemist.org/bio/03205/0054/032050054.pdf |title=Oh to be in Oxford now that Krebs is there…! |work=The Biochemist |date=October 2010 |publisher= The Biochemical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1955, a second professorship in the department, the Iveagh Chair of Microbiology, was established with funding from Guinness and the sub-department of Microbiology created, with [[Donald Devereux Woods|Donald Woods]] its first holder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.microbiologyresearch.org/docserver/fulltext/micro/128/10/mic-128-10-2215.pdf |journal=Journal of General Microbiology |year=1982|volume =128 |pages= 2215–2220 |title=Sir Hans Krebs, 1900-1981 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-128-10-2215 |author=Quayle J. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight-storey Hans Krebs Building was constructed in 1964 with funds from the Rockefeller Foundation.  Krebs was succeeded by [[Rodney Porter]] in 1967. Genetics was brought into the Biochemistry Department when [[Walter Bodmer]] was appointed the first Professor of Genetics in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/archivesandmanuscripts/2012/10/18/sir-walter-bodmer-and-the-department-of-genetics-at-oxford-university/ |title=Sir Walter Bodmer and the Department of Genetics at Oxford University |date=18 October 2012|work=The Bodleian Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, first established in the [[Department of Zoology, University of Oxford|Zoology Department]] with support from Krebs and also linked to the [[Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory (Oxford)|Physical Chemistry Laboratory]] of the [[Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford|Chemistry Department]], became part of the Biochemistry Department. It moved into the [[Rex Richards (chemist)|Rex Richards]] building built in 1984, with [[David Chilton Phillips|David Phillips]] the Professor in Molecular Biophysics.&lt;ref name="chemistry"/&gt; The Oxford Glycobiology Institute, then headed by [[Raymond Dwek]] and housed in the Rodney Porter Building, opened in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/glycob/papers_gen/biochemist_(2006)_28_p4.pdf |title=Glycobiology at Oxford: A personal view |author=Raymond Dwek |work=The Biochemist |date=June 2006|publisher= Biochemical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department is now part of the [[Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford|Medical Sciences Division]] of Oxford University, under the Divisional Boards formed in 2000.  In 2006, two older biochemistry buildings were demolished, and another two including the Han Krebs Tower in 2014, to make way for the  two-phase construction of the New Biochemistry Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.oxford.gov.uk/online-applications/files/FB1C0A6AAF57E34EB3D8D6341BDE152C/pdf/05_00643_FUL-COMMITTEE_REPORT-587951.pdf |title=Proposal: Demolition of Walter Bodmer, Donald Woods, Rudolph Peters and Hans Krebs Buildings, plus associated outbuildings |work=Oxford City Council |date=14 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mycouncil.oxford.gov.uk/documents/s12111/Science%20area%20masterplan.pdf |title=University Science Area: Masterplan  |work=Oxford City Council |date=16 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Sansom]], the current [[David Chilton Phillips|David Phillips]] Professor in Molecular Biophysics, is the head of the Biochemistry Department.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/aspsite/index.asp?pageid=72 |title=Key Personnel |work=Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The department is sub-divided into the following research areas:&lt;ref name=bioch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/aspsite/index.asp?pageid=609 |title=About the Department |work=Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cell Biology, Development and Genetics
*Chromosomal and RNA Biology
*Infection and Disease Processes
*Microbiology and Systems Biology
*Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics

==Academic staff==
There are around 400 research staff, with about 50 independent Principal Investigators who lead research groups that may range from a few people to forty or more.&lt;ref name=bioch /&gt; Members of other departments also contribute to teaching, including lecturers in physiology, pathology, pharmacology, clinical biochemistry and zoology. The Department hosts the Oxford University Biochemical Society, a graduate student association that invites speakers to the University of Oxford. The head of department is Professor Mark Sansom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other members of the academic staff include [[Judy Armitage]], [[Elspeth Garman]], [[Jonathan Hodgkin]], [[Kim Nasmyth]], [[Rob Klose]] and [[Alison Woollard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/research/rgroups|title=Research Groups Section  - Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford|website=www.bioch.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==
The department currently has three main buildings:

* The New Biochemistry building
* The [[Rex Richards (scientist)|Rex Richards]] building (housing the NMR facility in the basement)
* The [[Rodney Porter]] building ([[Glycobiology]])

Until 2006, two older buildings housing [[genetics]] (the [[Walter Bodmer]] building) and biochemistry (the [[Rudolph Peters]] building) were also part of the department. However, these were demolished in 2006 to make way for the first phase of the construction of the New Biochemistry building, completed in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/hawkins-browns-oxford-university%E2%80%99s-biochemistry-research-facilities-oxford/3142909.article |title=Hawkins Brown's Oxford University’s biochemistry research facilities, Oxford |date=19 June 2009 |author= Will Hunter |work=bdonline }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until 2008 biochemistry also occupied the [[Donald Devereux Woods|Donald Woods]] building and the [[Hans Adolf Krebs|Hans Krebs]] Tower, which was demolished in 2014 for the second phase of the construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/11425803.___Ugliest_building____in_Oxford_comes_down/?ref=mr |title=‘Ugliest building’ in Oxford comes down |date=22 August 2014 |author= Matt Oliver|work=Oxford Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The New Biochemistry building houses interdisciplinary research in the Biosciences including Physiology, Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Clinical Neurosciences. The Department moved into the purpose-built new biochemistry building during the Autumn of 2008 which was designed to promote interaction and collaboration as well as provide facilities for all staff. The New Biochemistry building houses a substantial amount of contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saltbridges.bioch.ox.ac.uk  |title=Salt Bridges |work=Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8049">'''Ecologically sustainable development''' is the environmental component of [[sustainable development]]. It can be achieved partially through the use of the [[precautionary principle]]; if there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent [[environmental degradation]].
Also important is the principle of [[intergenerational equity]]; the present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations. In order for this movement to flourish, environmental factors should be more heavily weighed in the valuation of assets and services to provide more incentive for the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity.

==Political considerations==
Effective political support is necessary for ecologically sustainable development. The mobilization of governments can be translated into action plans that are crucial to [[Sustainable development#Politics|sustainable development]]. Development efforts can be influenced by patterns of family arrangements, work attitudes, [[Morality|social morality]]—particularly interpersonal responsibilities, hierarchy of authority, quality of scientific education and implementation, and degree of domestic stability—especially, freedom from [[social conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. "Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?." New Global Studies 7.3: 23-56. ISSN (Online) 1940-0004, ISSN (Print) 2194-6566, DOI: 10.1515/ngs-2013-021, November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; National policy and development planning requires three conditions to permit ecological [[sustainability]]: action-oriented values to which individuals are committed, political authorities that favour long-term ecological benefits over immediate economic gains, and a policy with a politically competent [[constituency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Lynton K.|title=Political Aspects of Ecologically Sustainable Development|journal=Environmental Conservation|year=1984|volume=11|issue=04|pages=299–308|doi=10.1017/S037689290001465X|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S037689290001465X|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has taken an evidence based approach to sustainability development by using Environmental [[Sustainability measurement|Sustainability Indicators]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/indicateurs-indicators/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=47F48106-1 |title=Environmental Sustainability Indicators |author=Government of Canada|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as guiding tool for policy development. At the municipal level, many cities also use evidence based indicators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surrey.ca/community/3568.aspx |title=Sustainability Charter|author=City of Surrey|accessdate=7 May 2016}}

==Forums for ecologically sustainable development==
The World Conservation Strategy was published in 1980, becoming one of the most encouraging developments that uses a goal-oriented programme for political change concerning ecological sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Robert P.|title=How to Save the World: Strategy for World Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwghAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=1980|publisher=Barnes and Noble Books|isbn=978-0-389-20011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The publication marked a fundamental policy shift for the global [[conservation movement]]. The traditional focus became cure rather than [[Prevention Science|Prevention]], confirming the growing trend on the assimilation of preservation and development aims that are key to an ecologically sustainable society. Specifically, the concentration on [[wildlife conservation]] drifted into a concern for wider strains degrading the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=John|title=The Origins of the World Conservation Strategy|journal=Environmental Review|year=1986|volume=10|issue=3|pages=177–187|jstor=3984544}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It promotes the principles of sustainable development and addresses the environmental concerns introduced by [[economic development]] decisions with a format that targets a wide audience. There are three chief conservation objectives:
#Maintaining essential [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and life-support systems
#Preserving [[genetic diversity]]
#Establishing a sustainable use of [[species]] and [[ecosystem]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Susan L.|title=Ecologically Sustainable Development: Integrating Economics, Ecology, and Law|journal=Willamette Law Review|year=1995|volume=31|issue=2|pages=261–306|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=31+Willamette+L.+Rev.+261&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=118207f62b4908b2ee0eb7a21f829a93|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other efforts such as the World Campaign for the Biosphere present environmental obstacles constantly before governmental and scientific authorities. Nicholas Polunin, former president of the Foundation for Environmental Conservation, believed the starting point for the World Campaign effort occurred in 1966 at an [[UNESCO]] conference in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polunin|first=Nicholas|title=Our Global Environment and the World Campaign for the Biosphere|journal=Environmental Conservation|year=1982|volume=9|issue=02|pages=115|doi=10.1017/S0376892900020002}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference examined conditions that hinder ecologically sustainable development such as rapid [[population growth]], proliferation of [[nuclear weapon]]s, and depletion of [[natural resource]]s. Similarly, the [[The Global 2000 Report to the President|Global 2000 Report to the President]], presents environmental prospective conditions that are likely to worsen if public policies, institutions, and rates of technologic advancement do not change. Findings of this type prompted [[environmentalist]]s and the Foundation for Environmental Conservation to initiate the World Campaign project and have included the following suggestions:
:*Publication and broadcast of [[environmental issue]]s
:*Use of traditional [[Media (communication)|communication mediums]] such as posters and automobile stickers
:*Distribution of increasing basic and applied environmental research results
:*Information about [[family planning]] and the necessity to control population growth
:*Designating more area as [[national park]]s or [[wilderness area]]s, including the ocean
:*Organization of local, state, national, and international conferences to discuss environmental issues
:*Encouraging sustainable uses of our natural resources
:*Establishment of [[common law]]s for the Earth and mankind
:*Obtaining support form [[nongovernmental organization]]s and [[institution]]s for the World Campaign
:*Attaining recognition such as "Guardians of the Biosphere Awards," for persons and/or groups that demonstrate actions to preserve the environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barman|first=Charles R.|title=The World Campaign for the Biosphere|journal=The American Biology Teacher|volume=46|issue=5|pages=269–271|doi=10.2307/4447840|jstor=4447840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10567">'''Endocannibalism''' is a practice of [[cannibalism|eating the flesh]] of a human being from the same [[community]] ([[tribe]], [[social group]] or [[society]]), usually after they have died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vilaca |first1=Aparecida |title=Relations between Funerary Cannibalism and Warfare Cannibalism: The Question of Predation |journal=Ethnos |volume=65 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=83–106 |doi=10.1080/001418400360652 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endocannibalism has also been used to describe the consumption of relics in a mortuary context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Wine of the Corpse: Endocannibalism and the Great Feast of the Dead in Borneo |jstor=3043794 |journal=Representations |date=1987-01-01 |pages=96–109 |issue=17 |doi=10.2307/3043794 |first=Peter |last=Metcalf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a cultural practice ==
[[Herodotus]] (3.38) mentions funerary [[cannibalism]] among the ''Callatiae'', a tribe of [[India (Herodotus)|India]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Also, the [[Aghori]]s of northern [[India]] consume the flesh of the dead floated in the [[Ganges]] in pursuit of [[immortality]] and supernatural powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |date=27 October 2005 |title=Indian doc focuses on Hindu cannibal sect |url=http://www.today.com/id/9842124/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/indian-doc-focuses-hindu-cannibal-sect/ |publisher=[[Today.com]] |accessdate=1 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that some South American indigenous cultures, such as the [[Mayoruna]] people, practiced endocannibalism in the past.&lt;ref name="enccan"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dorn, Georgette M. |author2=Tenenbaum, Barbara A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Encyclopedia of Latin American history and culture |publisher=C.

== Medical implications ==
[[Kuru (disease)|Kuru]] is a type of [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy]] (TSE) caused by [[prion]]s that is found in humans.&lt;ref name="pmid18316717"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wadsworth |first1=J. D. F. |last2=Joiner |first2=S. |last3=Linehan |first3=J. M. |last4=Desbruslais |first4=M. |last5=Fox |first5=K. |last6=Cooper |first6=S. |last7=Cronier |first7=S. |last8=Asante |first8=E.

Norton |location=New York |year=1997 |page=208 |isbn=0-393-03891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuru was 8 to 9 times more prevalent in women and children than in men at its peak because, while the men of the village took the choice cuts, the women and children would eat the rest of the body, including the brain, where the prion particles were particularly concentrated.&lt;ref name="emed"&gt;{{EMedicine|article|220043|Kuru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kuru epidemic, which is recorded to have begun in the 1920s, is believed to have been started by the consumption of a single individual with kuru, which then spread through the population. Oral history records that cannibalism began within the Fore in the late 19th century. Recent research at University College London identified a gene that protects against prion diseases, by studying the Fore people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Tribe In Papua New Guinea Reveals The Upside Of Cannibalism |url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/eating-human-brains-led-tribe-developing-brain-disease-resistant-genes-337672 |accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there is no treatment to cure or even treatment to control kuru, but there are numerous programs being funded by universities and national institutes, such as the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ([[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|NINDS]]). This institute is currently funding research into the genetic and cellular process behind the development and transmission of kuru and other TSE diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kuru Information Page: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/kuru/kuru.htm |website=www.ninds.nih.gov |accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prehistory of endocannibalism controversy ==
Whether or not endocannibalism was commonplace through much of [[human prehistory]] remains controversial.

A team led by [[Michael Alpers]], a lifelong investigator of Kuru,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.med.monash.edu.au/news/2009/michael-alpers-biography.html |title=A life of determination |publisher=Med.monash.edu.au |date=2009-02-27 |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; found genes that protect against similar prion diseases were widespread, suggesting that such endocannibalism could have once been common around the world.&lt;ref name="scibal"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Simon |last1=Mead |first2=Michael P. H. |last2=Stumpf |first3=Jerome |last3=Whitfield |first4=Jonathan A. |last4=Beck |first5=Mark |last5=Poulter |first6=Tracy |last6=Campbell |first7=James B. |last7=Uphill |first8=David |last8=Goldstein |first9=Michael |last9=Alpers |first10=Elizabeth M.

However, a later study by Simon Mead ''et al.'' of the [[University College London]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mead |first1=Simon |last2=Whitfield |first2=Jerome |last3=Poulter |first3=Mark |last4=Shah |first4=Paresh |last5=Uphill |first5=James |last6=Campbell |first6=Tracy |last7=Al-Dujaily |first7=Huda |last8=Hummerich |first8=Holger |last9=Beck |first9=Jon |last10=Mein |first10=Charles A. |last11=Verzilli |first11=Claudio |last12=Whittaker |first12=John |last13=Alpers |first13=Michael P. |last14=Collinge |first14=John |title=A Novel Protective Prion Protein Variant that Colocalizes with Kuru Exposure |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=361 |issue=21 |pages=2056–65 |year=2009 |pmid=19923577 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0809716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has since shown that the protective G127V variant of the prion protein gene [[PRNP]] is only commonplace in the areas with the highest incidence of kuru; it is not commonplace in the global population. The relatively rare (but widespread) occurrence of G127V in the global population could therefore be explained as random mutation. This is evidence that cannibalism may not have been widespread among humanity, as the kuru disease is the only known prion disease that spreads by human cannibalism. Were cannibalism widespread, G127V would have to be commonplace by evolutionary necessity – but it is not. The only way by which cannibalism could have been widespread would be if kuru was not the only prion to spread by human cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liberski |first1=Pawel |title=Kuru: A Journey Back in Time from Papua New Guinea to the Neanderthals' Extinction |journal=Pathogens |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=472–505 |year=2013 |pmid=25437203 |pmc=4235695 |doi=10.3390/pathogens2030472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fernhurst Research Station''' was a [[Crop protection|plant protection]] ([[Herbicide|weed killer]]) research institute in [[West Sussex]], mainly run by ICI, for the [[Horticulture industry|fruit industry]].

==History==
[[Plant Protection Limited]] moved to this site in 1945 and opened a research institute on the estate of Sir [[Felix Schuster]] (1854-1936). The research institute was to investigate pest and disease control, and was also known as a horticultural research station. In June 1951 an international conference, with scientists from 39 countries, took place at the site on [[Famine|food scarcity]].&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 26 June 1951, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 May 1955, the site was visited by the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]]. Another international conference took place at the site in June 1956. 

ICI Plant Protection had its international headquarters at the site in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1986 a new international conference centre was opened on the site by the Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]]. ICI Public Health was formed in 1989 and situated at the site.

In April 1990, the site won a [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen's Award for Technological Achievement]] for herbicides, fungicides and pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'',Saturday  21 April 1990, page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zeneca===
It became part of [[Zeneca]] in 1994. 

===Syngenta===
It became part of [[Syngenta]]. It became the headquarters of Syngenta Europe Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04312779/filing-history?page=3 Companies House]&lt;/ref&gt; Syngenta left the site in December 2001. This site is mostly still present.

==Structure==
It was situated to the east of the [[A286 road|A286]], around a mile north of the east-west [[Serpent Trail]]. 

==Function==
It undertook [[Pesticide research|research]] on horticultural crops. It had a 60-acre orchard with 9 acres of [[plum]]s and 26 acres of [[Table apple|dessert apple]]s. Around 700 people worked at the site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9490">[[File:Schreiben mit Kugelschreiber.jpg|thumb|Student writing takes many shapes in Freshman writing classes, including handwritten freewriting and notetaking.]]    

'''First-year composition''' (sometimes known as '''freshman composition''' or '''freshman writing''') is an introductory core curriculum [[writing]] course in  American colleges.  This course focuses on improving students' abilities to write in a university setting and introduces students to writing practices in the disciplines and professions.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, John. "[http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2012/03/16/essay-value-first-year-writing-courses| Essay on the Value of First-year Writing Courses]." ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]''. March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These courses are traditionally required of incoming students, thus the previous name, "Freshman Composition". Scholars working within the field of Composition-Rhetoric often have teaching First-year composition (FYC) courses  as the practical focus of their scholarly work. 

FYC courses are structured in a variety of ways.  Some institutions of higher education require only one term of FYC, while others require two or three courses. There are a number of identifiable [[Pedagogy|pedagogies]] associated with FYC, including: [[formalist theory in composition studies|current-traditional]], [[theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy|expressivist]], [[Cognitive rhetoric|social-epistemic]], [[Process theory of composition|process]], post-process and [[Writing about Writing]] (WAW). Each of these [[pedagogy|pedagogies]] can generate a multitude of curricula. 

Composition professionals, including those with degrees in Writing Studies and [[Rhetoric]] and [[Composition Studies|Composition]], often focus on a rhetorical approach to help students learn how to apply an understanding of [[audience]], purpose, [[Context (language use)|context]], invention, and [[Stylistics (literature)|style]] to their writing processes. This rhetorical approach has shown that real writing, rather than existing as isolated modes, has more to do with a writer choosing from among many approaches to perform rhetorical tasks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In addition to a focus on rhetoric, many first year composition courses also emphasize writing process, where students are encouraged to interact with classmates and receive feedback to be used for [[revision (writing) | revision]].  These practices can take the form of essay [[peer review]] or workshopping. [[Electronic Portfolio|Portfolios]] are a common way of assessing revised student work.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncte.org/cccc/resources/positions/electronicportfolios| Principles and Practices in Electronic Portfolios]." Conference on College Composition and Communication, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Since the late nineteenth century, college courses on composition have become increasingly common in American higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Sharon. ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays''. Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a longstanding course offering at many colleges, first-year composition remains controversial and marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Susan. ''Textual Carnivals: The Politics of Composition.'' Carbondale and Edwardsville, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook, Sue Ellen. "Women's Work: The Feminizing of Composition." ''Rhetoric Review'' 9(2) 1991: 201-229. &lt;/ref&gt;

===First-year requirement debate===

The requirement for a first-year composition course has been debated in [[composition studies]]. This debate centers around how effective the first-year composition course is and the changes that need to be made to develop the field of composition. While most schools do require some form of the first-year composition course, there are some schools that have decided to abolish the first-year composition requirement. Some scholars, such as Sharon Crowley in ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays,'' argue that this requirement should be abolished. Crowley does not suggest the course itself be removed, only the requirement that all freshmen take the course. She states that students would still be interested in the course if the requirement was abolished and that removing the requirement would strengthen the field of composition. She implies that composition studies is marginalized within the university because of the view of the first-year composition course as a skill course. Removing the requirement, she states, would remove the association of composition studies with introductory courses, giving more acknowledgement to the field. &lt;ref&gt; Crowley, Sharon. ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1998. pg 241-43. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; Crowley's opinion initiated a debate in the composition field, but she is not the only critic who advocates for the removal of this requirement. Scholars Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle also dislike the requirement and instead argue for a writing studies curriculum. &lt;ref&gt; Downs, Douglas and Elizabeth Wardle. ''Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions: (Re)Envisioning 'First-Year Composition' as 'Introduction to Writing Studies'''. College Composition and Communication. 58.4 (2007) 552-584. Web. &lt;/ref&gt; However, there are scholars who do not agree with this stance, argue that the first-year composition course is needed in the university, and believe that the requirement should remain. Scholar David Smit is one critic who favors keeping the requirement. He suggests that the requirement can be kept and the curriculum and structure of the first-year composition course altered for improvement. Smit explains that many of the developmental goals of those who favor abolishing the requirement can still be achieved by offering more writing experiences. He proposes more genre writing in composition courses with a "[[scaffolding]]" progression of discipline writing. If this was done, he suggests, the concerns over the status of composition studies in the university would still be solved, as the course would no longer be seen as skills based. &lt;ref&gt; Smit, David. ''The End of Composition Studies''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2004. pg 183-85. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; There has been no consensus reached in composition studies regarding the status of the first-year composition course requirement. The benefits of the course, as well as the drawbacks, continue to be debated and the scholars noted above are only a few of the voices and perspectives involved in this discussion. Despite the debate about the requirement, it remains in effect at a majority of universities{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

==Structure of contemporary first-year composition==

First-year composition is designed to meet the goals for successful completion set forth by the [http://wpacouncil.org/positions/outcomes.html/ Council of Writing Program Administrators]. To reach these goals, students must learn rhetorical conventions, [[critical thinking]] skills, [[information literacy]], and the process of writing an academic paper. While there is no American standard curriculum for first-year composition, curriculum is developed at several levels, including the state, institution, department, and [[Writing center|writing program]].

=== First-year composition and rhetoric ===

With the publication of James Kinneavy's ''Theory of Discourse'' in 1971, English departments began incorporating [[rhetoric]] into their composition classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Irene. ''Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing.'' Mahweh, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2003. p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing this, composition instructors have placed more emphasis on teaching [[audience analysis]], [[Aristotle]]'s three appeals ([[ethos]], [[pathos]], and [[logos]]), and teaching Kinneavy's modes of discourse.
According to Brian Sutton in "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper," since 1980, there has been an increasing debate in academic circles as to whether the "generic" approach to writing in first year composition is useful for students whose future writing will be discipline specific (46).&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Brian. "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper." ''Language and Learning Across the Disciplines'' 2.1 (1997) 46–57. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic writing===

First described by [[Mina P. Shaughnessy|Mina Shaughnessy]] in the 1970s, [[Basic writing]] is a division of composition studies that strives to bring disadvantaged students entering college to a more complete understanding of the rhetorical aspects of the writing process.&lt;ref&gt;Otte, George, and Rebecca Mlynarczyk.

The '''Forest Research Institute Malaysia''' ('''FRIM'''; [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Institut Penyelidikan Perhutanan Malaysia'') is a statutory [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of Malaysia]], under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. FRIM promotes sustainable management and optimal use of [[forestry|forest]] resources in [[Malaysia]] by generating knowledge and technology through research, development and application in tropical forestry. FRIM is located in [[Kepong]], near Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref name=frim-gov&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Research Institute Malaysia {{!}} Official Portal|url=http://www.frim.gov.my/|publisher=frim.gov.my|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tourismselangor&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Research Institute of Malaysia (FRIM), Kepong|url=http://www.tourismselangor.my/forest-research-institute-of-malaysia/|publisher=tourismselangor.my|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1926, the Chief Conservator of the Forest (equivalent to today's Director of Forestry), G.E.S Cubitt, asked Dr. F.W. Foxworthy to establish a separate forest research unit for the Forestry Department. It was Foxworthy who selected the present site, at Kepong. He was also to become the institutes's first Chief Research Officer.

The site comprised an area that was practically stripped of its original [[forest cover]] except for a few remnant trees at the more inaccessible localities. Lalang-grass scrub on the hillsides made way to vegetable terraces on the lower slopes, while the valley cradled a few ponds, the left-overs of a past tin-mining operation.

Within two years in 1928, the first {{convert|42|ha}} of experimental plantation (mainly [[dipterocarp]]s, tall hardwood species) were in place, carefully nurtured into being using "nurse" trees of other species as shade and food providers (being nitrogen-fixers). By that time the construction of the main building had begun. Completed the following years, this building was to remain the sole centre for the laboratories, [[herbarium]], and museum, as well as the Chemistry, Zoology and Sivilculture sections of the institute, until new buildings were added after World War II. The herbarium collection, that was also moved to Kepong, numbered 1,500 accessions.

The end of the decade saw some 125 hectares of plantation established at the Institute. Plantation trials with exotic species started in the early 1930s. The plantations covered 154 hectares just before the outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939, and before the Japanese occupation of the [[Malay Peninsula]] in 1941–1945. By this time the dipterocarp and non-Dipterocarp arboreta contained 75 species (represented by 360 individual trees), while the Herbarium collection numbered nearly 40,000 accessions.

=== Establishment ===
Just before [[Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957|Malaysia won independence]] from the [[British Empire]] in 1957, some 220 hectares of plantations had been established at the institute, while the Dipterocarp and non-Dipterocarp arboreta held 201 and 168 species respectively. The herbarium collection had grown to 53,600 accessions. The Timber Research Branch had moved from [[Sentul, Kuala Lumpur|Sentul]] to become a part of the Institute at Kepong.

Six years later, Encik Abdul Rahman Mohd. Ali was appointed the Institute's first Malaysian Director and Chief Research Officer. The ground of the Institute expanded by a further 192 hectares in 1962 and 1964 to total 600 hectares.

In 1977 Dr. Salleh Mohd. Nor was appointed to his present post of director general of the institute. Eight years later, the institute was transformed into a statutory body. Through an Act of Parliament, the Malaysia Forestry Research and Development Board (MFRDB) was formed to administer the Institute, which was now named FOREST RESEARCH INSTITUTE of MALAYSIA (FRIM). This historic change was announced by the EX-Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Bin Muhammad when he visited FRIM on 11 June 1984. The formal inauguration of FRIM took place later, on 5 April 1986.

'''Frederick John Kiesler''' ([[Czernowitz]] or Tschernovitz, [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (now [[Chernivtsi]], [[Ukraine]]), September 22, 1890 – [[New York City]], December 27, 1965) (born as Friedrich Jacob Kiesler). [[Austria]]n-[[United States|American]] architect, theoretician, theater designer, artist and sculptor.

==Biography==
From 1908 to 1909, Kiesler studied at the [[Vienna University of Technology|Technische Hochschule]] in [[Vienna]]. From 1910–12, he attended painting and printmaking classes at the [[Akademie der bildenden Künste]], both in [[Vienna]]. In July 1913, Kiesler quit the academy without having earned a diploma.

He married Stefanie (Stefi) Frischer (1896–1963) in 1920, and they moved to New York City in 1926, where he lived until his death. Kiesler collaborated there early on with the [[Surrealists]], and with [[Marcel Duchamp]]. His writing was extensive, and his theoretical work embraced two lengthy manifestos, the article "Pseudo-Functionalism in Modern Architecture" (''[[Partisan Review]]'', July 1949) and the book ''Contemporary Art Applied to the Store and Its Display'' (New York: Brentano, 1930).

Stefi Kiesler died in September 1963. In 1964, the year before his death, Kiesler married Lillian Olinsey, his longtime secretary and confidante, as Stefi had advised him to do while she was still living. In May 1965, he traveled to Jerusalem for the inauguration of the [[Shrine of the Book]]; seven months later he died in New York City.

==Design and architectural career==

Kiesler was productive as a theater and art-exhibition designer in the 1920s in Vienna and [[Berlin]]. In 1920, he started a brief collaboration with architect [[Adolf Loos]] and, in 1923, became a member of the [[De Stijl]] group in 1923. Kiesler was friendly with many of the major figures of the European [[avant-garde]], which may have influenced his heretical approach to artistic theories and practices.

Kiesler arranged the world premiere in Vienna on September 24, 1924, of the 16-minute film ''[[Ballet mécanique]]'', directed by [[Dudley Murphy]] and [[Fernand Léger]], with [[Man Ray]]. In November 1975, Lillian Kiesler, Frederick's second wife, found Léger's original spliced [[35mm]], 16-minute version of the film in the closet of their week-end house in the [[Hamptons]] on [[Long Island]], near New York City. This version, restored by [[Anthology Film Archives]], has since been included in the documentary film compilation ''Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant-Garde Film 1893-1941'' (released as a seven-disc DVD set by Image Entertainment, October 2005). The music for the film was originally composed by [[George Antheil]], who used it to create a separate concert piece, also named ''Ballet mécanique'', which premiered in Paris in 1926.

His architectural designs include the [[Film Guild Cinema]] (1929) in New York City and, with [[Armand Phillip Bartos]], the [[Shrine of the Book]] (1965) in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Samuel. [http://www.archdaily.com/156442/AD "Classics: Shrine of the Book / Armand Phillip Bartos and Frederick John Kiesler"], ''ArchDaily'', September 24, 2011, accessed October 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1937 to 1943, Kiesler was the director of the Laboratory for Design Correlation within the [[Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation|Department of Architecture]] at [[Columbia University]], where the study program was more pragmatic and commercially oriented than his deep, theoretical concepts and ideas, such as those about "correalism" or "continuity," which concern the relationship among space, people, objects and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Creighton (July 1961), "Kiesler's Pursuit of an Idea," ''[[Progressive Architecture]]'', vol. 42, no. 7, p.&amp;nbsp;104&lt;/ref&gt;

For his object designs, such as the biomorphic furniture in his Abstract Gallery room of [[Peggy Guggenheim]]’s ''[[The Art of This Century Gallery]]'' art salon (1942), for example. For it, he sought to dissolve the visual, real, image, and environment into a free-flowing space. He likewise pursued this approach with his “[[Endless House]],” exhibited in maquette form in 1958–59 at [[The Museum of Modern Art]]. The project stemmed from his shop-window displays of the 1920s and his [[Film Guild Cinema]] in New York City, mentioned above. Pursuing display and art-gallery work, he was a window designer for [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] from 1928 to 1930. Earlier in his career in Europe, Kiesler invented the 1924 L+T (Leger und Trager) radical hanging system for galleries and museums.

His unorthodox architectural drawings and plans that he called "polydimensional" were somewhat akin to Surrealist automatic drawings.

He designed some intriguing furniture, a few pieces of which were featured in the yearbook of the short-lived [[American Union of Decorative Artists and Craftsmen]] (AUDAC); he was a founding member of the organization in 1930. Some models of the furniture — none of which was reproduced in numbers as intended — have been posthumously manufactured in limited quantities by various firms in Europe since 1990. The most popular has been the cast-aluminum "Two-Part Nesting Table" (1935).

==Galaxies and Installational Works==

During the 1950s, Kiesler created a series of paintings called ''Galaxies'', which translated his vision of space into multi-paneled installations that protruded from the wall. Combining painting, sculpture and drawing, the ''Galaxies'' were presented as grouped units. To Kiesler, the space between the different parts was just as important as the paintings themselves, marking a reflection of the “inner necessity” of the work as a whole. He noted that it was the same as what “breathing is to our body reality.” Kiesler wrote further:

{{Quote|text=''"Each painting represents a definite unit in itself just as in one family each member is of distinct individuality. Yet, their firm cohesion (into one) is inborn no matter how heterogeneous the character of the members might be. Under these circumstances, it seems natural that each painted unit, particularly when protruding from the wall, and viewed from the side, will also assume the value of a plastic entity, very much in the sense of sculpture, while the aspect of the total galaxy promotes too, the idea of an architectural coordinate without destroying the main character as a painting. Thus the traditional division of the plastic arts, sculpture, and architecture, is transmuted and overcome and their fluid unification is now contained within rather than combined from without."''}}

[[File:Frederick Kiesler, Horse Galaxy, 1954, installation view at Jason McCoy Gallery.jpg|thumb|left|Frederick Kiesler, ''Horse Galaxy'', 1954, installation view at Jason McCoy Gallery, 1993.]]
These multi-paneled paintings were also sparked by the artist's response to the political and social upheaval of his time. Conceived only a few years after the atomic bombings of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], Kiesler described his inspiration for the ''Galaxies'' as follows:

{{Quote|text=''"If the reassessment of values in these tense times is of necessity for each and all of us, one is convinced that the artist’s work too can no longer be placed in isolation: that art must strive again to become part of daily experience. It seems, therefore, that painters, sculptors, and architects must conceive their work – as part of the world."''}}

[[File:Frederick Kiesler, Us, You, Me installation view, Parrish Art Museum.jpg|thumb|Installation view of Frederick Kiesler's ''Us, You, Me'' at the [[Parrish Art Museum]] in 2003. ]]
Kiesler’s body of sculptural works also incorporate similar philosophies, uniting individual pieces with specific placements, further illustrating his theories of human-design relationships. His installation of ''Us, You, Me'' (completed 1963-65), included pieces in bronze, aluminum, wood, granite, and concrete in various sizes, and was shown at [[Hunter College]]/Times Square Gallery (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cotter|first1=Holland|title=Art in Review: 'Moved'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/09/arts/art-in-review-moved.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parrish Art Museum]] (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Longwell|first1=Alicia G.|title=FREDERICK KIESLER: THE LATE WORK US, YOU, ME AUGUST 10 - OCTOBER 12 2003|url=http://artists.parrishart.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/124|website=Parrish Art Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Iowa Museum of Art]] (1995).  The idea of sculpture as a landscape in ''Us, You, Me'' reflects upon Kiesler’s history with stage design, and the subject matters marking underlying anxieties of modern life. Kiesler’s final sculpture ''Bucephalus'', inspired by [[Bucephalus|Alexander the Great’s battle horse]], was to be entered by the viewer and used as a grotto for meditation. The sculpture was conceived in concrete and mesh by Kiesler and his assistant, Len Pitkowsky, between 1962-1965 and was posthumously cast in aluminum at the Polich Tallix Foundry, Rock Tavern, New York by [[Jason McCoy Inc|Jason McCoy Gallery]] with the help of Len Pitkowsky between 2006-2008.

==Recognition and awards==
Kiesler was often shunned by his peers, although he was chosen in 1952 as one of "the 15 leading artists at mid-century" by The [[Museum of Modern Art]] and in 1957 became a fellow of the Graham Foundation in Chicago. [[Israel]]i architects disapproved of his and Bartos's serving as the architects for the [[Shrine of the Book]] (1957–65) because they were not Israelis, even though they were [[Jews]]. Further objections to Kiesler were that he had not completed his architecture studies and had built no structures, despite having been a licensed architect in [[New York (state)|New York State]] since 1930. One of his colleagues at Columbia University joked: "If Kiesler wants to hold two pieces of wood together, he pretends he's never heard of nails or screws.

The '''High Value Manufacturing Catapult''' ('''HVM Catapult''') is a group of manufacturing research centres in the United Kingdom which forms part of the [[Catapult centres]] initiative.

==History==
Catapult centres were set up by [[Swindon]]'s [[Innovate UK]] (formerly the Technology Strategy Board).

The HVM Catapult was created with £140m of government funding and was the first Catapult centre to open, in October 2011. In 2016, manufacturing employed 2.6m people in the UK, and contributed 11% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theengineer.co.uk/the-future-of-uk-manufacturing-solving-our-productivity-puzzle/ The Engineer August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and funding==
The HVM Catapult has offices at the Blythe Valley Business Park, off junction 4 of the M42 in [[Cheswick Green]], Solihull, West Midlands. It is a [[Private company limited by guarantee]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07708659|title=High Value Manufacturing Catapult|last=|first=|date=|website=Companies House|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its members are seven national centres:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hvm.catapult.org.uk/hvm-centres/|title=HVM Catapult Centres|last=|first=|date=|work=High Value Manufacturing Catapult|access-date=26 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palac-staszica.jpg|thumb|Staszic Palace - headquarters of INE PAN]]
'''Institute of Economics, Polish Academy of Sciences''' ({{lang-pl|Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych PAN}}, abbreviation: '''INE PAN''') is a public Polish research center for economic and business studies. It was founded on December 10, 1980. Its offices are located in the [[Staszic Palace]] and the [[Palace of Culture and Science]] in [[Warsaw]]. Organizationally, it is part of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Polish Academy of Sciences - the Past and the Present, ed. Jan Strelau, Warsaw, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Economics has the rights to bestow doctoral degrees, habilitation degrees and to initiate the professorship procedure. Some of its MBA and DBA prominent programs are the most modern programs in Poland which are internationally recognized.

==History==

The PAS Institute of Economics commenced its activities in 1980. Its research at that time concentrated on problems related to socialist planned economies. During the 80s IE PAS was actively engaged in the promotion of independent thinking on economic issues. It significantly contributed to the success of Polish economic reforms after the collapse of the socialist system in 1989. 

In the 90s the Institute was reorganized and took active part in the analysis and evaluation of free market economic developments in Poland.  At present there are about forty scholars and researchers working in four departments of the Institute: Microeconomics, Economic Policy, Institutional Economics and  the World Economy. Many of them have occupied important posts in the [[Cabinet of Poland]], [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Parliament (Sejm)]], the [[National Bank of Poland]], the Polish [[Monetary Policy Council]], the [[European Commission]] and the [[World Bank]].

==Research and Other Activities==

IE PAS’s main research areas are:

- contemporary economic theory, 

- economic policy, 

- analysis, evaluation and strategic studies of the Polish economy, and 

- analysis of the world economy and European integration.

IE PAS also offers forecasts concerning growth and development of the Polish economy, and publishes a number of analyses of Polish firms. The Institute also publishes the bilingual quarterly ''Studia Ekonomiczne - Economic Studies''. 

IE PAS maintains cooperation with leading institutions in various countries, e.g. the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies; the Institute of Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences; the Institute of World Economy of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and the [[University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne]]. 

IE PAS also runs several postgraduate, MBA and doctoral programs in business and economics.  Together with the [[National Bank of Poland]] the Institute offers specialized studies for economic journalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inepan.waw.pl/en/], Institute of Economics of the Polish Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific Council and Board of Directors==

Professor Barbara Błaszcyk is Chairman of the Scientific Council of IE PAS. Urszula Skorupska serves as the Director of the Institute.

The following professors served as Directors of the Institute of Economics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in the past:

- Józef Pajestka (1981–1990),

- Cezary Józefiak (1990–1993),

- [[Marek Belka]] (1993–1996),

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5929">'''Interdiscourse''' is the implicit or explicit relations that a [[discourse]] has to other discourses. '''Interdiscursivity''' is the aspect of a discourse that relates it to other discourses. [[Norman Fairclough]] prefers the concept "orders of discourse". Interdiscursivity is often mostly an analytic concept, e.g. in Foucault and Fairclough. Interdiscursivity has close affinity to [[recontextualisation]] because interdiscourse often implies that elements are imported from another discourse.

The meaning of interdiscourse varies. It denotes at least three levels:

# In Courtine interdiscursivity means that ''a discourse has a relation to another discourse''. That is, a meaning which is close to the meaning of [[intertextuality]].
# In [[Norman Fairclough]] and Linell interdiscursive denotes ''relations between types of discourse'' such as genres.
# In [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Marc Angenot]], interdiscursive &lt;ref&gt;constellation/configuration interdiscursive, Foucault 1969: 88, 206-8&lt;/ref&gt; denotes ''relations between discursive formations'', that is, between large heterogeneous discursive entities, such as natural history and political economy during enlightenment. In [[Michel Foucault]], interdiscourse is differences and equalities across [[discourse|discursive formations]].

An example (where 1. corresponds to a., etc.) illustrates the three levels: A minister of environment speaks in the parliament about a proposal.

*a. She refers to other specific speeches in the parliament about the proposal.
*b. She refers to a memorandum from her civil servants.
*c. She refers to scientific reports supporting the proposal.

The example illustrates that 2. and 3. are specific cases of 1, in the sense a-c all relate to another discourse. To avoid this, level 1. might be defined as relations to other discourses ''within'' the same discursive formation and type of discourse. Consequently, the definition of the levels depends on the definition of [[discourse|discursive formation]] and types of discourse, and the three levels may collapse to the extent that these concepts are not conceived. In short, the stratification of interdiscourse depends on the stratification of discourse.

==Power, ideology and interdiscursive configuration==

Level 2. and 3. may be conceived as particularly salient. This is explained in [[Marc Angenot]] and Bruce by reference to [[Bakhtin]]: In [[Bakhtin]]'s [[dialogism]], the utterance is the natural meaningful and finalised unit of speech, which others are supposed to respond to, that is, others ''interpret the utterance by situating it in a discursive context''. But, an utterance may be interpreted (contextualised) in various ways, and interdiscourse and interdiscursivity denote how certain such interpretations (and relations to other discourses) are socially more privileged than others. Since interdiscourse privileges certain interpretations, it has a close affinity to the concepts of [[ideology]], [[hegemony]] and [[power (sociology)]]. For Bakhtin/Voloshinov, signs are a reality that refracts another reality, that is, signs are ideological.&lt;ref&gt;Voloshinov 1973: 10&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the embedding of a discourse in an interdiscourse is an ideological interpretation of the discourse.

In [[Michel Foucault]], interdiscursivity is not bound to [[ideology]], but is a more open concept for analysing relations between [[discourse|discursive formations]], that is, mapping their interdiscursive configuration. Such analyses constitute a part of his [[discourse analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Foucault 1969: 88-90&lt;/ref&gt;

The cogent and restrictive character of the interdiscourse is reflected in the concept of the ''primacy of interdiscourse''.&lt;ref&gt;Maingueneau 1991: 20&lt;/ref&gt; The interdiscourse is the sayable, the opposite of what cannot be enunciated (l'inénoncable). But, the interdiscourse has also primacy in the sense that it ''defines the relations between discursive entities (or formations) that are constitutive of the discursive entities''. What is acceptable discourse, is in many respects a matter of interdiscursivity at level 2 and 3, because the interdiscursive import and export relations constitute a worksharing between the discursive entities, and this frames what is acceptable discourse within each discursive entity: Generally, a discourse has little authority over what other discourses are assumed to speak of and will therefore accept imported form and content from the other discourses. On the other hand, when a discourse exports content to other discourses, there are expectations as to the exported form and content. Thus, the interdiscursive system shapes the discourses.

'''Lucas van Uffelen''' or '''Uffel''' (1586 – 1637) was a Dutch merchant and art collector.

Uffelen was born in [[Amsterdam]], but moved to Venice where he grew his art collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ta.sandrart.net/en/person/view/1574 Lucas von Uffelen], mentioned by [[Joachim von Sandrart]] on Sandrart.net&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to Amsterdam in 1630, he continued to collect art. When he died, many of his Italian paintings were purchased by the [[Reynst Collection]]. He had his portrait painted by [[Anthony van Dyck]] twice, once in 1622 and later in the fashionable "action" style of getting up from one's chair. He appears to be getting up to greet the viewer after studying the objects of his collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27254">In [[music]], a '''note''' is the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[Duration (music)|duration]] of a sound, and also its representation in [[musical notation]] (♪, ♩). A note can also represent a [[pitch class]]. Notes are the building blocks of much written music: [[musical analysis#Discretization|discretizations]] of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and [[musical analysis|analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Nattiez 1990, p.81n9&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''note'' can be used in both generic and specific senses: one might say either "the piece '[[Happy Birthday to You]]' begins with two notes having the same pitch", or "the piece begins with two repetitions of the same note". In the former case, one uses ''note'' to refer to a specific musical event; in the latter, one uses the term to refer to a class of events sharing the same pitch. (See also: [[Key signature names and translations]].)

[[File:Treble a.svg|right|250px|thumb|The note ''A'' or ''La'']]
[[File:Cifrado americano.JPG|right|thumb|Names of some notes without accidentals]]

Two notes with [[fundamental frequency|fundamental frequencies]] in a ratio equal to any integer power of two (e.g., half, twice, or four times) are perceived as very similar. Because of that, all notes with these kinds of relations can be grouped under the same [[pitch class]].

In traditional music theory, most countries in the world use the [[solfège]] naming convention Do–Re–Mi–Fa–Sol–La–Si, including for instance Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, Poland, Romania, most Latin American countries, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia, and all the Arabic-speaking or Persian-speaking countries. However, within the English-speaking and Dutch-speaking world, pitch classes are typically represented by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). A few European countries, including Germany, adopt an almost identical notation, in which H substitutes for B (see below for details). In Indian music the [[Sanskrit]] names Sa–Re–Ga–Ma–Pa–Dha–Ni (स–रे–ग–म–प–ध–नि) is used, as in Telugu Sa–Ri–Ga–Ma–Pa–Da–Ni (స–రి–గ–మ–ప–ద–ని), and in Tamil (ச–ரி–க–ம–ப–த–நி). Byzantium used the names Pa–Vu–Ga–Di–Ke–Zo–Ni. 

The eighth note, or [[octave]], is given the same name as the first, but has double its frequency. The name octave is also used to indicate the span between a note and another with double frequency. To differentiate two notes that have the same pitch class but fall into different octaves, the system of [[scientific pitch notation]] combines a letter name with an Arabic numeral designating a specific octave. For example, the now-standard tuning pitch for most Western music, 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, is named a′ or A4.

There are two formal systems to define each note and octave, the [[Helmholtz pitch notation]] and the [[scientific pitch notation]].

== Accidentals ==

Letter names are modified by the [[accidental (music)|accidentals]]. The [[sharp (music)|sharp sign]] {{music|sharp}} raises a note by a [[semitone]] or half-step, and a [[flat (music)|flat]] {{music|flat}} lowers it by the same amount. In [[Equal temperament|modern tuning]] a [[half step]] has a frequency ratio of [[Twelfth root of two|{{radic|2|12}}]], approximately 1.059. The accidentals are written after the note name: so, for example, F{{music|sharp}} represents F-sharp, B{{music|flat}} is B-flat, and C{{music|natural}} is C natural (or C).
[[File:frequency vs name.svg|frame|right|Frequency vs position on [[treble clef]]. Each note shown has a frequency of the previous note multiplied by {{radic|2|12}}]]

Additional accidentals are the double-sharp {{music|##}}, raising the frequency by two semitones, and double-flat {{music|bb}}, lowering it by that amount.

In musical notation, accidentals are placed before the note symbols. Systematic alterations to the seven lettered pitches in the scale can be indicated by placing the symbols in the [[key signature]], which then apply implicitly to all occurrences of corresponding notes. Explicitly noted accidentals can be used to override this effect for the remainder of a bar. A special accidental, the [[natural (music)|natural]] symbol {{music|natural}}, is used to indicate an unmodified pitch. Effects of key signature and local accidentals do not accumulate. If the key signature indicates G{{music|sharp}}, a local flat before a G makes it G{{music|flat}} (not G{{music|natural}}), though often this type of rare accidental is expressed as a natural, followed by a flat ({{music|natural}}{{music|b}}) to make this clear. Likewise (and more commonly), a double sharp {{music|##}} sign on a key signature with a single sharp {{music|#}} indicates only a double sharp, not a triple sharp.

Assuming [[enharmonic]]ity, many accidentals will create equivalences between pitches that are written differently. For instance, raising the note B to B{{music|sharp}} is equal to the note C. Assuming all such equivalences, the complete [[chromatic scale]] adds five additional pitch classes to the original seven lettered notes for a total of 12 (the 13th note completing the [[octave]]), each separated by a half-step.

Notes that belong to the [[diatonic scale]] relevant in the context are sometimes called ''[[diatonic]] notes''; notes that do not meet that criterion are then sometimes called ''[[chromatic]] notes''.

Another style of notation, rarely used in English, uses the suffix "is" to indicate a sharp and "es" (only "s" after A and E) for a flat, e.g., Fis for F{{music|sharp}}, Ges for G{{music|flat}}, Es for E{{music|flat}}. This system first arose in Germany and is used in almost all European countries whose main language is not English, Greek, or a Romance language.

In most countries using these suffixes, the letter H is used to represent what is B natural in English, the letter B is used instead of B{{music|flat}}, and Heses (i.e., H{{music|bb}}) is used instead of B{{music|bb}} (although Bes and Heses both denote the English B{{music|bb}}). Dutch-speakers in Belgium and the Netherlands use the same suffixes, but applied throughout to the notes A to G, so that B, B{{music|flat}} and B{{music|bb}} have the same meaning as in English, although they are called B, Bes, and Beses instead of B, B flat and B double flat. Denmark also uses H, but uses Bes instead of Heses for B{{music|bb}}.

==12-tone chromatic scale==

The following chart lists the names used in different countries for the 12 notes of a [[chromatic scale]] built on C. The corresponding symbols are shown within parenthesis. Differences between German and English notation are highlighted in '''bold''' typeface. Although the English and Dutch names are different, the corresponding symbols are identical.

== Note designation in accordance with octave name ==
{{See also|Piano key frequencies}}
The table below shows each octave and the frequencies for every note of pitch class A. The traditional ([[Helmholtz pitch notation|Helmholtz]]) system centers on the great octave (with capital letters) and small octave (with lower case letters). Lower octaves are named "contra" (with primes before), higher ones "lined" (with primes after). Another system ([[Scientific pitch notation|scientific]]) suffixes a number (starting with 0, or sometimes −1). In this system A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is nowadays standardised at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, lying in the octave containing notes from C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (middle C) to B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The lowest note on most pianos is A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the highest C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[MIDI]] system for electronic musical instruments and computers uses a straight count starting with note 0 for C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; at 8.1758&amp;nbsp;Hz up to note 127 for G&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; at 12,544&amp;nbsp;Hz.

== Written notes ==
A written note can also have a [[note value]], a code that determines the note's relative [[Duration (music)|duration]]. In order of halving duration, they are: [[double whole note|double note (breve)]]; [[whole note|whole note (semibreve)]]; [[half note|half note (minim)]]; [[quarter note|quarter note (crotchet)]]; [[eighth note|eighth note (quaver)]]; [[sixteenth note|sixteenth note (semiquaver)]].; [[thirty-second note|thirty-second note (demisemiquaver)]], [[sixty-fourth note|sixty-fourth note (hemidemisemiquaver)]], and [[hundred twenty-eighth note]].
&lt;!--PLEASE DON'T ADD THE NAME "QUASIHEMIDEMISEMIQUAVER" OR "SEMIHEMIDEMISEMIQUAVER" WITHOUT A REPUTABLE PEER REVIEWED SOURCE FOR IT, SUCH AS THE OXFORD DICTIONARY OF MUSIC OR A REPUTABLE UNABRIDGED DICTIONARY--&gt;

In a [[Sheet music|score]], each note is assigned a specific vertical position on a [[staff position]] (a line or space) on the [[Musical staff|staff]], as determined by the [[clef]]. Each line or space is assigned a note name. These names are memorized by [[musician]]s and allow them to know at a glance the proper pitch to play on their instruments.

&lt;/score&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The [[Staff (music)|staff]] above shows the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C and then in reverse order, with no key signature or accidentals.

== Note frequency (hertz) ==
{{Main|Music and mathematics}}
In all technicality, ''music'' can be composed of notes at any arbitrary physical{{clarify|date=November 2012}} [[frequency]]. Since the physical causes of music are vibrations of mechanical systems, they are often measured in [[hertz]] (Hz), with 1&amp;nbsp;Hz meaning one vibration per second. For historical and other reasons, especially in Western music, only twelve notes of fixed frequencies are used. These fixed frequencies are mathematically related to each other, and are defined around the central note, A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The current "standard pitch" or modern "[[concert pitch]]" for this note is 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, although this varies in actual practice (see [[Concert pitch#History of pitch standards in Western music|History of pitch standards]]).

The note-naming convention specifies a letter, any [[accidental (music)|accidentals]], and an octave number. Each note is an [[integer]] number of half-steps away from concert A (A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Let this distance be denoted ''n''. If the note is above A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''n'' is [[positive number|positive]]; if it is below A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''n'' is [[negative number|negative]]. The frequency of the note (''f'') (assuming [[equal temperament]]) is then:
:&lt;math&gt;f = 2^\frac{n}{12} \times 440 \text{ Hz}\,&lt;/math&gt;

For example, one can find the frequency of C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, the first C above A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. There are 3 half-steps between A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → A{{music|sharp}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), and the note is above A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, so ''n'' = 3. The note's frequency is:

:&lt;math&gt;f = 2^\frac{3}{12} \times 440 \text{ Hz} \approx 523.2 \text{ Hz}&lt;/math&gt;

To find the frequency of a note below A4, the value of ''n'' is negative. For example, the F below A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. There are 4 half-steps (A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → A{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → G{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and the note is below A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, so ''n'' = −4. The note's frequency is:

:&lt;math&gt;f = 2^{-\frac{4}{12}} \times 440 \text{ Hz} \approx 349.2 \text{ Hz}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, it can be seen from this formula that octaves automatically yield [[exponentiation|powers]] of two times the original frequency, since ''n'' is a multiple of 12 (12''k'', where ''k'' is the number of octaves up or down), and so the formula reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt;f = 2^\frac{12k}{12} \times 440 \text{ Hz} = 2^k \times 440 \text{ Hz}&lt;/math&gt;

yielding a [[factorization|factor]] of 2. In fact, this is the means by which this formula is derived, combined with the notion of equally-spaced [[interval (music)|intervals]].

The distance of an equally [[Musical temperament|tempered]] semitone is divided into 100 [[cent (music)|cents]]. So 1200 cents are equal to one octave – a frequency ratio of 2:1. This means that a cent is precisely equal to {{radic|2|1200}}, which is approximately {{val|1.000578}}.

For use with the [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) standard, a frequency mapping is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;p = 69 + 12 \times \log_2\frac{f}{440 \text{ Hz}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is the MIDI note number (and 69 is the number of semitones between C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; (note 0) and A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). And in the opposite direction, to obtain the frequency from a MIDI note ''p'', the formula is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;f=2^\frac{p-69}{12} \times 440 \text{ Hz}&lt;/math&gt;

For notes in an A440 equal temperament, this formula delivers the standard MIDI note number (''p''). Any other frequencies fill the space between the whole numbers evenly. This lets MIDI instruments be tuned accurately in any microtuning scale, including non-western traditional tunings.

== History of note names ==
Music notation systems have used letters of the [[alphabet]] for centuries. The 6th-century philosopher [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] is known to have used the first fourteen letters of the classical [[Latin alphabet]] (the letter J did not exist until the 16th century),
:A B C D E F G H I K L M N O,
to signify the notes of the two-octave range that was in use at the time&lt;ref&gt;
Boethius. ''De institutione musica''. Book IV, chap. 14. Ed. Friedlein, 341.&lt;/ref&gt; and in modern [[scientific pitch notation]] are represented as
:A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

Though it is not known whether this was his devising or common usage at the time, this is nonetheless called ''Boethian notation''. Although Boethius is the first author known to use this nomenclature in the literature, [[Ptolemy]] wrote of the two-octave range five centuries before, calling it the ''perfect system'' or ''complete system'' – as opposed to other, smaller-range note systems that did not contain all possible species of octave (i.e., the seven octaves starting from A, B, C, D, E, F, and G).

Following this, the range (or compass) of used notes was extended to three octaves, and the system of repeating letters A–G in each octave was introduced, these being written as [[lower-case]] for the second octave (a–g) and double lower-case letters for the third (aa–gg). When the range was extended down by one note, to a G, that note was denoted using the Greek letter [[gamma]] (Γ). (It is from this that the French word for scale, ''gamme'' derives, and the English word [[hexachord|gamut]], from "Gamma-Ut", the lowest note in Medieval music notation.)

The remaining five notes of the chromatic scale (the black keys on a piano keyboard) were added gradually; the first being B{{music|flat}}, since B was flattened in certain [[mode (music)|modes]] to avoid the dissonant [[tritone]] interval. This change was not always shown in notation, but when written, B{{music|flat}} (B-flat) was written as a Latin, round "b", and B{{music|natural}} (B-natural) a Gothic script (known as [[Blackletter]]) or "hard-edged" b. These evolved into the modern flat ({{music|flat}}) and natural ({{music|natural}}) symbols respectively. The sharp symbol arose from a barred b, called the "cancelled b".

In parts of Europe, including [[Germany]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Finland]] and [[Iceland]] (and [[Sweden]] before about 1990s), the Gothic b transformed into the letter H (possibly for ''hart'', German for ''hard'', or just because the Gothic b resembled an H). Therefore, in German music notation, H is used instead of B{{music|natural}} (B-natural), and B instead of B{{music|flat}} (B-flat). Occasionally, music written in German for international use will use H for B-natural and B&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; for B-flat (with a modern-script lower-case b instead of a flat sign). Since a Bes or B{{music|flat}} in Northern Europe (i.e., a B{{music|bb}} elsewhere) is both rare and unorthodox (more likely to be expressed as Heses), it is generally clear what this notation means.

In Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Romanian, Greek, Russian, Mongolian, Flemish, Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, Ukrainian, Bulgarian and Turkish notation the notes of scales are given in terms of Do–Re–Mi–Fa–Sol–La–Si rather than C–D–E–F–G–A–B. These names follow the original names reputedly given by [[Guido d'Arezzo]], who had taken them from the first syllables of the first six musical phrases of a [[Gregorian chant]] melody "[[Ut queant laxis]]", which began on the appropriate scale degrees. These became the basis of the [[solfège]] system. "Do" later replaced the original "Ut" for ease of singing (most likely from the beginning of ''Dominus'', Lord), though "Ut" is still used in some places. "Si" or "Ti" was added as the seventh degree (from ''Sancte Johannes'', St. John, to whom the hymn is dedicated). The use of "Si" versus "Ti" varies regionally.

The two notation systems most commonly used today are the [[Helmholtz pitch notation]] system and the [[scientific pitch notation]] system. As shown in the table above, they both include several octaves, each starting from C rather than A. The reason is that the most commonly used scale in Western music is the [[major scale]], and the sequence C–D–E–F–G–A–B–C (the [[C major]] scale) is the simplest example of a major scale. Indeed, it is the only major scale that can be obtained using [[natural note]]s (the white keys on the piano keyboard) and is typically the first musical scale taught in music schools.

In a newly developed system, primarily in use in the United States, notes of scales become independent of music notation. In this system the natural symbols C–D–E–F–G–A–B refer to the absolute notes, while the names Do–Re–Mi–Fa–So–La–Ti are relativized and show only the relationship between pitches, where Do is the name of the base pitch of the scale, Re is the name of the second pitch, etc. The idea of so-called movable Do, originally suggested by [[John Curwen]] in the 19th century, was fully developed and involved into a whole educational system by [[Zoltán Kodály]] in the middle of the 20th century, which system is known as the [[Kodály method]] or Kodály concept.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8927">The '''NK model''' is a [[mathematical model]] described by its primary inventor [[Stuart Kauffman]] as a "tunably rugged" [[fitness landscape]]. "Tunable ruggedness" captures the intuition that both the overall size of the landscape and the number of its local "hills and valleys" can be adjusted via changes to its two parameters, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, defined below.  The NK model has found application in a wide variety of fields, including the theoretical study of [[evolutionary biology]], [[immunology]], [[combinatorial optimization|optimisation]], [[technological evolution]], and [[complex systems]]. The model was also adopted in [[organizational theory]], where it is used to describe the way an [[Agent-based model|agent]] may search a landscape by manipulating various characteristics of itself. For example, an agent can be an [[organization]], the hills and valleys represent [[Profit (economics)|profit]] (or changes thereof), and movement on the landscape necessitates organizational decisions (such as adding product lines or altering the organizational structure), which tend to interact with each other and affect profit in a complex fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levinthal | first1 = D. A. | year = 1997 | title = Adaptation on Rugged Landscapes | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 43 | issue = 7| pages = 934–950 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.43.7.934}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An early version of the model, which considered only the smoothest (&lt;math&gt;K=0&lt;/math&gt;) and most rugged (&lt;math&gt;K=N-1&lt;/math&gt;) landscapes, was presented in Kauffman and Levin (1987).&lt;ref name = "kauff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kauffman | first1 = S. | last2 = Levin | first2 = S. | year = 1987 | title = Towards a general theory of adaptive walks on rugged landscapes | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 128 | issue = 1| pages = 11–45 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(87)80029-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model as it is currently known first appeared in Kauffman and Weinberger (1989).&lt;ref name = "KandW"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kauffman | first1 = S. | last2 = Weinberger | first2 = E. | year = 1989 | title = The NK Model of rugged fitness landscapes and its application to the maturation of the immune response | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 141 | issue = 2| pages = 211–245 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(89)80019-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the reasons why the model has attracted wide attention in [[combinatorial optimization|optimisation]] is that it is a particularly simple instance of a so-called [[NP-complete problem]].&lt;ref name = "NPcomplete"&gt;Weinberger, E. (1996), "NP-completeness of Kauffman's N-k model, a Tuneably Rugged Fitness Landscape", Santa Fe Institute Working Paper, 96-02-003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical details ==
The NK model defines a [[combinatorial]] [[phase space]], consisting of every string (chosen from a given alphabet) of length &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. For each string in this search space, a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] value (called the ''[[fitness function|fitness]]'') is defined. If a distance [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] is defined between strings, the resulting structure is a ''landscape''.

Fitness values are defined according to the specific incarnation of the model, but the key feature of the NK model is that the fitness of a given string &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of contributions from each locus &lt;math&gt;f_i(S)&lt;/math&gt; in the string:

:&lt;math&gt;F(S) = \sum_i \tilde{f}_i(S),&lt;/math&gt;

and the contribution from each locus in general depends on its state and the state of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; other loci,:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}_i(S) = f_i(S_i, S_{k_{i1}}, \dots, S_{k_{iK}}), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the index of the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th neighbor of locus &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. 

Hence, the fitness function &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] between strings of length ''K''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 and scalars, which Weinberger's later work calls "fitness contributions". Such fitness contributions are often chosen randomly from some specified probability distribution.

In 1991, Weinberger published a detailed analysis&lt;ref name="AnalyticOptima" /&gt;  of the case in which &lt;math&gt;1 &lt;&lt; k \le N&lt;/math&gt; and the fitness contributions are chosen randomly.  His analytical estimate of the number of local optima was later shown to be flawed {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.  However, numerical experiments included in Weinberger's analysis support his analytical result that the expected fitness of a string is normally distributed with a mean of approximately

&lt;math&gt; \mu + \sigma \sqrt{{2 \ln (k+1)} \over {k+1}}&lt;/math&gt;

and a variance of approximately

&lt;math&gt; {{(k+1)\sigma^2} \over {N[k+1 + 2(k+2)\ln(k+1)]}}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Visualization of two dimensions of a NK fitness landscape.png|thumb|Visualization of two dimensions of a NK fitness landscape. The arrows represent various mutational paths that the population could follow while evolving on the fitness landscape.]]

== Example ==
For simplicity, we will work with [[Binary code|binary]] strings. Consider an NK model with ''N'' = 5, ''K'' = 1. Here, the fitness of a string is given by the sum of individual fitness contributions from each of 5 loci. Each fitness contribution depends on the local locus value and one other. We will employ the convention that &lt;math&gt;f(S_i) = f(S_i, S_{i+1})&lt;/math&gt;, so that each locus is affected by its neighbour, and &lt;math&gt;f(S_5) = f(S_5, S_1)&lt;/math&gt; for cyclicity. If we choose, for example, the fitness function ''f''(0, 0) = 0; ''f''(0, 1) = 1; ''f''(1, 0) = 2; ''f''(1, 1) = 0, the fitness values of two example strings are:

:&lt;math&gt; F(00101) = f(0,0)  + f(0,1) + f(1,0) + f(0, 1) + f(1, 0) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6. &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; F(11100) = f(1,1)  + f(1,1) + f(1,0) + f(0, 0) + f(0, 1) = 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 3. &lt;/math&gt;

== Tunable topology ==
[[Image:Nk model hypercube.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Illustration of tunable topology in the NK model. Nodes are individual binary strings, edges connect strings with a [[Hamming distance]] of exactly one. (left) ''N'' = 5, ''K'' = 0. (centre) ''N'' = 5, ''K'' = 1. (right) ''N'' = 5, ''K'' = 2. The colour of a node denotes its fitness, with redder values having higher fitness. The [[embedding]] of the hypercube is chosen so that the fitness maximum is at the centre. Notice that the ''K'' = 0 landscape appears smoother than the higher-K cases.]]

The value of ''K'' controls the degree of [[epistasis]] in the NK model, or how much other loci affect the fitness contribution of a given locus. With ''K'' = 0, the fitness of a given string is a simple sum of individual contributions of loci: for nontrivial fitness functions, a [[global optimum]] is present and easy to locate (the genome of all 0s if ''f''(0) &gt; ''f''(1), or all 1s if ''f''(1) &gt; ''f''(0)). For nonzero ''K'', the fitness of a string is a sum of fitnesses of substrings, which may interact to [[Geometrical frustration|frustrate]] the system (consider how to achieve optimal fitness in the example above). Increasing ''K'' thus increases the ruggedness of the fitness landscape.

=== Variations with neutral spaces ===
The bare NK model does not support the phenomenon of ''neutral space'' -- that is, sets of genomes connected by single mutations that have the same fitness value. Two adaptations have been proposed to include this [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|biologically important structure]]. The ''NKP model'' introduces a parameter &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;: a proportion &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;2^K&lt;/math&gt; fitness contributions is set to zero, so that the contributions of several genetic motifs are degenerate {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The ''NKQ model'' introduces a parameter &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and enforces a discretisation on the possible fitness contribution values so that each contribution takes one of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; possible values, again introducing degeneracy in the contributions from some genetic motifs {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The bare NK model corresponds to the &lt;math&gt;P = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q = \infty&lt;/math&gt; cases under these parameterisations.

== Applications ==
The NK model has found use in many fields, including in the study of [[spin glasses]], [[epistasis]] and [[pleiotropy]] in [[evolutionary biology]], and [[combinatorial optimisation]].

[[Image:Wea02616 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|right|The National Data Buoy Center just after Hurricane Katrina]] 

The '''National Data Buoy Center''' ('''NDBC''') is a part of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s (NOAA) [[National Weather Service]] (NWS). NDBC designs, develops, operates, and maintains a network of data collecting [[buoys]] and coastal stations. The NBDC is located in southern Mississippi as a tenant at the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]], a [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) facility.

== Operations ==
NDBC employs [[engineer]]s, [[meteorologist]]s, [[oceanographer]]s, [[computer scientist]]s, and other professionals. 

NDBC provides hourly observations from a network of about 90 buoys and 60 [[Coastal Marine Automated Network]] (C-MAN) stations to help meet these needs. All stations measure [[wind]] speed, direction, and gust; [[atmospheric pressure]]; and air [[temperature]]. In addition, all [[weather buoy|buoy]] stations, and some C-MAN stations, measure [[sea surface temperature]] and [[Ocean surface wave|wave]] height and period. Conductivity and water current are measured at selected stations.

A new task is the operation of the '''DART''' ([[Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis]]) buoys.  DART is a fleet of tsunami detecting buoys.

Another task adopted in 2005 is '''TAO''' ([[Tropical Atmosphere Ocean project]]) buoys. TAO is a fleet of over 50 buoys moored in the Pacific Ocean.  These buoys are designed to help detect and predict [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] and [[La Niña]]. 

All buoys and many C-MAN stations located in offshore areas operate on marine batteries which are charged by [[solar cell]]s. Sensors are calibrated in wind tunnels or environmental chambers, and later tested with the onboard station microprocessors, called payloads, on test stands at the outside sensor test facility. Final calibration and testing of the completed buoy systems are accomplished in the onsite canal. All buoys are serviced about every two years for routine maintenance and to install newly calibrated sensors. 
[[Image:Discus buoy 42001.jpg|thumb|right|A typical deep-sea NDBC discus buoy in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]

The observations from moored buoys and C-MAN stations are transmitted hourly through NOAA [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]]s (GOES) to a ground receiving facility at [[Wallops Island, Virginia]], operated by the NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS). Additionally, some buoys and C-MAN stations may use the [[Iridium Satellite LLC|Iridium satellite system]] to transmit data. The data is recorded and processed by the [[National Oceanographic Data Center]].

Through a Memorandum of Agreement, the [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG) remains a critically important partner to NDBC, supplying transportation for buoy deployments, retrievals, and other maintenance.

== History ==
The National Data Buoy Development Program (NDBDP), created in 1967, was placed under the control of the USCG.

In 1970, NOAA was formed and the NOAA Data Buoy Office (NDBO) was created within the National Ocean Service (NOS) and located in Mississippi. In 1982, the NDBO was renamed NDBC and was placed under NOAA's NWS.

The first buoys deployed by NDBC were the large 12-m discus hulls constructed of steel. These were generally deployed in deep water off the U.S. East Coast and in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. 

By 1979, 16 stations were deployed in the Pacific, 7 in the Atlantic, and 3 in the Gulf of Mexico. Eight more stations were deployed in the Great Lakes after 1979.

In 1995, development of the [[Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis]] (DART) system began, with deployment beginning in 2000. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and its subsequent tsunamis, additional dart buoys were deployed.

== Location ==
NDBC's main office is located in southern Mississippi at the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]], a [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) facility. This site was chosen because it contains an excellent pre-existing industrial facility which is adjacent to a canal with deep-water access to the Gulf of Mexico. Other offices are located in Sterling, Virginia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4312">The '''Oddy test''' is a procedure created at the [[British Museum]] by conservation scientist [[William Andrew Oddy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/objects_conservation/spring_2003/oddy.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123123422/http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/objects_conservation/spring_2003/oddy.asp |archivedate=November 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;W.A.Oddy, "An unsuspected danger in display", Museum Journal 73, 1973, p.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; in order to test materials for safety in and around art objects.
Often, materials for construction are evaluated for safety. However, though materials may be safe for building purposes, they may emit trace amounts of chemicals that can harm art objects over time. [[Acid]]s, [[formaldehyde]], and other fumes can damage and even destroy delicate artifacts if placed too close.

==Procedure==
This test calls for a sample of the material in question to be placed in an airtight container with three [[Coupon (materials science)|coupons]] of different metals—[[silver]], [[lead]], and [[copper]]—that are not touching each other or the sample of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Schiro,Mara "Oddy Test Protocols" http://www.conservation-wiki.com/index.php?title=Oddy_Test_Protocols&amp;oldid=4830 Accessed February 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The container is sealed with a small amount of de-ionized water to maintain a high [[humidity]], then heated at 60 degrees [[Celsius]] for 28 days. An identical container with three metal coupons acts as a [[Scientific control|control]]. If the metal coupons show no signs of [[corrosion]], then the material is deemed suitable to be placed in and around art objects. The Oddy test is not a contact test, but is for testing [[outgassing|off-gassing]].
[[File:Oddy-test-color.jpg|thumb|A basic layout of a three-in-one Oddy Test]]
Each metal detects a different set of [[corrosive substance|corrosive agents]]. The silver is for detecting reduced sulfur compounds and [[carbonyl sulfide]]s. The lead is for detecting organic acids, [[aldehyde]], and acidic gases. The copper is for detecting [[chloride]], oxide, and sulfur compounds.

There are many types of [[materials testing]] for other purposes, including [[chemical test]]ing and [[physical test]]ing.

==Development==
The Oddy test has gone through many changes and refinements over time. Whereas Andrew Oddy proposed to place each metal coupon in a separate glass container with the material to be tested, Bamberger et al.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Conservation, Vol. 44, No. 2 (1999), pp. 86-90.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a "three-in-one" test, where all three metal coupons shared one container, simplifying the procedure. Robinett and Thickett (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Conservation, Vol. 48, No. 4 (2003), pp. 263-268.&lt;/ref&gt; refined the "three-in-one" test by stabilizing the metal coupons.

One of the main issues with the Oddy test is that there is some subjectivity to the interpretation of the results,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-43/standard-materials-for-corrosiveness-testing/&lt;/ref&gt; since it is primarily a visual determination.
[[File:Oddy-tests 0823b.jpg|thumb|Oddy-tests 0823b]]

Institutions that use the Oddy test in their research are mainly art museums such as The [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art|The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

'''Overexploitation''', also called '''overharvesting''', refers to harvesting a [[renewable resource]] to the [[point of diminishing returns]]. Continued overexploitation can lead to the destruction of the resource. The term applies to [[natural resource]]s such as: wild [[medicinal plant]]s, [[Pasture|grazing pasture]]s, [[Game (food)|game animals]], [[fish stocks]], [[forests]], and [[Aquifer|water aquifers]].

In [[ecology]], overexploitation describes one of the five main activities threatening global [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=Wilcoveetal&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilcove |first=D. S. |first2=D. |last2=Rothstein |first3=J. |last3=Dubow |first4=A. |last4=Phillips |first5=E. |last5=Losos |year=1998 |title=Quantifying threats to imperiled species in the United States |journal=BioScience |volume=48 |issue= |pages=607–615 |doi=10.2307/1313420 |jstor= 1313420 |url= http://www.unc.edu/courses/2006spring/geog/144/001/www/readings/wilcove2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists use the term to describe populations that are harvested at a rate that is unsustainable, given their natural rates of mortality and capacities for reproduction. This can result in extinction at the population level and even extinction of whole species. In [[conservation biology]] the term is usually used in the context of human economic activity that involves the taking of biological resources, or organisms, in larger numbers than their populations can withstand.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford. (1996). Oxford Dictionary of Biology. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used and defined somewhat differently in [[fisheries]], [[hydrology]] and [[natural resource management]].

Overexploitation can lead to resource destruction, including [[extinction]]s. However it is also possible for overexploitation to be sustainable, as [[#Fisheries|discussed below]] in the section on fisheries. In the context of fishing, the term [[overfishing]] can be used instead of overexploitation, as can [[overgrazing]] in [[stock management]], [[overlogging]] in [[forest management]], [[overdrafting]] in [[aquifer]] management, and [[endangered species]] in species monitoring. Overexploitation is not an activity limited to humans. Introduced predators and herbivores, for example, can overexploit native [[flora]] and [[fauna]].

==History==
[[File:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|right|When the giant flightless birds called [[moa]] were overexploited to the point of extinction,&lt;ref name=Holdaway /&gt; the giant [[Haast's eagle]] that preyed on them also became extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tennyson |first=A. |author2=Martinson, P. |year=2006 |title=Extinct Birds of New Zealand |publisher=Te Papa Press |location=Wellington, New Zealand |isbn=978-0-909010-21-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Concern about overexploitation is relatively recent, though overexploitation itself is not a new phenomenon. It has been observed for millennia. For example, ceremonial cloaks worn by the Hawaiian kings were made from the [[mamo]] bird; a single cloak used the feathers of 70,000 birds of this now-extinct species. The [[dodo]], a flightless bird from [[Mauritius]], is another well-known example of overexploitation.  As with many island species, it was naive about certain predators, allowing humans to approach and kill it with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Fryer |date=2002-09-14 |title=Bringing the dodo back to life |work=BBC News |accessdate=2006-09-07 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2255991.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the earliest of times, [[hunting]] has been an important human activity as a means of survival. There is a whole history of overexploitation in the form of overhunting. The [[overkill hypothesis]] ([[Quaternary extinction event]]s) explains why the [[megafauna]]l extinctions occurred within a relatively short period of time. This can be traced with [[human migration]]. The most convincing evidence of this theory is that 80% of the North American large mammal species disappeared within 1000 years of the arrival of humans on the western hemisphere continents.&lt;ref&gt;Paul S. Martin&lt;/ref&gt;  The fastest ever recorded extinction of [[megafauna]] occurred in [[New Zealand]], where by 1500 AD, just 200 years after settling the islands, ten species of the giant [[Moa|moa birds]] were hunted to extinction by the [[Māori people|Māori]].&lt;ref name=Holdaway&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holdaway |first=R. N. |authorlink= |author2=Jacomb, C. |year=2000 |title=Rapid Extinction of the Moas (Aves: Dinornithiformes): Model, Test, and Implications |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/gibbs/efb413/moa.pdf |volume=287 |issue=5461 |pages=2250–2254 |doi=10.1126/science.287.5461.2250 |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=10731144 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527164824/http://www.esf.edu/efb/gibbs/efb413/moa.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-27 |df= |bibcode=2000Sci...287.2250H }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of extinctions occurred later with European settlement.

In more recent times, overexploitation has resulted in the gradual emergence of the concepts of [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]], which has built on other concepts, such as [[sustainable yield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larkin |first=P. A. |year=1977 |title=An epitaph for the concept of maximum sustained yield |journal=Transactions of the American Fisheries Society |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106&lt;1:AEFTCO&gt;2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[eco-development]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lubchenco |first=J. |year=1991 |title=The Sustainable Biosphere Initiative: An ecological research agenda |journal=Ecology |volume=72 |issue= |pages=371–412 |doi=10.2307/2937183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lee |first=K.

==Overview==
Overexploitation doesn't necessarily lead to the destruction of the resource, nor is it necessarily unsustainable. However, [[resource depletion|depleting]] the numbers or amount of the resource can change its quality. For example, [[Livistona rotundifolia|footstool palm]] is a wild palm tree found in Southeast Asia. Its leaves are used for thatching and food wrapping, and overharvesting has resulted in its leaf size becoming smaller.

==Tragedy of the commons==
[[File:Cows on Selsley Common - geograph.org.uk - 192472.jpg|thumb|left|Cows on [[Selsley Common]]. The [[tragedy of the commons]] is a useful parable for understanding how overexploitation can occur.]]

The [[tragedy of the commons]] refers to a dilemma described in an article by that name written by [[Garrett Hardin]] and first published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1968.&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{cite journal |first=Garrett |last=Hardin |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |year=1968 |pages=1243–1248 |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |pmid=5699198|bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H }} Also available [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to [[Tragedy of the commons#Garrett Hardin's essay|Hardin's essay]] is an example which is a useful parable for understanding how overexploitation can occur. This example was first sketched in an 1833 pamphlet by [[William Forster Lloyd]], as a hypothetical and simplified situation based on medieval [[land tenure]] in Europe, of herders sharing a [[Common land|common]] on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze. In Hardin's example, it is in each herder's interest to put each succeeding cow he acquires onto the land, even if the [[carrying capacity]] of the common is exceeded and it is temporarily or permanently damaged for all as a result. The herder receives all of the benefits from an additional cow, while the damage to the common is shared by the entire group. If all herders make this individually rational economic decision, the common will be overexploited or even destroyed to the detriment of all. However, since all herders reach the same rational conclusion, overexploitation in the form of [[overgrazing]] occurs, with immediate losses, and the pasture may be degraded to the point where it gives very little return.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit—in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons." (Hardin, 1968)&lt;ref name=hardin68 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the course of his essay, Hardin develops the theme, drawing in many examples of latter day commons, such as [[national park]]s, the atmosphere, oceans, rivers and [[fish stocks]]. The example of fish stocks had led some to call this the "tragedy of the fishers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Bowles |title=Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=27–29 |year=2004 |isbn=0-691-09163-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major theme running through the essay is the growth of human populations, with the [[Earth]]'s finite resources being the general common.

The tragedy of the commons has intellectual roots tracing back to [[Aristotle]], who noted that "what is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostrom |first=E. |year=1992 |chapter=The rudiments of a theory of the origins, survival, and performance of common-property institutions |editor-first=D. W. |editor-last=Bromley |title=Making the Commons Work: Theory, Practice and Policy |location=San Francisco |publisher=ICS Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to [[Hobbes]] and his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feeny |first=D. |year=1990 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons: Twenty-two years later |journal=Human Ecology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1007/BF00889070 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite situation to a tragedy of the commons is sometimes referred to as a [[tragedy of the anticommons]]: a situation in which rational individuals, acting separately, collectively waste a given resource by underutilizing it.

The tragedy of the commons can be avoided if it is appropriately regulated. Hardin's use of "commons" has frequently been misunderstood, leading Hardin to later remark that he should have titled his work "The tragedy of the unregulated commons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fe20060726sh.html |title=Will commons sense dawn again in time? |work=The Japan Times Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fisheries==
[[File:Bluefin-big.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] is currently seriously overexploited. Scientists say 7,500 tons annually is the sustainable limit, yet the fishing industry continue to harvest 60,000 tons.]]

In [[wild fisheries]], overexploitation or [[overfishing]] occurs when a [[fish stock]] has been fished down "below the size that, on average, would support the long-term [[maximum sustainable yield]] of the fishery".&lt;ref&gt;[[NOAA]]: [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/fishwatch/glossary.htm ''FishWatch glossary''] Retrieved 2 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, overexploitation can be sustainable.

When a fishery starts harvesting fish from a previously unexploited stock, the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of the fish stock will decrease, since harvesting means fish are being removed. For sustainability, the rate at which the fish replenish biomass through reproduction must balance the rate at which the fish are being harvested. If the harvest rate is increased, then the stock biomass will further decrease. At a certain point, the maximum harvest yield that can be sustained will be reached, and further attempts to increase the harvest rate will result in the collapse of the fishery. This point is called the [[maximum sustainable yield]], and in practice, usually occurs when the fishery has been fished down to about 30% of the biomass it had before harvesting started.&lt;ref&gt;Bolden, E.G., Robinson, W.L. (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PL6r1Ir_x_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Wildlife+ecology+and+management%22&amp;ei=ugW6SpjREJCINMbR1L8P#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Wildlife ecology and management''] 4th ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc. Upper Saddle River, NJ. {{ISBN|0-13-840422-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to fish the stock down further to, say, 15% of the pre-harvest biomass, and then adjust the harvest rate so the biomass remains at that level. In this case, the fishery is sustainable, but is now overexploited, because the stock has been run down to the point where the sustainable yield is less than it could be.

Fish stocks are said to "collapse" if their biomass declines by more than 95 percent of their maximum historical biomass. [[Atlantic cod]] stocks were severely overexploited in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to their abrupt collapse in 1992.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; Even though fishing has ceased, the cod stocks have failed to recover.&lt;ref name=Frank/&gt; The absence of cod as the [[apex predator]] in many areas has led to [[trophic cascade]]s.&lt;ref name=Frank/&gt;

About 25% of world fisheries are now overexploited to the point where their current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grafton | first1 = RQ | authorlink3 = Ray Hilborn | last2 = Kompas | first2 = T | last3 = Hilborn | first3 = RW | year = 2007 | title = Economics of Overexploitation Revisited | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/318/5856/1601 | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5856| page = 1601 | doi=10.1126/science.1146017 | bibcode=2007Sci...318.1601G | pmid=18063793}}&lt;/ref&gt; These depleted fisheries can often recover if fishing pressure is reduced until the stock biomass returns to the optimal biomass. At this point, harvesting can be resumed near the maximum sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = AA | year = 2003 | title = Managing to the margins: the overexploitation of fisheries | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 102–106 | doi = 10.1890/1540-9295(2003)001[0102:MTTMTO]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tragedy of the commons]] can be avoided within the context of fisheries if fishing effort and practices are regulated appropriately by [[fisheries management]]. One effective approach may be assigning some measure of ownership in the form of  [[individual transferable quota]]s (ITQs) to fishermen. In 2008, a large scale study of fisheries that used ITQs, and ones that didn't, provided strong evidence that ITQs help prevent collapses and restore fisheries that appear to be in decline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/dn14762-guaranteed-fish-quotas-halt-commercial-freeforall.html  New Scientist: Guaranteed fish quotas halt commercial free-for-all]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=12253181 A Rising Tide: Scientists find proof that privatising fishing stocks can avert a disaster] The Economist, 18th Sept, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water resources, such as [[lake]]s and [[aquifer]]s, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers which don't recharge). Overexploitation occurs if a water resource, such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], is mined or extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge rate, that is, at a rate that exceeds the practical sustained yield. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. An aquifer which has been overexploited is said to be [[Overdrafting|overdrafted]] or depleted.  Forests enhance the recharge of [[aquifer]]s in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation: UN Report|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|archivedate=2001-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Conrad2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/byauthor/244797 |last= Conrad|first= C.|title= Forests of eucalyptus shadowed by questions |date= 2008-06-21|publisher= [[Arizona Daily Star]]|accessdate=2010-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206103926/http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/byauthor/244797 |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as [[nitrate]]s, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean.

[[File:Gordon River Clearcut.jpg|thumb|right|Clear cutting of old growth forests in Canada.]]

[[Forest]]s are overexploited when they are [[Logging|logged]] at a rate faster than [[reforestation]] takes place. Reforestation competes with other land uses such as food production, livestock grazing, and living space for further economic growth. Historically utilization of forest products, including timber and fuel wood, have played a key role in human societies, comparable to the roles of water and cultivable land. Today, developed countries continue to utilize timber for building houses, and wood pulp for [[paper]]. In developing countries almost three billion people rely on wood for heating and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;http://atlas.aaas.org/pdf/63-66.pdf Forest Products&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term economic gains made by [[Deforestation|conversion of forest]] to agriculture, or overexploitation of wood products, typically leads to loss of long-term income and long term biological productivity. [[West Africa]], [[Madagascar]], [[Southeast Asia]] and many other regions have experienced lower revenue because of overexploitation and the consequent declining timber harvests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0905.htm|title=Destruction of Renewable Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endangered species==
[[File:Overgrazing.JPG|thumb|right|It is not just humans that overexploit resources. [[Overgrazing]] can be caused by native fauna, as shown in the upper right. However, past human overexploitation (leading to elimination of some predators) may be behind the situation.]]

Overexploitation threatens one-third of endangered [[vertebrate]]s, as well as other groups. Excluding edible fish, the illegal [[wildlife trade|trade in wildlife]] is valued at $10 billion per year.  Industries responsible for this include the trade in [[bushmeat]], the trade in [[Chinese medicine]], and the [[fur trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Hemley 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or [[CITES]] was set up in order to control and regulate the trade in endangered animals.  It currently protects, to a varying degree, some 33,000 species of animals and plants. It is estimated that a quarter of the endangered vertebrates in the United States of America and half of the endangered mammals is attributed to overexploitation.&lt;ref name=Wilcoveetal /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Primack |first=R. B. |year=2002 |title=Essentials of Conservation Biology |edition=3rd |location=Sunderland |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=0-87893-719-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All living organisms require resources to survive. Overexploitation of these resources for protracted periods can deplete natural stocks to the point where they are unable to recover within a short time frame. Humans have always harvested food and other resources they have needed to survive.  Human populations, historically, were small, and methods of collection limited to small quantities. With an exponential increase in human population, expanding markets and increasing demand, combined with improved access and techniques for capture, are causing the [[exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] of many species beyond sustainable levels.&lt;ref&gt;Redford 1992, Fitzgibon ''et al.'' 1995, Cuarón 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  In practical terms, if continued, it reduces valuable resources to such low levels that their exploitation is no longer sustainable and can lead to the [[extinction]] of a species, in addition to having dramatic, unforeseen [[keystone species|effects]], on the [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frankham |first=R. |last2=Ballou |first2=J. D. |last3=Briscoe |first3=D. A. |year=2002 |title=Introduction to Conservation Genetics |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-63014-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overexploitation often occurs rapidly as markets open, utilising previously untapped resources, or locally used species.

[[File:Conuropsis carolinensisAWP026AA2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Carolina parakeet]] was hunted to extinction.]]

Today, overexploitation and misuse of natural resources is an ever-present threat for [[species richness]].  This is more prevalent when looking at [[island ecology]] and the species that inhabit them, as islands can be viewed as the world in miniature.  Island [[Endemism|endemic]] populations are more prone to [[extinction]] from overexploitation, as they often exist at low densities with reduced reproductive rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dowding |first=J.

Chapman and Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

As another example, when the humble [[Erinaceus europaeus|hedgehog]] was introduced to the Scottish island of [[Uist]], the population greatly expanded and took to consuming and overexploiting shorebird eggs, with drastic consequences for their breeding success.  Twelve species of [[Bird|avifauna]] are affected, with some species numbers being reduced by 39%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=D. B. |last2=Fuller |first2=R.

Where there is substantial human migration, civil unrest, or war, controls may no longer exist.  With civil unrest, for example in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and [[Rwanda]], firearms have become common and the breakdown of food distribution networks in such countries leaves the resources of the natural environment vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=R. F. |year=1990 |title=Farewell to Africa |journal=Audubon |volume=92 |issue= |pages=1547–1551 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals are even killed as target practice, or simply to spite the government.  Populations of large primates, such as [[gorilla]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s, [[ungulate]]s and other mammals, may be reduced by 80% or more by hunting, and certain species may be eliminated altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilkie |first=D.

Overall, 50 bird species that have become extinct since 1500 (approximately 40% of the total) have been subject to overexploitation,&lt;ref&gt;The LUCN Red List of Threatened Species (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; including:

* [[Pinguinus impennis|Great Auk]] – the penguin-like bird of the north, was hunted for its feathers, meat, fat and oil.
* [[Carolina parakeet]] – The only parrot species native to the eastern United States, was hunted for crop protection and its feathers.

Other species affected by overexploitation include: 

* The international trade in fur: [[chinchilla]], [[vicuña]], [[giant otter]] and numerous cat species
* Insect collectors: butterflies
* Horticulturists: New Zealand mistletoe (''Trilepidia adamsii''), orchids, cacti and many other plant species

==Cascade effects==
[[Image:Kelp forest.jpg|thumb|left|Overexploiting [[sea otter]]s resulted in [[cascade effect]]s which destroyed [[kelp forest]] ecosystems.]]

Overexploitation of species can result in knock-on or [[cascade effect]]s. This can particularly apply if, through overexploitation, a habitat loses its [[apex predator]]. Because of the loss of the top predator, a [[Overpopulation in wild animals|dramatic increase]] in their [[prey]] species can occur. In turn, the unchecked prey can then overexploit their own food resources until population numbers dwindle, possibly to the point of extinction.

A classic example of cascade effects occurred with [[sea otters]]. Starting before the 17th century and not phased out until 1911, sea otters were hunted aggressively for their exceptionally warm and valuable pelts, which could fetch up to $2500 US. This caused cascade effects through the [[kelp forest]] ecosystems along the Pacific Coast of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Estes |first=J. A. |first2=D. O. |last2=Duggins |first3=G. B. |last3=Rathbun |year=1989 |title=The ecology of extinctions in kelp forest communities |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=251–264 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1989.tb00085.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sea otters’ primary food sources is the [[sea urchin]]. When hunters caused sea otter populations to decline, an [[ecological release]] of sea urchin populations occurred. The sea urchins then overexploited their main food source, [[kelp]], creating urchin barrens, areas of seabed denuded of kelp, but carpeted with urchins. No longer having food to eat, the sea urchin became [[locally extinct]] as well. Also, since kelp forest ecosystems are homes to many other species, the loss of the kelp caused other cascade effects of secondary extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dayton |first=P. K. |first2=M. J. |last2=Tegner |first3=P. B. |last3=Edwards |first4=K. L. |last4=Riser |year=1998 |title=Sliding baselines, ghosts, and reduced expectations in kelp forest communities |journal=Ecol.

In 1911, when only one small group of 32 sea otters survived in a remote cove, an international treaty was signed to prevent further exploitation of the sea otters. Under heavy protection, the otters multiplied and repopulated the depleted areas, which slowly recovered. More recently, with declining numbers of fish stocks, again due to overexploitation, [[Orcinus orca|killer whales]] have experienced a food shortage and have been observed feeding on sea otters, again reducing their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krebs |first=C.

'''Post-normal science''' ('''PNS''') represents a novel approach for the use of science on issues where "facts [are] uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent".&lt;ref name="PNS3" /&gt; PNS was developed in the 1990s by [[Silvio Funtowicz]] and [[Jerome R. Ravetz]].&lt;ref name="PNS1"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. and Ravetz, J. R., 1991. "A New Scientific Methodology for Global Environmental Issues", in Costanza, R. (ed.), Ecological Economics: The Science and Management of Sustainability: 137–152. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNS2"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. and Ravetz, J. R., 1992. "Three types of risk assessment and the emergence of postnormal science", in Krimsky, S. and Golding, D. (eds.), Social theories of risk: 251–273. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNS3"&gt;Funtowicz, S. and Ravetz, J., 1993. "Science for the post-normal age", Futures, 31(7): 735-755.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be considered as a reaction to the styles of analysis based on risk and cost-benefit analysis prevailing at that time, and as an embodiment of concepts of a new "critical science" developed in previous works by the same authors.&lt;ref name="UQSP"&gt;Funtowicz, S. and Ravetz, J., 1990. [[Uncertainty and quality in science for policy]]. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SK_1971"&gt;Ravetz, J. R., 1971. Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent work PNS is described as "the stage where we are today, where all the comfortable assumptions about science, its production and its use, are in question".&lt;ref name="no-nonsense"&gt;Ravetz, J.R., 2006, The [[No nonsense guide to science]], New Internationalist.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==

In 1962, [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' introduced the concept of [[normal science]] as part of his theory that scientific knowledge progresses through socially constructed [[paradigm shift]]s, where normal science is what most scientists do all the time and what all scientists do most of the time. The process of a paradigm shift is essentially as follows:
* from normal science (the rules are agreed upon or disagreed upon in debates that cannot be concluded; science is puzzle solving, but some contradictions in theory cannot be resolved)
* to revolutionary science (important rules are called into question; contradictions may be resolved; paradigms shift)
* to new normal science (new rules are accepted, science returns to puzzle solving under new rules).

An illustration of the theory in practice is the [[Copernican revolution]], where Copernicus’ idea of a (sun-centered) solar system was largely ignored (not in the rules) when first introduced; then [[Galileo]] was deemed a heretic for supporting the idea (rules called into question); and finally, after a revolution in cosmology, the solar system became an obvious and foundational part of scientific knowledge (new rules).

Another example is the question of whether light is [[Wave–particle duality|a particle or a wave]]. For a long time there was debate on this point. Advocates on both sides had many valid arguments based on scientific evidence but were lacking a theory that would resolve the conflict. After a revolution in thinking, it was realized that both perspectives could be true.

Physicist and policy adviser [[James J. Kay]] described post-normal science as a process that recognizes the potential for gaps in knowledge and understanding that cannot be resolved in ways other than revolutionary science. He [http://www.jameskay.ca/pns/ argued] that (between revolutions) one should not necessarily attempt to resolve or dismiss contradictory perspectives of the world, whether they are based on science or not, but instead incorporate multiple viewpoints into the same problem-solving process. From the ecological perspective post-normal science can be situated in the context of 'crisis disciplines' – a term coined by the conservation biologist [[Michael E. Soulé]] to indicate approaches addressing fears, emerging in the seventies, that the world was on the verge of [[ecological collapse]]. In this respect Michael Egan&lt;ref name="Egan"&gt;Egan, M., 2018, Survival Science: Crisis Disciplines and the Shock of the Environment in the 1970s, Centaurus 2018: doi:10.1111/1600-0498.12149.&lt;/ref&gt; defines PNS as a 'survival science'.

Moving from PNS [[Ziauddin Sardar]] developed the concept of [[Postnormal Times]] (PNT). Sardar was the editor of [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/futures FUTURES] when it published the article ‘Science for the post-normal age’&lt;ref name="PNS3" /&gt; presently the most cited paper of the journal . A recent review of academic literature conducted on the [[Web of Science]] and encompassing the topics of Futures studies, Foresight, Forecasting and Anticipation Practice &lt;ref name="Gauthier" /&gt; identifies the same paper as "the all-time publication that received the highest number of citations". 

==Content==
"At birth Post-normal science was conceived as an inclusive set of robust insights more than as an exclusive fully structured theory or field of practice".&lt;ref name="Personal"&gt;Funtowicz, S., 2016, personal correspondence.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ideas underpinning PNS can already be found in a work published in 1983 and entitled "Three types of risk assessment: a methodological analysis" &lt;ref name="ThreeTypes_1983"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. and Ravetz, J. R. (1985), Three types of risk assessment: a methodological analysis, in C. Whipple and V. T. Covello (Eds), Risk Analysis in the Private Sector, pp 217-232 (Plenum, New York).&lt;/ref&gt; This and subsequent works &lt;ref name="PNS1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PNS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PNS3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UQSP" /&gt; show that PNS concentrates on few aspects of the complex relation between science and policy: the communication of uncertainty, the assessment of quality, and the justification and practice of the extended peer communities.

The horizontal axis represents ‘Systems Uncertainties’ and the vertical one ‘Decision Stakes’. The three quadrants identify Applied Science, Professional Consultancy, and Post-Normal Science. Different standards of quality and styles of analysis are appropriate to different regions in the diagram, i.e. Post-normal science does not claim relevance and cogency on all of science's application but only on those defined by the PNS's [[mantram]] with a fourfold challenge:  : ‘facts uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent’. For applied research science’s own peer quality control system will suffice (or so was assumed at the moment PNS was formulated in the early nineties), while professional consultancy was considered appropriate for these settings which cannot be ‘peer-reviewed’, and where the skills and the tacit knowledge of a practitioner are needed at the forefront, e.g. in a surgery room, or in a house on fire. Here a surgeon or a fireman takes a difficult technical decision based on her or his training and appreciation of the situation (the Greek concept of ‘[[Metis (mythology)]]’).

==Complexity==  
There are important linkages between PNS and complexity science,&lt;ref name="Complexity"&gt;Rees, M., 2017, Black holes are simpler than forests and science has its limits, [https://aeon.co/amp/ideas/black-holes-are-simpler-than-forests-and-science-has-its-limits AEON, 01 December].&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. system ecology ([[C. S. Holling]]) and hierarchy theory ([[Arthur Koestler]]). In PNS, complexity is respected through its recognition of a multiplicity of legitimate perspectives on any issue; and reflexivity is realised through the extension of accepted ‘facts’ beyond the supposedly objective productions of traditional research. Also, the new participants in the process are not treated as passive learners at the feet of the experts, being coercively convinced through scientific demonstration. Rather, they will form an ‘extended peer community’, sharing the work of quality assurance of the scientific inputs to the process, and arriving at a resolution of issues through debate and dialogue.&lt;ref name="Poetry_Thermod"&gt;Funtowicz, S., and Ravetz, J.R., THE POETRY OF THERMODYNAMICS, Energy, entropy/exergy and quality, Futures, Vol. 29, No. 9. pp. 791-810, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extended Peer Community==

PNS concept of extended peer community moves from and transcends the familiar concept of scientific peer community relative to a well-defined field of scientific research.
The peer community is extended in two respects: first, more than one discipline is assumed to have a potential bearing on the issue being debated, thereby providing different lenses to consider the problem. Second the community is extended to lay actors, taken to be all those with stakes, or an interest, in the given issue. Perhaps the best justification of the concept is offered by Paul Feyerabend in Against Method &lt;ref name="Feyerabend1975"&gt;Feyerabend, P. (1975). Against method. Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;. For Feyerabend the participation of experts together with non-experts would allow the citizens to mature, inter alia by realizing that the experts are themselves lay-people outside their restricted field of competence. For Giandomenico Majone &lt;ref name="Majone1989"&gt;Majone, G. (1989). Evidence, argument, and persuasion in the policy process. Yale University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; "In any area of public policy the choice of instruments, far from being a technical exercise that can be safely delegated to the experts, reflects as in a microcosm all the political, moral, and cultural dimensions of policy-making." The same author notes: "Dialectical confrontation between generalists and experts often succeeds in bringing out unstated assumptions, conflicting interpretations of the facts, and the risks posed by the projects". These considerations justifies the need for an extended peer community, as the arena where the policy instruments and options can be discussed with - but without deference to - the experts and the authorities. 

The lay members of the community thus constituted may also take upon themselves active 'research' tasks; this has happened e.g. in the so-called 'popular epidemiology' &lt;ref name="Brown1997"&gt;Brown, P. (1997). Popular Epidemiology Revisited. Current Sociology, 45(3), 137–156.&lt;/ref&gt;, when the official authorities have shown reticence to perform investigations deemed necessary by the communities affected - for example - by a case of air or water pollution &lt;ref name="Fjelland2016"&gt;Fjelland, R. (2016). When Laypeople are Right and Experts are Wrong: Lessons from Love Canal. International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry, 22(1), 105–125.&lt;/ref&gt; , and more recently ‘citizen science’ &lt;ref name="Stilgoe2009"&gt;Stilgoe, J. (2009). Citizen Scientists: Reconnecting Science with Civil Society. London: Demos.&lt;/ref&gt;. The extended community can usefully investigate the quality of the scientific assessments provided by the experts, the definition of the problem, as well as research priorities and research questions &lt;ref name="Miedema2016"&gt;Miedema, F. (2016, May 12). To confront 21st century challenges, science must rethink its reward system | Science | The Guardian. The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Thus, the extension of the peer community is not only ethically fair or politically correct, but also enhances the quality of the relevant science. An example is provided by Brian Wynne, who discusses the Cumbrian sheep farmers' interaction with scientist and authorities in the relation to the Chernobyl radioactive fallout &lt;ref name="Wynne1992"&gt;Wynne, B. (1992). Misunderstood misunderstanding: social identities and public uptake of science. Public Understanding of Science, 1, 281–304.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Applications==


Beside its dominating influence in the literature on 'futures'&lt;ref name="Gauthier"&gt; Thomas Gauthier, Sylvaine Mercuri Chapuis, 2018, An Investigation of Futures Studies Scholarly Literature, In: Poli R. (eds) Handbook of Anticipation. Springer, Cham &lt;/ref&gt;, PNS is considered to have influenced the ecological ‘conservation versus preservation debate’, especially via its reading by American pragmatist [https://www.iac.gatech.edu/people/faculty/norton Bryan G. Norton]. According to Jozef Keulartz &lt;ref name="Keulartz"&gt;Keulartz, J. (2018). Does Deliberation Promote Ecological Citizenship? The Convergence Hypothesis and the Reality of Polarization. In S. Sarkar &amp; B. A. Minteer (Eds.), A Sustainable Philosophy—The Work of Bryan Norton, The International Library of Environmental, Agricultural and Food Ethics 26. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; the PNS concept of "extended peer community" influenced how Norton's developed his 'convergence hypothesis'. The hypothesis posits that ecologists of different orientation will converge once they start thinking 'as a mountain', or as a planet. For Norton this will be achieved via deliberative democracy, which will pragmatically overcome the black and white divide between conservationists and preservationists.

Other authors &lt;ref name="Heaslip"&gt;Heaslip, E., &amp; Fahy, F. (2018). Developing transdisciplinary approaches to community energy transitions: An island case study. Energy Research &amp; Social Science.&lt;/ref&gt; attribute to PNS the role of having stimulated the take up of transdisciplinary methodological frameworks, reliant on the social constructivist perspective embedded in PNS.

Today Post-normal science is intended as applicable to most instances where the use of evidence is contested due to different norms and values.

As summarized in a recent work "the ideas and concepts of post normal science bring about the emergence of new problem solving strategies in which the role of science is appreciated in its full context of the complexity and the uncertainty of natural systems and the relevance of human commitments and values.&lt;ref name="Lister"&gt;Lister, A. R., Ingram, J. C., Briehl, M. M., &amp; Diana, S. (2018). THE BIOACCUMULATION OF URANIUM IN SHEEP HEART AND KIDNEY: THE IMPACT OF CONTAMINATED TRADITIONAL FOOD SOURCES ON THE NAVAJO RESERVATION. ProQuest, 10817030. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/openview/ab771b94df56ad747c9a64e499803e88/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y&lt;/ref&gt;

For Peter Gluckman (2014), chief science advisor to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, post normal science approaches are today appropriate for a host of problems including  "eradication of exogenous pests […], offshore oil prospecting, legalization of recreational psychotropic drugs, water quality, family violence, obesity, teenage morbidity and suicide, the ageing population, the prioritization of early-childhood education, reduction of agricultural greenhouse gases, and balancing economic growth and environmental sustainability".&lt;ref name="Gluckman"&gt;Gluckman, P., 2014, Policy: The art of science advice to government, Nature, 507, 163–165.&lt;/ref&gt;
For Carrozza &lt;ref name="Carrozza"&gt;Carrozza, C. (2015). Democratizing Expertise and Environmental Governance: Different Approaches to the Politics of Science and their Relevance for Policy Analysis. Journal of Environmental Policy &amp; Planning, 17(1), 108-126.&lt;/ref&gt; PNS can be "framed in terms of a call for the ‘democratization of expertise’", and as a "reaction against long-term trends of ‘scientization’ of politics—the tendency towards assigning to experts a critical role in policymaking while marginalizing laypeople". For Mike Hulme (2007), writing on ''[[The Guardian]]'' Climate change seems falls into the category of issues which are best dealt with in the context of PNS and notes that "Disputes in post-normal science focus as often on the process of science - who gets funded, who evaluates quality, who has the ear of policy - as on the facts of science".&lt;ref&gt;

Spash, p. 288-297.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been recently an increased reference to post-normal science, e.g. in [[Nature (journal)]].&lt;ref name="Gluckman2014"&gt;Gluckman P. (2014) "Policy: The art of science advice to government". Nature, 507, 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grinnell2015"&gt;Grinnell, F.

==Criticism==
A criticism of post-normal science is offered by Weingart (1997)&lt;ref name="PNS4"&gt;Weingart, P.  From "Finalization" to "Mode 2":  old wine in new bottles?.  Social Science Information 36 (4), 1997. Pp. 591-613.&lt;/ref&gt; for whom Post-normal science does not introduce a new epistemology but retraces earlier debates linked to the so-called "finalization thesis".

== Special issues ==

The journal [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/futures FUTURES] devoted several specials issues to PNS.

* The first was in [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00163287/31/7 1999] and included as editorial two pieces: from [[Jerome Ravetz]] and [[Silvio Funtowicz]], [http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/Editorials1.pdf Post-Normal Science—an insight now maturing], and from [[Jerome Ravetz]]: [http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/Editorials2.pdf What is Post-Normal Science].
* The second [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00163287/43/2 special issue], edited by [[Merryl Wyn Davies]], was entitled "Post normal times" in 2011.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;Davies, M.W., Editor, 2011, Special Issue: Postnormal Times
Futures, Volume 43, Issue 2, Pages 135-228 (March 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; This was a selection of papers from the symposium "Post Normal Science – perspectives &amp; prospectives 26-27th June 2009, Oxford." A summary of the abstracts can be found on the [http://www.nusap.net/article.php?sid=48 NUSAP net].

* The third [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301921 special issue on PNS was in 2017]. This special issue contains a selection of papers discussed at the [[University of Bergen]]'s Centre for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities between 2014 and 2016. The issue includes also two extended commentaries on the present crisis in science and the post-fact/post-truth discourse, one from Europe ([http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301969 Saltelli and Funtowicz]) and one from Japan ([http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301829 Tsukahara]). All articles in this special issue are in open access.

Another special issue on Post Normal Science was published on the journal [[Science, Technology &amp; Human Values]] in [http://nusap.net/article.php?sid=49 May 2011].

==Recent production==
A group of scholars of PNS orientation has published in 2016 a volume on the quality control crisis of science.&lt;ref name="Benessia"&gt;Benessia, A., Funtowicz, S., Giampietro, M., Guimarães Pereira, A., Ravetz, J., Saltelli, A., Strand, R., van der Sluijs, J., 2016.

The Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes at Arizona State University.&lt;/ref&gt; The volume discusses ''inter alia'' what this community perceive as the root causes of the present crisis.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;Ravetz, J., 2016, [https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/jun/08/how-should-we-treat-sciences-growing-pains How should we treat science's growing pains? The Guardian, June 8th 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantitative approaches== 
Among the quantitative styles of analysis which make reference to post-normal science one can mention [[NUSAP]] for numerical information, [[sensitivity auditing]] for indicators and mathematical modelling and [[MUSIASEM]] in the field of social metabolism.

==Mathematical modelling==
In relation to mathematical modelling PNS suggests a participatory approach, whereby ‘models to predict and control the future’ are replaced by ‘models to map our ignorance about the future’, in the process exploring and revealing the metaphors embedded in the model. &lt;ref name="Metaphor"&gt;Ravetz, J. R. Models as metaphors. in Public participation in sustainability science : a handbook (ed. B. Kasemir, J. Jäger, C. Jaeger, Gardner Matthew T., Clark William C.,  and W. A.) (Cambridge University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; PNS is also known for the its definition of GIGO: in modelling GIGO occurs when the uncertainties in the inputs must be suppressed, lest the outputs become completely indeterminate. &lt;ref name="OldPNSpaper"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O., and Ravetz, J. R. 1990, Post-normal science: A new science for new times, Scientific European, October 1990, p. 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9299">The '''''Prebiarum de multorum exemplaribus''''' is a [[Hiberno-Latin]] interrogatory [[florilegium]] of the mid-8th century, written as a [[Dialogue#Literary and philosophical genre|dialogue]] in a series of 93 short questions and answers. The word ''prebiarum'' seems to be a corruption of ''breviarium'',&lt;ref&gt;Joseph F. Kelly, "Scripture and Tradition in the Early Irish Church," ''Scripture, tradition and reason: a study in the criteria of Christian doctrine: essays in honour of Richard P.C. Hanson'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 1988), p. 163 [https://books.google.com/books?id=f0Bj5pWPJgoC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=Prebiarum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Prebiarum&amp;f=false  online.] ''Multorum'' is also given incorrectly as ''multorium''.&lt;/ref&gt; though the work is not a [[breviary]] in the usual sense; the title is not customarily translated into English, but would mean something like "A Breviary of Examples from Many Sources." The [[medieval Latin|Latin]] dialogue makes use of [[Triads of Ireland|triads]], a tripartite form of expression characteristic of [[early Irish literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary F. Wack and Charles D. Wright, "A New Latin Source for the Old English 'Three Utterances' Exemplum," in ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), vol. 20, p. 197 [https://books.google.com/books?id=21xhHS5eBdsC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=Prebiarum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Prebiarum&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Its subject matter is [[exegesis|exegetical]] or [[Didactic literature|didactic]]; that is, it seeks to explain or teach, often through an enumeration of its points.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin Wright, ''The Irish Tradition in Old English Literature'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Prebiarum'' is mostly of [[comparative literature|comparative]] interest, and has been dismissed as an example of texts, often written by [[Christian monasticism|monks]], that "display a vulgarization of religious subjects, treating them as popular [[trivia]], meant more for fun and humour than for any overly didactic, serious purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Liam Ethan Felsen, "Medieval Monks: Funnier Than You Thought," in ''Misconceptions about the Middle Ages'' (Routledge, 2008), p. 72 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ljrw9swM1fAC&amp;pg=PT82&amp;dq=Prebiarum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Prebiarum&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; This characterization may represent an elitist view not evident to all readers of the ''Prebiarum''. Like other [[catechism|catechetical]] Hiberno-Latin writings, the ''Prebiarum'' with its modest aims seems intended to help ordinary people with [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. McNally, ''Scriptores Hiberniae Minores Pars I'', Corpus Christianorum 108B (Turnhout, 1973), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text's 20th-century editor regarded the ''Prebiarum'' as "a [[handbook]] useful to the [[itinerant preacher]], the teacher, or even to the [[spiritual father]] charged with the obligation of giving spiritual conferences or instructions. … In no sense is the work sophisticated; it is rather simple, direct, even somewhat archaic in spirit."&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources, analogues, and intellectual context==
Despite its 8th-century date, the ''Prebiarum'' is disconnected from the intellectual and [[theology|theological]] preoccupations of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] and represents a more "primitive state of biblical learning." Its methods cannot be said to derive from the [[exegesis|exegetical literature]] of 7th-century Ireland, nor from the [[Northumbria#Culture|Northumbrian tradition]] of [[Bede]].&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a collection of miscellaneous snippets from various sources (''[[collectanea]]''), the ''Prebiarum'' draws on [[Church Fathers|patristic]] sources such as [[Jerome]], [[Augustine]], and [[Gregory the Great|Gregory]], as well as medieval writings of obscure origin. The ''Prebiarum'' is similar to the ''[[Joca monarchorum]]'' ("Monks' jests") and ''Collectanaea pseudo-Bedae'' (sometimes noted as ''[[List of works by Bede|Collectanaea Bedae]]''). The author or compiler of the ''Prebiarum'' drew on at least three works by [[Isidore of Seville]], the ''[[Etymologiae]]'', ''De ecclesiasticis officiis'', and the ''Sententiae'', along with the Irish [[pseudepigraph]]ical ''Liber de numeris''.&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 155; Claudia di Sciacca, ''Finding the Right Words: Isidore's'' Synonyma ''in Anglo-Saxon England'' (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other parallels can be found in works of Irish provenance or character, such as Pseudo-Cyprian's ''[[Duodecim abusivis saeculi|De XII Abusiuis Saeculi]]'', the Irish [[Pseudo-Bede]]'s ''De XIII Diuisionibus Temporum'', the [[Cambrai Homily]], and [[Pseudo-Isidore]]'s ''Questiones tam de nouo quam de uetere testamentum''.&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistically, the text is influenced by [[Merovingian]] and [[Vulgar Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prebiarum'' is addressed to an Adalfeus (''Adalfeo spiritali''), who might tenuously be identified as the Adelphus (d. 670) who was the third [[abbot]] of [[Remiremont Abbey|Remiremont]]. The ''Adalfeo'' of the text might also be a mistaken [[Romanization of Greek|transliteration of Greek]] Ἀδελφῷ (from ''adelphos'', "brother"), and the phrase mean "for a spiritual brother."&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triads==
[[File:Saint Virgiliusm, Salzburg (detail).jpg|thumb|100px|The '''''Prebiarum''''' most likely originated within the circle of [[Vergilius of Salzburg|St. Virgilius]] in Salzburg]]

The ''Prebiarum'' provides an enumerative response to many of the questions it poses, often in the form of a triadic utterance, including triads on greed (''cupiditas'')&lt;ref&gt;Richard Newhauser, ''The Early History of Greed: The Sin Of Avarice in Early Medieval Thought and Literature'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 112 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OJiMn6CZ60EC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=Prebiarum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Prebiarum&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cambrai Homily#The colors of martyrdom|martyrdom]]. One pair of triads is of a type circulated in other florilegia of moral extracts:&lt;ref&gt;For example, the ''Liber exhortationis'' of [[Paulinus I of Aquileia|Paulinus of Aquileia]]; for further examples of the "Three Utterances," see Mary F. Wack and Charles D. Wright, "A New Latin Source for the Old English 'Three Utterances' Exemplum," in ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), vol. 20, p. 197 [https://books.google.com/books?id=21xhHS5eBdsC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=%22Quod+sunt+quae+pessima+sunt+in+hoc+mundo%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kE8cYOOKBv&amp;sig=5U_SI94q8EH-y5TWUyqEU1UDqc0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZzD4StfTC5GKNNfBmekF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Quod%20sunt%20quae%20pessima%20sunt%20in%20hoc%20mundo%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What are the worst things in this world? There are three. The soul of a sinner after death, the demons coming into his path, and not getting well rid of them for eternity.

What are the best things in this world? There are three. The soul of a just man after its departure from the body, and angels coming into his path, and to possess the eternal kingdom without end.&lt;ref&gt;''Quod sunt quae pessima sunt in hoc mundo? Id, III. Anima peccatoris post mortem, et demones venientes in obviam ei, et bene non deficiens ab eis in perpetuum.''
&lt;br&gt;''Quod sunt meliora sunt in hoc mundo? Id, tres. Anima iusti post exitum de corpore, et angeli venientes in obviam ei, et regnum perpetuum possidere sine fine.'' ''Prebiarum'' 32–33 (McNally, ''SHM'' p. 164).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The text==
The ''Prebiarum'' exists in a single [[manuscript]] that was most likely transcribed in the [[scriptorium]] of Bishop [[Arbeo of Freising]]. It thus originated in southeast Germany around [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]], probably within the circle of [[Vergilius of Salzburg|St. Virgilius]], which had a strong Irish presence. It is bound with five other minor works, four of which are of Irish provenance. [[Orthography]] and linguistic aspects date the work to the mid-8th century.&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''HSM'' pp. 155, 158, 159. Claudia di Sciacca concurs that the ''Prebiarum'' likely originated in the Salzburg area at the time of the bishop Virgilius, despite its Irish character; p. 43; Charles Darwin Wright, ''The Irish Tradition in Old English Literature'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 60–61, note 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Given this setting, it may be Arbeo who is addressed in the dedication as a "spiritual brother."&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rape Culture''''' is a 1975 film by [[Cambridge Documentary Films]], produced by [[Margaret Lazarus]] and [[Renner Wunderlich]]. It was updated in 1983.&lt;ref name="camdocfilm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape Culture|url=http://www.cambridgedocumentaryfilms.org/rapeculture.html|publisher=Cambridge Documentary Films|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1975, Judy Norsigan outlined how the film illustrated "[[rape culture]]", through the voices of men and women, including rapists, victims, prisoners, rape crisis workers, and the media.&lt;ref name="Norsigian"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norsigian|first=Judy|title=Women, Health, and Films|journal=Women &amp; Health|date=20 January 1975|volume=1|issue=1|pages=29–30|doi=10.1300/J013v01n01_07|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J013v01n01_08#preview|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film featured prisoners of [[Lorton Reformatory]], Virginia, "Prisoners Against Rape Inc" (PAR), a not-for-profit organization founded by William Fuller and Larry Cannon on September 9, 1973, in conjunction with women fighting rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuller|first=William|author2=Larry Cannon |title=Prisoners Against Rape|journal=Feminist Alliance Against Rape Newsletter and Aegis: Magazine on Ending Violence Against Women|date=Sep–Oct 1974|url=http://www.faar-aegis.org/sepoct_74/prisoner_sepoct74.html|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prisoners Against Rape|title=Prisoners Against Rape|journal=Crime and social justice, Issues 1-8|year=1974|volume=1|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prison administration "approved" self-help status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anonymous Author for the Black Panther Newspaper|title=Lorton Organizes Prisoners Against Rape|url=http://solomon.bltc.alexanderstreet.com/cgi-bin/asp/philo/bltc/getdoc.pl?S14062-D021|accessdate=7 May 2012|newspaper=Black Panther|date=March 22, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAR was set up after Fuller wrote to the DC Rape Crisis Center in 1973 and asked for assistance. The DC Rape Crisis Center had opened in 1972 in response to the high incidence of rape against women of color. Fuller acknowledged his history of rape, murder, and prison rape. He wanted to stop being a rapist. This resulted in a cooperative effort.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Follet|first=Joyce|title=LORETTA ROSS|journal=Voices of Feminism Oral History Project, Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, MA 01063|year=2004–2005|pages=122–124|url=http://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/ssc/vof/vof-intro.html|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women from the DC Rape Crisis Center who initiated work with PAR were Loretta Ross, Yulanda Ward and Nkenge Toure.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; Ross has said that whilst the relationship was seen initially as controversial, it was one of the more interesting aspects of her work at the DC Rape Crisis Center in the 1970s and 80s. In an interview with Joyce Follet, Ross observed that in the work of the DC Rape Crisis center they could bandage up women all they wanted to, but if they did not stop rape what was the point?&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; Maragaret lazarus, the film's producer, said of this relationship that the work was "groundbreaking".&lt;ref name="lazarus"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lazarus|first=Margaret|title=Rape Culture|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~korenman/wmst/rapeculture2.html|publisher=Women's Studies Online Resources|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film featured [[Mary Daly]], radical feminist philosopher, academic, and theologian, and Author and Artist Emily Culpepper. They discussed rapism as an intellectual concept, and phallocentric morality and "its 'unholy trinity of rape, genocide and war.'".&lt;ref name="Norsigian" /&gt;&lt;!-- The Norsigian quote may look odd due to double quotation marks, but it is a direct quote from the source text which can be checked - see notes on talk page --&gt;

Doreen McDowell, a rape victim, talked of her experience, how sex fantasies play a part in rape, and how male identified behavior in women maintained a "state of siege". Powerful statistical evidence, refuting rape myths, law enforcement and legislative views of rape were presented by Joanna Morris, author and statistical coordinator for rape crisis centers across the USA.

The film also looked closely at the mass media, how filmmakers, songwriters, writers and magazines perpetuated the attitudes to rape, which normalized it and even perpetuated rape myths and stereotypical behavior around rape. ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Frenzy]]'', and ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine were some of the media used to illustrate the normalization of rape.

In describing the film, the producers say that it attempts to give real and accurate limits to rape and expand society's narrow and sexist concepts of rape.&lt;ref name="camdocfilm" /&gt;

Lazarus has said of the film's title that it came from long discussion about what the film was trying to illustrate. She has also expressed the view that the film is the first time "[[rape culture]]" was used in its widest accepted sense.&lt;ref name="lazarus" /&gt; A mention of the film in the [[Congressional Record]] in January 1978 is the first known occurrence of the term 'rape culture' in national-level American politics.&lt;ref name="CongressRecordJan1978Hearings"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015081118591;view=1up;seq=680 | title=RESEARCH INTO VIOLENT BEHAVIOR: OVERVIEW AND SEXUAL ASSAULTS HEARINGS BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC PLANNING, ANALYSIS AND COOPERATION OF THE COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES NINETY-FIFTH CONGRESS SECOND SESSION JANUARY 10, 11, 12, 1978 [No 64] | journal=Congressional Record |date=January 1978  | pages=676 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OdXtdf9g | archivedate=6 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18302">'''Dr. Rebecca J. Keck'''  (1838&amp;ndash;1904), was a 19th-century woman physician and patent medicine entrepreneur and one of the wealthiest independent businesswomen in the Midwest.

[[File:Rebecca in Peoria c1880 web c 1880.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Mrs. Dr. Rebecca Keck (1838-1904) in Peoria c1880]]

== Life and career ==

=== Early years ===

The oldest daughter in a large [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] pioneer farming family, Rebecca Keck ([[née]] Ilgenfritz, sometimes spelled Ilginfritz) was born in [[Wooster, Ohio|Wooster]], [[Wayne County, Ohio]] in 1838.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;''History of Scott Co., Iowa'' Chicago: Inter-State Pub. Co., 1882, pp. 858-861.&lt;/ref&gt;  She moved with her parents to [[Fairfield, Iowa]] at the age of thirteen, where she may have completed schooling as far as the eighth grade.&lt;ref name="State Census"&gt;''Iowa State Census'' July 3, 1854.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1857, she married John Conrad Keck, a merchant and mechanic newly arrived in Fairfield from Northampton County, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Jefferson County Marriages"&gt;''Jefferson County Iowa Marriages'' page 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of Rebecca's brothers died of [[tuberculosis]] between 1857 and 1869; while she was nursing them through their illnesses, she also gave birth to six children (five girls and a boy)&lt;ref name="US Census"&gt;''United States Census'' records for 1860, 1870 and 1880.&lt;/ref&gt; and began to develop a reputation among her neighbors as an [[herbalist]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;James Frederic Clarke, M.D. "A History of Medicine in Jefferson County, Iowa" ''The Journal of the Iowa State Medical Society'' Dec. 1934 and December, 1935. pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, her husband built up a substantial farm equipment and foundry business.&lt;ref name="Report"&gt;''Report of the Iowa State Agricultural Society,'' John R. Shaffer, Secretary. 1866 through 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical career ===

Following the national banking [[Panic of 1873]], Mr. Keck's foundry business collapsed and the couple began to collect herbs and brew her remedies together, which Rebecca Keck started to sell door to door.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;Dr. James Frederic Clarke M.D. ''ibid'' page 29&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking a wider market, in November, 1873, she took out her first advertisement for "Keck's [[Catarrh]]ochesis"  in Dubuque.&lt;ref name="Dubuque"&gt;''[[Dubuque Herald]]'' November 23 to 29, 1873&lt;/ref&gt; Success came very quickly; within three years she was advertising her "Catarrh Cure" heavily in a number of newspapers including the ''[[Telegraph Herald|Dubuque Herald]]'', the ''Davenport Gazette'' and the ''[[Chicago Times]]'' and ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.

Besides selling her remedies by mail order, she practiced as an "itinerant physician," a common business model for the frontier, because sick people were scattered across long distances and lacked regular access to medical care. She would rent rooms in a local hotel or storefront for visits of two days to two weeks, and take out large advertisements in advance to advise her customers of her upcoming personal consultations. She traveled her entire circuit every two months, so that patients could see her for follow-up treatment. At its height, her practice served between 12,000 and 15,000 patients, and she would typically see 350 patients per week.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

[[File:Flyer1894.jpg|thumb|The first page of a 4-page booklet describing Mrs. Dr. Keck's medical services, published in 1894.]]

Mrs. Dr. Keck moved her family to [[Davenport, Iowa]], on the Mississippi River, in 1875 as her business expanded.&lt;ref name="Finger's"&gt;''Finger's Davenport Business Directory for 1876''&lt;/ref&gt; As was common for Midwestern women physicians in her day, she used both Dr &amp; Mrs so that her married and professional status could both be understood by the public. She only treated chronic conditions and according to the testimonial letters she published in her advertising, the majority of her customers were working people and farm families who could not afford the high cost of private doctors' fees and who received her medical remedies and treatment advice by mail order.

Rebecca Keck considered herself to be a fully qualified physician by virtue of her long years of experience treating her family, neighbors and public customers. She owned a large medical library&lt;ref name="will"&gt;Rebecca J. Keck's last will and testament p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and advertised herself as an Eclectic practitioner. The [[Eclectic medicine|Eclectic School of medicine]], which grew out of the sectarian medical reform movements of the 1830s, was an active and publicly accepted school of medicine in the mid 19th century in the Midwest that competed with [[homeopathy]] and [[Allopathic medicine|allopathic]] (or regular, scientific) medical approaches. Eclectic treatments combined an emphasis on botanical remedies with a willingness to use regular medical techniques in certain cases.

There is no evidence that Rebecca Keck ever graduated from an Eclectic medical school although most of them were open to women by the 1870s. She did not enroll for regular medical training at the University of Iowa's new medical school which opened for men and women in 1871. Either she could not afford the time and money required (because of her six children and her family's bankruptcy in 1873) or she did not consider a professional degree to be necessary for her practice as a physician.

===Fame grows ===

With the exception of [[Lydia Pinkham]], Mrs. Dr. Keck appears to be the only woman to have earned substantial wealth on her own behalf in the lucrative but highly competitive and bruising profession of selling [[patent medicine]] in 19th century America.&lt;ref name="Stage"&gt;Sarah Stage, ''Female Complaints: Lydia Pinkham and the Business of Women's Medicine'' W.W. Norton &amp; Co. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Mrs. Pinkham, Mrs. Dr. Keck began her career because of family bankruptcy caused by the Panic of 1873. Unlike Mrs. Pinkham, Rebecca Keck not only believed herself to be a practicing physician, but became the top executive of the family's business and ran it herself, with the assistance of her two oldest daughters, Belle Alexander and Charlotte Dorn, while her husband played only a peripheral role and her only son contributed even less to the operations.

It is difficult to know Mrs. Dr. Keck's exact income, but she was able to purchase her infirmary in 1879 for $12,000 in cash,&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;''Davenport Gazette'' June 2, 1879, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; and at the time of her death, her life insurance payout of $15,520 was one of the largest made in the United States for the week of May 17, 1905.&lt;ref name="Insurance"&gt;''The Insurance Press'' May 17, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;

While extremely unpopular with members of the medical establishment in Iowa and Illinois, Rebecca Keck enjoyed glowing front page editorial endorsements from newspapers in the cities where she practiced. Some newspapers ran her illustrated, full-column ads on the front page under the heading, "Mrs. Dr. Keck's Column." The ''Decatur Review''&lt;ref name="DecaturReview"&gt;[http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=7104 About Decatur Review (Decatur, Illinois)]&lt;/ref&gt; declared on November 15, 1883, "We have a marked example among us of success in medicine, in the person of Mrs. Dr. Keck, well-known in the West," while the ''Bloomington Pantagraph'' declared on August 30, 1883 that Mrs. Dr. Keck "absorbs considerable public attention and is a subject for congratulation among the women of America…a forcible illustration of the ability of women to succeed" in "avenues of professional or public life." The ''Quincy Whig'' said she was "one of our longest established and best known physicians,"&lt;ref name="Whig"&gt;The ''Quincy Whig'' July 21, 1881 page 5&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''Evening Peorian'' referred to her "celebrity as a physician and good name as a citizen."&lt;ref&gt;''Bloomington Daily Leader'' September 24, 1881 page 2&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Peoria National Democrat'' declared, "her success is unprecedented…she is capable of doing the work of five ordinary women."

The regular medical establishment disagreed. The secretary of the Illinois State Board of Health, Dr. John Rauch was quoted in the ''Chicago Tribune'' as saying that Mrs. Dr. Keck was "foul and damnable in every way,"&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;''Chicago Daily Tribune'' February 7, 1880, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and mostly male members of county medical associations were hardly less kind; Dr. James Clarke M.D. of Fairfield averred that the sale of her [[catarrh]] cures "made the doctor wealthy, even if it did not cure her patients."&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt; Regular doctors universally dismissed her as a quack, and her name was excluded from the physicians and surgeons listing in the Davenport business directories every year after 1878, although she continued to describe herself as a specialist and physician in the regular alphabetical listings and bought the entire back cover of the 1882 edition to advertise her infirmary.

=== Legal reform ===

The state of Illinois passed its [[Medical Practices Act]] in 1877 in an effort to exert some control of the wholly unregulated medical profession in the state.&lt;ref name="Sandvick"&gt;Clinton Sandvick, Enforcing Medical Licensing in Illinois: 1877-1890  ''Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine''  June 2009; 82(2): 67–74&lt;/ref&gt; This Illinois law was a landmark in [[health law]] in the United States, leading the way towards improved standards for the dismal state of medical licensing and medical education in the country at that time.&lt;ref name="NEJM"&gt;''The New England Journal of Medicine'', known in 1890 as ''The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal'' 122(11): page 257&lt;/ref&gt; The act defined requirements for a [[Medical license|physician's license]] that were extremely loose by modern standards, but which were sufficient to expel thousands of untrained and unqualified physicians and quacks from the state during the first year after it was passed.&lt;ref name="Board of Health 1878"&gt;Illinois State Board of Health, ''First Annual Report of the Illinois State Board of Health, 1878'' Springfield: Weber, Magie and Co. State Printer, 1879&lt;/ref&gt; Popular opposition to this measure was strong, and outraged citizens complained that a law requiring doctors to obtain a license to practice medicine was "an opening wedge for [[socialized medicine]]" in the state.&lt;ref name="Beatty"&gt;William K. Beatty, M.D. (1991) "John H. Rauch—Public Health, Parks and Politics" in ''The Proceedings of the Institute of Medicine of Chicago'' Volume 44 page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Dr. Keck refused to stop treating her patients in Illinois and quickly emerged as one of the most formidable opponents to the state's legal reform effort. As she pushed back against the new governmental regulations, Mrs. Dr. Keck became locked in a highly publicized, adversarial relationship with the secretary of the new Illinois State Board of Health, [[John Henry Rauch|Dr. John H. Rauch M.D.]], that lasted for at least a decade.&lt;ref name="Tribune"/&gt; When local doctors tried to block Mrs. Dr. Keck from practicing in McLean County, Illinois in early 1878, the ''Bloomington Daily Leader'' called hers the first test case of the new legislation, "the beginning of a long and tedious litigation" between the "regulars" and the "irregulars."&lt;ref&gt;''Bloomington Daily Leader'' February 12, 1878 page 4&lt;/ref&gt; The lasting stigma of these accusations was probably an important reason why her accomplishments faded quickly and completely from public view after her death, and her career remains little known today.

Criminal charges were brought against Mrs. Dr. Keck in at least five different counties in Illinois for [[practicing medicine without a license]] between 1878 and 1889, but she was ably defended by her lawyer W. S. McCoy&lt;ref name="champaign"&gt;''The People of Illinois vs. Rebecca Keck'' Case No. 1686, Circuit Court of Champaign County, Ill. March 1886 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and persisted in business in McLean, Logan, Champaign, Peoria and Adams counties in Illinois for twenty years.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;''Decatur Review'' February 6, 1884, and hundreds of advertisements in newspapers from those cities&lt;/ref&gt; Iowa's medical legislation had even less effect on her business, and she opened Mrs. Dr. Keck's Infirmary for All Chronic Diseases in Davenport in 1879,&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt; practicing with uninterrupted financial success there and in Cedar Rapids, Dubuque and rural communities in Iowa until she retired in 1900.&lt;ref name="Republican"&gt;''Davenport Daily Republican'' July 11, 1900, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations of quackery ===

Over the years, Mrs. Dr. Keck grew more and more boastful of her ability to cure many types of chronic diseases, including tuberculosis, an obviously impossible task in an era before the bacillus that caused the disease had even been identified.  Grateful patients wrote to her when they were cured of chronic lung infections, piles, eczema, general debility, deafness and a host of other issues, and she published their testimonial letters in her advertisements.,&lt;ref&gt;''Davenport Daily Gazette'' Nov. 10, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flyer"&gt;''Dr. Mrs.Keck's Medical Infirmary'' a four-page advertising flyer published by Rebecca J. Keck circa 1894, and thousands of advertisements published in newspapers, business directories and gazettes across upper Illinois and eastern Iowa between 1873 and 1900--see Newspaperarchive.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraudulent testimonial letters were a common feature of 19th century patent medicine advertising.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;James Harvey Young, ''The Toadstool Millionaires: A Social History of Patent Medicines in America before Federal Regulation,'' Princeton, NJ: The Princeton University Press, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, United States Census records from 1880 show that many of these people actually existed as presented in print by Mrs. Dr. Keck.&lt;ref name="US Census"/&gt; However, in over a thousand ads that survive to be studied today, less than a hundred different individuals are named, and there is no way to verify the facts presented about their illnesses, particularly the accuracy of the diagnoses, and there is no way to know for sure what percentage of her thousands of other patients did and did not get cured.

Regular allopathic medical practice during the 1870s and 1880s often involved "heroic" treatments with harsh, mineral medications containing lead, mercury (calomel) and arsenic, as well as toxic vegetable compounds containing strychnine, castor oil (derived from ricin), belladonna and other poisonous substances we would consider extremely dangerous today.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;Paul Starr, ''The Social Transformation of American Medicine'' Basic Books, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Clumsy, unsanitary surgical procedures were also common, so it is not impossible that Mrs. Dr. Keck's herbal tonics and sensible nursing advice were actually better for her patients than the regular doctors' remedies in some cases.

It is unlikely that Mrs. Dr. Keck ever hurt anyone. Alert opponents in the medical profession would have been quick to pounce on any provable instance if she had ever actually harmed a patient with her treatments. While a number of outright quacks were taken to court by angry patients seeking reparations for botched treatments in Davenport during the years she practiced, no such accusation against Mrs. Dr. Keck shows up in the public record.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;See for example: ''W.R.Alexander vs. Edward Emerson'' Case No. 1724, District Court of the State of Iowa for Scott County. November 6, 1890 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only parties who sued her during her career were male doctors with M.D. credentials. In every instance, they were seeking to solidify institutional boundaries for their evolving practice of allopathic or scientific medicine by first preventing her from getting a license and second by preventing her from practicing medicine without one. No evidence that she harmed a patient was ever produced in any of these cases.

'''Shoals Marine Laboratory''' ('''SML''') is a seasonal marine field station located on [[Appledore Island]], [[Maine]], in the United States. Appledore Island is the largest of the [[Isles of Shoals]] archipelago, a group of rocky islands just offshore of the coastline of Maine and [[New Hampshire]]. The laboratory is cooperatively operated and maintained by [[Cornell University]] and the [[University of New Hampshire]]. Shoals is a residential facility where participants and staff live together in a close-knit learning community. SML's academic program runs from May through August to accommodate off-campus study for undergraduates. Limited access for research can be arranged during the off-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title = Research - Shoals Marine Lab
 | accessdate = 2010-01-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to Appledore Island is provided by Shoals Marine Laboratory vessels operated by laboratory personnel. SML administrative offices are at Cornell University in [[Ithaca, New York]], in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], and at the University of New Hampshire in [[Durham, New Hampshire]].

==Academics==
[[File:Shoals Marine Lab Underwater Research Class.jpg|thumb|Students aboard the R/V ''John B. Heiser'' as part of SML's Underwater Research diving course]]
SML is dedicated to undergraduate education and research in [[marine science]], and has been offering courses since 1966. The laboratory offers a wide variety of summer credit courses for undergraduates and high school students along with programs and workshops for graduate students, teachers, professionals, and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic day at Shoals consists of laboratory and classroom time, combined with extensive fieldwork. Fieldwork typically includes excursions along Appledore's rocky [[intertidal zone]] and seabird nesting colonies, visits to neighboring islands to study harbor seals, terns, and archaeological sites, off-shore cruises, and trips to the Maine/New Hampshire coast to study mud flats, salt marshes, and bogs. Lessons on [[sustainable living]] are incorporated into the experience. Credit course offerings range from survey courses like Field Marine Science to more specialized courses like Field Ornithology, Underwater Research, and Ecology of Animal Behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other programs, workshops, and citizen science opportunities include [[Biological illustration|Biological Illustration]], a course about Forensic Science, and Island Archaeology.

==Research==
[[File:Seals Sunbathing.jpg|left|thumb|Seals sunbathing at the Isles of Shoals]]
The Shoals Marine Laboratory emphasizes its dedication to undergraduate research by offering several Research Internships in Field Science (RIFS). This program is the successor to the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program which was funded by a seven-year [[National Science Foundation]] grant. The RIFS program allows undergraduates to perform a full research project - from proposal to research paper and presentation - in the course of a summer. It also provides participants with full room and board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.sml.cornell.edu/sml_internresearch.html
 | title = Research Internships in Field Science
 | accessdate = 2014-10-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the formal research internship, nearly all credit courses at SML require small individual research projects. For example, students enrolled in the Underwater Research course must produce an original research proposal, supported by preliminary data collected and analyzed in the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lab also hosts and works with visiting researchers from across the country, including a migratory bird banding program, the [[New Hampshire Fish and Game]] tern restoration project on [[Isles of Shoals|White Island]], gull research, and monitoring of subtidal communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[File:Volunteer Weekend at Shoals Marine Lab.jpg|thumb|Volunteers disembarking from the R/V ''John M. Kingsbury'']]
Appledore Island, originally named Hog Island, was visited by [[Scandinavia]]ns sailing from [[Greenland]] before the 17th century. Europeans arrived in 1614 to take advantage of the favorable fishing conditions in the [[Gulf of Maine]]. The island saw an exodus in 1680 and sustained a small population until 1847. Thomas Laighton and daughter [[Celia Thaxter]] helped to revitalize the island through Celia's hospitality, artistry, and garden. The garden has been restored as a tourist attraction today which helps generate revenue for SML. Celia's death in 1894, subdivision of land in 1908, and a major fire at the Appledore Hotel in September 1914 led to the decline of this era in Appledore history. UNH's Marine Zoological Laboratory on Appledore thrived from 1928 to 1940. This was followed by government control of the island during World War II and a period of vandalism into the 1970s.

The current form of the lab was conceived by John M. Kingsbury and John M. Anderson, both professors at Cornell. Having visited the [[Star Island (New Hampshire)|Star Island]] conference center, they were keen to bring undergraduate university students out to the Isles of Shoals as an alternative to the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]. The first group of students arrived on Star Island in 1966. Appledore Island, which was mostly uninhabited since World War II, was selected and developed from the late 1960s to early 1970s as the future home of the lab. UNH took interest in the project due to their proximity and previous association with the island. Dominic Gratta of [[Kittery, Maine]], directed his crew, assisted by students and early SML staff, in the refurbishing of old hotel and military era buildings as well as the construction of six new buildings and utility services.

==Island utilities and sustainability==
[[File:Shoals Diesel Usage.svg|thumb|left|SML diesel usage charted over time]]
Shoals must provide the utilities necessary to support the island population during its operating season independent of mainland services. Since 1974, SML has generated its own electricity, produced its own drinking water, and treated its own wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kingsbury |first=John |date=1991 |title=Here's how we'll do it : an informal history of the construction of the Shoals Marine Laboratory, Appledore Island, Maine |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=Bullbrier Press |isbn=978-0961261030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent initiatives in engineered island systems and the educational and operating benefits to living more [[sustainably]] on Appledore have guided the development of [[renewable energy]] resources and low impact wastewater management.

===Wind, sun, and diesel power===
[[File:Shoals Battery Bank.jpeg|thumb|Sealed absorbed glass mat batteries for photovoltaic power collection]]
SML maintains three [[diesel generator]]s and two green energy grids to provide electrical power day and night. Green energy grids collect power from the sun with [[photovoltaic panels]] and from the wind with a 7.5&amp;nbsp;kW Bergy [[wind turbine]]. Power collected is stored in sealed absorbed glass mat batteries. There are 52 batteries creating a storage capacity of 388 A·h at a nominal 48 V DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stored power is inverted to AC electricity for distribution to the island's 14 buildings. Diesel generators provide backup power. Over the past seven years, addition of photovoltaic power generation with battery storage, along with sustainability and energy efficiency efforts, has:
* Reduced electrical grid load by 50%.
* Reduced diesel generator run times by 50%.
* Reduced fuel needs by 75%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Solar Hot Water Panels.JPG|thumb|Solar hot water panels on the roof of the SML water conservation building|left]]

===Propane and solar-based hot water===
In 2011, SML installed a solar water heating system to provide a significant portion of its {{convert|500|gal|l|abbr=on}} per day domestic hot water needs. The solar water heating system collects heat energy from the sun and transfers the energy to domestic hot water systems used in its commercial kitchen and residential shower facilities. In 2012, SML's sustainable engineering interns calculated that the system reduced [[propane]] consumption for heating water by 42%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wastewater===
Sewage is treated with three [[Septic drain field|subsurface leach fields]] and several [[Clivus Multrum]] composting toilet installations. Eljen In-Drain technology was used in order to decrease the size of the leach fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://www.eljen.com/Pages/GSF/GSFoverview.html

 |accessdate = 2010-01-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composting toilet installations have two major advantages for SML:
* The Nepon foam flush toilets use only three ounces of fresh water per flush.
* Solids composted by the units do not have to be hauled away using a septic truck and barge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drinking water===
Water is obtained from a {{convert|20|ft|adj=on|0}} well on the north side of the island. This supply can serve the island throughout the season if there is sufficient rainfall during the summer. A [[reverse osmosis]] system provides fresh water if well water does not meet demand. Shoals is licensed by the State of Maine to provide potable drinking water to island residents and visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://oaspub.epa.gov/enviro/sdw_report_v3.first_table?pws_id=ME0010973&amp;state=ME&amp;source=Surface%20water&amp;population=100&amp;sys_num=1
 | title = EPA Envirofacts
 | accessdate = 2014-12-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation measures reduce the volume of freshwater used to 1/5 of expected consumption.

===Communications===
Shoals currently uses a 5.8&amp;nbsp;GHz wireless link which provides an internet connection from a [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] base station to the [[World War II]]-era radio tower on the island. Internet access is distributed to the buildings via a fiber, ethernet, and wireless network. Island staff carry [[VHF]] radios for inter-island communication and cell phones work well for mainland phone calls. [[Vonage]] is used for more formal office phone and fax needs. VHF channel 80A is monitored for boat to island communication.

==Research vessels==
[[File:Research Vessel JB Heiser Underway.jpg|thumb|Shoals Marine Lab's R/V ''John B. Heiser'' underway]]
The lab is served by two [[US Coast Guard]] inspected research vessels: the {{convert|47|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}}, 34.49 gross ton ''R/V John M. Kingsbury'' and the {{convert|35.7|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}}, 13 gross ton ''R/V John B. Heiser''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both boats are used to transport goods and people to the island and for research/education. The ''R/V John M. Kingsbury'' has a [[winch]] and a one-ton [[crane (machine)|crane]] for the deployment of research equipment and for the movement of heavy materials from the mainland to the island.

The lab also operates various smaller vessels, including the {{convert|27|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} ''R/V Acipenser'', {{convert|21|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} ''R/V Storm Petrel'', numerous inflatables, a {{convert|16|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[Boston Whaler]] (''R/V Miss Christine''), and two small sailboats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34591">{{short description|The effects on human societies of the scientific explanation of life's diversity}}
{{Evolutionary biology}}
The '''social effects of evolutionary thought''' have been considerable.  As the scientific explanation of life's diversity has developed, it has often displaced alternative, sometimes very widely held, explanations. Because the theory of [[evolution]] includes an explanation of humanity's origins, it has had a profound impact on human [[society|societies]]. Some have vigorously denied acceptance of the scientific explanation due to its perceived religious implications (e.g. its implied rejection of the [[special creation]] of humans presumably described in the [[Bible]]). This has led to a vigorous conflict between [[creation and evolution in public education]], primarily in the United States.

==Evolution and ethics==
The theory of evolution by natural selection has also been adopted as a foundation for various ethical and social systems, such as [[social Darwinism]], an idea that preceded the publication of &lt;cite&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/cite&gt;, popular in the 19th century, which holds that "the [[survival of the fittest]]" (a phrase coined in 1851 by Herbert Spencer, 6 years before Darwin published his theory of evolution) explains and justifies differences in wealth and success among societies and people. A similar interpretation was one created by Darwin's cousin, [[Francis Galton]], known as [[eugenics]], which claimed that human civilization was subverting natural selection by allowing the less bright and less healthy to survive and out-breed the more smart and more healthy.

Later advocates of this theory suggested radical and often coercive social measures in an attempt to "correct" this imbalance. [[Thomas Huxley]] spent much time demonstrating through a series of thought experiments that it would not only be immoral, but impossible,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2940 Evolution and Ethics by Thomas Henry Huxley]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and others have argued that social Darwinism is based on misconceptions of evolutionary theory, and many ethicists regard it as a case of the [[is-ought problem]]. After the atrocities of [[the Holocaust]] became linked with eugenics, it greatly fell out of favor with public and scientific opinion, though it was never universally accepted by either, and at no point in Nazi literature is Charles Darwin or the scientific theory of evolution mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/darwin_nazism.htm The fallacious nature of [[reductio ad Hitlerum]] arguments by anti-evolutionists.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=January 2015}}

In his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] argues that Nazism was largely a continuation of [[Christian anti-Semitism]]. Jim Walker compiled a list of 129 quotes from [[Mein Kampf]] in which Hitler described himself as a Christian, or mentioned God, Jesus or a biblical passage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitler.htm Webpage containing 129 Mein Kampf quotes relating to his Christianity]&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=January 2015}} argue that six million of the people killed during the Holocaust were killed because of their religion (Judaism) not their race, "strength," or any reason with an obvious link to the mechanism of Darwinian evolution. Hitler often used Christian beliefs like, "Jews killed Jesus," to justify his anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitlerchristian.htm Religion and Hitler - a history]&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that humans share ancestors with other animals has also affected how some people view the relationship between humans and other species. Many proponents of [[animal rights]] hold that if animals and humans are of the same nature, then rights cannot be distinct to humans.

Charles Darwin, in fact, &lt;!-- himself was an abolitionist who --&gt; considered "[[sympathy]]" to be one of the most important [[Ethics|moral virtues]] — and that it was, indeed, a product of natural selection and a trait beneficial to social animals (including [[homo sapiens|humans]]). Darwin further argued that the most "sympathetic" societies would consequently be the most "successful." He also stated that our sympathy should be extended to "all sentient beings":

{{quote|As man advances in civilization, and small tribes are united into larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unknown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races. If, indeed, such men are separated from him by great differences in appearance or habits, experience unfortunately shows us how long it is, before we look at them as our fellow-creatures. ... This virtue, one of the noblest with which man is endowed, seems to arise incidentally from our sympathies becoming more tender and more widely diffused, until they are extended to all sentient beings. As soon as this virtue is honored and practiced by some few men, it spreads through instruction and example to the young, and eventually becomes incorporated in public opinion.|source=Charles Darwin; ''The Descent of Man'', 1871}}

===Thomas Huxley: Evolution and Ethics===
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=May 2009}}
{{Essay-like|date=September 2013}}
[[Thomas Huxley]], ''Darwin's Bulldog'', spent much of his book [[Evolution and Ethics]] debunking Social Darwinism, piece by piece. The following is a summary of his arguments in the ''Prolegomena'', the most detailed and comprehensive of the two sections devoted to it. It should be noted that Huxley is here attempting to disprove the science behind Social Darwinism; as such, the moral arguments only come in later in the essay.

Consider a garden. Without constant upkeep, it would return to the ''state of nature'', even the very walls surrounding it crumbling in sufficient time, but by constant diligence of the gardener, may be maintained in a ''state of art''. This "state of art" is not permanent: It is instead the replacement of natural selection by artificial selection through the human energy expended in maintaining it.

This artificial selection is, however, part of natural selection: It is the action upon a set of species by the human species by way of the human species expending energy through evolved intelligence on its choice of selection. It is thus no less natural than, for example, a predator expending energy through evolved instinct on preferentially hunting a certain prey species. The presence of humans may change the dynamic, but in a perfectly natural way. Hence, it is part of the ''cosmic process'', that is natural laws, even though the "histological process" may remove many aspects of the "struggle for existence" that is a key part of the natural laws that apply to biology, from its preferred plant species by substituting human work for work done by the species itself.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Not only is the state of nature hostile to the state of art of the garden; but the principle of the horticultural process, by which the latter is created and maintained, is antithetic to that of the cosmic process. The characteristic feature of the latter is the intense and unceasing competition of the struggle for existence. The characteristic of the former is the elimination of that struggle, by the removal of the conditions which give rise to it. The tendency of the cosmic process is to bring about the adjustment of the forms of plant life to the current conditions; the tendency of the horticultural process is the adjustment of the conditions to the needs of the forms of plant life which the gardener desires to raise.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nature uses unrestricted breeding to let hundreds compete for the natural resources that would only support one, and uses frost and drought to kill off the weak and unlucky, requiring not just strength, but "flexibility and good fortune." However, a gardener restricts multiplication, gives each plant sufficient space and nourishment,  protects from frost and drought&amp;mdash;and, in every other way, attempts to modify the conditions to benefit the forms that most nearly approach the result he desires. However, though the gardener's actions may have circumvented natural selection, he can still improve the species, should he find them wanting, through selective breeding. The struggle for existence is not actually required for improvement: only heritability, variation, and some form of selective pressure.

Can we then apply this to humans? Let's see how far we can take the analogy with respect to colonization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose a shipload of English colonists sent to form a settlement, in such a country as Tasmania was in the middle of the last century. On landing, they find themselves in the midst of a state of nature, widely different from that left behind them in everything but the most general physical conditions. The common plants, the common birds and quadrupeds, are as totally distinct as the men from anything to be seen on the side of the globe from which they come. The colonists proceed to put an end to this state of things over as large an area as they desire to occupy.  They clear away the native vegetation, extirpate or drive out the animal population, so far as may be necessary, and take measures to defend themselves from the re-immigration of either. In their place, they introduce English grain and fruit trees; English dogs, sheep, cattle, horses; and English men; in fact, they set up a new Flora and Fauna and a new variety of mankind, within the old state of nature. Their farms and pastures represent a garden on a great scale, and themselves the gardeners who have to keep it up, in watchful antagonism to the old regime. Considered as a whole, the colony is a composite unit introduced into the old state of nature; and, thenceforward, a competitor in the struggle for existence, to conquer or be vanquished.

Under the conditions supposed, there is no doubt of the result, if the work of the colonists be carried out energetically and with intelligent combination of all their forces. On the other hand, if they are slothful, stupid, and careless; or if they waste their energies in contests with one another, the chances are that the old state of nature will have the best of it. The native savage will destroy the immigrant civilized man; of the English animals and plants some will be extirpated by their indigenous rivals, others will pass into the feral state and themselves become components of the state of nature. In a few decades, all other traces of the settlement will have vanished.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, as yet we lack an organized gardener. Let us imagine an idealized one: an administrative authority of intelligence and foresight as much greater than men as men are to their livestock. The unwanted native species - men, animals, or plants - are all weeded out and destroyed. Those to replace them are chosen with a view to his ideal of the colony, just as a gardener tries to create through his selection his ideal garden. And, finally, to ensure that no struggle for existence between the colonists interferes with the struggle against nature, he provides them with sufficient food, housing, and so on. "With every step of this progress in civilization, the colonists would become more and more independent of the state of nature; more and more, their lives would be conditioned by a state of art. In order to attain his ends, the administrator would have to avail himself of the courage, industry, and co-operative intelligence of the settlers; and it is plain that the interest of the community would be best served by increasing the proportion of persons who possess such qualities, and diminishing that of persons devoid of them. In other words, by selection directed towards an ideal."

However, though this might create a paradise where every aspect of nature works to support its colonists, problems arise: "as soon as the colonists began to multiply, the administrator would have to face the tendency to the reintroduction of the cosmic struggle into his artificial fabric, in consequence of the competition, not merely for the commodities, but for the means of existence. When the colony reached the limit of possible expansion, the surplus population must be disposed of somehow; or the fierce struggle for existence must recommence and destroy that peace, which is the fundamental condition of the maintenance of the state of art against the state of nature.

If the administrator is guided purely by scientific considerations, he would work to restrict the population by removing "the hopelessly diseased, the infirm aged, the weak or deformed in body or in mind, and the excess of infants born," just as a "gardener pulls up defective and superfluous plants, or the breeder
destroys undesirable cattle. Only the strong and the healthy, carefully matched, with a view to the progeny best adapted to the purposes of the administrator, would be permitted to perpetuate their kind."

And so we have reached Social Darwinism. However, we do not have an idealized administrator:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the more thoroughgoing of the multitudinous attempts to apply the principles of cosmic evolution, or what are supposed to be such, to social and political problems, which have appeared of late years, a considerable proportion appear to me to be based upon the notion that human society is competent to furnish, from its own resources, an administrator of the kind I have imagined. The pigeons, in short, are to be their own [[Sir John Sebright]]. A despotic government, whether individual or collective, is to be endowed with the preternatural intelligence, and with what, I am afraid, many will consider the preternatural ruthlessness, required for the purpose of carrying out the principle of improvement by selection, with the somewhat drastic thoroughness upon which the success of the method depends.  Experience certainly does not justify us in limiting the ruthlessness of individual "saviors of society"; and, on the well-known grounds of the aphorism which denies both body and soul to corporations, it seems probable (indeed the belief is not without support in history) that a collective despotism, a mob got to believe in its own divine right by demagogic missionaries, would be capable of more thorough work in this direction than any single tyrant, puffed up with the same illusion, has ever achieved.  But intelligence is another affair. The fact that "saviors of society" take to that trade is evidence enough that they have none to spare. And such as they possess is generally sold to the capitalists of physical force on whose resources they depend. However, I doubt whether even the keenest judge of character, if he had before him a hundred boys and girls under fourteen, could pick out, with the least chance of success, those who should be kept, as certain to be serviceable members of the polity, and those who should be chloroformed, as equally sure to be stupid, idle, or vicious. The "points" of a good or of a bad citizen are really far harder to discern than those of a puppy or a short-horn calf; many do not show themselves before the practical difficulties of life stimulate manhood to full exertion. And by that time the mischief is done. The evil stock, if it be one, has had time to multiply, and selection is nullified.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, humans are not cattle, nor flowers: the organization of human society is kept together by
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...bonds of such a singular character, that the attempt to perfect society after his fashion would run serious risk of loosening them. They do not even correspond to social insects such as bees: With bees, "The members of the society are each organically predestined to the performance of one particular class of functions only. If they were endowed with desires, each could desire to perform none but those offices for which its organization specially fits it; and which, in view of the good of the whole, it is proper it should do. Among mankind, on the contrary, there is no such predestination to a sharply defined place in the social organism. However much men may differ in the quality of their intellects, the intensity of their passions, and the delicacy of their sensations, it cannot be said that one is fitted by his organization to be an agricultural laborer and nothing else, and another to be a landowner and nothing else. Moreover, with all their enormous differences in natural endowment, men agree in one thing, and that is their innate desire to enjoy the pleasures and to escape the pains of life; and, in short, to do nothing but that which it pleases them to do, without the least reference to the welfare of the society into which they are born, checked only by sympathy, familial and social bonds, and fear of the judgment of ones fellow man. "Every forward step of social progress brings men into closer relations with their fellows, and increases the importance of the pleasures and pains derived from sympathy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In short, he describes a creation of morality.

Since morality is what keeps the desire for selfishness in check, it is necessary to the propagation of society, with one requirement: the punishment of wrongdoers being necessary for the continuation of society, self-restraint must not be taken so far that wrongdoers may act unrestrained: Without the protection of society against them, "The followers of the "golden rule" may indulge in hopes of heaven, but they must reckon with the certainty that other people will be masters of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley credits Hartley (Observations on Man (1749), vol. ii p. 281.) for not only having "...laid the foundations but built up much of the superstructure of a true theory of the Evolution of the intellectual and moral faculties and for having realized that the creation of civilization will in itself create ethics, if not in an evolutionary context." as well as [[Adam Smith]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley sums up this section of his argument against Social Darwinism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have further shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the horticulturist and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part in the evolution of society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Huxley finishes with a series of short, further evidences against Social Darwinism, including:

* Historical evidences against: Consider the vast changes of society between the Tudor and the Victorian eras; however, human nature, as evidenced by their writing, remains the same. "In my belief, the innate qualities, physical, intellectual, and moral, of our nation have remained substantially the same for the last four or five centuries. If the struggle for existence has affected us to any serious extent (and I doubt it) it has been, indirectly, through our military and industrial wars with other nations."
* Whether some qualities are virtues or vices depends on circumstance: "The benevolence and open-handed generosity which adorn a rich man, may make a pauper of a poor one; the energy and courage to which the successful soldier owes his rise, the cool and daring subtlety to which the great financier owes his fortune, may very easily, under unfavorable conditions, lead their possessors to the gallows, or to the hulks. Moreover, it is fairly probable that the children of a "failure" will receive from their other parent just that little modification of character which makes all the difference. I sometimes wonder whether people, who talk so freely about extirpating the unfit, ever dispassionately consider their own history. Surely, one must be very "fit," indeed, not to know of an occasion, or perhaps two, in one's life, when it would have been only too easy to qualify for a place among the "unfit.""

&lt;!--Have skipped the struggle for means of enjoyment argument, as it is almost impossible to summarize--&gt;

==Evolution and religion==
{{See also|History of evolutionary thought}}

Before Darwin's argument and presentation of the evidence for evolution, Western [[religion]]s generally discounted or condemned any claims that diversity of life is the result of an evolutionary process, as did most scientists in the English scientific establishment. However, evolution was accepted by some religious groups such as the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church and the liberal [[Anglican]] theologians who went on to publish ''[[Essays and Reviews]]''. as well as by many scientists in [[France]] and [[Scotland]] and some in [[England]], notably [[Robert Edmund Grant]]. Literal or authoritative interpretations of [[sacred text|Scripture]] hold that a [[God|supreme being]] directly created humans and other animals as separate ''[[Created kind]]s'', which to some means species. This view is commonly referred to as [[creationism]]. From the 1920s to the present in the US, there has been a strong religious backlash to the teaching of evolution theory, particularly by conservative [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]]. They have expressed concerns about the effects of the teaching of evolution on society and their faith (see [[Creation-evolution controversy]]).

In response to the wide scientific acceptance of the theory of evolution, many religions have formally or informally synthesized the scientific and religious viewpoints. Several important 20th century scientists ([[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]]) whose work confirmed Darwin's theory, were also [[Christianity|Christians]] who saw no incompatibility between their experimental and theoretical confirmations of evolution and their faith. Some religions have adopted a [[Evolutionary creationism|theistic evolution]] viewpoint, where God provides a [[divine spark]] that ignited the process of evolution and (or), where God has guided evolution in one way or another.

===Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church===

{{main|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]], beginning in 1950 with [[Pope Pius XII]]'s encyclical [[Humani generis|Humani Generis]], took up a neutral position with regard to evolution. "The Church does not forbid that...research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 22, 1996, address to the [[Pontifical Academy of Science]], [[Pope John Paul II]] updated the Church's position, recognizing that Evolution is "more than a hypothesis" - "In his encyclical Humani Generis, my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation... Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP961022.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic views on Evolution===

Classical figures have not discussed the subject as it has only come up in the 19th century. Contemporaries have come up with several distinct stances. One stance is that adaptation, or evolution on a micro scale, is accepted within a species, but cross-species evolution, that is evolution from one species into another species, is not as the human beginning is considered to be miraculous. However, this traditional thought would not conflict with the view that human-like beings could have been created around the same time as human beings, which, in this view, would explain the fossil records that look human but are not. Another stance is that since evolution is the simplest explanation it is the most reasonable to accept under the condition that it is not random but occurs only with the permission of God every step of the way. One particular argument that supports the idea that evolution is possible is the one stating that in that the stages of human development in evolution are akin to the distinct stages of development acknowledged in the Koran.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The final stance completely rejects cross-species evolution across all organisms, but approves of adaptation (micro evolution).

===Jewish views on evolution===

==Evolutionary theory and the political left==
{{Undue weight section|date=September 2011}}

Many important political figures on the left have never publicized their views on [[biology]], and so their opinions of evolutionary theory are unknown. To some extent, [[Marxist]]s are the exception. [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] supported Darwin's evolutionary theory. Marx even sent Darwin a copy of his book ''[[Das Kapital]]'', though Darwin never wrote back to him. Karl Marx's work was based on a material view of the world that showed natural causes and effects for all aspects of human society and economy. He recognized that Darwin's work provided a similar material explanation for all of nature, thus supporting Marx's worldview.

In 1861 Karl Marx wrote to his friend Ferdinand Lassalle, "Darwin’s work is most important and suits my purpose in that it provides a basis in natural science for the historical class struggle. ... Despite all shortcomings, it is here that, for the first time, 'teleology' in natural science is not only dealt a mortal blow but its rational meaning is empirically explained."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marx &amp; Engels Collected Works|volume=41|pages=246-247|chapter=Letter to F. Lassalle in Berlin. London, 16 January 1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most later Marxists agreed with this view, but some – particularly those in the early [[Soviet Union]] – believed that evolutionary theory conflicted with their economic and social ideals. As a result, they came to support [[Lamarckism]] instead – the idea that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring. This led to the practice of [[Lysenkoism]], which caused agricultural problems.

In his book, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', [[anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] argued that co-operation and mutual aid are as important in the evolution of the species as competition and mutual strife, if not more so.

On the contemporary moderate left, some authors such as [[Peter Singer]] (in his book, ''[[A Darwinian Left]]'') support Darwinism but reach different political and economic lessons than more conservative observers. Richard Dawkins' book, ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', has a chapter, "Nice guys finish first," that attempts to explain the role of altruism and cooperation in evolution and how social animals not only cannot survive without such traits, but how evolution will create them. Dawkins explains that when an animal sacrifices itself or uses its resources for the survival of other members of the same species, its genes, present on the other animals, survive. For example, if a mother dies to save three of its pups, one and a half copies (on average) of its genes will survive, because there is a 50% chance of a particular gene being present in its offspring. Dawkins also made a documentary of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzeCn02l_Rw Nice guys finish first]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the documentary, Dawkins added that chapter as a way of overcoming modern day misinterpretations of the concept of ''survival of the fittest''.

==Evolution in relation to Social Darwinism and Imperialism==

"[[Social Darwinism]]" is a derogatory term associated with the 19th century [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] theory developed by [[British Whig Party|Whig]] philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]]. It is associated with evolutionary theory but now widely regarded as unwarranted. Social Darwinism was later expanded by others into ideas about "[[survival of the fittest]]" in commerce and human societies as a whole, and led to claims that [[social inequality]], [[sexism]], [[racism]] and [[imperialism]] were justified.&lt;ref&gt;On the history of [[eugenics]] and evolution, see {{cite book|authorlink=Daniel Kevles |first=D |last=Kevles |year=1998 |title=In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity |publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-44557-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these ideas contradict [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s own views, and contemporary scientists and philosophers consider these ideas to be neither mandated by evolutionary theory nor supported by data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] strongly disagreed with attempts by Herbert Spencer and others to extrapolate evolutionary ideas to all possible subjects; see {{cite book|authorlink=Mary Midgley|first=M|last=Midgley|year=2004|title=The Myths we Live By|publisher=Routledge|page=62|isbn=978-0-415-34077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Allhoff F |title=Evolutionary ethics from Darwin to Moore |journal=History and philosophy of the life sciences |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=51–79 |year=2003 |pmid=15293515 |doi=10.1080/03919710312331272945 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gowaty, Patricia Adair |title=Feminism and evolutionary biology: boundaries, intersections, and frontiers |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |location=London |year=1997 |isbn=0-412-07361-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Darwinism is further linked with [[nationalism]] and imperialism.&lt;ref name="Marvin Perry"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perry |first1=Marvin |last2=Chase |first2=Myrna |last3=Jacob |first3=Margaret |last4=Jacob |first4=James |last5=Daly |first5=Jonathan W. |last6=Von Laue |first6=Theodore H. |year=2014 |title=Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jy5BBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA634&amp;lpg=PA634 |volume=Volume II: Since 1600 |edition=11th |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |pages=634–635 |isbn=978-1-305-09142-9 |lccn=2014943347 |oclc=898154349 |quote=The most extreme ideological expression of nationalism and imperialism was Social Darwinism.

Social Darwinists vigorously advocated empires, saying that strong nations—by definition, those that were successful at expanding industry and empire—would survive and others would not.

== Research==
===Wikipedia===
Yasseri has studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution. His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or "undo" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting "reverting/reverted pairs" or "mutually reverting edit pairs". Such a "mutually reverting edit pair" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the "mutually reverting edit pairs". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles ''[[George W. Bush]]'', ''[[Anarchism]]'' and ''[[Muhammad]]''. By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the [[Oxford]] study were for the articles covering (i) ''[[Croatia]]'', (ii) ''[[Scientology]]'' and (iii) ''[[9/11 conspiracy theories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yasseri|first=Taha|last2=Spoerri|first2=Anselm|last3=Graham|first3=Mark|last4=Kertesz|first4=Janos|date=23 May 2013|title=The Most Controversial Topics in Wikipedia: A Multilingual and Geographical Analysis|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2269392|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study published by ''[[PLoS ONE]]'' in 2012 he estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the [[English Wikipedia]], and 25% for the [[simple English Wikipedia]]. The Wikimedia Foundation hopes to increase the number of editors in the Global South to 37% by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yasseri|first=Taha|last2=Sumi|first2=Robert|last3=Kertész|first3=János|date=17 January 2012|title=Circadian Patterns of Wikipedia Editorial Activity: A Demographic Analysis|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030091|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=e30091|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0030091|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thorbjørn Egners lesebøker''''' ({{lang-en|Thorbjorn Egner's Readers}}) were a series of sixteen [[Basal reader|readers]] for [[elementary school]] written by [[Norway|Norwegian]] author [[Thorbjørn Egner]]. Egner spent 25 years working on the series{{spaced ndash}}consisting of collected literature as well as his own stories and illustrations{{spaced ndash}}and they were published in the years 1950&amp;ndash;1972.&lt;ref name="NSF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skoleforum.com/stiler/saeroppgave/det.aspx?id=2929|title=Thorbjørn Egner|publisher=Norsk Skoleforum|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books were intended for children aged 8&amp;ndash;15, which at the time corresponded to grades 2nd&amp;ndash;9th.&lt;ref name="NSF"/&gt; Among the recurring characters was the young boy Ola-Ola, who grew up on a farm on the Norwegian countryside, but later moved to the city and had to adapt to a new life. Other stories took place in far-away lands, reminiscent of the environment in Egner's celebrated ''[[People and Robbers of Cardemon Town]]''. There were also a selection of songs and poems in between the stories.

The books took over the role held for decades by the readers of [[Nordahl Rolfsen]] in the Norwegian educational system. Rolfsen's books were published in the years 1892&amp;ndash;1895, and had been the standard works since, but starting in the 1950s, Egner's books took over this position. Egner himself considered the series to be the ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' of his collected works. In 1972, however{{spaced ndash}}the year when the last book in the series was published{{spaced ndash}}the educational program of Norwegian [[primary school]]s was altered. The new scheme largely abandoned the use of basic readers in the [[curriculum]]. As a result, Egner's textbooks were rendered virtually obsolete as educational tools.&lt;ref name="DP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dyreparken.no/kart-parkinfo/kardemomme_by/Thorbjorn-Egner/|title=Thorbjørn Egner-biografi|publisher=Dyreparken|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books remain an important part of the Norwegian cultural heritage, being considered children's classics, and some of them have been reprinted more recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bokkilden.no/SamboWeb/produkt.do?produktId=115869|title=Ola-Ola Heia|publisher=BokKilden|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5131">{{short description|Conserving an unstable painting on a deteriorated panel by transferring it to canvas or a new panel}}
[[File:Sebastiano del Piombo, The Raising of Lazarus.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastiano del Piombo]]'s ''[[The Raising of Lazarus (Sebastiano del Piombo)|The Raising of Lazarus]]'', transferred from panel to canvas in 1771.&lt;ref name=lazarus/&gt;]]
The practice of conserving an unstable [[panel painting|painting on panel]] by transferring it from its original decayed, worm-eaten, cracked or distorted wood support to canvas or a new panel has been practised since the eighteenth century. It has now been largely superseded by improved methods of  wood conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Structural Conservation of Panel Paintings:Proceedings of a symposium at the J. Paul Getty Museum |editor1-first= Kathleen|editor1-last= Dardes |editor2-first=Andrea|editor2-last= Rothe|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|volume=3|page=189|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/panelpaintings.html#download}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice evolved in [[Naples]] and [[Cremona]] in 1711–1725, and reached France by the middle of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Structural Conservation of Panel Paintings:Proceedings of a symposium at the J. Paul Getty Museum |editor1-first= Kathleen|editor1-last= Dardes |editor2-first=Andrea|editor2-last= Rothe|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|volume=3|pages=268–9|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/panelpaintings.html#download}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was especially widely practiced in the second half of the 19th century. Similar techniques are used to transfer [[fresco]]s. Oil paintings on [[canvas]] often [[Lining of paintings|receive additional support or are transferred to a new backing]].

==Methods==
The process is described by Henry Mogford  in his '' Handbook for the Preservation of Pictures''. Smooth sheets of paper were pasted over the painted surface of the panel, and a layer of [[muslin]] over that. The panel was then fixed, face down, to a table, and the wood planed away from the back  until it was "as thin as a plane may safely go", and the remainder scraped off with a sharp instrument such as a razor. The ground of the painting was then removed by solvents or scraping, until nothing remained but  a thin skin of colour,  pasted over with paper and held together by the muslin. A prepared canvas was then attached to the back of the paint layer, using the same method as was used for lining pictures. When the glue had dried, the  paper and muslin was removed by careful damping.&lt;ref name=mogford&gt;{{cite book|title= Handbook for the Preservation of Pictures|first=Henry|last=Mogford|edition=3rd|year=1851|pages=35–6|publisher= Winsor and Newton|location=London|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading workshop carrying out the process in Paris in the eighteenth century was that of Jean-Louis Hacquin (d. 1783), who transferred many works in the French royal collection.  Transfers from the workshop have sometimes been found to have a layer of pieces of silk, or of sheets of paper between the paint layer and the new canvas. The workshop  was continued after  Hacquin’s death by his son, François-Toussaint Hacquin (1756–1832),  who transferred many paintings  taken to France from Italy during the Napoleonic period.&lt;ref name=lazarus &gt;{{cite journal|journal=National Gallery Technical Bulletin|volume=30|year=2009|title=Sebastiano del Piombo's Raising of Lazarus: A History of Change|first1=Jill|last1= Dunkerton|first2=Helen|last2= Howard|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/upload/pdf/dunkerton_howard2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method, used by Hacquin's contemporary,  Jean-Michel Picault, dissolved the ground layer chemically, apparently with  fumes of [[nitrous oxide]], allowing the panel to be removed intact from the paint.&lt;ref name=lazarus/&gt; A later restorer, Marie-Jacob Godefroid is recorded as having achieved similar results by the use of steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Getty Publications|title=Issues in the Conservation of Paintings|first1=David|last1= Bomford|first2=Mark|last2= Leonard,|year=2004|page=281|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywaDvCzGxpsC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq|isbn=978-0-89236-781-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A less dramatic "partial transfer" tended to be used in Germany and Austria, in which a thin layer of the original wood was retained, and glued onto a new panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Structural Conservation of Panel Paintings:Proceedings of a symposium at the J. Paul Getty Museum |editor1-first= Kathleen|editor1-last= Dardes |editor2-first=Andrea|editor2-last= Rothe|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|volume=3|page=222|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/panelpaintings.html#download}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uncertainty theory''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] based on normality, monotonicity, self-duality, countable subadditivity, and product measure axioms.{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} It was founded by Baoding Liu &lt;ref&gt;Baoding Liu, Uncertainty Theory, 2nd ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 and refined in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Baoding Liu, Uncertainty Theory, 4th ed., http://orsc.edu.cn/liu/ut.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical measures of the likelihood of an event being true include [[probability theory]], capacity, [[fuzzy logic]], possibility, and credibility, as well as uncertainty.

==Four axioms==
'''Axiom 1.''' (Normality Axiom) &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\{\Gamma\}=1\text{ for the universal set }\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Axiom 2.''' (Self-Duality Axiom) &lt;Math&gt;\mathcal{M}\{\Lambda\}+\mathcal{M}\{\Lambda^c\}=1\text{ for any event }\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Axiom 3.''' (Countable Subadditivity Axiom) For every countable sequence of events &amp;Lambda;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;Lambda;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., we have
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\left\{\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty\Lambda_i\right\}\le\sum_{i=1}^\infty\mathcal{M}\{\Lambda_i\}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Axiom 4.''' (Product Measure Axiom) Let &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma_k,\mathcal{L}_k,\mathcal{M}_k)&lt;/math&gt; be uncertainty spaces for &lt;math&gt;k=1,2,\cdots,n&lt;/math&gt;. Then the product uncertain measure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is an uncertain measure on the product &amp;sigma;-algebra satisfying
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\left\{\prod_{i=1}^n\Lambda_i\right\}=\underset{1\le i\le n}{\operatorname{min} }\mathcal{M}_i\{\Lambda_i\}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Principle.''' (Maximum Uncertainty Principle) For any event, if there are multiple reasonable values that an uncertain measure may take, then the value as close to 0.5 as possible is assigned to the event.

==Uncertain variables==
An uncertain variable is a [[measurable function]] ξ from an uncertainty space &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma,L,M)&lt;/math&gt; to the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[real numbers]], i.e., for any [[Borel set]] '''B''' of [[real numbers]], the set 
&lt;math&gt;\{\xi\in B\}=\{\gamma \in \Gamma|\xi(\gamma)\in B\}&lt;/math&gt; is an event.

==Uncertainty distribution==
Uncertainty distribution is inducted to describe uncertain variables.

'''Definition''':The '''uncertainty distribution''' &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x):R \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of an uncertain variable ξ is defined by &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)=M\{\xi\leq x\}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem'''(Peng and Iwamura, ''Sufficient and Necessary Condition for Uncertainty Distribution'') A function &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x):R \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is an uncertain distribution if and only if it is an increasing function except &lt;math&gt;\Phi (x) \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi (x)\equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Independence==
'''Definition''': The uncertain variables &lt;math&gt;\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_m&lt;/math&gt; are said to be independent if 
:&lt;math&gt;M\{\cap_{i=1}^m(\xi \in B_i)\}=\mbox{min}_{1\leq i \leq m}M\{\xi_i \in B_i\} &lt;/math&gt;
for any Borel sets &lt;math&gt;B_1,B_2,\ldots,B_m&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers.

'''Theorem 1''': The uncertain variables &lt;math&gt;\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_m&lt;/math&gt; are independent if 
:&lt;math&gt;M\{\cup_{i=1}^m(\xi \in B_i)\}=\mbox{max}_{1\leq i \leq m}M\{\xi_i \in B_i\} &lt;/math&gt;
for any Borel sets &lt;math&gt;B_1,B_2,\ldots,B_m&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers.

'''Theorem 2''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_m&lt;/math&gt; be independent uncertain variables, and &lt;math&gt;f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_m&lt;/math&gt; measurable functions. Then &lt;math&gt;f_1(\xi_1),f_2(\xi_2),\ldots,f_m(\xi_m)&lt;/math&gt; are independent uncertain variables.

'''Theorem 3''': Let &lt;math&gt;\Phi_i&lt;/math&gt; be uncertainty distributions of independent uncertain variables &lt;math&gt;\xi_i,\quad i=1,2,\ldots,m&lt;/math&gt; respectively, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; the joint uncertainty distribution of uncertain vector &lt;math&gt;(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_m)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_m&lt;/math&gt; are independent, then we have 
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m)=\mbox{min}_{1\leq i \leq m}\Phi_i(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;
for any real numbers &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m&lt;/math&gt;.

==Operational law==
'''Theorem''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_m&lt;/math&gt; be independent uncertain variables, and &lt;math&gt;f: R^n \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; a measurable function. Then &lt;math&gt;\xi=f(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_m)&lt;/math&gt; is an uncertain variable such that
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\{\xi\in B\}=\begin{cases} \underset{f(B_1,B_2,\cdots,B_n)\subset B}{\operatorname{sup} }\;\underset{1\le k\le n}{\operatorname{min} }\mathcal{M}_k\{\xi_k\in B_k\}, &amp; \text{if } \underset{f(B_1,B_2,\cdots,B_n)\subset B}{\operatorname{sup} }\;\underset{1\le k\le n}{\operatorname{min} }\mathcal{M}_k\{\xi_k\in B_k\} &gt; 0.5 \\ 1-\underset{f(B_1,B_2,\cdots,B_n)\subset B^c}{\operatorname{sup} }\;\underset{1\le k\le n}{\operatorname{min} }\mathcal{M}_k\{\xi_k\in B_k\}, &amp; \text{if } \underset{f(B_1,B_2,\cdots,B_n)\subset B^c}{\operatorname{sup} }\;\underset{1\le k\le n}{\operatorname{min} }\mathcal{M}_k\{\xi_k\in B_k\} &gt; 0.5 \\ 0.5, &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;B, B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_m&lt;/math&gt; are Borel sets, and &lt;math&gt;f( B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_m)\subset B&lt;/math&gt; means&lt;math&gt;f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m) \in B&lt;/math&gt; for any&lt;math&gt;x_1 \in B_1, x_2 \in B_2, \ldots,x_m \in B_m&lt;/math&gt;.

==Expected Value==
'''Definition''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable. Then the expected value of &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is defined by 
:::&lt;math&gt;E[\xi]=\int_0^{+\infty}M\{\xi\geq r\}dr-\int_{-\infty}^0M\{\xi\leq r\}dr&lt;/math&gt;
provided that at least one of the two integrals is finite.

'''Theorem 1''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable with uncertainty distribution &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. If the expected value exists, then 
:::&lt;math&gt;E[\xi]=\int_0^{+\infty}(1-\Phi(x))dx-\int_{-\infty}^0\Phi(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Uncertain expected value.jpg|300px|center]]

'''Theorem 2''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable with regular uncertainty distribution &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. If the expected value exists, then 
:::&lt;math&gt;E[\xi]=\int_0^1\Phi^{-1}(\alpha)d\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 3''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; be independent uncertain variables with finite expected values. Then for any real numbers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:::&lt;math&gt;E[a\xi+b\eta]=aE[\xi]+b[\eta]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Variance==
'''Definition''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable with finite expected value &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;. Then the variance of &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is defined by 
:::&lt;math&gt;V[\xi]=E[(\xi-e)^2]&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem''': If &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable with finite expected value, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers, then
:::&lt;math&gt;V[a\xi+b]=a^2V[\xi]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Critical value==
'''Definition''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in(0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\xi_{sup}(\alpha)=\mbox{sup}\{r|M\{\xi\geq r\}\geq\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;
is called the α-[[optimistic]] value to &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, and 
:&lt;math&gt;\xi_{inf}(\alpha)=\mbox{inf}\{r|M\{\xi\leq r\}\geq\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;
is called the α-[[pessimistic]] value to &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 1''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable with regular uncertainty distribution &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then its α-[[optimistic]] value and α-[[pessimistic]] value are 
::&lt;math&gt;\xi_{sup}(\alpha)=\Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\xi_{inf}(\alpha)=\Phi^{-1}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 2''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in(0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have
* if &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;0.5&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\xi_{inf}(\alpha)\geq \xi_{sup}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;;

'''Theorem 3''': Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; are independent uncertain variables, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in(0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have

&lt;math&gt;(\xi \wedge \eta)_{inf}(\alpha)=\xi_{inf}(\alpha)\wedge\eta_{inf}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Entropy==
'''Definition''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable with uncertainty distribution &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then its entropy is defined by
::&lt;math&gt;H[\xi]=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}S(\Phi(x))dx&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S(x)=-t\mbox{ln}(t)-(1-t)\mbox{ln}(1-t)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 1'''(''Dai and Chen''): Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable with regular uncertainty distribution &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then
::&lt;math&gt;H[\xi]=\int_0^1\Phi^{-1}(\alpha)\mbox{ln}\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}d\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 2''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; be independent uncertain variables. Then for any real numbers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, we have
::&lt;math&gt;H[a\xi+b\eta]=|a|E[\xi]+|b|E[\eta]&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 3''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable whose uncertainty distribution is arbitrary but the expected value &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;. Then
::&lt;math&gt;H[\xi]\leq\frac{\pi\sigma}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Inequalities==
'''Theorem 1'''(''Liu'', Markov Inequality): Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable. Then for any given numbers &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, we have
::&lt;math&gt;M\{|\xi|\geq t\}\leq \frac{E[|\xi|^p]}{t^p}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 2''' (''Liu'', Chebyshev Inequality) Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable whose variance &lt;math&gt;V[\xi]&lt;/math&gt; exists. Then for any given number&lt;math&gt; t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, we have
::&lt;math&gt;M\{|\xi-E[\xi]|\geq t\}\leq \frac{V[\xi]}{t^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 3''' (''Liu'', Holder’s Inequality) Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; be positive numbers with &lt;math&gt;1/p + 1/q = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; be independent uncertain variables with &lt;math&gt;E[|\xi|^p]&lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E[|\eta|^q] &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have
::&lt;math&gt;E[|\xi\eta|]\leq \sqrt[p]{E[|\xi|^p]} \sqrt[p]{E[\eta|^p]}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 4''':(Liu [127], Minkowski Inequality) Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be a real number with &lt;math&gt;p\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; be independent uncertain variables with &lt;math&gt;E[|\xi|^p]&lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E[|\eta|^q] &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have
::&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[p]{E[|\xi+\eta|^p]}\leq \sqrt[p]{E[|\xi|^p]}+\sqrt[p]{E[\eta|^p]}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Convergence concept==
'''Definition 1''': Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\xi,\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; are uncertain variables defined on the uncertainty space &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma,L,M)&lt;/math&gt;. The sequence &lt;math&gt;\{\xi_i\}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be convergent a.s. to &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; if there exists an event &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;M\{\Lambda\} = 1&lt;/math&gt; such that
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{lim}_{i\rightarrow\infty}|\xi_i(\gamma)-\xi(\gamma)|=0&lt;/math&gt;
for every &lt;math&gt;\gamma\in\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;. In that case we write &lt;math&gt;\xi_i\rightarrow \xi&lt;/math&gt;,a.s.

'''Definition 2''': Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\xi,\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; are uncertain variables. We say that the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{\xi_i\}&lt;/math&gt; converges in measure to &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; if
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{lim}_{i\rightarrow\infty}M\{|\xi_i-\xi|\leq \varepsilon \}=0&lt;/math&gt;
for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition 3''': Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\xi,\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; are uncertain variables with finite expected values. We say that the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{\xi_i\}&lt;/math&gt; converges in mean to &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; if
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{lim}_{i\rightarrow\infty}E[|\xi_i-\xi|]=0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition 4''': Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\Phi,\phi_1,\Phi_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; are uncertainty distributions of uncertain variables &lt;math&gt;\xi,\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. We say that the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{\xi_i\}&lt;/math&gt; converges in distribution to &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\Phi_i\rightarrow\Phi&lt;/math&gt; at any continuity point of &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 1''': Convergence in Mean &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; Convergence in Measure &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; Convergence in Distribution. 
However, Convergence in Mean &lt;math&gt;\nLeftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; Convergence Almost Surely &lt;math&gt;\nLeftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; Convergence in Distribution.

==Conditional uncertainty==
'''Definition 1''': Let &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma,L,M)&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertainty space, and &lt;math&gt;A,B\in L&lt;/math&gt;. Then the conditional uncertain measure of A given B is defined by

::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\{A\vert B\}=\begin{cases} \displaystyle\frac{\mathcal{M}\{A\cap B\} }{\mathcal{M}\{B\} }, &amp;\displaystyle\text{if }\frac{\mathcal{M}\{A\cap B\} }{\mathcal{M}\{B\} }&lt;0.5 \\ \displaystyle 1 - \frac{\mathcal{M}\{A^c\cap B\} }{\mathcal{M}\{B\} }, &amp;\displaystyle\text{if } \frac{\mathcal{M}\{A^c\cap B\} }{\mathcal{M}\{B\} }&lt;0.5 \\ 0.5, &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\text{provided that } \mathcal{M}\{B\}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1''': Let &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma,L,M)&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertainty space, and B an event with &lt;math&gt;M\{B\} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then M{·|B} defined by Definition 1 is an uncertain measure, and &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma,L,M\{\mbox{·}|B\})&lt;/math&gt;is an uncertainty space.

'''Definition 2''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable on &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma,L,M)&lt;/math&gt;. A conditional uncertain variable of &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; given B is a measurable function &lt;math&gt;\xi|_B&lt;/math&gt; from the conditional uncertainty space &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma,L,M\{\mbox{·}|_B\})&lt;/math&gt; to the set of real numbers such that
::&lt;math&gt;\xi|_B(\gamma)=\xi(\gamma),\forall \gamma \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition 3''': The conditional uncertainty distribution &lt;math&gt;\Phi\rightarrow[0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; of an uncertain variable &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; given B is defined by
::&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x|B)=M\{\xi\leq x|B\}&lt;/math&gt;
provided that &lt;math&gt;M\{B\}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 2''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable with regular uncertainty distribution &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; a real number with &lt;math&gt;\Phi(t) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. Then the conditional uncertainty distribution of &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;\xi&gt; t&lt;/math&gt; is
::&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x\vert(t,+\infty))=\begin{cases} 0, &amp; \text{if }\Phi(x)\le\Phi(t)\\ \displaystyle\frac{\Phi(x)}{1-\Phi(t)}\and 0.5, &amp; \text{if }\Phi(t)&lt;\Phi(x)\le(1+\Phi(t))/2 \\ \displaystyle\frac{\Phi(x)-\Phi(t)}{1-\Phi(t)}, &amp; \text{if }(1+\Phi(t))/2\le\Phi(x) \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 3''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable with regular uncertainty distribution &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; a real number with &lt;math&gt;\Phi(t)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the conditional uncertainty distribution of &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;\xi\leq t&lt;/math&gt; is
::&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x\vert(-\infty,t])=\begin{cases} \displaystyle\frac{\Phi(x)}{\Phi(t)}, &amp; \text{if }\Phi(x)\le\Phi(t)/2 \\ \displaystyle\frac{\Phi(x)+\Phi(t)-1}{\Phi(t)}\or 0.5, &amp; \text{if }\Phi(t)/2\le\Phi(x)&lt;\Phi(t) \\ 1, &amp; \text{if }\Phi(t)\le\Phi(x) \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Definition 4''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; be an uncertain variable. Then the conditional expected value of &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; given B is defined by
::&lt;math&gt;E[\xi|B]=\int_0^{+\infty}M\{\xi\geq r|B\}dr-\int_{-\infty}^0M\{\xi\leq r|B\}dr&lt;/math&gt;
provided that at least one of the two integrals is finite.

'''Villa rustica''' ('''countryside villa''') was the term used by the ancient Romans to denote a villa set in the open countryside, often as the hub of a large agricultural estate (''[[Latifundia|latifundium]]''). The adjective ''rusticum'' was used to distinguish it from an urban or resort [[Roman villa|villa]]. The ''villa rustica'' would thus serve both as a residence of the landowner and his family (and retainers) and also as a farm management centre. It would often comprise separate buildings to accommodate farm labourers and sheds and barns for animals and crops.&lt;ref&gt;Annalia Marzano: ''Roman villas in central Italy: a social and economic history''.

In modern British [[archaeology]], a ''villa rustica'' is commonly (and misleadingly) referred to simply as a "Roman villa".

The villa rustica's design differed depending on the architect, but usually it consisted of three parts; the urbana (main house), agricultural center and the rusticana (farm area).

'''Water conservation''' includes all the policies, strategies and activities to [[sustainably]] manage the [[natural resource]] of [[fresh water]], to protect the [[hydrosphere]], and to meet the current and future human  [[demand]]. Population, household size, and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used. Factors such as [[climate change]] have increased pressures on natural water resources especially in [[manufacturing]] and agricultural [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/water/conserve/|title=Water conservation « Defra |work=defra.gov.uk |year=2013 |accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many US cities have already implemented policies aimed at water conservation, with much success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/watersense/docs/utilityconservation_508.pdf|title=Cases in Water Conservation: How Efficiency Programs Help Water Utilities Save Water and Avoid Costs|last=|first=|date=|website=EPA.gov|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of water conservation efforts include:
* Ensuring [[water resources|availability of water]] for future generations where the withdrawal of [[freshwater]] from an [[ecosystem]] does not exceed its natural replacement rate.
* [[Energy conservation]] as water pumping, delivery and [[wastewater treatment]] facilities consume a significant amount of energy. In some regions of the world over 15% of total [[electricity consumption]] is devoted to [[water management]]. 
* [[Habitat conservation]] where minimizing human water use helps to preserve [[freshwater habitat]]s for local wildlife and migrating [[waterfowl]], but also [[water quality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hermoso |first1=Virgilio |last2=Abell |first2=Robin |last3=Linke |first3=Simon |last4=Boon |first4=Philip |title=The role of protected areas for freshwater biodiversity conservation: challenges and opportunities in a rapidly changing world |journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems |date=2016 |volume=26 |issue=S1 |pages=3–11 |doi=10.1002/aqc.2681|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.2681/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==

The key activities that benefit water conservation(save water) are as follows:
#Any beneficial reduction in [[Drying|water loss]], use and waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Duane D. Baumann|author2=John J. Boland|author3=John H. Sims|date=April 1984|title=Water Conservation: The Struggle over Definition|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=20|pages=428–434|url=  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/WR020i004p00428/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Avoiding any damage to [[water quality]].
#Improving [[water management]] practices that reduce the use or enhance the beneficial use of water.&lt;ref name="Vickers, Amy 2002"&gt;{{cite book |title=Water Use and Conservation |last=Vickers |first=Amy |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= water plow Press |location=Amherst, MA |isbn=1-931579-07-5 |page=434 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Geerts | first1 = S. | last2 = Raes | first2 = D. | year = 2009 | title = Deficit irrigation as an  on-farm strategy to maximize crop water productivity in dry areas | doi = 10.1016/j.agwat.2009.04.009 | journal = Agric. Water Manage | volume = 96 | issue = 9| pages = 1275–1284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
One strategy in water conservation is [[rain water harvesting]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar Kurunthachalam|first=Senthil|year=2014|title=Water Conservation and Sustainability: An Utmost Importance.|url=|journal=Hydrol Current Res|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digging ponds, lakes, canals, expanding the water reservoir, and installing rain water catching ducts and filtration systems on homes are different methods of harvesting rain water. Many people in many countries keep clean containers so they can boil it and drink it, which is useful to supply water to the needy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Harvested and filtered rain water can be used for toilets, home gardening, lawn irrigation, and small scale agriculture.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Another strategy in water conservation is protecting [[groundwater]] resources. When precipitation occurs, some infiltrates the soil and goes underground.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwrfc.noaa.gov/info/water_cycle/hydrology.cgi|title=Description of the Hydrologic Cycle|last=|first=|date=|website=nwrfc.noaa.gov/rfc/|publisher=NOAA River Forecast Center|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water in this saturation zone is called groundwater.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; [[groundwater contamination|Contamination of groundwater]] causes the groundwater water supply to not be able to be used as resource of fresh drinking water and the natural regeneration of contaminated groundwater can takes years to replenish.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.groundwater.org/get-informed/groundwater/contamination.html|title=Potential threats to Groundwater|last=|first=|date=|website=groundwater.org/|publisher=The Groundwater Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of potential sources of groundwater contamination include storage tanks, [[septic tank|septic]] systems, uncontrolled [[hazardous waste]], [[landfill]]s, [[atmospheric contaminants]], chemicals, and [[road salt]]s.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Contamination of groundwater decreases the replenishment of available freshwater so taking preventative measures by protecting groundwater resources from contamination is an important aspect of water conservation.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

An additional strategy to water conservation is practicing sustainable methods of utilizing groundwater resources.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Groundwater flows due to gravity and eventually discharges into streams.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Excess pumping of groundwater leads to a decrease in groundwater levels and if continued it can exhaust the resource.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Ground and surface waters are connected and overuse of groundwater can reduce and, in extreme examples, diminish the water supply of lakes, rivers, and streams.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In coastal regions, over pumping groundwater can increase saltwater intrusion which results in the contamination of  groundwater water supply.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Sustainable use of groundwater is essential in water conservation.

A fundamental component to water conservation strategy is communication and education outreach of different water programs.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delgado|first1=Jorge A.|last2=Groffman|first2=Peter M.|last3=Nearing|first3=Mark A.|last4=Goddard|first4=Tom|last5=Reicosky|first5=Don|last6=Lal|first6=Rattan|last7=Kitchen|first7=Newell R.|last8=Rice|first8=Charles W.|last9=Towery|first9=Dan|last10=Salon|first10=Paul|title=Conservation practices to mitigate and adapt to climate change|journal=Journal of Soil and Water Conservation|date=1 July 2011|volume=66|issue=4|pages=118A–129A|doi=10.2489/jswc.66.4.118A|url=http://www.jswconline.org/content/66/4/118A.refs|accessdate=25 May 2018|language=en|issn=0022-4561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing communication that educates science to land managers, policy makers, farmers, and the general public is another important strategy utilized in water conservation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Communication of the science of how water systems work is an important aspect when creating a management plan to conserve that system and is often used for ensuring the right management plan to be put into action.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Social solutions ==
[[File:VineyardDrip.JPG|thumb|right|[[Drip irrigation]] system in [[New Mexico]]]]
Water conservation programs involved in social solutions are typically initiated at the local level, by either municipal [[water industry|water utilities]] or regional governments.  Common strategies include public [[outreach]] campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wateruseitwisely.com "Water - Use It Wisely."] U.S. multi-city public outreach program. Park &amp; Co., Phoenix, AZ. Accessed 2010-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt; tiered water rates (charging progressively higher prices as water use increases), or restrictions on outdoor water use such as lawn watering and car washing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Cases in Water Conservation |url=http://www.epa.gov/watersense/docs/utilityconservation_508.pdf |author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |year=2002 |accessdate=2010-02-02}} Document No. EPA-832-B-02-003.&lt;/ref&gt; Cities in dry climates often require or encourage the installation of [[xeriscaping]] or [[natural landscaping]] in new homes to reduce outdoor water usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcwua.org/content/view/132/222/ |title= Xeriscape Rebates |author= Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority |authorlink= |date= 2009-02-06 |work= |location=Albuquerque, NM |accessdate= 2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most urban outdoor water use in California is residential,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heberger|first=Matthew|year=2014|title=Issue Brief|url=http://pacinst.org/app/uploads/2014/06/ca-water-urban.pdf|journal=Urban Water Conservation and efficiency Potential in California|volume=|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating a reason for outreach to households as well as businesses.

One fundamental conservation goal is universal metering. The prevalence of residential [[water meter]]ing varies significantly worldwide. Recent studies have estimated that water supplies are metered in less than 30% of UK households,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/environment_sciences/report-60279.html "Time for universal water metering?"] ''Innovations Report.'' May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and about 61% of urban Canadian homes (as of 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Municipal Water Use, 2001 Statistics |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/water-apps/en/info/pubs/sss/e_mun2001.pdf |author=Environment Canada |year=2005 |accessdate=2010-02-02}} Cat. No. En11-2/2001E-PDF. {{ISBN|0-662-39504-2}}. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although individual water meters have often been considered impractical in homes with private wells or in multifamily buildings, the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates that metering alone can reduce consumption by 20 to 40 percent.&lt;ref name="EPA-Conserve"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/nps-conserve.html |title=How to Conserve Water and Use It Effectively |author=EPA |date=2010-01-13 |work= |location=Washington, DC|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to raising consumer awareness of their water use, metering is also an important way to identify and localize [[water leakage]].  Water metering would benefit society, in the long run, it is proven that water metering increases the efficiency of the entire water system, as well as help unnecessary expenses for individuals for years to come.  One would be unable to waste water unless they are willing to pay the extra charges, this way the water department would be able to monitor water usage by the public, domestic and manufacturing services.

Some researchers have suggested that water conservation efforts should be primarily directed at farmers, in light of the fact that crop irrigation accounts for 70% of the world's fresh water use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pimentel, Berger|title=Water resources: agricultural and environmental issues |journal=BioScience |volume=54 |issue=10 |pages=909 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0909:WRAAEI]2.0.CO;2|display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agricultural sector of most countries is important both economically and politically, and water subsidies are common.  Conservation advocates have urged removal of all subsidies to force [[farmers]] to grow more water-efficient crops and adopt less wasteful irrigation techniques.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

New technology poses a few new options for consumers, features such as full flush and half flush when using a toilet are trying to make a difference in water consumption and waste.  Also available are modern [[shower head]]s that help reduce wasting water: Old shower heads are said to use 5-10 gallons per minute, while new fixtures available are said to use 2.5 gallons per minute and offer equal water coverage.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Household applications ==
The Home Water Works website contains useful information on household water conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.home-water-works.org|title=Water Usage Calculator, Water Conservation and Efficiency - Home Water Works|website=www.home-water-works.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to the popular view that the most effective way to save water is to curtail water-using behavior (e.g., by taking shorter showers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/02/26/1316402111|title=Perceptions of water use|first=Shahzeen Z.|last=Attari|date=26 February 2014|publisher=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=201316402|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.1316402111|pmid=24591608|pmc=3986180}}&lt;/ref&gt; experts suggest the most efficient way is replacing toilets and retrofitting washers; as demonstrated by two [[Residential water use in the U.S. and Canada|household end use logging]] studies in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, P.W.; DeOreo, W.B.; Opitz, E.M.; Kiefer, J.C.; Davis, W.Y.; Dziegielewski, B.; &amp; Nelson, J.O., 1999.

Water-saving technology for the home includes:
#Low-flow shower heads sometimes called energy-efficient shower heads as they also use less energy
#[[Low flush toilet|Low-flush toilet]]s and [[composting toilet]]s. These have a dramatic impact in the developed world, as conventional Western [[toilet]]s use large volumes of water
#[[Dual flush toilet]]s created by [[Caroma]] includes two buttons or handles to flush different levels of water. Dual flush toilets use up to 67% less water than conventional toilets
#[[Faucet aerator]]s, which break water flow into fine droplets to maintain "wetting effectiveness" while using less water. An additional benefit is that they reduce splashing while washing hands and dishes
#[[Raw water flushing]] where toilets use sea water or non-purified water
#[[Reclaimed water|Wastewater reuse]] or recycling systems, allowing:
#*Reuse of [[greywater|graywater]] for flushing toilets or watering gardens
#*Recycling of wastewater through [[water purification|purification]] at a water treatment plant. ''See also [[Wastewater#Reuse|Wastewater - Reuse]]''
#[[Rainwater harvesting]]
#High-efficiency [[washing machine|clothes washer]]s
#Weather-based irrigation controllers
#[[Garden hose]] [[nozzle]]s that shut off the water when it is not being used, instead of letting a hose run.
# Low flow taps in wash basins
#[[Swimming pool]] covers that reduce evaporation and can warm pool water to reduce water, energy and chemical costs.
#[[Automatic faucet]] is a water conservation faucet that eliminates water waste at the faucet. It automates the use of faucets without the use of hands.

== Commercial applications ==
Many water-saving devices (such as low-flush toilets) that are useful in homes can also be useful for business water saving. Other water-saving technology for businesses includes:
*[[Waterless urinal]]s
*[[Waterless car wash]]es
*[[Infrared]] or foot-operated taps, which can save water by using short bursts of water for rinsing in a kitchen or bathroom
*Pressurized waterbrooms, which can be used instead of a hose to clean sidewalks
*[[Radiography|X-ray]] film processor re-circulation systems
*[[Cooling tower]] conductivity controllers
*Water-saving [[steam sterilizer]]s, for use in hospitals and health care facilities
*[[Rain water harvesting]]
*Water to Water [[heat exchanger]]s.

== Agricultural applications ==
[[Image:PivotIrrigationOnCotton.jpg|thumb|216px|right|Overhead irrigation, [[Center pivot irrigation|center pivot]] design]]
For crop irrigation, optimal [[water efficiency]] means minimizing losses due to [[evaporation]], [[Surface runoff|runoff]] or subsurface drainage while maximizing production.  An [[evaporation pan]] in combination with specific crop correction factors can be used to determine how much water is needed to satisfy plant requirements.  [[surface irrigation|Flood irrigation]], the oldest and most common type, is often very uneven in distribution, as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts. [[Irrigation#Overhead (sprinkler) irrigation|Overhead irrigation]], using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers, has the potential for a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern. [[Drip irrigation]] is the most expensive and least-used type, but offers the ability to deliver water to plant roots with minimal losses. However, drip irrigation is increasingly affordable, especially for the home gardener and in light of rising water rates. Using drip irrigation methods can save up to 30,000 gallons of water per year when replacing irrigation systems that spray in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/watersense/outdoor/tech.html|title=Water-Saving Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=WaterSense: An EPA Partnership Program|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also cheap effective methods similar to drip irrigation such as the use of soaking hoses that can even be submerged in the growing medium to eliminate evaporation.

As changing irrigation systems can be a costly undertaking, conservation efforts often concentrate on maximizing the efficiency of the existing system.  This may include chiseling compacted soils, creating furrow dikes to prevent runoff, and using soil moisture and rainfall sensors to optimize irrigation schedules.&lt;ref name="EPA-Conserve"/&gt; Usually large gains in efficiency are possible through measurement and more effective management of the existing irrigation system. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report notes that "[i]mproved [[soil organic matter]] from the use of green manures, mulching, and recycling of crop residues and animal manure increases the water holding capacity of soils and their ability to absorb water during torrential rains",&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt; which is a way to optimize the use of rainfall and irrigation during dry periods in the season.

== Water Reuse ==
Water shortage has become an increasingly difficult problem to manage. More than 40% of the world's population live in a region where the demand for water exceeds its supply. The imbalance between supply and demand, along with persisting issues such as climate change and exponential [[population growth]], has made water reuse a necessary method for conserving water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-23892-0|title=Wastewater Reuse and Current Challenges - Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23892-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of methods used in the [[Water treatment|treatment of waste water]] to ensure that it is safe to use for irrigation of food crops and/or drinking water.

Seawater desalination requires more energy than the desalination of fresh water. Despite this, many seawater desalination plants have been built in response to water shortages around the world. This makes it necessary to evaluate the impacts of seawater desalination and to find ways to improve desalination technology. Current research involves the use of experiments to determine the most effective and least energy intensive methods of desalination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elimelech|first=Menachem|last2=Phillip|first2=William A.|date=2011-08-05|title=The Future of Seawater Desalination: Energy, Technology, and the Environment|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6043/712|journal=Science|language=en|volume=333|issue=6043|pages=712–717|doi=10.1126/science.1200488|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21817042}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Han|first=Songlee|last2=Rhee|first2=Young-Woo|last3=Kang|first3=Seong-Pil|date=2017-02-17|title=Investigation of salt removal using cyclopentane hydrate formation and washing treatment for seawater desalination|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916416309742|journal=Desalination|volume=404|pages=132–137|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2016.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sand filter|Sand filtration]] is another method used to treat water. Recent studies show that sand filtration needs further improvements, but it is approaching optimization with its effectiveness at removing pathogens from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seeger|first=Eva M.|last2=Braeckevelt|first2=Mareike|last3=Reiche|first3=Nils|last4=Müller|first4=Jochen A.|last5=Kästner|first5=Matthias|date=2016-10-01|title=Removal of pathogen indicators from secondary effluent using slow sand filtration: Optimization approaches|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857416303937|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=95|pages=635–644|doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.06.068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vries|first=D.|last2=Bertelkamp|first2=C.|last3=Kegel|first3=F.

The removal of [[pathogen]]s from recycled water is of high priority because wastewater always contains pathogens capable of infecting humans. The levels of pathogenic viruses have to be reduced to a certain level in order for recycled water to not pose a threat to human populations. Further research is necessary to determine more accurate methods of assessing the level of pathogenic viruses in treated wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerba|first=Charles P.|last2=Betancourt|first2=Walter Q.|last3=Kitajima|first3=Masaaki|title=How much reduction of virus is needed for recycled water: A continuous changing need for assessment?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004313541630865X|journal=Water Research|volume=108|pages=25–31|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2016.11.020|pmid=27838026|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wasting of water ==
[[File:Leaking garden hose bib.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Leaking garden hose bib]]
Wasting of water (also called "water waste" in the U.S.) is the flip side of water conservation and, in household applications, it means causing or permitting discharge of water without any practical purpose. Inefficient water use is also considered wasteful. By [[EPA]] estimate, household leaks in the U.S. can waste approximately 900 billion gallons (3.4 billion cubic meters) of water annually nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/watersense/statistics-and-facts |title=Statistics and Facts &amp;amp;#124; WaterSense &amp;amp;#124; US EPA |website=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, water management agencies are reluctant or unwilling to give a concrete definition to the somewhat fuzzy concept of '''water waste'''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/bibarticles/neuman_forfeiture.pdf |title=Janet C. Neuman. Beneficial Use, Waste, and Forfeiture:The Inefficient Search for Efficiency in Western Water Use |date= |accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, definition of water waste is often given in local drought emergency ordinances. One example refers to any acts or omissions, whether willful or negligent, that are “causing or permitting water to leak, discharge, flow or run to waste into any gutter, sanitary sewer, watercourse or public or private storm drain, or to any adjacent property, from any tap, hose, faucet, pipe, sprinkler, pond, pool, waterway, fountain or nozzle.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qcode.us/codes/roseville/view.php?topic=14-14_09-14_09_030&amp;frames=off |title=14.09.030 Definition of water waste |website=Qcode.us |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this example, the city code also clarifies that “in the case of washing, “discharge,” “flow” or “run to waste” means that water in excess of that necessary to wash, wet or clean the dirty or dusty object, such as an automobile, sidewalk, or parking area, flows to waste. Water utilities (and other media sources) often provide listings of wasteful water-use practices and prohibitions of wasteful uses. Examples include utilities in San Antonio, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saws.org/conservation/waterwaste/whatiswaste.cfm |title=SAWS Report Water Waste - What is Water Waste? |website=Saws.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Vegas, Nevada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lvvwd.com/conservation/waste.html |title=Water Waste |website=Lvvwd.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; California Water Service company in California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.calwater.com/conservation/water-waste-report/ |title=Report Water Waste |publisher=Cal Water |date=2015-12-03 |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and City of San Diego, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sandiego.gov/water/conservation/kids/tips |title=Water Saving Tips &amp;#124; City of San Diego Official Website |website=Sandiego.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Palo Alto in California enforces permanent water use restrictions on wasteful practices such as leaks, runoff, irrigating during and immediately after rainfall, and use of potable water when non-potable water is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=2336&amp;TargetID=235,310 |title=Water &amp; Drought Update - Palo Alto Water Use Guidelines |date= |accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar restrictions are in effect in the State of Victoria, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.water.vic.gov.au/liveable-cities-and-towns/permanent-water-saving-rules |title=Permanent water saving rules |date= |accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary water use bans (also known as "hosepipe bans") are used in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Water UK http://www.water.org.uk/consumers/tubs&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strictly speaking, water that is discharged into the sewer, or directly to the environment is not wasted or lost. It remains within the [[hydrologic cycle]] and returns to the land surface and surface water bodies as precipitation. However, in many cases, the source of the water is at a significant distance from the return point and may be in a different catchment. The separation between extraction point and return point can represent significant environmental degradation in the watercourse and riparian strip. What is "wasted" is the community's supply of water that was captured, stored, transported and treated to drinking quality standards. Efficient use of water saves the expense of water supply provision and leaves more fresh water in lakes, rivers and aquifers for other users and also for supporting ecosystems. A concept that is closely related to water wasting is "water-use efficiency." Water use is considered [[inefficiency|inefficient]] if the same purpose of its use can be accomplished with less water. Technical [[efficiency]] derives from engineering practice where it is typically used to describe the ratio of output to input and is useful in comparing various products and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dziegielewski, B. J.|author2=Kiefer, C.|title=Water Conservation Measurement Metrics: Guidance Report|journal=American Water Works Association|date=January 22, 2010|url=https://www.awwa.org/Portals/0/files/resources/resource%20dev%20groups/tech%20and%20educ%20program/documents/WaterConservationMeasurementMetricsGuidanceReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, one showerhead would be considered more efficient than another if it could accomplish the same purpose (i.e., of showering) by using less water or other inputs (e.g., lower water pressure). However, the technical efficiency concept is not useful in making decisions of investing money (or resources) in water conservation measures unless the inputs and outputs are measured in value terms. This expression of efficiency is referred to as [[economic efficiency]] and is incorporated into the concept of water conservation.

'''''What Engineers Know and How they Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History''''' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990) ({{ISBN|0-8018-4588-2}}) is a historical reflection on [[engineering]] practice in US [[aeronautics]] from 1908 to 1953 written by an accomplished practitioner and instructor. This period represents the dawn of aviation which was fraught with uncertainties and numerous paths to many [[possible worlds]].  The book captures two main conclusions from this period.  The first order conclusion of this book is about "what engineers know." Five case studies from the history of aeronautical engineering are used to argue engineering often demands its ''own'' scientific discoveries. Thus, engineering should be understood as a knowledge-generating activity that includes [[applied science]] but is not limited to applied science. The second order conclusion of this book pertains to "how engineers know" by using the same case studies to reveal patterns in the nature of all engineering. These patterns form an “[[epistemology]]” of engineering that may point the way to an “engineering method” as something distinct from [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="vincenti"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vincenti|first= Walter G.|title=What Engineers Know and How They Know It : Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History, Johns Hopkins Studies in the History of Technology [New.

The book is filled with numerous additional observations and stories told by a practitioner and instructor. This may be why [[Michael A. Jackson|Dr. Michael A.

== Author ==

Walter G. Vincenti (commonly pronounced "''vin-sen-tee''" in the US or "''vin-chen-tee''" in Italian) (1917–present) is a Professor Emeritus of Aeronautical and Aerospace Engineering at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://soe.stanford.edu/research/layout.php?sunetid=sts, accessed 24 Jan 2011, 2043.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1987 he was inducted into the [[National Academy of Engineering]], “for pioneering contributions to supersonic aircraft aerodynamics and to fundamental understanding of the physical [[gas dynamics]] of [[hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] flow.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.members.nae.edu/nae/naepub.nsf/Members+By+UNID/5B3300986C7CFF4C8625755200622ED3?opendocument, accessed 23 Jan 2011, 2230.&lt;/ref&gt;  His important textbook from the first part of his career is, ''Introduction to Physical Gas Dynamics'' (1ed ed 1965, 2nd ed 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Vincenti, Walter G., and Charles H. Kruger. Introduction to Physical Gas Dynamics. Huntington, N.Y.: Krieger, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vincenti in effect had two whole careers: one as a cutting-edge aeronautical engineer and another as a leading historian of technology.  This gave him a dual vantage point to think about how technological innovation works.  Further, he broadened the relevance of engineering to society by co-founding a Stanford discipline called Values, Technology and Society in 1971—now called Science, Technology and Society.&lt;ref&gt;Walter C. Post interview 1997, http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1997/3/1997_3_20.shtml, accessed 23 Jan 2011, 2240.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of 90 he published his most recent work with [[William M. Newman]], "On an Engineering Use of Engineering History" which appears in ''[[Technology and Culture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Vincenti and William Newman.  "On an Engineering Use of Engineering History," Technology and Culture.  Volume 48, Number 1, January 2007, pp. 245–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

''What Engineers Know'' was first published in 1990 when Mr. Vincenti was 73 years old after full careers in [[aerospace engineering]], the history of technology, and instructing.  The five case studies used for evidence in this book come from the first half of the 20th century, 1908-1953.  During this period the author worked at the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) from 1940 to 1957.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1997/3/1997_3_20.shtml, accessed 23 Jan 2011, 2245.&lt;/ref&gt;  Four of the five case studies used as evidence in this book were first published independently in ''[[Technology and Culture]]'' between 1979 and 1986.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|10}}  During this era, other authors were beginning to refute the view of engineering as only applied science.&lt;ref&gt;Bijker, Wiebe E., Thomas Parke Hughes, and T. J. Pinch. The Social Construction of Technological Systems : New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1987. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Then in 1990, Vincenti's five case studies indirectly supported this newer discourse about engineering as a knowledge-generating discipline.

== Scope==

The profession of "engineering" encompasses a wide scope of practice.  Thus, the author narrows the scope of his five case studies in three ways.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|6–9}} First, viewed end-to-end, the engineering process contains three phases including [[design]], construction/production and operation.  These cases come largely from the design phase of engineering.  One exception is the fifth case study on flush-riveted joints which involved an intimate interplay between design and production.  Second, design can be categorized as normal or radical.  These case studies pertain to normal design.  Third,  normal design itself is multi-leveled.  These levels proceed from project definition down to overall design, major component design, subdivision of component design, and highly specific problems (like planform, airfoil and high-lift devices).  These five case studies come mostly from these lower levels.  Thus when combined, the scope of these case studies is design, normal design and highly specific problems at the lowest level, "to help redress the neglect of this large and essential area."&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

== Case Study Summary (What Engineers Know)==

The five case studies are organized by chapter.  Chapter 2 regards '''[[airfoil]] design''' generally.  The early work of Davis illustrates how useful engineering has been done by people who have no formal training in engineering.  The [[Davis wing]] was instrumental even though Davis did not have the theoretical basis to know how or why.  Chapter 3 is about how engineers design in accord with '''flying qualities''' satisfactory to pilots.  This case study illustrates there can be a key relationship between human behavior and engineering requirements that can greatly affect the outcomes.  As such, "artifactual design is a social activity."&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|11, 237}}  Chapter 4 instructs the importance of '''[[control volume|control-volume]] analysis''' situations in mechanical design.  Control volume analysis was missing in physics textbooks at the time.  Thus, engineers had a scientific requirement that was not addressed adequately by any [[natural science]].  Importantly, such case studies are examples of why there is such a thing as "engineering science".  Chapter 5 regards the dynamic problem of''' [[propeller]] design and selection'''.  The propeller case study illustrates how engineers develop methods to account for the absence of required scientific theory.  In this case "[[variation of parameter|parameter variation]]" was used to map-out and survey a subject where no comprehensive scientific theory (in physics) existed.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|160–161}}  Finally, chapter 6 describes the problem of designing '''flush-riveted joints''' for aircraft.  This case study conveys how requirements of production can have a reverse influence on design thus driving iterations between production and design.  This case study also illustrates how there are aspects of engineering that cannot adequately be described as science such as the "feel" rivet mechanics developed for how much pressure to apply when completing the aircraft's aluminum stressed-skin structure (see "tacit knowledge" discussion below).

==An Epistemology of Engineering (How Engineers Know)==

Throughout the book, Walter Vincenti makes [[epistemology]] observations pertaining to engineering.  The following are six of several observations made throughout the book.&lt;ref&gt;Note: there are many other epistemological observations made throughout the book including a high density of them in Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  These observations do not constitute an "engineering method" per se but offer a [[conjecture]] that they may point the way for further research.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|160–161}}  He wrote, "in the final paragraph of chapter 5, I also raised the question of whether it might be profitable to look for "engineering method" analogous to but distinguishable from scientific method that has been a fruitful concern for the history of science.  Could it be that the variation-selection process outlined here is that method, with its distinctive features lying in the criterion of selection and the vicarious methods used to shortcut direct trial?"&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|256}}

First, there is a pattern to the iterative engineering discovery process seen in the development of flying-quality specifications.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|102}}  This process is referred to as "Seven Interactive Elements of Engineering Learning" and includes:

# '''Familiarization with''' vehicle and recognition of '''problem'''.
# '''Identification of''' basic variables and derivation of analytical concepts and '''criteria'''.
# '''Development of''' instruments/piloting techniques for in-flight '''measurements'''.
# '''Growth''' and refinement '''of''' pilot '''opinion''' regarding desirable flying qualities.
# Combine results from 2-4 into a deliberate '''scheme for''' flying-quality '''research'''.
# '''Measurement of''' relevant flight '''characteristics''' for a cross section of aircraft.
# '''Assessment of results''' and data on flight characteristics in light of pilot opinion to arrive at general specifications.

The boldface from the original text isolates the steps in a subject-neutral manner.

=== Six Categories of Engineering Knowledge ===
Second, there is a pattern in the very categories of knowledge in engineering.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|208}}
These six categories of engineering knowledge are:
# Fundamental design concepts
# Criteria and specifications 
# Theoretical tools
# Quantitative data
# Practical considerations
# Design instrumentalities

=== Seven Knowledge-Generating Activities===
Third, Walter Vincenti sees a pattern in knowledge/science generating activities of engineering.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|229}}
These seven Knowledge-Generating Activities include:
# Transfer from science
# Invention
# Theoretical engineering research
# Experimental engineering research
# Design practice
# Production
# Direct Trial

=== Relationship Between Categories and Activities ===
Fourth, by placing six categories of knowledge and the seven knowledge-generating activities on an x-y table, these knowledge generating activities cut across the categories of knowledge in a partially predictable way.  The resulting table serves as an approximation for what engineering tasks may be likely to produce new engineering knowledge.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|235, Table 7-1}}  The resulting diagram "is intended for discussion more than a set of hard and fast divisions."&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|225}}

=== Engineering Knowledge Classification ===
Fifth, he re-classifies engineering knowledge itself.  Knowledge generated by engineering may normally be categorized by phases such as design, production or operations.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|195}}  Another way to think about engineering knowledge categories is [[descriptive knowledge]], prescriptive knowledge and [[tacit knowledge]].&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|198}}  He adds Gilbert Ryle's terms "knowing that" and "knowing how"&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|13}} to illustrate the aim of each knowledge category.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|198}}  "Knowing what or that" to do in engineering is a mixture of descriptive and prescriptive knowledge.  "Knowing how" to do it is a mixture of prescriptive and tacit knowledge.  Thus, these case studies show the need for all three kinds of knowledge in engineering.

=== Variation-Selection Model of Technological Innovation ===
Finally, he posits a variation-selection model for knowledge growth.  At all levels of design hierarchy, growth of knowledge acts to increase the complexity and power of the variation-selection process by modifying both the mechanism for variation and expanding the processes of selection vicariously.  Variation and selection each add two realistic principles for the advancement of technology: ''blindness'' to variation and ''unsureness'' of selection.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|249}}

Vincenti concludes that our blindness to the vast potential in variations of design does not imply a random or unpremeditated search.  A blind person in an unfamiliar alleyway uses a cane to provide information to explore the constraints in an intentional way without having any idea where the alleyway leads.  Likewise, engineers proceed in design “blindly” in the sense that “the outcome is not completely foreseeable” thus the “best” potential variations are in some degree invisible.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|243}}  As a result, finding high functioning designs is not the norm.  He notes, “from the outside or in retrospect, the entire process tends to seem more ordered and intentional—less blind—than it usually is.”&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|246}}

However, Vincenti uses the differences between the Wright brothers and the French to show there is a range in how we manage blindness to variations.  The Wright brothers designed a flying machine before the French even though they started experimenting at roughly the same time.  The French 1) appealed to what little was known about the Wrights/Langley, 2) mental imaginings of what might succeed, and 3) guidance from growing flight experience.  But “since [#1 and #3] were meager, however, the level of blindness, at least at first, was well nigh total.”&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|244}}

What was the difference in the process between the Wrights and the French?

The French trial and error process had less theoretical analysis (or new engineering knowledge).  Since, “the French were not inclined toward theoretical analysis, variations could be selected for retention and refinement only by trails in flight.”&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|244 [emphasis added]}}  For the Wrights, advancement of basic principles in theory via analysis lent to precise shortcuts to direct trials making the French process appear more exploratory in retrospect.  Thus, the process of selection is aided by 1) theoretical analysis and 2) experiments (in, say, wind tunnels) in place of direct trial of actual (“overt”) versions in the environment.   The growth in knowledge increases the power of vicarious trials in place of actual/direct trials.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|247}}

====Uncertainty In the Variation-Selection Process (blindness in variation and unsureness in selection)====

In the long term, “the entire variation-selection process—variation and selection together—is filled with uncertainty.”  The level of uncertainty is affected by two things.  First, “uncertainty comes from the degree of blindness in the variations.”&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|248}}  Uncertainty in the whole process decreases as technology matures—he notes that aircraft designers of today operate with more “sure-footedness” than the French of the early 1900s or even his era working at NACA.   Yet, there is a paradox in decreasing blindness.  While blindness decreases over time, advances simultaneously become more difficult to come by and more sophisticated… which in turn increases blindness!  Thus the temptation to see a net decrease in blindesss “stems from an illusion.”  The variation-selection process can create as much blindness as it reduces; just ask “talented engineers who struggle to advance a mature technology like present-day aeronautics…”&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|249}}

The second factor on uncertainty in the whole variation-selection model is “unsureness” in the process of selection.  Both vicarious and overt trials suffer from unsureness which adds complication to the variation selection model.  But unlike blindness in variation, unsureness in selection decreases with the precision in both kinds of trials.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|249}}

Blindness and unsureness characterize the difficult or arduous nature of technology evolution in the variation-selection model.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|248–249}}  The author then reviews the five case studies retrospectively to demonstrate how variation-selection and blindness-unsureness were at work in each case.&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|250–252}}  In total, "the cumulative growth of engineering knowledge as the result of individual variation-selection processes acts to change the nature of how those processes are carried out."&lt;ref name="vincenti"/&gt;{{rp|245}}
