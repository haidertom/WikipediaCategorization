      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">The '''American Bryological and Lichenological Society''' is an organization devoted to the scientific study of all aspects of the [[biology]] of [[bryophytes]] and [[lichen]]-forming [[fungi]] and is one of the nation's oldest botanical organizations. It was originally known as the '''Sullivant Moss Society''', named after [[William Starling Sullivant]]. The Society publishes a quarterly journal distributed worldwide, ''[[The Bryologist]]'', which includes articles on all aspects of the biology of [[mosses]], [[hornworts]], [[liverworts]] and lichens.

==History==
The Society was founded in 1898, and was first known as the Sullivant Moss Chapter. It was founded by [[Elizabeth Gertrude Britton]] and [[Abel Joel Grout]].  [[Carolyn Wilson Harris]] was vice president of the Society during 1904–1905 and charge of the Lichen Department from 1901–1905.

[[Annie Morrill Smith]] was a central figure in the organization in the early years, contributing much time, energy, and money. She was editor or associate editor of ''[[The Bryologist]]'' for ten years, and changed the name to the Sullivant Moss ''Society''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5944">'''American political development''' (often abbreviated as '''APD''') is a subfield of [[political science]] that studies the historical development of [[politics in the United States]]. In American political science departments, it is considered a subfield within [[American political science|American politics]] and is closely linked to [[historical institutionalism]].

Scholarship in American political development focuses on "the causes, nature, and consequences of key transformative periods and central patterns in American political history."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersh|first=Rogan|date=2005-01-01|title=The Growth of American Political Development: The View from the Classroom|jstor=3688034|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=3|issue=2|pages=335–345|doi=10.1017/s1537592705050243}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Orren]] and [[Stephen Skowronek]], co-founders of the subfield's [[Studies in American Political Development|flagship journal]], define American political development as the study of "durable shifts in governing authority" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Search-American-Political-Development/dp/0521547644|title=The Search for American Political Development|date=2004-05-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521547642|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subfield emerged within [[American political science]] in the 1980s, alongside a general renewal of work in [[historical institutionalism]], as an "insurgent movement" that sought to refocus attention on the study of historical American politics and to use such historical study to recast the study of contemporary political phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697915-e-21|chapter=Distinctiveness and Necessity of American Political Development |title=Oxford Handbook of American Political Development| editors=Richard M.

APD shares overlaps with the research agendas of [[comparative politics]] (particularly [[Comparative historical research|comparative historical analysis]]), [[historical sociology]], and [[political history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polisci.northwestern.edu/research/department-strengths/american-political-development.html|title=American Political Development: Department of Political Science - Northwestern University|website=www.polisci.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholarship in APD differs from political history in that the former's "primary concerns are analytical, conceptual, and theoretical rather than historical."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697915-e-36|title=Qualitative Methods and American Political Development|last=Galvin|first=Daniel J.|date=2015-07-09|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.013.36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodologically, the subfield tends to use within-case analysis and conduct causes-of-effects research (as opposed to effects-of-causes research).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Major journals in the subfield include the flagship journal ''[[Studies in American Political Development]]'', founded in 1986, and ''The Journal of Political History'', founded in 1989. As of 2005, the Politics and History section (founded in 1989) of the [[American Political Science Association]] was the eighth-largest in membership out of 35 total sections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/section24|title= MEMBERSHIP &gt; Organized Sections by Title &gt; Politics and History (Section 24)|website=American Political Science Association|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[molecular biology]], an '''amplicon''' is a piece of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that is the source and/or product of [[amplification (molecular biology)|amplification]] or [[DNA replication|replication]] events. It can be formed artificially, using various methods including [[polymerase chain reaction]]s (PCR) or [[ligase chain reaction]]s (LCR), or naturally through [[gene duplication]]. In this context, ''amplification'' refers to the production of one or more copies of a genetic fragment or target sequence, specifically the amplicon. As it refers to the product of an amplification reaction, ''amplicon'' is used interchangeably with common laboratory terms, such as "PCR product."

Artificial amplification is used in [[research]],&lt;ref name=Meyers&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Meyers |editor1-first=Robert A. |title=Molecular Biology and Biotechnology: A Comprehensive Desk Reference |year=1995 |publisher=VCH Publishers |location=New York, NY |isbn=1-56081-925-1 |pages=53, 585}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forensic science|forensics]],&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1867860 |year=1991 |last1=Walsh |first1=PS |last2=Metzger |first2=DA |last3=Higuchi |first3=R |title=Chelex 100 as a medium for simple extraction of DNA for PCR-based typing from forensic material |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=506–13 |journal=BioTechniques}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[medicine]]&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt; for purposes that include detection and quantification of [[Infectious disease|infectious agents]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Consumer Affairs Branch |url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/BloodBloodProducts/ApprovedProducts/PremarketApprovalsPMAs/ucm091626.htm |title=Roche Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test |publisher=FDA |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; identification of human remains,&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng0294-130 |title=Identification of the remains of the Romanov family by DNA analysis |year=1994 |last1=Gill |first1=Peter |last2=Ivanov |first2=Pavel L. |last3=Kimpton |first3=Colin |last4=Piercy |first4=Romelle |last5=Benson |first5=Nicola |last6=Tully |first6=Gillian |last7=Evett |first7=Ian |last8=Hagelberg |first8=Erika |last9=Sullivan |first9=Kevin |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=130–5 |pmid=8162066}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extracting [[genotypes]] from human hair.&lt;ref name=Walsh /&gt;

Natural [[gene duplication]] plays a major role in [[evolution]].

Amplification of the genes encoded by these amplicons generally increases [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of those genes and ultimately the volume of associated [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name=Bignell&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1101/gr.6522707 |title=Architectures of somatic genomic rearrangement in human cancer amplicons at sequence-level resolution |year=2007 |last1=Bignell |first1=G.

==Structure==
Amplicons in general are [[direct repeat]] (head-to-tail) or [[inverted repeat]] (head-to-head or tail-to-tail) genetic sequences, and can be either linear or circular in structure.&lt;ref name=Cohn&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cohn|editor1-first=Waldo E. |editor2-last=Moldave |editor2-first=Kivie |title=Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology |year=1996 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-540054-1 |pages=280–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circular amplicons consist of imperfect inverted duplications [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics#Annealing|annealed]] into a circle&lt;ref name=Grondin&gt;{{cite journal |year=1996 |last1=Grodin |first1=K |last2=Roy |first2=G |last3=Ouellette |first3=M |title= Formation of extrachromosomal circular amplicons with direct or inverted duplications in drug-resistant Leishmania tarentolae. |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=3587–3595 |journal=Mol. Cell. Biol. |pmc=231354 |pmid=8668175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are thought to arise from precursor linear amplicons.&lt;ref name=Grondin2&gt;{{cite journal |year=1998 |last1=Grodin |first1=K |last2=Küding |first2=C |last3=Roy |first3=G |last4=Ouellette |first4=M |title= Linear amplicons as precursors of amplified circles in methotrexate-resistant Leishmania tarentolae. |volume=26|issue=14 |pages=3372–3378|journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |pmc=147699 |pmid=9649621 |doi=10.1093/nar/26.14.3372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During artificial amplification, amplicon length is dictated by the experimental goals.&lt;ref&gt;PCR Primer Design Guidelines. Premier Biosoft: Accelerating Research in Life Sciences. Retrieved from: http://www.premierbiosoft.com/tech_notes/PCR_Primer_Design.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

Analysis of amplicons has been made possible by the development of amplification methods such as [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], and increasingly by cheaper and more [[High-throughput screening|high-throughput]] technologies for [[DNA sequencing]] or [[DNA sequencing#Next-generation methods|next-generation sequencing]], such as [[ion semiconductor sequencing]], popularly referred to as the brand of the developer, Ion Torrent.&lt;ref name="ion torrent"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iontorrent.com/ |title=Ion Torrent Official Webpage |access-date=2018-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106192756/http://www.iontorrent.com/ |archive-date=2012-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA sequencing technologies such as next-generation sequencing have made it possible to study amplicons in [[Genome Biology|genome biology]] and [[genetics]], including [[Genetics of cancer|cancer genetics]] research,&lt;ref name="International Cancer Genome Consortium"&gt;[http://icgc.org International Cancer Genome Consortium Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] research, and [[human genetics]].&lt;ref name="National Human Genome Research Institute Official Website"&gt;[http://www.genome.gov National Human Genome Research Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, using the [[16S rRNA]] gene, which is part of every bacterial and archaeal genome and is highly conserved, bacteria can be taxonomically classified by comparison of the amplicon sequence to known sequences. This works similarly in the fungal domain with the [[18S rRNA]] gene.

Irrespective of the approach used to amplify the amplicons, some technique must be used to quantitate the amplified product.&lt;ref name="Stanley"&gt;Stanley, J. (2002). Essentials of Immunology &amp; Serology by Jacqueline Stanley. Albany, NY: Delmar.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, these techniques incorporate a capture step and a detection step, although how these steps are incorporated depends on the individual [[assay]].

Examples include the Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Assay ([[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|RT-PCR]]), which has the capacity to recognize [[HIV]] in [[Blood plasma|plasma]]; the HIV-1 QT ([[NASBA (molecular biology)|NASBA]]), which is used to measure plasma [[viral load]] by amplifying a segment of the HIV RNA; and Transcription Mediated Amplification, which employs a hybridization protection assay to distinguish ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' infections.&lt;ref name="Stanley"/&gt; Various detection and capture steps are involved in each approach to assess the amplification product, or amplicon. With amplicon sequencing the high number of different amplicons resulting from amplification of a usual sample are concatenated and sequenced. After quality control classification is done by different methods, the counts of identical taxa representing their relative abundance in the sample.

==Applications==

PCR can be used to determine sex from a human DNA sample.&lt;ref name=Mannucci&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01371335 |title=Forensic application of a rapid and quantitative DNA sex test by amplification of the X-Y homologous gene amelogenin |year=1994 |last1=Mannucci |first1=Armando |last2=Sullivan |first2=Kevin M. |last3=Ivanov |first3=Pavel L. |last4=Gill |first4=Peter |journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=190–3 |pmid=8038111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[locus (genetics)|loci]] of [[Alu element]] insertion is selected, amplified and evaluated in terms of size of the fragment. The sex assay utilizes AluSTXa for the [[X chromosome]], AluSTYa for the [[Y chromosome]], or both AluSTXa and AluSTYa, to reduce the possibility of error to a negligible quantity. The inserted chromosome yields a large fragment when the [[Homologous chromosome|homologous region]] is amplified. The males are distinguished as having two DNA amplicons present, while females have only a single amplicon. The kit adapted for carrying out the method includes a pair of primers to amplify the locus and optionally polymerase chain reaction reagents.&lt;ref name=Hedges&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0003-2697(02)00430-X |title=Mobile element-based assay for human gender determination |year=2003 |last1=Hedges |first1=Dale J |last2=Walker |first2=Jerilyn A |last3=Callinan |first3=Pauline A |last4=Shewale |first4=Jaiprakash G |last5=Sinha |first5=Sudhir K |last6=Batzer |first6=Mark A |journal=Analytical Biochemistry |volume=312 |pages=77–9 |pmid=12479838 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LCR can be used to diagnose [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=T M|title=The ligase chain reaction as a primary screening tool for the detection of culture positive tuberculosis|journal=Thorax|date=1 November 2000|volume=55|issue=11|pages=955–957|doi=10.1136/thorax.55.11.955|pmid=11050266|pmc=1745641}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence containing protein [[antigen]] B is targeted by four [[oligonucleotide]] [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]]—two for the [[sense strand]], and two for the [[Sense (molecular biology)#Antisense DNA|antisense strand]]. The primers bind adjacent to one another, forming a segment of double stranded DNA that once separated, can serve as a target for future rounds of replication. In this instance, the product can be detected via the [[Enzyme immunoassay|microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA)]].

'''Anna Hornby''', N.E.A.C (1914–1996) was an English painter, [[calligrapher]] and member of the [[New English Art Club]].&lt;ref name="Who 1986"&gt;Who's Who in Art (Twenty-Second Edition, Art Trade Press 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

Anna Hornby was born on 6 April 1914 and educated at the independent [[Westonbirt School]], Gloucestershire.&lt;ref name="Who 1986"/&gt; She went on to study art in [[Florence]] with landscape and flower painter Aubrey Waterfield in 1934, and later that year enrolled at the [[Byam Shaw School of Art]] in London where she studied under [[Francis Ernest Jackson]], graduating in 1940.&lt;ref name="Who 1986"/&gt;

Apart from painting, Calligraphy was Anna's other great passion - in 1952 she was appointed Honorary Secretary of the Society for Italic Handwriting, a post she held until 1962. Through her interest in calligraphy and her association with the Society, she became acquainted with [[Alfred John Fairbank]], whose portrait Anna painted (exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1961).&lt;ref name="archiveshub.ac.uk"&gt;{{Cite web

Anna was also a member of the Art Works’ Guild and was elected member of the [[New English Art Club]] in 1971. She exhibited widely with no fewer than 13 pictures at the Royal Academy, additionally she exhibited at the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolours, The Royal Society of Portrait Painters and the Royal Society of British Artists.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Academy Exhibitors 1905-1970, Vol I (EP Publishing LTD, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna Hornby died in 1996, bequeathing paintings by Peter Greenham and Francis Ernest Jackson to the [[Ashmolean]] Museum of Art, Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Harrison, Catherine Casley, Jon Whiteley

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1827">'''Aphelia''' (Greek, "plainness") is a rhetorical term that refers to the plainness of writing or speech.&lt;ref&gt;Lanham, Richard A. ''A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms''. 2nd ed. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991. 17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to explain or teach rather than to entertain or elicit an emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Brett. "A Catalogue of Rhetorical and Other Literary Terms from American Literature and Oratory." ''Style'' 22 Dec. 1997: n. pag. Web. 29 Sep. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The sentence structure is typically both short in length and lacks "poetic and rhetorical adornment." &lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Brett. ''Edgar Allan Poe: Rhetoric and Style''. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2005. 139. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parataxis]] and [[asyndeton]] are also expected within the plain style. Writing or speech using aphelia may display a "right-branching" sentence structure for the most part; that is, the sentence will begin with an [[independent clause]] that will be followed by at least one [[dependent clause]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Brett. ''Edgar Allan Poe: Rhetoric and Style''. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2005. 138. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*"In plain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar." — [[Herman Melville]], [[Moby-Dick]]
*"I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, but chuckled at heart." — [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[The Tell-Tale Heart]]
*"She presented all of the ordinary appearances of death. The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The lips were of usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless. There was no warmth. Pulsation had ceased." — [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[The Premature Burial]]

'''Autonomic computing''' (also known as '''AC''') refers to the [[Self-management (computer science)|self-managing]] characteristics of [[distributed computing]] resources, adapting to unpredictable changes while hiding intrinsic complexity to operators and users. Initiated by [[IBM]] in 2001, this initiative ultimately aimed to develop computer systems capable of self-management, to overcome the rapidly growing complexity of computing [[systems management]], and to reduce the barrier that complexity poses to further growth.&lt;ref name="Kephart"&gt;{{Citation|doi=10.1109/MC.2003.1160055|title=The vision of autonomic computing|year=2003|last1=Kephart|first1=J.O.|last2=Chess|first2=D.M.|journal=Computer|volume=36|pages=41–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The AC system concept is designed to make adaptive decisions, using high-level policies. It will constantly check and optimize its status and automatically adapt itself to changing conditions.  An autonomic computing framework is composed of autonomic [[Software component|component]]s (AC) interacting with each other. An AC can be modeled in terms of two main control schemes (local and global) with [[sensor]]s (for [[self-monitoring]]), [[Actuator|effectors]] (for self-adjustment), knowledge and planner/adapter for exploiting policies based on self- and environment awareness. This architecture is sometimes referred to as Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute (MAPE).

Driven by such vision, a variety of architectural frameworks based on "[[homoeostasis|self-regulating]]" autonomic components has been recently proposed. A very similar trend has recently characterized significant research in the area of [[multi-agent system]]s. However, most of these approaches are typically conceived with centralized or cluster-based server architectures in mind and mostly address the need of reducing management costs rather than the need of enabling complex software systems or providing innovative services. Some [[#Autonomic systems|autonomic systems]] involve mobile agents interacting via loosely coupled communication mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Padovitz|first=Amir|author2=Arkady Zaslavsky|author3= Seng W. Loke|title=Awareness and Agility for Autonomic Distributed Systems: Platform-Independent Publish-Subscribe Event-Based Communication for Mobile Agents|journal=Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA'03)|year=2003|pages=669–673|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/dexa/2003/1993/00/19930669-abs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Autonomy-oriented computation'' is a paradigm proposed by Jiming Liu in 2001 that uses artificial systems imitating [[social animals]]' collective behaviours to solve difficult computational problems. For example, [[ant colony optimization]] could be studied in this paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-25928-2_13|isbn= 978-3-540-22477-8|chapter=From Individual Based Modeling to Autonomy Oriented Computation|title=Agents and Computational Autonomy|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2004|last1=Jin|first1=Xiaolong|last2=Liu|first2=Jiming|volume=2969|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problem of growing complexity ==
Forecasts suggest that the  computing devices in use will grow at 38% per year&lt;ref name="IBM1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Horn |title=Autonomic Computing:IBM’s Perspective on the State of Information Technology |url=http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/manifesto/autonomic_computing.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916160342/http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/manifesto/autonomic_computing.pdf |archivedate=September 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the average complexity of each device is increasing.&lt;ref name="IBM1"/&gt; Currently, this volume and complexity is managed by highly skilled humans; but the demand for skilled IT personnel is already outstripping supply, with labour costs exceeding equipment costs by a ratio of up to 18:1.&lt;ref&gt;‘Trends in technology’, survey, Berkeley University of California, USA, March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Computing systems have brought great benefits of speed and automation but there is now an overwhelming economic need to automate their maintenance.

In a 2003 [[IEEE]] ''[[Computer Magazine]]'' article, Kephart and Chess &lt;ref name="Kephart"/&gt;
warn that the dream of interconnectivity of computing systems and devices could become the “nightmare of [[pervasive computing]]” in which architects are unable to anticipate, design and maintain the [[complexity]] of interactions. They state the essence of autonomic computing is system self-management, freeing administrators from low-level task management while delivering better system behavior.

A general problem of modern [[Distributed systems|distributed computing systems]] is that their [[complexity]], and in particular the complexity of their management, is becoming a significant limiting factor in their further development. Large companies and institutions are employing large-scale [[computer network]]s for communication and computation. The distributed applications running on these computer networks are diverse and deal with many tasks, ranging from internal control processes to presenting web content to customer support.

Additionally, [[mobile computing]] is pervading these networks at an increasing speed: employees need to communicate with their companies while they are not in their office. They do so by using [[laptop]]s, [[personal digital assistant]]s, or [[mobile phones]] with diverse forms of [[wireless]] technologies to access their companies' data.

This creates an enormous complexity in the overall computer network which is hard to control manually by human operators. Manual control is time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. The manual effort needed to control a growing networked computer-system tends to increase very quickly.

80% of such problems in infrastructure happen at the client specific application and database layer.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Most 'autonomic' service providers{{Who|date=July 2010}} guarantee only up to the basic plumbing layer (power, hardware, operating system, network and basic database parameters).

== Characteristics of autonomic systems ==

A possible solution could be to enable modern, networked computing systems to manage themselves without direct human intervention. The ''Autonomic Computing Initiative'' (ACI) aims at providing the foundation for autonomic systems. It is inspired by the [[autonomic nervous system]] of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/autonomic-computing&lt;/ref&gt; This nervous system controls important bodily functions (e.g. respiration, [[heart rate]], and [[blood pressure]]) without any conscious intervention.

In a [[Self-management (computer science)|self-managing]] autonomic system, the human operator takes on a new role: instead of controlling the system directly, he/she defines general policies and rules that guide the self-management process. For this process, IBM defined the following four types of property referred to as self-star (also called self-*, self-x, or auto-*) properties.

#[[Self-organization]]: System structure driven by physics-type models without explicit pressure or involvement from outside the system;
#Self-creation (also called [[Self-assembly]], [[Self-replication]]): System driven by ecological and social type models without explicit pressure or involvement from outside the system. A system’s members are self-motivated and self-driven, generating complexity and order in a creative response to a continuously changing strategic demand;
#Self-management (also called self-governance): A system that manages itself without external intervention. What is being managed can vary dependent on the system and application. Self -management also refers to a set of self-star processes such as autonomic computing rather than a single self-star process;
#Self-description (also called self-explanation or Self-representation): A system explains itself. It is capable of being understood (by humans) without further explanation. {{see also|Reflection (computer programming)}}

IBM has set forth eight conditions that define an autonomic system:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/autonomic_computing.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The system must
# know itself in terms of what resources it has access to, what its capabilities and limitations are and how and why it is connected to other systems;
# be able to automatically configure and reconfigure itself depending on the changing computing environment;
# be able to optimize its performance to ensure the most efficient computing process;
# be able to work around encountered problems by either repairing itself or routing functions away from the trouble;
# detect, identify and protect itself against various types of attacks to maintain overall system security and integrity;
# adapt to its environment as it changes, interacting with neighboring systems and establishing communication protocols;
# rely on open standards and cannot exist in a proprietary environment;
# anticipate the demand on its resources while staying transparent to users.

Even though the purpose and thus the behaviour of autonomic systems vary from system to system, every autonomic system should be able to exhibit a minimum set of properties to achieve its purpose:

#[[Automaticity|Automatic]]: This essentially means being able to self-control its internal functions and operations. As such, an autonomic system must be self-contained and able to start-up and operate without any manual intervention or external help. Again, the knowledge required to bootstrap the system (''Know-how'') must be inherent to the system.
#[[Adaptive]]: An autonomic system must be able to change its operation (i.e., its configuration, state and functions). This will allow the system to cope with temporal and spatial changes in its operational context either long term (environment customisation/optimisation) or short term (exceptional conditions such as malicious attacks, faults, etc.).
#[[Awareness|Aware]]: An autonomic system must be able to monitor (sense) its operational context as well as its internal state in order to be able to assess if its current operation serves its purpose. Awareness will control adaptation of its operational behaviour in response to context or state changes.

==Evolutionary levels==
IBM defined five evolutionary levels, or the ''autonomic deployment model'', for the deployment of autonomic systems:
*Level 1 is the basic level that presents the current situation where systems are essentially managed manually.
*Levels 2 - 4 introduce increasingly automated management functions, while
*level 5 represents the ultimate goal of autonomic, self-managing systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/464.wss&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design patterns==
The design complexity of Autonomic Systems can be simplified by utilizing [[design patterns]] such as the [[model-view-controller]] (MVC) pattern to improve [[separation of concerns|concern separation]] by [[encapsulation (computer programming)|encapsulating]] functional concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|doi=10.1109/MS.2008.60|title=Flexible Self-Management Using the Model-View-Controller Pattern|year=2008|last1=Curry|first1=Edward|last2=Grace|first2=Paul|journal=IEEE Software|volume=25|issue=3|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Control loops ==

A basic concept that will be applied in Autonomic Systems are [[closed control loop]]s. This well-known concept stems from [[Process Control]] Theory. Essentially, a closed control loop in a self-managing system monitors some resource (software or hardware component) and autonomously tries to keep its parameters within a desired range.

According to IBM, hundreds or even thousands of these control loops are expected to work in a large-scale self-managing computer system.

== Conceptual model ==
[[Image:AutonomicSystemModel.png|right|300px]]
A fundamental building block of an autonomic system is the sensing capability (''Sensors S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), which enables the system to observe its external operational context. Inherent to an autonomic system is the knowledge of the ''Purpose'' (intention) and the ''Know-how'' to operate itself (e.g., [[Bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrapping]], configuration knowledge, interpretation of sensory data, etc.) without external intervention. The actual operation of the autonomic system is dictated by the ''Logic'', which is responsible for making the right decisions to serve its ''Purpose'', and influence by the observation of the operational context (based on the sensor input).

This model highlights the fact that the operation of an autonomic system is purpose-driven. This includes its mission (e.g., the service it is supposed to offer), the policies (e.g., that define the basic behaviour), and the “[[survival instinct]]”. If seen as a control system this would be encoded as a feedback error function or in a heuristically assisted system as an algorithm combined with set of [[heuristic]]s bounding its operational space.

'''Bioenergetics''' is a field in [[biochemistry]] and [[cell biology]] that concerns [[energy]] flow through living systems.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 24. &lt;/ref&gt; This is an active area of [[Biology|biological]] research that includes the study of the transformation of energy in living organisms and the study of thousands of different [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] processes such as [[cellular respiration]] and the many other [[metabolism|metabolic]] and [[Enzyme|enzymatic]] processes that lead to production and utilization of energy in forms such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) molecules.&lt;ref&gt; Green, D.E., Vande Zande, H.A (1981). Universal energy principle of biological systems and the unity of bioenergetics. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.,'' '''78''' 9: 5344- 5347. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC348741/pdf/pnas00660-0107.pdf Accessed 9 April 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 27. &lt;/ref&gt; That is, the goal of bioenergetics is to describe how living organisms acquire and transform energy in order to perform biological work.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 24. &lt;/ref&gt; The study of [[metabolic network|metabolic pathways]] is thus essential to bioenergetics.

==Overview==

Bioenergetics is the part of biochemistry concerned with the energy involved in making and breaking of chemical bonds in the [[molecules]] found in biological [[organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrick D.A., Neilson A., Beeson C (2008). Advances in measuring cellular bioenergetics using extracellular flux. ''Drug Discovery Today,'' '''13''' 5 &amp; 6: 268- 274. http://www.wklab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Advances-in-measuring-cellular-bioenergetics-using-extracellular-flux-Drug-Discovery-Today-2008.pdf Accessed 9 April 2017. &lt;/ref&gt; It can also be defined as the study of energy relationships and energy transformations and transductions in living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 506. &lt;/ref&gt; The ability to harness energy from a variety of metabolic pathways is a property of all living organisms. [[Cell growth|Growth]], [[Developmental biology|development]], [[anabolism]] and [[catabolism]] are some of the central processes in the study of biological organisms, because the role of energy is fundamental to such [[biological process]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 28. &lt;/ref&gt; [[Life]] is dependent on [[energy transformation]]s; living organisms survive because of exchange of energy between living tissues/ cells and the outside environment. Some organisms, such as [[autotrophs]], can acquire energy from sunlight (through [[photosynthesis]]) without needing to consume nutrients and break them down.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 22. &lt;/ref&gt; Other organisms, like [[heterotrophs]], must intake nutrients from food to be able to sustain energy by breaking down chemical bonds in nutrients during metabolic processes such as [[glycolysis]] and [[Citric acid cycle|the citric acid cycle]]. Importantly, as a direct consequence of the [[First Law of Thermodynamics]], autotrophs and heterotrophs participate in a universal metabolic network—by eating autotrophs (plants), heterotrophs harness energy that was initially transformed by the plants during [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pgs. 22, 506. &lt;/ref&gt;

In a living organism, [[chemical bond]]s are broken and made as part of the exchange and transformation of energy. Energy is available for work (such as mechanical work) or for other processes (such as chemical synthesis and [[anabolism|anabolic]] processes in growth), when weak bonds are broken and stronger bonds are made. The production of stronger bonds allows release of usable energy.

Adenosine triphosphate ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]) is the main "energy currency" for organisms; the goal of metabolic and catabolic processes are to synthesize ATP from available starting materials (from the environment), and to break- down ATP (into adenosine diphosphate ([[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]) and inorganic phosphate) by utilizing it in biological processes.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 24. &lt;/ref&gt; In a cell, the ratio of ATP to ADP concentrations is known as the "[[energy charge]]" of the cell.  A cell can use this energy charge to relay information about cellular needs; if there is more ATP than ADP available, the cell can use ATP to do work, but if there is more ADP than ATP available, the cell must synthesize ATP via oxidative phosphorylation.&lt;ref&gt; Ferrick D.A., Neilson A., Beeson C (2008). Advances in measuring cellular bioenergetics using extracellular flux. ''Drug Discovery Today,'' '''13''' 5 &amp; 6: 268- 274. http://www.wklab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Advances-in-measuring-cellular-bioenergetics-using-extracellular-flux-Drug-Discovery-Today-2008.pdf Accessed 9 April 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;

Living organisms produce ATP from energy sources via [[oxidative phosphorylation]].  The terminal phosphate bonds of ATP are relatively weak compared with the stronger bonds formed when ATP is [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] (broken down by water) to adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate. Here it is the thermodynamically favorable free energy of hydrolysis that results in energy release; the phosphoanhydride bond between the terminal phosphate group and the rest of the ATP molecule does not itself contain this energy.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 522- 523. &lt;/ref&gt; An organism's stockpile of ATP is used as a battery to store energy in cells.&lt;ref&gt; Hardie, D.G., Ross, F.A., Hawley, S.A (2012). AMPK: a nutrient and energy sensor that maintains energy homeostasis. ''Nature,'' '''13''' 251- 262. http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v13/n4/pdf/nrm3311.pdf Accessed 9 April 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;  Utilization of chemical energy from such molecular bond rearrangement powers biological processes in every biological organism.

Living organisms obtain energy from organic and inorganic materials; i.e. ATP can be synthesized from a variety of biochemical precursors.  For example, [[lithotroph]]s can oxidize minerals such as [[nitrate]]s or forms of [[sulfur]], such as elemental sulfur, [[sulfite]]s, and [[hydrogen sulfide]] to produce ATP.  In [[photosynthesis]], [[autotroph]]s produce ATP using light energy, whereas [[Heterotroph|heterotrophs]] must consume organic compounds, mostly including [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, and [[protein]]s.  The amount of energy actually obtained by the organism is lower than the [[Food energy|amount present in the food]]; there are losses in digestion, metabolism, and [[thermogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/Y5022E/y5022e04.htm FAO, Calculation of the Energy Content of Foods—Energy Conversion Factors]&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental materials that an organism intakes are generally combined with [[oxygen]] to release energy, although some can also be oxidized anaerobically by various organisms.  The bonds holding the molecules of [[nutrient]]s together and in particular the bonds holding molecules of free oxygen together are relatively weak compared with the chemical bonds holding carbon dioxide and water together.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schmidt-Rohr K | year = 2015 | title = Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | doi = 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | volume = 92 | issue = 12| pages = 2094–2099 | bibcode = 2015JChEd..92.2094S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The utilization of these materials is a form of slow [[combustion]] because the nutrients are reacted with oxygen (the materials are oxidized slowly enough that the organisms do not actually produce fire). The oxidation releases energy because stronger bonds (bonds within water and carbon dioxide) have been formed.  This net energy may evolve as heat, which may be used by the organism for other purposes, such as breaking other bonds to do chemistry required for survival.

==Types of reactions==

* An '''exergonic''' reaction is a spontaneous chemical reaction that releases energy.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 24. &lt;/ref&gt; It is thermodynamically favored, indexed by a negative value of ΔG ([[Gibbs free energy]]). Over the course of a reaction, energy needs to be put in, and this activation energy drives the reactants from a stable state to a highly energetically unstable transition state to a more stable state that is lower in energy (see: [[reaction coordinate]]). The reactants are usually complex molecules that are broken into simpler products. The entire reaction is usually [[Catabolism|catabolic]].&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 502. &lt;/ref&gt; The release of energy (called Gibbs free energy) is negative (i.e. −ΔG) because energy is released from the reactants to the products.
* An '''endergonic''' reaction is an anabolic chemical reaction that consumes energy.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 27. &lt;/ref&gt; It is the opposite of an exergonic reaction. It has a positive ΔG because it takes more energy to break the bonds of the reactant than the energy of the products offer, i.e. the products have weaker bonds than the reactants. Thus, endergonic reactions are thermodynamically unfavorable. Additionally, endergonic reactions are usually [[Anabolism|anabolic]].&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 503. &lt;/ref&gt;

The free energy (ΔG) gained or lost in a reaction can be calculated as follows: ΔG = ΔH − TΔS
where ∆G = [[Gibbs free energy]], ∆H = [[enthalpy]], T = temperature (in [[kelvin]]s), and ∆S = [[entropy]].&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 23. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of major bioenergetic processes==

*[[Glycolysis]] is the process of breaking down glucose into [[pyruvate]], producing two molecules of ATP (per 1 molecule of glucose) in the process.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 544. &lt;/ref&gt; When a cell has a higher concentration of ATP than ADP (i.e. has a high [[energy charge]]), the cell can undergo glycolysis, releasing energy from available glucose to perform biological work. Pyruvate is one product of glycolysis, and can be shuttled into other metabolic pathways (gluconeogenesis, etc.) as needed by the cell. Additionally, glycolysis produces [[reducing equivalents]] in the form of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]] (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), which will ultimately be used to donate electrons to the [[Electron Transport Chain|electron transport chain]].

*[[Gluconeogenesis]] is the opposite of glycolysis; when the cell's energy charge is low (the concentration of ADP is higher than that of ATP), the cell must synthesize glucose from carbon- containing biomolecules such as proteins, amino acids, fats, pyruvate, etc.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 568. &lt;/ref&gt; For example, proteins can be broken down into amino acids, and these simpler carbon skeletons are used to build/ synthesize glucose. 

*[[Citric acid cycle|The citric acid cycle]] is a process of [[cellular respiration]] in which [[Acetyl-CoA|acetyl coenzyme A]], synthesized from [[Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex|pyruvate dehydrogenase]], is first reacted with [[oxaloacetate]] to yield [[citrate]].&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 633. &lt;/ref&gt; The remaining eight reactions produce other carbon-containing metabolites. These metabolites are successively oxidized, and the free energy of oxidation is conserved in the form of the reduced coenzymes [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]].&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 640. &lt;/ref&gt; These reduced electron carriers can then be re-oxidized when they transfer electrons to the [[electron transport chain]]. 

*[[Ketosis]] is a metabolic process whereby ketone bodies are used by the cell for energy (instead of using glucose). Cells often turn to ketosis as a source of energy when glucose levels are low; e.g. during starvation.&lt;ref&gt; Owen, O.E. (2005) Ketone Bodies as a Fuel for the Brain during Starvation. ''The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.'' '''33''':4, 246- 251. &lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Oxidative phosphorylation]] and the [[electron transport chain]] is the process where reducing equivalents such as [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]], [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]] can be used to donate electrons to a series of redox reactions that take place in electron transport chain complexes.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 731. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 734. &lt;/ref&gt; These redox reactions take place in enzyme complexes situated within the mitochondrial membrane. These redox reactions transfer electrons "down" the electron transport chain, which is coupled to the [[Chemiosmosis|proton motive force]]. This difference in proton concentration between the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane space is used to drive ATP synthesis via [[ATP Synthase|ATP synthase]].

*[[Photosynthesis]], another major bioenergetic process, is the metabolic pathway used by plants in which solar energy is used to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide and water. This reaction takes place in the [[chloroplast]]. After glucose is synthesized, the plant cell can undergo [[photophosphorylation]] to produce ATP.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 731. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Cotransport==
In August 1960, [[Robert K. Crane]] presented for the first time his discovery of the sodium-glucose [[Co-transport|cotransport]] as the mechanism for intestinal glucose absorption.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Crane]], D. Miller and I. Bihler. "The restrictions on possible mechanisms of intestinal transport of sugars". In: Membrane Transport and Metabolism. Proceedings of a Symposium held in Prague, August 22–27, 1960. Edited by A. Kleinzeller and A. Kotyk. [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic|Czech Academy of Sciences]], Prague, 1961, pp. 439-449.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert K. Crane|Crane's]] discovery of [[Co-transport|cotransport]] was the first ever proposal of flux coupling in biology and was the most important event concerning carbohydrate absorption in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00424-003-1063-6 |author=Wright, Ernest M. |author2=Turk, Eric |title=The sodium glucose cotransport family SLC5 |journal=Pflügers Arch |volume=447 |pages=510–8 |year=2004 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/c7ryue6u68ge924t/fulltext.pdf?page=1 |quote=[[Robert K. Crane|Crane]] in 1961 was the first to formulate the [[Co-transport|cotransport]]  concept to explain active transport [7]. Specifically, he  proposed that the accumulation of glucose in the intestinal  epithelium across the brush border membrane was coupled to downhill {{chem|Na|+}} transport cross the brush border. This hypothesis was rapidly tested, refined and extended [to] encompass the active transport of a diverse range of molecules and ions into virtually every cell type. |pmid=12748858 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2007.037523 |author=Boyd, C A R |title=Facts, fantasies and fun in epithelial physiology |journal=Experimental Physiology |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=303–14 |year=2008 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119410531/main.html,ftx_abs#b12 |quote=the insight from this time that remains in all current text books is the notion of [[Robert K. Crane|Robert Crane]] published originally as an appendix to a symposium paper published in 1960 ([[Robert K. Crane|Crane]] et al. 1960). The key point here was 'flux coupling', the [[Co-transport|cotransport]] of sodium and glucose in the apical membrane of the small intestinal epithelial cell. Half a century later this idea has turned into one of the most studied of all transporter proteins (SGLT1), the sodium–glucose [[Co-transport|cotransport]]er. |pmid=18192340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemiosmotic theory==
One of the major triumphs of bioenergetics is [[Peter D. Mitchell]]'s [[Chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic theory]] of how [[proton]]s in aqueous solution function in the production of ATP in cell [[organelle]]s such as [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Peter Mitchell | title=Coupling of phosphorylation to electron and hydrogen transfer by a chemi-osmotic type of mechanism | journal=Nature | year=1961 | volume=191 | pages= 144–8 | doi=10.1038/191144a0 | pmid=13771349 | issue=4784 | bibcode=1961Natur.191..144M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work earned Mitchell the 1978 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]]. Other cellular sources of ATP such as [[glycolysis]] were understood first, but such processes for direct coupling of [[enzyme]] activity to ATP production are not the major source of useful chemical energy in most cells. Chemiosmotic coupling is the major energy producing process in most cells, being utilized in [[chloroplast]]s and several [[Three-domain system|single celled]] organisms in addition to mitochondria.

==Energy balance==

[[Energy homeostasis]] is the [[Homeostasis#Biological|homeostatic]] control of [[Energy balance (biology)|energy balance]]&amp;nbsp;– the difference between energy obtained through food consumption and energy expenditure&amp;nbsp;– in living systems.&lt;ref name="NHM-#"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE | editor = Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 179, 262–263 | edition = 2nd | quote = Orexin neurons are regulated by peripheral mediators that carry information about energy balance, including glucose, leptin, and ghrelin.&amp;nbsp;... Accordingly, orexin plays a role in the regulation of energy homeostasis, reward, and perhaps more generally in emotion.&amp;nbsp;... The regulation of energy balance involves the exquisite coordination of food intake and energy expenditure. Experiments in the 1940s and 1950s showed that lesions of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) reduced food intake; hence, the normal role of this brain area is to stimulate feeding and decrease energy utilization. In contrast, lesions of the medial hypothalamus, especially the ventromedial nucleus (VMH) but also the PVN and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), increased food intake; hence, the normal role of these regions is to suppress feeding and increase energy utilization. Yet discovery of the complex networks of neuropeptides and other neurotransmitters acting within the hypothalamus and other brain regions to regulate food intake and energy expenditure began in earnest in 1994 with the cloning of the leptin (ob, for obesity) gene. Indeed, there is now explosive interest in basic feeding mechanisms given the epidemic proportions of obesity in our society, and the increased toll of the eating disorders, anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Unfortunately, despite dramatic advances in the basic neurobiology of feeding, our understanding of the etiology of these conditions and our ability to intervene clinically remain limited.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Homeostatic control of energy balance"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morton GJ, Meek TH, Schwartz MW | title = Neurobiology of food intake in health and disease | journal = Nat. Rev. Neurosci. | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 367–378 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24840801 | pmc = 4076116 | doi = 10.1038/nrn3745 | quote = However, in normal individuals, body weight and body fat content are typically quite stable over time&lt;sup&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt; owing to a biological process termed ‘energy homeostasis’ that matches energy intake to expenditure over long periods of time. The energy homeostasis system comprises neurons in the mediobasal hypothalamus and other brain areas&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; that are a part of a neurocircuit that regulates food intake in response to input from humoral signals that circulate at concentrations proportionate to body fat content&lt;sup&gt;4-6&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;nbsp;... An emerging concept in the neurobiology of food intake is that neurocircuits exist that are normally inhibited, but when activated in response to emergent or stressful stimuli they can override the homeostatic control of energy balance. Understanding how these circuits interact with the energy homeostasis system is fundamental to understanding the control of food intake and may bear on the pathogenesis of disorders at both ends of the body weight spectrum.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Branch House''' in [[Richmond, Virginia]], was designed in 1916 by the firm of [[John Russell Pope]] as a private residence of financier John Kerr Branch (1865–1930)&lt;ref name="findgrave"&gt;{{cite web

The house lies within Richmond's [[Monument Avenue Historic District]], which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1967.  Branch House itself was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; The district's status was extended in 1989 and subsequently upgraded to a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="monav"&gt;{{cite web

After a Branch family heir gifted the home to a local charity in the 1950s, the house changed ownership several times until it was purchased in 2003 by the Virginia Architecture Foundation (formerly the Virginia Center for Architecture Foundation) and reopened in 2005 as headquarters of its successor, the '''Virginia Center for Architecture''' (VCA), offices for the Virginia Society of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (VSAIA) and its now defunct publication, ''Inform'' magazine, and an architectural museum.

The Branch House would subsequently (2015) operate as '''The Branch Museum of Architecture and Design''' (The Branch),&lt;ref name="newname"&gt;{{cite web

John Kerr Branch grew up in Richmond and attended the McGuire School, subsequently studying in Paris and Germany (1882–1884).  At age 21 he began clerking with his father's firm, Thomas Branch &amp; Company.  Branch invested successfully in real estate and railroads;&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt; ultimately inherited his family's banking fortune;&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vabio"/&gt; and became director of the Continental Insurance Company of New York (chiefly involved with Southern cotton mills and railroads) and the Petersburg Savings and Insurance Company.  He became President of Merchants National Bank of Richmond (having founded the bank in 1871);&lt;ref name="vabio"/&gt; President of Thomas Branch and Company, later Branch &amp; Company, (1837–1976);&lt;ref name="branch&amp;co"&gt;{{cite web

The Branches lived "seasonally," maintaining ''Elmwood'', their farm estate at Quaker Hill, Pawling, New York&lt;ref name="cost"/&gt; and later also acquiring a 15th-century Italian Renaissance villa near Florence (Villa Marsilio Ficino in [[Fiesole]]&lt;!-- [[:it:Villa Marsilio Ficino]] --&gt;).&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt; Branch House was their winter home.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;

==Historical significance==

After designing Branch House, the firm of John Russell Pope (1874–1937) became widely known for designing the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] building (1935), the [[Jefferson Memorial]] (1943) and the West Building of the [[National Gallery of Art]] (1941) in Washington, DC.  Pope's partner, [[Eggers &amp; Higgins|Otto R. Eggers]] (1882–1964), completed those commissions after Pope's death in 1937, and subsequently designed prominent projects including the interior of the {{SS|United States}} (1952) and the [[Morehead Planetarium and Science Center|Morehead Planetarium]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

Branch House was thus elevated to the National Register because it was designed by one of the country's prominent architectural firms during the early 20th century;&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt; because it is the only example of the firm's domestic work in Virginia;&lt;ref name="Loth"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Architect's Showplace
  | publisher = Traditional-building.com, April 2006
  | url = http://www.traditional-building.com/Previous-Issues-06/AprilProject06showplace.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because it is the only example of the firm's [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]]-[[Jacobethan|Jacobean Revival]] residences in which the interiors have survived intact.&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt; In addition, the house is located within a historic district of cultural significance and is the largest house in the city of Richmond.&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;

Branch House also accurately reflects a particular period of American history, in the early decades of the twentieth century, when English architectural styles were fashionable among wealthy industrialists and financiers.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dreamtrue"/&gt; The client was also scion to a distinguished Virginia family and had assembled a substantial collection of Renaissance artifacts.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Eggers &amp; Higgins office.jpg|thumb|right|Eggers and Higgins in their New York City offices in 1941]]

After receiving the gift of half a city block from his father, John Kerr and Beulah Branch commissioned the firm of [[John Russell Pope]] for the design.  The site was adjacent to the colonnaded memorial to [[Jefferson Davis]]&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt; at 2501 [[Monument Avenue]] at Davis Street, in what is now the [[Monument Avenue Historic District]], itself within Richmond's [[Fan district]]. Notably, the site is on axis with the Broad Street Station to the north, possibly related to John Kerr Branch's professional associations with the railroad.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;

===Overall design===

According to the 1984 application to the National Register of Historic Places, Pope himself had limited involvement in the project and never visited the building.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt; The architectural construction drawings were dated August 18, 1916,&lt;ref name="dateofdrawings"&gt;{{cite book
  | title = Arts in Virginia, Vol. 4–5

Eggers]].&lt;ref name="NPS1"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Branch House
  | publisher = National Park Service
  | url = http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/richmond/BranchHouse.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Floor plans included 28 major rooms:&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt; public halls, galleries, private suites, servants' quarters, a ballroom, and storage rooms designated specifically for carpets, china, paintings&amp;nbsp;– and suits of armour.&lt;ref name="cost"/&gt;

The overall size of the house has been reported as ranging from 27,000 to 33,000 sq ft.&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="monumenthouse"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = John Kerr Branch House
  | publisher = Monumenthouse.com
  | url = http://www.monumenthouse.com/richmond/landmarks/3025}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is roughly three times the size of its neighbors on Monument Avenue.&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;

Branch House features a central portion flanked by two projecting pavilions.&lt;ref name="monav"/&gt; The roof is double-pitched with parapets and [[castellation]] (or crenelations), creating numerous complexities and hidden flat areas. The eastern pavilion has a three-story castellated bay. The 1984 application to the National Register of Historic Places described the home's relationship to the street as "extremely awkward." Pope's office had made provision for a garage on Park Avenue, but a two-door garage was not added until the 1920s, at the west end of the building.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;

Although from the outside the house appears to have three storeys, and although the interior is logically laid out, the interior is organized on numerous different levels &amp;mdash; variously reported as ranging from 11 levels &lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPS1"/&gt; to as many as 19.&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;

===Style and inspiration===
The historic style of Branch House has been variously reported as [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]], [[Tudor Revival]], [[Jacobethan|Tudor-Jacobean]] or Domestic Tudor. The 1984 application to the National Register of Historic Places noted that the design "incorporated salient features from several 16th-century English country houses to form a convincingly correct assemblage of design elements," adding that "to maintain the illusion of age, the architect had the building materials distressed and aged to add patina to the image of power and pedigree"&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt; and furthermore that "barons of American industry, finance, and culture, such as Branch, appropriated the traditions of English domestic architecture as a way of asserting a noble lineage for their class."&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;

John Russell Pope had traveled extensively and the firm based the design for Branch House on a large 16th-century [[English country houses|country house]] in [[Warwickshire]], England known as [[Compton Wynyates]], which features numerous exterior details also found at Branch House including [[Linenfold|linenfold paneling]] inside and exterior half-timbering and brick [[diapering]], along with [[Oriel window|oriel]] and casement windows with leaded glass.  Pope's office primarily borrowed details and design elements from Compton Wynyates, which wraps around a large interior courtyard, sits on the interior of a large country parcel, and is highly expansive and asymmetrical. Branch House, by contrast, includes no courtyard, sits adjacent to a street corner on an urban parcel and is largely compact and more symmetrical.&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;

===Construction and details===

Exterior features of Branch House include its perimeter wall of brick construction, wall materials of weathered brick combined with distressed and patinized briarcliff sandstone,&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt; sculpted stone motifs,&lt;ref name="NPS1"/&gt; sandstone door and window surrounds, chimney pots, brickwork with diamond diapering, leaded glass,&lt;ref name="monav"/&gt; carved-stone heraldry, oriel windows with cul-de-lampe ([[corbel]]ing resembling the conical bottom of ancient lamps), [[bargeboard]]s resembling those of Compton Wynyates, inscriptions at the window heads referring to the Branch family's arrival in Virginia during the 17th century, a tower reminiscent of that at [[Hampton Court Palace]], and three characteristically Tudor twisted brick chimneys that resemble those found in Tudor pattern books of the period.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4149">The term '''building engineering physics''' was introduced in a report released in January 2010 commissioned by The Royal Academy of Engineering. The report, entitled ''Engineering a Low Carbon Built Environment: The Discipline of Building Engineering Physics'',  presents the initiative of many at the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] in developing a field that addresses our [[fossil fuel]] dependence while working towards a more sustainably built environment for the future.

The field of building engineering physics combines the existing professions of building services engineering, [[applied physics]] and building construction engineering into a single field designed to investigate the energy efficiency of old and new buildings.&lt;ref&gt;King p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The application of building engineering physics allows the construction and renovation of high performance, energy efficient buildings, while minimizing their environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton&lt;/ref&gt;

Building engineering physics addresses several different areas in building performance including: air movement, thermal performance, control of moisture, ambient energy, acoustics, light, climate and biology.&lt;ref&gt;King pp. 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt; This field employs creative ways of manipulating these principal aspects of a building’s indoor and outdoor environments so that a more eco-friendly standard of living is obtained. Building engineering physics is unique from other established applied sciences or engineering professions as it combines the sciences of architecture, engineering and human biology and physiology. Building engineering physics not only addresses energy efficiency and building sustainability, but also a building's internal environment conditions that affect the comfort and performance levels of its occupants.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, a large percentage of buildings were constructed completely dependent on fossil fuels. Rather than focusing on energy efficiency, architects and engineers were more concerned with experimenting with “new materials and structural forms” to further aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Now in the 21st century, building energy performance standards are pushing towards a zero carbon standard in old and new buildings alike. The threat of global change and the need for energy independence and sustainability has prompted governments across the globe to adopt firm carbon reducing standards.  A significant way to meet these stringent standards is in the construction of buildings that minimize environmental impacts, as well as the refurbishing of older buildings to meet carbon emission standards.  The application of building engineering physics can aid in this transition to reduce energy dependent buildings, provide for the demands of a growing population and better standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth in the application of this field is due in large part to the'' introduction of regulations requiring the calculation of carbon emissions to demonstrate compliance, principally the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)''.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the discipline of building engineering physics is severely impaired by lack of diverse education in the construction industry. Very few in the construction industry know how to apply the principles of building engineering physics and do not have interdisciplinary experience.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton&lt;/ref&gt;

'''COPI''' is a [[coatomer]], a protein complex&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Coat+Protein+Complex+I}}&lt;/ref&gt; that coats [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s transporting proteins from the ''cis'' end of the [[Golgi complex]] back to the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER), where they were originally [[Translation (genetics)|synthesized]], and between Golgi compartments.  This type of transport is termed as ''retrograde transport'', in contrast to the ''anterograde transport'' associated with the [[COPII]] protein. The name "COPI" refers to the specific '''co'''at '''p'''rotein complex that initiates the budding process on the ''cis''-Golgi membrane. The coat consists of large protein subcomplexes that are made of seven different protein subunits, namely α, β, β', γ, [[Archain|δ]], ε and [[COPZ1|ζ]].

Coat protein, or COPI, is an [[ADP ribosylation factor]] (ARF)-dependent protein involved in membrane traffic.&lt;ref name="pmid1680566"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/0092-8674(91)90176-Y| vauthors=Serafini T, Orci L, Amherdt M, Brunner M, Kahn RA, Rothman JE| title=ADP-ribosylation factor is a subunit of the coat of Golgi-derived COP-coated vesicles: a novel role for a GTP-binding protein. | journal=Cell | year= 1991 | volume= 67 | issue= 2 | pages= 239–53 | pmid=1680566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; COPI was first identified in retrograde traffic from the ''cis''-Golgi to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schekman R, Orci L | year = 1996 | title = Coat proteins and vesicle budding | url = | journal = Science | volume = 271 | issue =5255 | pages = 1526–1533 | doi=10.1126/science.271.5255.1526 | pmid=8599108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9261053"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/S0955-0674(97)80023-3| vauthors=Cosson P, Letourneur F| title=Coatomer (COPI)-coated vesicles: role in intracellular transport and protein sorting. | journal=Curr Opin Cell Biol | year= 1997 | volume= 9 | issue= 4 | pages= 484–7 | pmid=9261053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the most extensively studied of ARF-dependent adaptors. COPI consists of seven subunits which compose the heteroheptameric protein complex.

The primary function of adaptors is the selection of cargo proteins for their incorporation into nascent carriers.

ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) is a GTPase involved in membrane traffic.  There are 6 mammalian ARFs which are regulated by over 30 GEFs and GAPs. ARF is post-translationally modified at the N-terminus by the addition of the fatty acid myristate.

ARF cycles between GTP and GDP-bound conformations.  In the GTP-bound form, ARF conformation changes such that the myristate and hydrophobic N-terminal become more exposed and associate with the membrane. The interconversion between GTP and GDP bound states is mediated by ARF [[guanine nucleotide exchange factors]] (GEFs) and ARF [[GTPase activating proteins]] (GAPs). At the membrane, ARF-GTP is hydrolyzed to ARF-GDP by ARF GAPs. Once in the GDP-bound conformation, ARF converts to a less hydrophobic conformation and dissociates from the membrane.  Soluble ARF-GDP is converted back to ARF-GTP by GEFs.

:1. Luminal proteins: Proteins found in the lumen of the Golgi complex that need to be transported to the lumen of the ER contain the [[signal peptide]] [[KDEL (amino acid sequence)|KDEL]].&lt;ref name="KDEL and KKXX retrieval"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Mariano Stornaiuolo| author2=Lavinia V.

In yeast, this is [[Erd2p]] and in mammals it is [[KDELR]].  This receptor then binds to an ARF-GEF, a class of guanine nucleotide exchange factors.  This protein in turn binds to the ARF.  This interaction causes ARF to exchange its bound [[Guanosine diphosphate|GDP]] for [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]].  Once this exchange is made ARF binds to the cytosolic side of the cis-Golgi membrane and inserts the myristoylated N-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix into the membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=J.|date=1998-10-16|title=Structural basis for activation of ARF GTPase: mechanisms of guanine nucleotide exchange and GTP-myristoyl switching|journal=Cell|volume=95|issue=2|pages=237–248|issn=0092-8674|pmid=9790530|doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81754-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2. Membrane proteins: Transmembrane proteins which reside in the ER contain sorting signals in their cytosolic tails which direct the protein to exit the Golgi and return to the ER.  These sorting signals, or motifs, typically contain the amino acid sequence [[KKXX (amino acid sequence)|KKXX]] or KXKXX, which interact with COPI subunits α-COP and β'-COP.&lt;ref name="KDEL and KKXX retrieval"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ma 926–937"/&gt; The order in which adaptor proteins associate with cargo, or adaptor proteins associate with ARFs is unclear, however, in order to form a mature transport carrier coat protein, adaptor, cargo, and ARF must all associate.

Membrane deformation and carrier budding occurs following the collection of interactions described above. The carrier then buds off of the donor membrane, in the case of COPI this membrane is the cis-Golgi, and the carrier moves to the ER where it fuses with the acceptor membrane and its content is expelled.

[[Image:Chirality with hands.svg|200px|thumb|Two enantiomers of a generic [[amino acid]] that is '''chiral''']]

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|iː}} is a property of [[asymmetry]] important in several branches of science. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|χειρ}} (''kheir''), "hand," a familiar chiral object.

An object or a system is ''chiral'' if it is distinguishable from its [[mirror image]]; that is, it cannot be [[wikt:superposed|superposed]] onto it.  Conversely, a mirror image of an ''achiral'' object, such as a sphere, cannot be distinguished from the object. A chiral object and its mirror image are called ''enantiomorphs'' (Greek, "opposite forms") or, when referring to molecules, ''[[enantiomers]]''. A non-chiral object is called ''achiral'' (sometimes also ''amphichiral'') and can be superposed on its mirror image. If the object is non-chiral and is imagined as being colored blue and its mirror image is imagined as colored yellow, then by a series of rotations and translations the two can be superposed, producing green, with none of the original colors remaining.

The term was first used by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] in 1893 in the second [[Robert Boyle Lecture]] at the [[Oxford University Junior Scientific Club]] which was published in 1894:

{{quote|I call any geometrical figure, or group of points, 'chiral', and say that it has chirality if its image in a plane mirror, ideally realized, cannot be brought to coincide with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Molecular Tactics of a Crystal |author=Sir William Thomson Lord Kelvin | year=1894 | publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] | url=https://archive.org/details/moleculartactic00kelvgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Human [[hand]]s are perhaps the most universally recognized example of chirality. The left hand is a non-superimposable mirror image of the right hand; no matter how the two hands are oriented, it is impossible for all the major features of both hands to coincide across all axes.&lt;ref name="OCATUA"&gt;Georges Henry Wagnière, ''On Chirality and the Universal Asymmetry: Reflections on Image and Mirror Image'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in symmetry becomes obvious if someone attempts to shake the right hand of a person using their left hand, or if a left-handed glove is placed on a right hand. In mathematics, ''chirality'' is the property of a figure that is not identical to its mirror image.

==Mathematics==

{{main|Chirality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone.  For example, a right shoe is different from a left shoe, and clockwise is different from anticlockwise. See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition.

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be enantiomorphs. The word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called achiral or amphichiral.

The [[helix]] (and by extension a spun string, a screw, a propeller, etc.) and [[Möbius strip]] are chiral two-dimensional objects in three-dimensional ambient space. The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space.

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves, glasses (where two lenses differ in prescription), and shoes. A similar notion of chirality is considered in [[knot theory]], as explained below.

Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the helix, can be assigned a right or left handedness, according to the [[right-hand rule]].

===Geometry===
In [[geometry]] a figure is achiral if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry.
In two dimensions, every figure that possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry.
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[plane of symmetry]] or a center of symmetry is achiral. There are, however, achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry.
In terms of [[point groups]], all chiral figures lack an improper axis of rotation (S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). This means that they cannot contain a center of inversion (i) or a mirror plane (σ). Only figures with a point group designation of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, T, O, or I can be chiral.

===Knot theory===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called chiral. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

{{main|Chirality (physics)}}

In physics, chirality may be found in the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a particle, where the handedness of the object is determined by the direction in which the particle spins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1995/nov/lookingfortherig591|title=Looking for the Right Hand - DiscoverMagazine.com|author=|date=|website=discovermagazine.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Helicity (particle physics)|helicity]], which is the projection of the spin along the linear momentum of a subatomic particle, chirality is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon like spin. Although both can have left-handed or right-handed properties, only in the massless case do they have a simple relation.&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2011/06/19/helicity-chirality-mass-and-the-higgs/|title=Quantum Diaries|author=|date=|website=www.quantumdiaries.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for a massless particle the helicity is the same as the chirality while for an antiparticle they have opposite sign.

The ''handedness'' in both chirality and helicity relate to the rotation of a particle while it proceeds in linear motion with reference to the human hands. The thumb of the hand points towards the direction of linear motion whilst the fingers curl into the palm, representing the direction of rotation of the particle (i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise). Depending on the linear and rotational motion, the particle can either be defined by left-handedness (ex. translating leftwards and rotating counterclockwise) or right-handedness (ex. translating in the right direction and rotating clockwise).&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"/&gt; A symmetry transformation between the two is called [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Invariance under parity by a [[Dirac fermion]] is called ''chiral symmetry''.

===Electromagnetism===

{{main|Chirality (electromagnetism)}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation|Electromagnetic]] wave [[Wave propagation|propagation]] as [[handedness]] is wave [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and described in terms of [[Circular dichroism|helicity]] (occurs as a helix). Polarization of an [[electromagnetic wave]] is the property that describes the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], i.e., the [[periodic function|time-varying]], direction ([[Euclidean vector|vector]]), and [[amplitude]] of the [[electric field]] vector. For a depiction, see the adjacent image.

{{main|Chirality (chemistry)}}

A ''chiral molecule'' is a type of [[molecule]] that has a non-superposable [[mirror image]]. The feature that is most often the cause of chirality in molecules is the presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon atom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "chiral" in general is used to describe the object that is non-superposable on its mirror image.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=chirality|file=C01058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a chiral molecule are called [[enantiomer]]s or optical [[isomer]]s. Pairs of enantiomers are often designated as "[[right-handed|right-]]", "left-handed" or if it has no bias achiral. As polarized light passes through a chiral molecule, the plane of polarization, when viewed along the axis toward the source, will be rotated in a clockwise (to the right) or anticlockwise (to the left). A right handed rotation is dextrorotary (d); that to the left is levorotary (l). The d- and l-isomers are the same compound but are called [[enantiomers]]. An equimolar mixture of the two optical isomers will produce no net rotation of polarized light as it passes through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Raymond|title=Chemistry|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-394-32983-X|page=660|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left handed molecules have l- prefixed to their names; d- is prefixed to right handed molecules.

Molecular chirality is of interest because of its application to [[stereochemistry]] in [[inorganic chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[supramolecular chemistry]].

More recent developments in chiral chemistry include the development of chiral inorganic nanoparticles that may have the similar tetrahedral geometry as chiral centers associated with sp3 carbon atoms traditionally associated with chiral compounds, but at larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moloney|first=Mícheál P.|last2=Gun'ko|first2=Yurii K.|last3=Kelly|first3=John M.|date=2007-09-26|title=Chiral highly luminescent CdS quantum dots|url=https://doi.org/10.1039/b704636g|journal=Chemical Communications|language=en|volume=0|issue=38|doi=10.1039/b704636g|issn=1364-548X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaaff|first=T.

==Biology==
{{See also|Homochirality}}

All of the known life-forms show specific chiral properties in chemical structures as well as macroscopic anatomy, development and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Wende|last2=Ernst|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Palotas|first3=Krisztian|last4=Zhang|first4=Yuyang|last5=Bruyer|first5=Emilie|last6=Peng|first6=Lingqing|last7=Greber|first7=Thomas|last8=Hofer|first8=Werner A.|last9=Scott|first9=Lawrence T.|date=2016-02-08|title=Microscopic origin of chiral shape induction in achiral crystals|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2449|journal=Nature Chemistry|language=En|volume=8|issue=4|pages=326–330|doi=10.1038/nchem.2449|issn=1755-4330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any specific organism or evolutionarily related set thereof, individual compounds, organs, or behavior are found in the same single enantiomorphic form. Deviation (having the opposite form) could be found in a small number of chemical compounds, or certain organ or behavior but that variation strictly depends upon the genetic make up of the organism. From chemical level (molecular scale), biological systems show extreme stereospecificity in synthesis, uptake, sensing, metabolic processing. A living system usually deals with two enantiomers of same compound in a drastically different way.

In biology, homochirality is a common property of [[Amino acid#Isomerism|amino acids]] and [[Monosaccharide#Open-chain stereoisomers|carbohydrates]]. The chiral [[Proteinogenic amino acid|protein-making amino acids]], which are translated through the ribosome from genetic coding, occur in the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; form. However, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are also found in nature. The monosaccharides (carbohydrate-units) are commonly found in &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-configuration. DNA double helix is chiral (as any kind of [[Helix#Types|helix]] is chiral), and [[B-DNA|B-form of DNA]] shows a right-handed turn.

Sometimes, when two enantiomers of a compound found in organisms, they significantly differ in their taste, smell and other biological actions.

Macroscopic example of Chirality is found in plant kingdom, animal kingdom and all other groups of organism. A simple example is the coiling direction of any climber plants. It may be one of two possible type of helix.

In anatomy, chirality is found in the imperfect mirror image symmetry of many kinds of animal bodies. Organisms such as [[gastropod]]s exhibit chirality in their coiled shells, resulting in an asymmetrical appearance. Over 90% of gastropod species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schilthuizen | first1 = M. | last2 = Davison | first2 = A. | year = 2005 | title = The convoluted evolution of snail chirality | url = | journal = [[Naturwissenschaften]] | volume = 92 | issue = 11| pages = 504–515 | doi =  10.1007/s00114-05-0045-2| bibcode = 2005NW.....92..504S }}&lt;/ref&gt; have ''dextral'' (right-handed) shells in their coiling, but a small minority of species and genera are virtually always ''sinistral'' (left-handed). A very few species (for example ''[[Amphidromus perversus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxshells.org/052ddr.htm|title=Amphidromus perversus (Linnaeus, 1758)|author=|date=|website=www.jaxshells.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) show an equal mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals.

In humans, chirality (also referred to as ''handedness'' or ''laterality'') is an attribute of humans defined by their unequal distribution of [[fine motor skill]] between the left and right [[hands]]. An individual who is more [[Dexterity|dexterous]] with the right hand is called ''[[right-handed]]'', and one who is more skilled with the left is said to be ''[[left-handed]]''. Chirality is also seen in the study of [[facial asymmetry]].

In flatfish, the [[Summer flounder]] or fluke are left-eyed, while [[halibut]] are right-eyed.

'''Cognitive robotics ''' is concerned with endowing a robot with intelligent behavior by providing it with a processing architecture that will allow it to [[Robot learning|learn]] and reason about how to behave in response to complex goals in a complex world. Cognitive robotics may be considered the engineering branch of [[embodied cognitive science]] and [[embodied embedded cognition]].

==Core issues==

While traditional cognitive modeling approaches have assumed symbolic coding schemes as a means for depicting the world, translating the world into these kinds of symbolic representations has proven to be problematic if not untenable. [[philosophy of perception|Perception]] and [[motor cognition|action]] and the notion of [[Mental representation|symbolic representation]] are therefore core issues to be addressed in cognitive robotics.

==Starting point==

Cognitive robotics views animal cognition as a starting point for the development of robotic information processing, as opposed to more traditional [[Artificial Intelligence]] techniques. Target robotic cognitive capabilities include perception processing, attention allocation, [[anticipation (artificial intelligence)|anticipation]], planning, complex motor coordination, reasoning about other agents and perhaps even about their own mental states. Robotic cognition embodies the behavior of [[intelligent agent]]s in the physical world (or a virtual world, in the case of simulated cognitive robotics). Ultimately the robot must be able to act in the real world.

==Learning techniques==

===Motor Babble===
{{main|Motor babbling}}

A preliminary robot learning technique called [[motor babbling]] involves correlating pseudo-random complex motor movements by the robot with resulting visual and/or auditory feedback such that the robot may begin to ''expect'' a pattern of sensory feedback given a pattern of motor output. Desired sensory feedback may then be used to inform a motor control signal. This is thought to be analogous to how a baby learns to reach for objects or learns to produce speech sounds. For simpler robot systems, where for instance inverse kinematics may feasibly be used to transform anticipated feedback (desired motor result) into motor output, this step may be skipped.

===Imitation===

Once a robot can coordinate its motors to produce a desired result, the technique of ''learning by imitation'' may be used. The robot monitors the performance of another agent and then the robot tries to imitate that agent. It is often a challenge to transform imitation information from a complex scene into a desired motor result for the robot. Note that imitation is a high-level form of cognitive behavior and imitation is not necessarily required in a basic model of embodied animal cognition.

===Knowledge acquisition===

A more complex learning approach is "autonomous knowledge acquisition": the robot is left to explore the environment on its own. A system of goals and beliefs is typically assumed.

A somewhat more directed mode of exploration can be achieved by "curiosity" algorithms, such as Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pyoudeyer.com/ims.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pyoudeyer.com/oudeyer-kaplan-neurorobotics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or Category-Based Intrinsic Motivation.&lt;ref&gt;http://science.slc.edu/~jmarshall/papers/cbim-epirob09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These algorithms generally involve breaking sensory input into a finite number of categories and assigning some sort of prediction system (such as an [[Artificial Neural Network]]) to each. The prediction system keeps track of the error in its predictions over time. Reduction in prediction error is considered learning. The robot then preferentially explores categories in which it is learning (or reducing prediction error) the fastest.

==Other architectures==

Some researchers in cognitive robotics have tried using architectures such as ([[ACT-R]] and [[Soar (cognitive architecture)]]) as a basis of their cognitive robotics programs. These highly modular symbol-processing architectures have been used to simulate operator performance and human performance when modeling simplistic and symbolized laboratory data. The idea is to extend these architectures to handle real-world sensory input as that input continuously unfolds through time. What is needed is a way to somehow translate the world into a set of symbols and their relationships.

==icb metric systematic manifold== 

drones or subatomic ai are some of the most controversial and greatest representation of sentient robotics and their processing or what the common people refer and believe in as  quantum computing or plutonic A.I. (not to be confused with platonic A.I.) use string theory or mass sentient (sentient, mass) relativity to conduct a universal occlusion called schripp  or string theory using schripp for the general process and purpose of creating A.I. or icb metric drones uses quantum relativity between two units to synchronize and assimilate a wavelength to cause universal fractal hyper conclusion and create an icb3 geometric manifold and conclude computing singularity units 
hypothetically for units to quantum compute icb3 metric numbers and code computers use a conjunction of high pitched AM frequency to randomize photogenic relay combined with a high axis accelerometer with the implementation and use of quantum source code and with inductive relay for reasoning skills that are very close to the geometric decision based system that the human race used for evolution 
inclusively space time to manifold and icb metric singularity are generally heard in a frequency that is beyond the range of human hearing

==Questions==

Some of the fundamental questions to still be answered in cognitive robotics are:
* How much human programming should or can be involved to support the learning processes?
* How can one quantify progress? Some of the adopted ways is the reward and punishment. But what kind of reward and what kind of punishment? In humans, when teaching a child for example, the reward would be candy or some encouragement, and the punishment can take many forms. But what is an effective way with robots?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20110">In [[philosophy of mind|philosophy]], the '''computational theory of mind''' ('''CTM''') refers to a family of views that hold that the human [[mind]] is an [[information processing system]] and that cognition and consciousness together are a form of [[computation]]. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) were the first to suggest that neural activity is computational. They argued that neural computations explain [[cognition]].&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;Piccinini, Gualtierro &amp; Bahar, Sonya, 2012. "Neural Computation and the Computational Theory of Cognition" in Cognitive Science. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/cogs.12012&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was proposed in its modern form by [[Hilary Putnam]] in 1967, and developed by his PhD student, philosopher and cognitive scientist [[Jerry Fodor]] in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary, 1961. "Brains and Behavior", originally read as part of the program of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Section L (History and Philosophy of Science), December 27, 1961, reprinted in Block (1983), and also along with other papers on the topic in Putnam, ''Mathematics, Matter and Method'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"&gt;[[Steven Horst|Horst, Steven]], (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ "The Computational Theory of Mind"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being vigorously disputed in [[analytic philosophy]] in the 1990s due to work by Putnam himself, [[John Searle]], and others, the view is common in modern [[cognitive psychology]] and is presumed by many theorists of [[evolutionary psychology]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} In the 2000s and 2010s the view has resurfaced in analytic philosophy (Scheutz 2003, Edelman 2008).{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The computational theory of mind holds that the mind is a computational system that is realized (i.e. physically implemented) by neural activity in the brain. The theory can be elaborated in many ways and varies largely based on how the term computation is understood. Computation is commonly understood in terms of [[Turing machine]]s which manipulate symbols according to a rule, in combination with the internal state of the machine. The critical aspect of such a computational model is that we can abstract away from particular physical details of the machine that is implementing the computation.&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"/&gt; This is to say that computation can be implemented by silicon chips or neural networks, so long as there is a series of outputs based on manipulations of inputs and internal states, performed according to a rule. CTM, therefore holds that the mind is not simply analogous to a computer program, but that it is literally a computational system.&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"/&gt;

Computational theories of mind are often said to require [[Representation (psychology)|mental representation]] because 'input' into a computation comes in the form of symbols or representations of other objects. A computer cannot compute an actual object, but must interpret and represent the object in some form and then compute the representation. The computational theory of mind is related to the [[representational theory of mind]] in that they both require that mental states are representations. However, the representational theory of mind shifts the focus to the symbols being manipulated. This approach better accounts for systematicity and productivity.&lt;ref name="The Computational Theory of Mind"/&gt; In Fodor's original views, the computational theory of mind is also related to the [[language of thought]]. The language of thought theory allows the mind to process more complex representations with the help of semantics. (See below in semantics of mental states).

Recent work has suggested that we make a distinction between the mind and cognition. Building from the tradition of McCulloch and Pitts, the Computational Theory of Cognition (CTC) states that neural computations explain cognition.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt; The Computational Theory of Mind asserts that not only cognition, but also phenomenal consciousness or [[qualia]], are computational. That is to say, CTM entails CTC. While phenomenal consciousness could fulfill some other functional role, computational theory of cognition leaves open the possibility that some aspects of the mind could be non-computational. CTC therefore provides an important explanatory framework for understanding neural networks, while avoiding counter-arguments that center around phenomenal consciousness.

=="Computer metaphor"==
Computational theory of mind is not the same as the computer metaphor, comparing the mind to a modern-day digital computer.&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [[The Blank Slate]]. New York: Penguin. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Computational theory just uses some of the same principles as those found in digital computing.&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; While the computer metaphor draws an analogy between the mind as software and the brain as hardware, CTM is the claim that the mind is a computational system.

'Computational system' is not meant to mean a modern-day electronic computer. Rather, a computational system is a symbol manipulator that follows step by step functions to compute input and form output. [[Alan Turing]] describes this type of computer in his concept of a [[Turing Machine]].

==Early proponents==

One of the earliest proponents of the computational theory of mind was [[Thomas Hobbes]], who said, "by reasoning, I understand computation. And to compute is to collect the sum of many things added together at the same time, or to know the remainder when one thing has been taken from another. To reason therefore is the same as to add or to subtract."&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Thomas "De Corpore"&lt;/ref&gt; Since Hobbes lived before the contemporary identification of computing with instantiating effective procedures, he cannot be interpreted as explicitly endorsing the computational theory of mind, in the contemporary sense.

==Causal picture of thoughts==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}At the heart of the Computational Theory of Mind is the idea that thoughts are a form of computation, and a computation is by definition a systematic set of laws for the relations among representations. This means that a mental state represents something if and only if there is some causal correlation between the mental state and that particular thing. An example would be seeing dark clouds and thinking “clouds mean rain”, where there is a correlation between the thought of the clouds and rain, as the clouds causing rain.  This is sometimes known as Natural Meaning. Conversely, there is another side to the causality of thoughts and that is the non-natural representation of thoughts. An example would be seeing a red traffic light and thinking “red means stop”, there is nothing about the color red that indicates it represents stopping, and thus is just a convention that has been invented, similar to languages and their abilities to form representations.

==Semantics of mental states==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
The computational theory of mind states that the mind functions as a symbolic operator, and that mental representations are symbolic representations; just as the [[semantics]] of language are the features of words and sentences that relate to their meaning, the semantics of mental states are those meanings of representations, the definitions of the ‘words’ of the [[language of thought]]. If these basic mental states can have a particular meaning just as words in a language do, then this means that more complex mental states (thoughts) can be created, even if they have never been encountered before. Just as new sentences that are read can be understood even if they have never been encountered before, as long as the basic components are understood, and it is syntactically correct. For example: “I have eaten plum pudding every day of this fortnight.” While it's doubtful many have seen this particular configuration of words, nonetheless most readers should be able to glean an understanding of this sentence because it is syntactically correct and the constituent parts are understood.

==Criticism==

A range of arguments have been proposed against physicalist conceptions used in Computational Theories of Mind.

An early, though indirect, criticism of the Computational Theory of Mind comes from philosopher [[John Searle]].  In his thought experiment known as the [[Chinese room]], Searle attempts to refute the claims that [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent systems]] can be said to have [[intentionality]] and [[understanding]] and that these systems, because they can be said to be minds themselves, are sufficient for the study of the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Minds, brains, and programs | year = 1980 | author = Searle, J.R. | journal = The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 417–457}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Searle asks us to imagine that there is a man in a room with no way of communicating to anyone or anything outside of the room except for a piece of paper with symbols written on it that is passed under the door.  With the paper, the man is to use a series of provided rule books to return paper containing different symbols.  Unknown to the man in the room, these symbols are of a Chinese language, and this process generates a conversation that a Chinese speaker outside of the room can actually understand. Searle contends that the man in the room does not understand the Chinese conversation.  This is essentially what the computational theory of mind presents us—a model in which the mind simply decodes symbols and outputs more symbols.  Searle argues that this is not real understanding or intentionality.  This was originally written as a repudiation of the idea that computers work like minds.

Searle has further raised questions about what exactly constitutes a computation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the wall behind my back is right now implementing the [[WordStar]] program, because there is some pattern of molecule movements that is isomorphic with the formal structure of WordStar. But if the wall is implementing WordStar, if it is a big enough wall it is implementing any program, including any program implemented in the brain.&lt;ref name=Searle1992&gt;{{Citation
 | title =  The Rediscovery of the Mind
 | year = 1992
 | author = Searle, J.R.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Objections like Searle’s might be called insufficiency objections. They claim that computational theories of mind fail because computation is insufficient to account for some capacity of the mind. Arguments from qualia, such as Frank Jackson’s [[Knowledge argument]], can be understood as objections to computational theories of mind in this way—though they take aim at physicalist conceptions of the mind in general, and not computational theories specifically.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

There are also objections which are directly tailored for computational theories of mind.

Putnam himself (see in particular ''Representation and Reality'' and the first part of ''Renewing Philosophy'') became a prominent critic of computationalism for a variety of reasons, including ones related to Searle's Chinese room arguments, questions of world-word reference relations, and thoughts about the mind-body relationship. Regarding functionalism in particular, Putnam has claimed along lines similar to, but more general than Searle's arguments, that the question of whether the human mind ''can'' implement computational states is not relevant to the question of the nature of mind, because "every ordinary open system realizes every abstract finite automaton."&lt;ref name=Putnam1988&gt;{{Citation

[[Roger Penrose]] has proposed the idea that the human mind does not use a knowably sound calculation procedure to understand and discover mathematical intricacies. This would mean that a normal [[Turing complete]] computer would not be able to ascertain certain mathematical truths that human minds can.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Penrose, "Mathematical Intelligence," in Jean Khalfa, editor, ''What is Intelligence?'', chapter 5, pages 107-136. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent scholars==
* [[Daniel Dennett]] proposed the [[Multiple Drafts Model]], in which consciousness seems linear but is actually blurry and gappy, distributed over space and time in the brain. Consciousness is the computation, there is no extra step or "[[Cartesian Theater]]" in which you become conscious of the computation.
* [[Jerry Fodor]] argues that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Further, this language of thought itself is codified in the brain, not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought. In later work (''Concepts'' and ''The Elm and the Expert''), Fodor has refined and even questioned some of his original computationalist views, and adopted a highly modified version of LOT (see ''LOT2'').
* [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]] proposed that cognitive processes have three levels of description: the computational level (which describes that computational problem (i.e., input/output mapping) computed by the cognitive process); the algorithmic level (which presents the algorithm used for computing the problem postulated at the computational level); and the implementational level (which describes the physical implementation of the algorithm postulated at the algorithmic level in biological matter, e.g. the brain). (Marr 1981)
* [[Ulric Neisser]] coined the term 'cognitive psychology' in his book published in 1967 (''Cognitive Psychology''), wherein Neisser characterizes people as dynamic information-processing systems whose mental operations might be described in computational terms.
* [[Steven Pinker]] described a "language instinct," an evolved, built-in capacity to learn language (if not writing).
* [[Hilary Putnam]] proposed [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] to describe consciousness, asserting that it is the computation that equates to consciousness, regardless of whether the computation is operating in a brain, in a computer, or in a "brain in a vat."
* [[Georges Rey]], professor at the [[University of Maryland]], builds on Jerry Fodor's representational theory of mind to produce his own version of a Computational/Representational Theory of Thought.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">'''Constant air volume''' ('''CAV''') is a type of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning ([[HVAC]]) system.  In a simple CAV system, the supply air flow rate is constant, but the supply air temperature is varied to meet the thermal loads of a space.&lt;ref&gt;Systems and Equipment volume of the ''[[ASHRAE Handbook]]'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2004{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most CAV systems are small, and serve a single thermal zone.  However, variations such as CAV with reheat, CAV multizone, and CAV primary-secondary systems can serve multiple zones and larger buildings.

In mid- to large-size buildings, new central CAV systems are somewhat rare.  Due to fan energy savings potential, [[variable air volume]] (VAV) systems are more common.  However, in small buildings and residences, CAV systems are often the system of choice due to their simplicity, low cost, and reliability.  Such small CAV systems often have ''on/off control'', rather than supply air temperature modulation, to vary their heating or cooling capacities.

There are two types of CAV systems that are commonly in use to modify the supply air temperature: the terminal reheat system and the mixed air system.

The terminal reheat system cools the air in the air handling unit down to the lowest possible needed temperature within its zone of spaces.  This supplies a comfortable quality to the space, but wastes energy.

The mixed air system has two air streams, typically one for the coldest and one for the hottest needed air temperature in the zone.  The two air streams are strategically combined to offset the space's load.  The mixed air system option is not as proficient at controlling the humidity, yet it does do well at controlling the temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Heating/Piping/Air Conditioning, December 1993 p.53-57{{full|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cottey College''' is an independent, women's liberal arts and sciences college in [[Nevada, Missouri]]. While it began as a finishing school, it is now a four-year baccalaureate-granting college. It was founded by Virginia Alice Cottey Stockard in 1884 and is currently owned and supported by the [[P.E.O. Sisterhood]], a philanthropic women's organization. It is the only [[nonsectarian]] college in the United States owned and supported by women for women.&lt;ref name="Weitzel"/&gt;

Cottey has 307 enrolled students.&lt;ref name="Stats"/&gt; Cottey has a student to faculty ratio of 10:1.&lt;ref name="CotteyFacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cottey.edu/pdf/Cottey-Facts-2017-2018.pdf|title=Cottey Fact Sheet|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some classes meet with fewer than 10 students. Faculty includes both men and women, with over 90% holding the terminal [[academic degree]] in their field.&lt;ref name="CotteyFacts"/&gt;

Cottey is situated on {{convert|66|acre|ha|1}} of land in [[Nevada, Missouri|Nevada]], [[Missouri]], the county seat and a rural town of 8,171 people (by the 2012 estimate). The main campus is situated on 11 city blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/pdf/enroll/cottey_map.pdf|title=Cottey College|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five blocks south of this is B.I.L. Hill, a {{convert|33|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} wooded area owned and used by Cottey for recreation, concerts, bonfires, picnics, suite nights, and other traditions.

The official colors of Cottey are yellow and white. Additionally, the senior class color is navy blue and the freshmen class color is "baby" blue.&lt;ref name="CotteyHandbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/campus-community/student-handbook/|title=Webmaster – Cottey College, Nevada, Missouri|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==

===Residential life===
[[File:CotteyRossLibrary.jpg|thumb|Blanche Skiff Ross Memorial Library]]
Students generally represent over 40 states and 20 different countries.&lt;ref name="Weitzel"/&gt; In the 2018-19 school year, international students came from [[Angola]], [[Burundi]], [[Ethiopia]], [[France]], [[Ghana]], [[Guatemala]], [[India]], [[Jamaica]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Mexico]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Nigeria]], [[South Africa]], [[ESwatini|Swaziland]], [[Uganda]], [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom,]] and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/home/academic/journalism/spectrum/15_1.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716195815/http://www.cottey.edu/home/academic/journalism/spectrum/15_1.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 July 2010|title=Webmaster – Cottey College, Nevada, Missouri|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cottey students live in one of three campus halls (P.E.O., Reeves, and Robertson), each having between 10 and 14 [[suite (address)|suite]]s with several bedrooms, a bathroom, and a kitchenette arranged around a living room. Student rooms have typical college furnishing. Suites have between 8 and 12 students. Most suites are sponsored by a P.E.O. chapter, and suite members usually receive several care packages from these P.E.O.s during the year. Sponsorship of some suites has changed over time, their names changing as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cotteyphile.com/suites/|title=Suitelife|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residence halls===
'''P.E.O. Hall''' is the oldest of the existing dormitories, and was erected in 1939. It has 10 suites, housing about 100 students. It was the first building to be paid by the [[P.E.O. Sisterhood]] after they acquired the college.&lt;ref&gt;"Cottey College Is the Only College In the U.S. Maintained By Women." ''Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune''. Chillicothe, MO. 15 Apr 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reeves Hall''' was built in 1949 on the site where a prior Cottey dorm, Missouri Hall, had burned down in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cotteyphile.com/missourihall/|title=Missouri Hall|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like P.E.O., it houses 10 suites and about 100 students. It is noted for having the largest basement of the three halls, and a foyer reminiscent of a classic hotel lobby.

[[File:CotteyRobertsonHall.jpg|thumb|Robertson (Robbie) Hall]]
'''Robertson Hall''' (Robbie) was the last Cottey dorm to be built, being erected in 1959. It houses 14 suites (about 150 students) as well as the college's dining facility, Raney Dining Hall and the Centennial Room. It is noted for being the only hall with air conditioning and an elevator, and for having the smallest basement.

Each hall has recreational rooms, computer suites, laundry facilities, and quiet study rooms elsewhere in each building.

Cottey has had several prior dormitories, including Rosemary Hall (est. 1903) and Missouri Hall (1928–1940). Main Hall was also used as a dorm from 1884 to 1939.&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"&gt;Troesch, Dr. Helen DeRusha. The Life of Virginia Alice Cottey Stockard. Wayside Press, Inc., 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletics===
Cottey's [[sport]]s teams are called the ''Comets'' and compete in intercollegiate [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], and [[softball]] (beginning in spring 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/comet-athletics/|title=Cottey College|publisher=|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[cross country running|cross-country]], [[tennis]] (added in fall 2014), [[golf]], and [[Track and field|track &amp; field]]. All seven are scholarship sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/comet-athletics/|title=Cottey College for Women – Comet Athletics|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the swimming team, ''Swimmin' Women'', competes largely as exhibition, since no other two-year colleges in the area have [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] programs. Cottey's teams compete in Region XVI of the [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] playing teams in their region, as well as teams from community colleges in eastern [[Kansas]]. In the spring of 2018, the softball team made it into the [http://www.naia.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjw9sreBRBAEiwARroYm9RxLPEfuQyzK24DWdjeUOuecnNU01rJVtHWCuEJPmlTHSUwt9kTpRoCDr0QAvD_BwE NAIA] and won the [[NJCAA]] Regional Championships.

===International experience===
In 2018, Cottey College took their senior class on a week-long trip to [[London, England]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Japan]] over spring break. Since then, each second year class has traveled to one of several destinations: [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Barcelona]], [[Madrid]], [[Rome]], or [[Florence]]. For each European destination, the cost of airfare and hotel stays have been paid by the college.  Alternative trips to destinations including [[Japan]], [[Peru]], [[Thailand]], [[Guatemala]], [[New Zealand]] may incur additional fees. In 2017, Cottey traveled to [[Italy]], [[New Zealand]], [[Thailand]] or [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cottey.edu/international-experience/ |title=International Experience |publisher=Cottey College |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:Cottey Nevada Souvenir.jpg|thumb|Cottey College, circa 1910]]
Cottey College was opened by Virginia Alice Cottey in 1884, and was originally called "Vernon Seminary."&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"/&gt; After teaching at Central College in [[Lexington, Missouri|Lexington]] since 1875, Alice (as she was called) decided it was time to establish the school she'd always wanted. She had $3,000 saved, and her sisters Dora and Mary lent her nearly $3,000 of their own savings to begin her school.

Several towns bid for the opportunity to host the new girls' school, including [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]] and several towns in [[Missouri]]. After much thought, Alice accepted [[Nevada, Missouri|Nevada]]'s offer, even though it wasn't the most generous. Nevadans donated {{convert|6|acre|ha|3}} of land upon which Alice erected a three-story brick building, which came to be known as Main Hall.

Vernon Seminary opened its doors in 1884 as a primary, intermediate, and collegiate school.&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"/&gt; In those early years, before educational standardization in the U.S., placement depended more upon accomplishment than age. In 1886 the school's name was officially changed to "Cottey College," and by 1932, only the college department remained.

In 1927, Alice offered the college to the [[P.E.O. Sisterhood]] on the condition that they raise a $200,000 endowment for the school (about $2.9 million in 2018 dollars).&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"/&gt;  The P.E.O.s accepted, and have since owned and operated Cottey College.

===Enrollment===
Enrollment grew from 28 to 72 students during the first year,&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"/&gt; and by 1910 there were 250 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damonwaring.com/genealogy/nevada/souvenir/page18.html|title=Nevada Souvenir|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216024819/http://www.damonwaring.com/genealogy/nevada/souvenir/page18.html|archivedate=16 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance dropped during the 1930s and '40s, but rose to maximum capacity of 350 by the 1970s. Cottey experienced a slow decline in enrollment during the 1990s and into the 2000s, which they are presently attempting to reverse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.noellevitz.com/Our+Services/Recruitment/Results/Cottey+College.htm|title=Noel-Levitz partners with Cottey to increase enrollment|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522004203/https://www.noellevitz.com/Our+Services/Recruitment/Results/Cottey+College.htm|archive-date=2013-05-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they have mostly, with a present enrollment of 307.&lt;ref name="Stats"/&gt;

'''Counter-''Maniera''''' or '''Counter-Mannerism''' (variously capitalized and part-italicized) is a term in art history for a trend identified by some art historians in 16th-century Italian painting that forms a sub-category or phase of [[Mannerism]], the dominant movement in Italian art between about 1530 and 1590.  Counter-''Maniera'' or Counter-Mannerism reacted against the artificiality of the second generation of Mannerist painters in the second half of the 16th century. It was in part due to artists wishing to follow the [[The_Reformation_and_art#Council_of_Trent|vague prescriptions for clarity and simplicity]] in art issued by the [[Council of Trent]] in its final session in 1563, and represented a rejection of the distortions and artificiality of high Mannerist style, and a partial return to the classicism and balance of [[High Renaissance]] art, with "clarity in formal order and legibility in content".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429; his longest passage explaining his term is on pp. 429–430&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was devised by the art historian [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] (1914–1997), and has gained a good degree of acceptance, although it is by no means universally adopted by other art historians.  Counter-Maniera was one of the four phases of 16th-century Italian painting defined by Freedberg in his ''Painting in Italy, 1500–1600'', first published in 1971 and long the standard textbook on the period, as: "First ''Maniera'', High ''Maniera'', Counter-''Maniera'' and Late ''Maniera''".&lt;ref&gt;Cropper, 17; Freedberg had used the terms in earlier articles.&lt;/ref&gt; The styles did not neatly succeed each other but existed side by side for much of the time, with High ''Maniera'' remaining the dominant style during the main period of Counter-''Maniera'' in the third quarter of the 16th century. In many cases Counter-Mannerism was a development of an artist's style in mid or late career, or a style used for some works, especially religious commissions, while other works by the same artist continued to use a high ''maniera'' style.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429–430&lt;/ref&gt; 

Freedberg's contemporary [[Federico Zeri]] had in 1957 introduced or revived his own term ''arte sacra'' ("sacred art") for pre-Baroque Counter-Reformation style in Roman painting, overlapping to a large degree with Freedberg's Counter-Maniera, though rather wider in both the dates and styles included. The use of the term Counter-''Maniera'' may be in decline, as impatience with such "[[Style (visual arts)|style]] labels" grows among art historians. In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of the period and mentee of Freedberg, was criticised by a reviewer of her ''After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century'' for her "fundamental flaw" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic "Note on style labels" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 324&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and characteristics==
The definition of Mannerism itself is notoriously complex,&lt;ref&gt;The subject of both Cropper and Smyth, and Shearman's Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; and that of Counter-Mannerism, which to a considerable extent is defined negatively or reductively against it, is no less so.  Many parts of Italy, led by [[Venice]] and other northern centres, were on the periphery of both the High Renaissance and the Mannerist reaction, and reached what might be called a Counter-Mannerist style merely by continuing to develop regional Renaissance styles, and accepting moderate doses of ''maniera'' influence.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 563, and many passages on specific artists&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often applied to painters in Florence and Rome who reacted against the prevailing style in these centres of full-blooded ''maniera'', without a fundamental rejection of its underlying principles. In proposing the term Freedberg compares it with terms such as "counterpart" and "[[counterpoint]]", explaining that he intends "implying parallelism and relation between two terms at the same time as their opposition".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429 quoted, and ''passim'' on individual artists; Friedländer, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; 

Characteristics of the ''maniera'' often retained in counter-''maniera'' works, though in moderation, are an idealized and abstracted treatment of the content, absence of naturalism, an avoidance of the expression of emotion, and many of the formal characteristics noted by Friedländer, such as the arrangement of figures on the same plane at the front of the picture space, which they nearly fill. Elements of the ''maniera'' that are removed include the impulse to push to the extreme, the willingness to sacrifice everything for a graceful effect, playfulness and wit, and the readiness to let the details and ambience of a painting crowd out or submerge the supposed main figures, that must be hunted out by the learned viewer. The style restores a [[decorum]] suitable for religious works, and removes distractions from the central religious figures.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 429; Shearman, 168–169, 178–179; Friedländer, 6–10, and Part 1 generally&lt;/ref&gt; In its latest phase, from about 1585, the need for popular appeal appears to have been recognized by artists and commissioners in the church, leading to some relaxation of the austerity of earlier periods, and sometimes to sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 657–660&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term counter-''maniera'' is not usually applied to the more radical [[Bologna|Bolognese]] reaction of the [[Carracci family|Carraccis]] from the 1580s, although this represented a more effective rejection of Mannerist artificiality. For Freedberg this was "a new and un-Maniera attitude to art";&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 566; Shearman, 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; elsewhere he cautions against confusing Counter-''Maniera'' with "anti-Maniera", apparently reflecting "Anti-Mannerism", the term used by [[Walter Friedländer]] for the "palpable break in the stylistic development of Italian painting" that occurred "sometime around 1590".&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, Part II, p. 47 quoted; Freedberg 606; for more on the "anti-Maniera" of [[Antonio Campi]] see 585–587, and for that of [[Scipione Pulzone]] see 658, and "non-Maniera" is also used; &lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term has not been extended to [[Northern Mannerism]].

Deciding what characterizes a work in Counter-Mannerist style may not be straightforward; in the single brief passage mentioning the term in [[John Shearman]]'s ''Mannerism'' (1967), he picks [[Santi di Tito]]'s ''Vision of St Thomas Aquinas'' (1593, illustrated here, as in both books) as an example of it, but Freedberg excludes Santo's classicising naturalism from the style, though noting his similarities to it.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 624&lt;/ref&gt; Shearman's other main example of Counter-Mannerism is [[Federigo Barocci]], who Freedberg also excludes from his definition.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 178; Freedberg, 632–640&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Many painters looked to revive the styles of [[Raphael]], [[Andrea del Sarto]] and other High Renaissance masters, or drew inspiration from the Venetian masters of the High Renaissance. The example of [[Michelangelo]]'s late work was important for many artists.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 428–429&lt;/ref&gt; The Florentine biographer and critic [[Raffaello Borghini]], author of ''Il Riposo della Pitura e della Scultura'' published in 1584, has been proposed as a theorist, rather late into the course of the trend,&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, "Conclusion"; Borghini is not mentioned by Freedberg&lt;/ref&gt; but his work is little known. The artists of Counter-Mannerism remain relatively unknown,&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; and often hard to see outside Italy, as much of their work was religious and remains in the churches for which it was commissioned, or Italian museums. It was mostly ignored in the hunt by picture dealers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Freedberg says frankly: "Boredom is a requisite of the Roman Counter-Maniera style, invading even the art of the few painters whose inspiration may be too considerable and too authentic to be sealed off wholly".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 499, when discussing [[Girolamo Muziano]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedberg cautions against treating the style as simply a reflection of the decrees of Trent, which were a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft, to the final session in 1563, well after the style had begun to show itself. He describes the decrees as "a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 427–428, 427 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that Freedberg, like the majority of art historians dealing with the period—even today—tended to view mid-to-late sixteenth-century and early seventeenth-century Italian art history through the singular pro-Roman Bolognese lens of [[Gian Pietro Bellori]]'s ''Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects'' - meaning Freedburg may have had little time for any alternative historical narrative that did not support a "pro-Bolognese" artistic account of Counter-''Maniera'' reform.&lt;ref&gt;Giovan Pietro Bellori, The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architect: A New Translation and Critical Edition, ed. Alice Sedgwick Wohl, Helmut Wohl and Tomaso Montanari (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Craposyncrasies''''' or '''''Doozakhrafat''''' is a book by Sorush Pakzad of satirical pieces in [[Persian language|Persian]], which were posted on his personal blog before publication. The book includes 107 stories about gods, prophets, and angels and was published in February 2012 by [[H&amp;S Media]]. The publisher included the book among its top-sellers in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article/-2618581558.html "H&amp;S Media's best sellers" (in Persian), March 03, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Pakzad’s critical approach towards the religious beliefs in the contemporary practices of [[Islam]] caught the attention of many critics. In his foreword to the book, [[Ebrahim Nabavi]], one of the leading Iranian satirists, contends “I have never seen or heard of a book like Doozakhrafat… it is unique, pleasant, and deep.” In an article published in [[openDemocracy]], Nabavi describes Doozakhrafat as "a unique magnum opus" for its "elegance, charm, and wonder" and praises the author as someone "who knows his job, has read much, is well-informed, and has studied theology and philosophy before fooling around with God." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.opendemocracy.net/ebrahim-nabavi/why-so-serious-on-doozakhrafat "Why so serious? on ‘Doozakhrafat’", Ebrahim Nabavi, openDemocracy, November 7, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nabavi encourages his readers to read the book before they die: “I have read many metaphysical and religious texts and I know the literature quite well. I have even tried to write along the path myself. But what Sorush Pakzad has done is way deeper… It has been a while since I have felt so inspired by reading a book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/archive/2012/may/02/article/-8d0e65bd2f.html "Sorush Pakzad's Doozakhrafat" (in Persian), Ebrahim Nabavi, Roozonline, May 2, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Nabavi has described Sorush Pakzad as "an unparalleled talent in satire. His book, 'Doozakhrafat,' is full of original jokes with the universe, God, humans, the creation, heaven, and hell. This genre of satire [in Persian literature] has often lacked elegance and grace.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/Ebrahim.Nabavi.Page/posts/895683890443496 "Interview" (in Persian), Ebrahim Nabavi, Facebook, October 19, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In an article published by [[Il Libraio]], Doozakhrafat has been praised for its success in introducing a creative level of religious satire, without showing hostility in its language&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illibraio.it/satira-religiosa-persia-211603/ "Com’è cambiata la satira religiosa in Iran?", Redazione Il Libraio, Il Libraio, April 23, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;.

[[Mahmud Farjami]], author, journalist, and researcher on Iranian comedy calls ''Doozakhrafat'' “an indisputable masterpiece in Persian parody.” Pakzad, Farjami believes, “is not only familiar with religious texts, fictions, and symbolism, but usually draws a parallel style to develop his story… It is difficult to find another book that contains so many original subjects that have been polished so masterfully.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debsh.com/1391/03/14/2805/ "Book Review" (in Persian), Mahmud Farjami, Rain in an open mouth, June 3, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101035421/http://www.debsh.com/1391/03/14/2805/ |date=November 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://tehranreview.net/articles/13868 "A book review: On Doozakhrafat, on a Fine Parody!", Mahmud Farjami, TehranReview, April 19, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Yaser Mirdamadi]], an Iranian scholar of analytic philosophy of religion and epistemology of Islam, in his interview about freedom of expression in ridiculing religion refers to ''Doozakhrafat'' as a book that satirizes religious beliefs without humiliation and insult:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“[The book] is a successful example of critical religious comedy that, although radical, is not humiliating or offensive. The critical aspect forces you to think while the comic aspect puts a smile on your face. The basis of all satirical pieces on religion in this book is to creatively emphasize this fact that the realm of gods, as depicted in religious practices, is humanly and affected by anthropomorphic perceptions of the divine… One might argue that this approach although morally justifiable, is religiously wrong. It seems that Sorush Pakzad’s critical satire is not only morally inoffensive but also insightful from a religious point of view.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://bamdadkhabar.com/2012/10/18098/ "The Right to Humor" (in Persian), Yaser Mirdamadi, Bamdad Khabar, October 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Roya Sadr]], Iran’s leading female satirist and researcher on [[Persian satire]], in her review of the book, points out some of its literary qualities: “The forms are diverse, unbelievably diverse. The parodies are masterful; moreover, their innovative approach makes them more enjoyable. The writing is minimalistic and does not bore the reader with unnecessary information. Every detail is professionally and artistically designed in its correct position. Even the subtitles are obsessively and thoughtfully picked. Most of the stories enjoy a precise tone, a theatrical atmosphere, believable dialogues, and a surprise element.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/culture/doozakhrafat-a-unique-satirical-voice-in-persian-literature_31084 "Doozakhrafat: a unique satirical voice in Persian literature" , Roya Sadr, Your Middle East, April 1, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;"

“The form and language of the book,” she concludes, “confirms that the author knows what he is doing and has a well crafted view on the topic… All these qualities mixed with the author’s thorough knowledge of the wide range of subjects touched in the book make ''Doozakhrafat'' a rich and insightful piece.”

Using ''Doozakhrafat'' to open a discussion on the little touched topic of the relationship between satire and religion in Iran, Roya Sadr argues, “[the book] aims to challenge the masses’ superstitious perception of the divine in order to… show how anthropomorphic the images of God and the divine is in religious practices… Doozakhrafat enjoys a strong, deep, and penetrating perspective. I do not know the author, but Sorush Pakzad shows from this book that he is a unique and unmatched satirist [among his Persian peers].”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbgoal.com/archives/000587.php "Thoughts on a book: Doozakhrafat" (in Persian), Roya Sadr, BBGoal, October 29, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Facebook post, [[Mehdi Khalaji]], a scholar of [[Islamic studies]], admires ''Doozakhrafat''’s “powerful humor.” “I started reading the book this evening,” writes Khalaji, “it’s a powerful satirical work that applies humor to religious material. Returning the jokes that God plays on us, the book makes fun of God and his kingdom. Well, what goes around comes around!”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/mehdi.khalaji1/posts/414256645372921 " Facebook Post," Mehdi Khalaji, December 21, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural psychology '''is the study of how cultures reflect and shape the psychological processes of their members.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Heine, S. J. (2011). ''Cultural Psychology. ''New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main tenet of cultural psychology is that mind and culture are inseparable and mutually constitutive, meaning that people are shaped by their culture and their culture is also shaped by them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fiske, A.; Kitayama, S.; Markus, H.R.; &amp; Nisbett, R.E. (1998). [http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/Classes/Readings/Heine2010Cult-Psy.pdf The cultural matrix of social psychology]. In D. Gilbert &amp; S. Fiske &amp; G. Lindzey (Eds.), The Handbook of Social Psychology (4th ed., pp. 915–81). San Francisco: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Richard Shweder]], one of the major proponents of the field, writes, "Cultural psychology is the study of the way cultural traditions and social practices regulate, express, and transform the human psyche, resulting less in psychic unity for humankind than in ethnic divergences in mind, self, and emotion."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Shweder, Richard (1991). Thinking Through Cultures. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-88415-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships with other branches of psychology ==
Cultural psychology is often confused with [[cross-cultural psychology]]. However, cultural psychology is distinct from cross-cultural psychology in that the cross-cultural psychologists generally use culture as a means of testing the universality of psychological processes rather than determining how local cultural practices shape psychological processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S. | last2 = Ruby | first2 = M. B. | year = 2010 | title = Cultural Psychology | url = | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science | volume = 1 | issue = | page = 2 | doi = 10.1002/wcs.7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So whereas a cross-cultural psychologist might ask whether [[Jean Piaget]]'s stages of development are universal across a variety of cultures, a cultural psychologist would be interested in how the social practices of a particular set of cultures shape the development of cognitive processes in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markus | first1 = H.R. | last2 = Kitayama | first2 = S. | year = 2003 | title = Culture, Self, and the Reality of the Social | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 277–83 | doi = 10.1207/S15327965PLI1403&amp;4_17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural psychology research informs several fields within psychology, including [[social psychology]], [[cultural-historical psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], and [[cognitive psychology]]. However, the relativist perspective of cultural psychology, through which cultural psychologists compare thought patterns and behaviors within and across cultures, tends to clash with the universal perspectives common in most fields in psychology, which seek to qualify fundamental psychological truths that are consistent across all of humanity.

== Importance ==

=== Need for expanded cultural research ===
According to [[Richard Shweder]], there has been repeated failure to replicate Western psychology laboratory findings in non-Western settings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Therefore, a major goal of cultural psychology is to have many and varied cultures contribute to basic psychological theories in order to correct these theories so that they become more relevant to the predictions, descriptions, and explanations of all human behaviors, not just Western ones.&lt;ref name="schweder84"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Shweder, R.A.|editor2=Levine, R.A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1984|title=Culture theory: Essays on mind, self, and emotion|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal is shared by many of the scholars who promote the [[indigenous psychology]] approach. In an attempt to show the interrelated interests of cultural and indigenous psychology, cultural psychologist Pradeep Chakkarath emphasizes that international mainstream psychology, as it has been exported to most regions of the world by the so-called West, is only one among many indigenous psychologies and therefore may not have enough intercultural expertise to claim, as it frequently does, that its theories have universal validity.&lt;ref name="Chakkarath"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chakkarath, P.|year=2012|chapter-url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396430.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195396430-e-5|chapter=The role of indigenous psychologies in the building of basic cultural psychology|editor=J. Valsiner|title=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology|pages=71–95|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acronym W.E.I.R.D. describes populations that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. Thus far, W.E.I.R.D. populations have been vastly overrepresented in psychological research.&lt;ref name="Arnett"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arnett, J.

Recent research is showing that cultures differ in many areas, such as logical reasoning and social values.&lt;ref name="weirdest"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henrich | first1 = J. | last2 = Heine | first2 = S. J. | last3 = Norenzayan | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = The weirdest people in the world? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 61–135 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X0999152X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird" /&gt; The evidence that basic cognitive and motivational processes vary across populations has become increasingly difficult to ignore. For example, many studies have shown that Americans, Canadians and western Europeans rely on analytical reasoning strategies, which separate objects from their contexts to explain and predict behavior. Social psychologists refer to the "[[fundamental attribution error]]" or  the tendency to explain people's behavior in terms of internal, inherent personality traits rather than external, situational considerations (e.g. attributing an instance of angry behavior to an angry personality). Outside W.E.I.R.D. cultures, however, this phenomenon is less prominent, as many non-W.E.I.R.D. populations tend to pay more attention to the context in which behavior occurs. Asians tend to reason holistically, for example by considering people's behavior in terms of their situation; someone's anger might be viewed as simply a result of an irritating day.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jones, D.|year=2010|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/media/WEIRDinScience.pdf|title=A WEIRD View of Human Nature|journal=Science |volume=328|issue=25|page=1627}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nisbettmiyamoto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nisbett | first1 = R. | last2 = Miyamoto | first2 = Y. | year = 2005 | title = The influence of culture: holistic versus analytic perception | citeseerx=10.1.1.87.43 | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 467–473 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.004 | pmid=16129648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet many long-standing theories of how humans think rely on the prominence of analytical thought.&lt;ref name=":most people are not weird" /&gt;

By studying only W.E.I.R.D. populations, psychologists fail to account for a substantial amount of diversity of the global population. Applying the findings from W.E.I.R.D. populations to other populations can lead to a miscalculation of psychological theories and may hinder psychologists' abilities to isolate fundamental cultural characteristics.

== Mutual constitution ==
Mutual constitution is the notion that the society and the individual have an influencing effect on one another. Because a society is composed of individuals, the behavior and actions of the individuals directly impact the society. In the same manner, society directly impacts the individual living within it. The values, morals, and ways of life a society exemplifies will have an immediate impact on the way an individual is shaped as a person. The atmosphere that a society provides for the individual is a determining factor for how an individual will develop. Furthermore, mutual constitution is a cyclical model in which the society and the individual both influence one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|title=The Cultural Nature of Human Development|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513133-8|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While cultural psychology is reliant on this model, societies often fail to recognize this. Despite the overwhelming acceptance that people affect culture and culture affects people, societal systems tend to minimize the effect that people form on their communities. For example, mission statements of businesses, schools, and foundations attempt make promises regarding the environment and values that their establishment holds. However, these promises cannot be made in accordance with the mutually consisting theory without being upheld by all participants. The mission statement for the employees of Southwest Airlines, for example, makes the claim that, "...We are committed to provide our Employees a stable work environment with equal opportunity for learning and personal growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Southwest|url=https://www.southwest.com/html/about-southwest/index.html?clk=GFOOTER-ABOUT-ABOUT|website=Southwest Airlines}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the company can ensure the "equal opportunity for learning and personal growth", the aforementioned message cannot be promised. The work environment that Southwest provides includes paying consumers. While rules can be enforced to ensure ''safety'' on their aircraft, customers will not be removed due to attitude or a lack of courtesy. This therefore contradicts the promise of a "stable work environment". On the contrary, some establishments do ensure that their mission statements agree with the mutually consisting model. For example, Yale University promises within its mission statement that:
::Yale is committed to improving the world today and for future generations through outstanding research and scholarship, education, preservation, and practice. Yale educates aspiring leaders worldwide who serve all sectors of society. We carry out this mission through the free exchange of ideas in an ethical, interdependent, and diverse community of faculty, staff, students, and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Statement|url=https://www.yale.edu/about-yale/mission-statement|website=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Positive Example of Mutual Constitution in Society.png|thumb|This image is a representation derived from ideas found in the journal article "Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution" by Hazel Rose Markus and Shinoba Kitayama.]]
Instead of making promises that depend on all of their students and faculty, they make statements that can refer to only a part of their student/ faculty body. The statement focuses more on what they offer, and how they uphold these promises. By providing evidence they provide readers with an example as to how their school community members participate in the environment they promise, accepting the community's role in their school culture.

Past research has been conducted by middle-class North Americans analyzing culturally different societies by means of comparison mostly involving middle-class North Americans and/or aforementioned W.E.I.R.D. societies. What has been characterized as Euro-American centrism, resulted in a great volume of research for this specific selection of humans. It has also allowed us to divert from the idea that certain psychological processes can be considered basic or universal, and recognize humans' remarkable capacity to create cultures and then be shaped by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markus |first=Hazel Rose |last2=Kitayama |first2=Shinobu |date=2010 |title=Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=5 |pages=420–430 |doi=10.1177/1745691610375557}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although cultural psychology has internalized the mutually constituting model, further implementation in our society is necessary. Being aware of this model promotes taking responsibility for one's actions and the effect that their actions have on their community. Through acceptance of ones responsibilities and conscious application, communities have opportunity for improvement which in turn supports the individuals within the community. These ideas can be found in the journal article "Cultures and Selves: A Cycle of Mutual Constitution" by Hazel Rose Markus and Shinobu Kitayama which are also represented in the graphic provided.

== Criticisms ==

=== Stereotyping ===
One of the most significant themes in recent years has been cultural differences between East Asians and North Americans in [[attention]],&lt;ref name="masuda01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masuda | first1 = T. | last2 = Nisbett | first2 = R.A. | year = 2001 | title = Attending holistically versus analytically: Comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans | url = http://gsct3237.kaist.ac.kr/e-lib/Culture/Journal/Attending%20holistically%20versus%20analytically.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = 5 | pages = 922–34 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.922 | pmid = 11708567 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111518/http://gsct3237.kaist.ac.kr/e-lib/Culture/Journal/Attending%20holistically%20versus%20analytically.pdf | archivedate = 2013-12-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[perception]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitayama | first1 = S. | last2 = Duffy | first2 = S. | last3 = Kawamura | first3 = T. | last4 = Larsen | first4 = J.T. | year = 2003 | title = Perceiving an object and its context in different cultures: A cultural look at new look | url = http://psy.haifa.ac.il/~ep/Students_Post/Slides/kitayama.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 201–06 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.02432 | pmid = 12741741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cognition]],&lt;ref name="cole"&gt;Cole, M.

The Culture of Morality: Social Development, Context, and Conflict. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Per Gjerde states that cultural psychology tends to "generalize about human development across nations and continents" and assigning characteristics to a culture promotes a disregard for heterogeneity and minimizes the role of the individual.&lt;ref name="uc"&gt;McNulty, Jennifer (2004, July 26). "[http://news.ucsc.edu/2004/07/531.html Emphasis on 'culture' in psychology fuels stereotypes, scholar says.]" University of California: Santa Cruz.&lt;/ref&gt; Gjerde argues that individuals develop multiple perspectives about their culture, sometimes act in accord with their culture without sharing the cultural beliefs, and sometimes outright oppose their culture. Stereotyping thus views individuals as homogeneous products of culture.&lt;ref name="wainryb"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wainryb | first1 = C | year = 2004 | title = The Study of Diversity in Human Development: Culture, Urgencies, and Perils | url = https://psych.utah.edu/people/files/wainryb83r13.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110173541/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/files/wainryb83r13.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2011-11-10 | format = PDF | journal = Human Development | volume = 47 | issue =  | pages = 131–137 | doi = 10.1159/000077986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faulty methodology ===
Self-reporting data is one of the easiest and most accessible methods of mass data collection, especially in cultural psychology.&lt;ref name="masuda01" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitayama | first1 = S. | display-authors = etal | year = 2002 | title = Culture and basic psychological processes—Toward a system view of culture: Comment on Oyserman et al | url = http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/n/x/nxy906/COMPS/indivdualismandcollectivism/culture%20lit/to%20print/Kitayama2002commentsonOyserman.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 1| pages = 89–96 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.128.1.89 | pmid = 11843550 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over-emphasizing cross-cultural comparisons of self-reported attitudes and values can lead to relatively unstable and ultimately misleading data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Lehman | first2 = D.R. | last3 = Peng | first3 = K. | last4 = Greenholtz | first4 = J. | year = 2002 | title = What's wrong with cross-cultural comparisons of subjective Likert scales: The reference-group problem | url = http://culcog.berkeley.edu/Publications/2002JPSP_referencegroup.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 82 | issue = 6| pages = 903–18 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.82.6.903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peng | first1 = K. | last2 = Nisbett | first2 = R.E. | last3 = Wong | first3 = N. | year = 1997 | title = Validity problems of cross-cultural value comparison and possible solutions | url = http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/92164/ValidityProblemsComparingValues.pdf?sequence=1 | journal = Psychological Methods | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 329–41 | doi = 10.1037/1082-989X.2.4.329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Cultural psychologist, Richard Shweder argues that the psyche and culture are mutually constructed and inseparable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The failure of replicating many psychology findings in other regions of the world supported the idea that mind and environment are interdependent, and different throughout the world. Some criticisms state that using self-report may be a relatively unreliable method, and could be misleading especially in different cultural context. Regardless that self-report is an important way to obtain mass data, it is not the only way.

In fact, cultural psychologists utilized multiple measurements and resources no different from other scientific researches – observation, experiment, data analysis etc. For example, Nisbett &amp; Cohen (1996) investigated the relation between historical cultural background and regional aggression difference in the U.S.A. In this study, researchers designed laboratory experiment to observe participants' aggression, and crime rate, demographic statistics were analyzed. The experiment results supported the [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|culture of honor]] theory that the aggression is a defense mechanism which is rooted in the herding cultural origin for most the southerners.&lt;ref name="nisbett96" /&gt; In laboratory observations, Heine and his colleagues found that Japanese students spend more time than American students on tasks that they did poorly on, and the finding presents a self-improvement motivation often seen in East Asian that failure and success is interconvertible with effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cultural psychology|last = Heine|first = Steven|publisher = W.

Quantitative statistics of cultural products revealed that public media in western countries promote more individualistic components than East-Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring Culture Outside the Head: A Meta-Analysis of Individualism—Collectivism in Cultural Products|url = http://psr.sagepub.com/content/12/3/199|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review|date = 2008-08-01|issn = 1088-8683|pmid = 18544712|pages = 199–221|volume = 12|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/1088868308318260|first = Beth|last = Morling|first2 = Marika|last2 = Lamoreaux}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics are objective because it does not involve having people fill out questionnaire, instead, psychologists use physical measurements to quantitatively collect data about culture products, such as painting and photos. These statistics data can also be national records, for example, Chiao &amp; Blizinsky (2010) revealed that cultures of high collectivism is associated with lower prevalence of mood/anxiety disorders in study involving 29 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Culture–gene coevolution of individualism–collectivism and the serotonin transporter gene|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1681/529|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2010-02-22|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 2842692|pmid = 19864286|pages = 529–537|volume = 277|issue = 1681|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.1650|first = Joan Y.|last = Chiao|first2 = Katherine D.|last2 = Blizinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the experimental and statistics data, evidence from neuro-imaging studies, also help strengthen the reliability of cultural psychology research. For example, when thinking of mother, the brain region related to self-concept showed significant activation in Chinese, whereas no activation observed in Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neural basis of cultural influence on self-representation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811906009189|journal = NeuroImage|date = 2007-02-01|pages = 1310–1316|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.08.047|first = Ying|last = Zhu|first2 = Li|last2 = Zhang|first3 = Jin|last3 = Fan|first4 = Shihui|last4 = Han|pmid=17134915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural models ==

"One way we organize and understand our social world is through the use of cultural models or culturally shaped mental maps. These consist of culturally derived ideas and practices that are embodied, enacted, or instituted in everyday life." Cultural psychologists develop models to categorize cultural phenomena.&lt;ref name="Fryberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fryberg | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Markus | first2 = H.R. | year = 2007 | title = Cultural models of education in American Indian, Asian America, and European American contexts | url = | journal = Social Psychology of Education | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 1381–2890 | doi = 10.1007/s11218-007-9017-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 4 I's culture cycle ===

The 4 I's cultural model was developed by [[Hazel Rose Markus]] and Alana Conner in their book ''Clash! 8 Cultural Conflicts That Make Us Who We Are.'' In it, they refer to the mutually constitutive nature of culture and individual as a "culture cycle." The culture cycle consists of four layers (Individuals, Interactions, Institutions, Ideas) of cultural influence that help to explain the interaction between self and culture.&lt;ref name="Markus"&gt;Markus, H. R., &amp; Conner, A. C. (2013). Clash! Eight Cultural Conflicts that Make Us Who We Are. New York: Penguin (Hudson Street Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Individuals ====
The first "I" concerns how an individual thinks about and expresses itself. Studies show that in the United States, individuals are more likely think of him or herself as "independent", "equal", and "individualistic". Individuals have characteristics that are consistent across time and situation.  When asked to describe themselves, Americans are likely to use adjectives to describe their personalities, such as "energetic", "friendly", or "hard-working". In Japan, studies show that individuals are more likely to think of themselves as "obligated to society", "interdependent", and "considerate". The self is adaptable to the situation. Japanese individuals are therefore more likely to describe themselves in relation to others, such as "I try not to upset anyone," or "I am a father, a son, and a brother."&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;Heine, S. (2011). Cultural Psychology. San Francisco: W. W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interactions ====
Interactions with other people and products reinforce cultural behaviors on a daily basis. Stories, songs, architecture, and advertisements are all methods of interaction that guide individuals in a culture to promote certain values and teach them how to behave.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; For example, in Japan, no-smoking signs emphasize the impact that smoke has on others by illustrating the path of smoke as it affects surrounding people. In the US, no-smoking signs focus on individual action by simply saying "No Smoking".  These signs reflect underlying cultural norms and values, and when people see them they are encouraged to behave in accordance with the greater cultural values.

==== Institutions ====
The next layer of culture is made up of the institutions in which everyday interactions take place. These determine and enforce the rules for a society and include legal, government, economic, scientific, philosophical, and religious bodies. Institutions encourage certain practices and products while discouraging others. In Japanese kindergartens, children learn about important cultural values such as teamwork, group harmony, and cooperation. During "birthday month celebration," for example, the class celebrates all the children who have birthdays that month. This institutional practice underscores the importance of a group over an individual. In US kindergartens, children learn their personal value when they celebrate their birthdays one by one, enforcing the cultural value of uniqueness and individualism. Everyday institutional practices such as classroom birthday celebrations propagate prominent cultural themes.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Whiting model ===
John and Beatrice Whiting, along with their research students at [[Harvard University]], developed the "Whiting model" for child development during the 1970s and 1980s, which specifically focused on how culture influences development.&lt;ref name="Worthman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Worthman | first1 = C. M. | year = 2010 | title = The Ecology of Human Development: Evolving Models for Cultural Psychology | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 546–562 | doi = 10.1177/0022022110362627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whitings coined the term "cultural learning environment", to describe the surroundings that influence a child during development.&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;Edwards, Carolyn P. and Bloch, M. (2010). "[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1500&amp;context=psychfacpub The Whitings' Concepts of Culture and How They Have Fared in Contemporary Psychology and Anthropology]." Faculty Publications, Department of Psychology.Paper 501.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beatrice Whiting defined a child's environmental contexts as being "characterized by an activity in progress, a physically defined space, a characteristic group of people, and norms of behavior".&lt;ref name="edwards" /&gt; This environment is composed of several layers. A child's geographical context influences the history/anthropology of their greater community. This results in maintenance systems (i.e., sociological characteristics) that form a cultural learning environment. These factors inform learned behavior, or progressive expressive systems that take the form of religion, magic beliefs, ritual and ceremony, art, recreation, games and play, or crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Berry, Ype H. Poortinga, Marshall H. Segall, Pierre R. Dasen, Cambridge University Press, 1992, Cross-Cultural Psychology: Research and Applications: Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Many researchers have expanded upon the Whiting model,&lt;ref name="Worthman" /&gt; and the Whiting model's influence is clear in both modern psychology and anthropology. According to an article by Thomas Weisner in the ''[[Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology]]'', "All these [more recent] approaches share a common intellectual project: to take culture and context deeply and seriously into account in studies of human development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisner | first1 = T.S. | year = 2010 | title = John and Beatrice Whiting's Contributions to the Cross-Cultural Study of Human Development: Their Values, Goals, Norms, and Practices | url = http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/41/4/499.full.pdf+html | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 499–509 | doi = 10.1177/0022022110362720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and motivation ==

=== Self-enhancement vs. self-improvement ===
While self-enhancement is a person's motivation to view themselves positively, self-improvement is a person's motivation to have others view themselves positively. The distinction between the two modes of life is most evident between independent and collectivistic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heine|first=Steven|date=1999|title=Is there a universal need for positive self-regard?|url=|journal=2017 American Psychological Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultures with independent self-views (the premise that people see themselves as self-contained entities) often emphasize self-esteem, confidence in one's own worth and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2007/06/07/high-self-esteem-may-be-culturally-universal-international-study-shows/|title=High self-esteem may be culturally universal, international study shows|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With self-esteem seen as a main source of happiness in Western cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hyunji|date=February 2016|title=The Role of Positive Self-Evaluation on Cross-Cultural Differences in Well-Being|url=|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the motivation to self-enhance generally follows as a way to maintain one's positive view about oneself. Some strategies employed when self-enhancing often include [[Social comparison theory|downward social comparison]], compensatory self-enhancement, discounting, [[Attribution (psychology)|external attributions]] and [[basking in reflected glory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Psychology|last=Heine|first=Steven|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, collectivistic cultures often emphasize self-improvement as a leading motivating factor in their lives. This motivation is often derived from a desire to not lose face and to appear positively among social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heine |first1=Steven J. |last2=Raineri |first2=Andres |title=Self-Improving Motivations and Collectivism |journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |date=January 2009 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=158–163 |doi=10.1177/0022022108326193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and empathy ==

=== Cultural orientation: collectivistic and individualistic ===
A main distinction to understand when looking at psychology and culture is the difference between [[Individualism|individualistic]] and [[Collectivism|collectivistic]] cultures. People from an individualistic culture typically demonstrate an independent view of the self; the focus is usually on personal achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prooijen|first1=J.|title=Individualistic and social motives for justice judgments|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=2013|volume=1299|issue=1|pages=60–67|doi=10.1111/nyas.12143|pmid=25708080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of a collectivistic society have more of a focus on the group (interdependent view of self), usually focusing on things that will benefit the group.&lt;ref name="Hui (1988)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hui|first1=C.H.|title=Measurement of individualism-collectivism|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=1988|volume=22|issue=1|pages=17–36|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(88)90022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown such differences of the self when comparing collectivistic and individualistic cultures: The [[Fundamental attribution error|Fundamental Attribution Error]] has been shown to be more common in America (individualistic) as compared to in India (collectivistic).&lt;ref name="Ross (1977)"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ross|authorlink1=L.|editor1-last=Berkowitz|editor1-first=L.|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1977|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|edition=4th|chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these same lines, the [[self-serving bias]] was again shown as more common among Americans than Japanese individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kashima|first1=Y.|authorlink2=Harry C. Triandis|last2=Triandis|first2=H.C.|title=The self-serving bias in attributions as a coping strategy: A cross-cultural study|journal=Journal of Cross-cultural Psychology|date=1986|volume=17|issue=1|pages=83–97|doi=10.1177/0022002186017001006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in a study involving an animation of fish, wherein Western viewers interpreted the scene of a fish swimming away from a school as an expression of individualism and independence, while Eastern individuals wondered what was wrong with the singular fish and concluded that the school had kicked it out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.learner.org/resources/transcripts/DiscoveringPsychology/26CulPsych.pdf|title=Discovering Psychology: Cultural Psychology|last=Zimbardo|first=Philip|date=|website=Learner.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that in coverage of the same instance of violent crime, Western news focused on innate character flaws and the failings of the individual while Chinese news pointed out the lack of relationships of the perpetrator in a foreign environment and the failings of society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is not to imply that collectivism and individualism are completely dichotomous, but these two cultural orientations are to be understood more so as a spectrum. Each representation is at either end; thus, some members of individualistic cultures may hold collectivistic values, and some collectivistic individual may hold some individualist values. The concepts of collectivism and individualism show a general idea of the values of a specific ethnic culture but should not be juxtaposed in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hofstede|first1=G.|title=Culture's consequences: International differences in work-related values|date=1980|publisher=Sage|location=Beverly Hills, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Empathy across cultures ===
These differences in values across cultures suggests that understanding and expressing empathy may be manifested differently throughout varying cultures. Duan and Hill&lt;ref name="Duan &amp; Hill (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=C.|last2=Hill|first2=C.E.|title=The current state of empathy research|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=1996|volume=43|issue=3|pages=261–74|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.43.3.261}}&lt;/ref&gt; first discussed empathy in subcategories of intellectual empathy: taking on someone's thoughts/perspective, also known as cognitive empathy&lt;ref name="Soto &amp; Levenson (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soto|first1=J.A.|last2=Levenson|first2=R.W.|title=Emotion recognition across culture: The influence of ethnicity on empathic accuracy and physiological linkage|journal=Emotion|date=2009|volume=9|issue=6|doi=10.1037/a0017399|pages=874–884|pmc=2877627}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotional empathy:  taking on someone's feeling/experience. Duan, Wei, and Wang&lt;ref name="Duan, Wei, &amp; Wang (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=C.|last2=Wei|first2=M.|last3=Wang|first3=L.|title=The role of individualism-collectivism|journal=Asian Journal of Counseling|date=2008|volume=29|issue=3|pages=57–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthered this idea to include empathy in terms of being either dispositional (capacity for noticing/understanding empathy) or experiential (specific to a certain context or situation, observing the person and empathizing). This created four types of empathy to further examine: 1) dispositional intellectual empathy; 2) dispositional empathic emotion; 3) experienced intellectual empathy; and 4) experienced empathic emotion. These four branches allowed researchers to examine empathic proclivities among individuals of different cultures. While individualism was not shown to correlate with either types of dispositional empathy, collectivism was shown to have a direct correlation with both types of dispositional empathy, possibly suggesting that by having less focus on the self, there is more capacity towards noticing the needs of others. More so, individualism predicted experienced intellectual empathy, and collectivism predicted experienced empathic emotion. These results are congruent with the values of collectivistic and individualistic societies. The self-centered identity and egoistic motives prevalent in individualistic cultures, perhaps acts as a hindrance in being open to (fully) experiencing empathy.&lt;ref name="Kitayama &amp; Markus (1994)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitayama|first1=S.|last2=Markus|first2=H.R.|title=Emotion and culture: Empirical studies of mutual influence|date=1994|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intercultural and ethnocultural empathy ===
Cultural empathy became broadly understood as concurrent understanding and acceptance of a culture different from one's own.&lt;ref name="Ridley &amp; Lingle (1996)"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ridely, C.R.|author2=Lingle, D.W.|editor1-last=Pedersen|editor1-first=P.B.|editor2-last=Draguns|editor2-first=J.G.|title=Counseling Across Culture|date=1996|publisher=Sage|location=Thousands Oaks: CA|chapter=Cultural empathy in multicultural counseling: A multidimensional process model.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea has been further developed with the concept of [[ethnocultural empathy]].&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Y.W.|last2=Blier|first2=J.|last3=Davidson|first3=M.|last4=Savoy|first4=H.|last5=Tan|first5=J.|last6=Tan|first6=J.|last7=Yakushka|first7=O.|title=The scale of ethnocultural empathy: Development, validation, and reliability|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=2003|volume=2|pages=221–234|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.50.2.221}}&lt;/ref&gt; This moves beyond merely accepting and understanding another culture, and also includes acknowledging how the values of a culture may affect empathy. This idea is meant to foster cultural empathy as well as engender cultural competence.&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyche &amp; Zayas (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyche|first1=L.|last2=Zayas|first2=L.H.|title=Cross-cultural empathy and training the contemporary psychotherapist|journal=Clinical Social Work Journal|date=2001|volume=29|issue=3|pages=245–258|doi=10.1023/A:1010407728614}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the greatest barriers of empathy between cultures is people's tendency to operate from an ethnocentric point of view. Eysneck&lt;ref name="Eysenck (2000)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eysenck|first1=M.|title=Psychology: A student's handbook|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press LTD}}&lt;/ref&gt; conceptualized ethnocentrism as using one's own culture to understand the rest of the world, while holding one's own values as correct. Concomitant with this barrier to intercultural empathy, Rasoal, Eklund, and Hansen&lt;ref name="Raosal, Eklund, &amp; Hansen (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raosal|first1=C.|last2=Eklund|first2=J.|last3=Hansen|first3=E.M.|title=Toward a conceptualization of ethnocultural empathy|journal=Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology|date=2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1037/h0099278}}&lt;/ref&gt; posit five hindrances of intercultural empathy; these include:

Paucity of:
* (general) knowledge outside one's own culture
* (general) experience with other cultures outside one's own
* (specific) knowledge regarding other people's cultures
* (specific) experiences regarding other people's cultures

and:
* inability to bridge different cultures by understanding the commonalities and dissimilarities

These five points elucidate lack of both depth and breadth as hindrances in developing and practicing intercultural empathy.

Another barrier to intercultural empathy is that there is often a power dynamic between different cultures. Bridging an oppressed culture with their (upper-echelon) oppressor is a goal of intercultural empathy.  One approach to this barrier is to attempt to acknowledge one's personal oppression.&lt;ref name="DeTurk (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeTurk|first1=S.|title=Intercultural empathy: Myth, competency, or possibility for alliance building?|journal=Communication Building|date=2001|volume=50|issue=4|pages=374–384|doi=10.1080/03634520109379262}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this may be minimal in comparison to other people's oppression, it will still help with realizing that other people have been oppressed.&lt;ref name="DeTurk (2001)" /&gt; The goal of bridging the gap should focus on building an alliance by finding the core commonalities of the human experience; this shows empathy to be a relational experience, not an independent one. Through this, the goal is that intercultural empathy can lend toward broader intercultural understanding across cultures and societies.

Four important facets of cultural empathy are:&lt;ref name="Wang et al. (2003)" /&gt;
* Taking the perspective of someone from a different culture
* Understanding the verbal/behavioral expression that occurs during ethnocultural empathy
* Being cognizant of how different cultures are treated by larger entities such as the job market and the media
* Accepting differences in cultural choices regarding language, clothing preference, food choice, etc.

These four aspects may be especially helpful for practicing cultural competence in a clinical setting. Given that most psychological practices were founded on the parochial ideals of Euro-American psychologists, cultural competence was not considered much of a necessity until said psychologists increasingly began seeing clients with different ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Dyche &amp; Zayas (2001)" /&gt; Many of the problems that contribute to therapy not being beneficial for people of color include: therapy having an individual focus, an emphasis on expressiveness, and an emphasis on openness.&lt;ref name="Sue &amp; Sue (1977)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sue|first1=D.W.|last2=Sue|first2=D.|title=Barriers to effective cross-cultural counseling|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=1977|volume=24|issue=5|pages=420–429|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.24.5.420}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more on intercultural competence, see [[intercultural competence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1592">A '''device-independent pixel''' (also: ''density-independent pixel'', ''dip'', ''dp'') is a physical [[Units of measurement|unit of measurement]] based on a coordinate system held by a computer and represents an abstraction of a [[pixel]] for use by an application that an underlying system then converts to physical pixels.

A typical use is to allow mobile device software to scale the display of information and user interaction to different screen sizes. The abstraction allows an application to work in pixels as a measurement, while the underlying graphics system converts the abstract pixel measurements of the application into real pixel measurements appropriate to the particular device.
For example, on the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system a device-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 [[Dots per inch|dpi]] screen,&lt;ref&gt;http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#dips-pels&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] specifies one device-independent pixel as equivalent to 1/96th of an inch.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/text/archive/2009/12/11/wpf-text-measurement-units.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

As dp is a physical unit it has an absolute value which can be measured in traditional units, e.g. for Android devices 1 dp equals 1/160 of inch or 0.15875 mm.

While traditional pixels only refer to the display of information, device-independent pixels may also be used to measure user input such as input on a touch screen device.

A diazotroph is a [[microorganism]] that is able to grow without external sources of fixed nitrogen. Examples of organisms that do this are [[rhizobia]] and ''[[Frankia]]'' (in symbiosis) and ''[[Azospirillum]]''. All diazotrophs contain iron-molybdenum or -vanadium [[nitrogenase]] systems. Two of the most studied systems are those of ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' and ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]''. These systems are used because of their genetic tractability and their fast growth.&lt;ref name=DK94&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dixon R, Kahn D | title = Genetic regulation of biological nitrogen fixation | journal = Nature Reviews. Microbiology | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | pages = 621–31 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15263897 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word diazotroph is derived from the words ''diazo'' ("di" = two + "a" = without + "zoe" = life) meaning "dinitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)" and ''troph'' meaning "pertaining to food or nourishment", in summary dinitrogen utilizing. The word ''azote'' means nitrogen in French and was named by French chemist and biologist Antoine Lavoisier, who saw it as the part of air which cannot sustain life. &lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Diazotroph | title=Diazotroph - Biology-Online Dictionary &amp;#124; Biology-Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of diazotrophs==
Diazotrophs are scattered across [[bacterial|Bacteria]] taxonomic groups (as well as a couple of [[Archaea]]). Even within a species that can fix nitrogen there may be strains that do not fix nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt; Fixation is shut off when other sources of nitrogen are available, and, for many species, when oxygen is at high partial pressure. Bacteria have different ways of dealing with the debilitating effects of oxygen on nitrogenases, listed below.

===Free-living diazotrophs===
* Anaerobes—these are obligate anaerobes that cannot tolerate oxygen even if they are not fixing nitrogen. They live in habitats low in oxygen, such as soils and decaying vegetable matter. ''[[Clostridium]]'' is an example. Sulphate-reducing bacteria are important in ocean sediments (e.g. ''[[Desulfovibrio]]''), and some Archean methanogens, like [[Methanococcus]], fix nitrogen in muds, animal intestines&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt; and anoxic soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bae HS, Morrison E, Chanton JP, Ogram A | title = Methanogens Are Major Contributors to Nitrogen Fixation in Soils of the Florida Everglades | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 84 | issue = 7 | pages = e02222–17 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29374038 | pmc = 5861825 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.02222-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Facultative anaerobes—these species can grow either with or without oxygen, but they only fix nitrogen anaerobically. Often, they respire oxygen as rapidly as it is supplied, keeping the amount of free oxygen low. Examples include ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Paenibacillus polymyxa]]'', ''[[Bacillus macerans]]'', and ''[[Escherichia intermedia]]''.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt;
* Aerobes—these species require oxygen to grow, yet their nitrogenase is still debilitated if exposed to oxygen. ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]'' is the most studied of these organisms. It uses very high respiration rates, and protective compounds, to prevent oxygen damage. Many other species also reduce the oxygen levels in this way, but with lower respiration rates and lower oxygen tolerance.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt;
* Oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria ([[cyanobacteria]]) generate oxygen as a by-product of [[photosynthesis]], yet some are able to fix nitrogen as well. These are colonial bacteria that have specialized cells ([[heterocyst]]s) that lack the oxygen generating steps of photosynthesis. Examples are ''[[Anabaena cylindrica]]'' and ''[[Nostoc commune]]''. Other [[cyanobacteria]] lack heterocysts and can fix nitrogen only in low light and oxygen levels (e.g. ''[[Plectonema]]'').&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt; Some cyanobacteria, including the highly abundant marine taxa ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' and ''[[Synechococcus]]'' do not fix nitrogen &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zehr JP | title = Nitrogen fixation by marine cyanobacteria | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 162–73 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21227699 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2010.12.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, whilst other marine cyanobacteria, such as ''[[Trichodesmium]]'' and ''[[Cyanothece]]'', are  major contributors to oceanic nitrogen fixation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bergman B, Sandh G, Lin S, Larsson J, Carpenter EJ | title = Trichodesmium--a widespread marine cyanobacterium with unusual nitrogen fixation properties | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 286–302 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 22928644 | pmc = 3655545 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2012.00352.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria do not generate oxygen during photosynthesis, having only a single photosystem which cannot split water. Nitrogenase is expressed under nitrogen limitation. Normally, the expression is regulated via negative feedback from the produced ammonium ion but in the absence of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the product is not formed, and the by-product H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; continues unabated [Biohydrogen]. Example species: ''Rhodobacter sphaeroides'', ''Rhodopseudomonas palustris'', ''Rhodobacter capsulatus''.&lt;ref name=Blankenship&gt;Blankenship RE, Madigan MT &amp; Bauer CE (1995). Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Dordrecht, The Netherlands, Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbiotic diazotrophs===
* [[Rhizobia]]—these are the species that associate with legumes, plants of the [[Fabaceae]] family. Oxygen is bound to [[leghemoglobin]] in the root nodules that house the bacterial symbionts, and supplied at a rate that will not harm the [[nitrogenase]].&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt;
* [[Frankia]]s—much less is known about these '[[actinorhizal]]' nitrogen fixers. The bacteria also infect the roots leading to the formation of nodules. Actinorhizal nodules consist of several lobes, each lobe has a similar structure as a lateral root. Frankia is able to colonize the cortical tissue of nodules where it fixes nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Vessey /&gt; Actinorhizal plants and Frankias also produce haemoglobins,&lt;ref name=Beckwith02&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beckwith J, Tjepkema JD, Cashon RE, Schwintzer CR, Tisa LS | title = Hemoglobin in five genetically diverse Frankia strains | journal = Canadian Journal of Microbiology | volume = 48 | issue = 12 | pages = 1048–55 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12619816 | doi = 10.1139/w02-106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but their role is less well established than for rhizobia.&lt;ref name=Vessey /&gt; Although at first it appeared that they inhabit sets of unrelated plants ([[alder]]s, [[Australian pine]]s, [[Ceanothus|California lilac]], [[bog myrtle]], [[Purshia|bitterbrush]], ''[[Dryas (plant)|Dryas]]''), revisions to the [[phylogeny]] of [[angiosperm]]s show a close relatedness of these species and the legumes.&lt;ref name=Soltis&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soltis DE, Soltis PS, Morgan DR, Swensen SM, Mullin BC, Dowd JM, Martin PG | title = Chloroplast gene sequence data suggest a single origin of the predisposition for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in angiosperms | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 92 | issue = 7 | pages = 2647–51 | date = March 1995 | pmid = 7708699 | pmc = 42275 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.92.7.2647 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vessey&gt;{{cite journal |author = Vessey JK, Pawlowski, K and Bergman B |title=Root-based N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing symbioses: Legumes, actinorhizal plants, ''Parasponia'' sp and cycads |journal=Plant and Soil |year=2005 |volume=274 |issue=1–2 |pages=51–78 |doi= 10.1007/s11104-005-5881-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These footnotes suggest the ontogeny of these replicates rather than the phylogeny. In other words, an ancient gene (from before the angiosperms and gymnosperms diverged) that is unused in most species was reawakened and reused in these species.
* [[Cyanobacteria]]—there are also symbiotic cyanobacteria. Some associate with [[fungi]] as [[lichen]]s, with [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, with a [[fern]], and with a [[cycad]].&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt; These do not form nodules (indeed most of the plants do not have roots). Heterocysts exclude the oxygen, as discussed above. The fern association is important agriculturally: the water fern ''[[Azolla]]'' harbouring ''[[Anabaena]]'' is an important green manure for [[rice]] culture.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt;
* Association with animals—although diazotrophs have been found in many animal guts, there is usually sufficient ammonia present to suppress nitrogen fixation.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt; [[Termite]]s on a low nitrogen diet allow for some fixation, but the contribution to the termite's nitrogen supply is negligible. [[Shipworm]]s may be the only species that derive significant benefit from their gut symbionts.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt;

==Importance==
In terms of generating nitrogen available to all organisms, the symbiotic associations greatly exceed the free-living species with the exception of cyanobacteria.&lt;ref name=Postgate98/&gt;

'''Digital Video Effects''', commonly called '''DVE'''s, are visual effects that provide comprehensive video image manipulation, in the same form as [[optical printer]] effects in film. DVEs differ from standard [[video switcher]] effects (often referred to as "analog effects") such as wipes or dissolves, in that they deal primarily with resizing, distortion or movement of the image. Modern video switchers often contain internal DVE functionality.

Early examples of DVE devices found in the broadcast [[post-production]] industry include the [[Ampex]] ADO ("Ampex Digital Optics"),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rxuU_TaFiw&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantel]] DPE-5000, Vital Squeezoom,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zh7hIL4Ttw&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nippon Electric Corporation|NEC]] DVE and Abekas A-51.&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/45687938&lt;/ref&gt; 

DVEs are used by the [[broadcast television]] industry in [[live television]] production environments like [[television studio]]s and [[outside broadcast]]s. They are commonly used in video [[post-production]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14462">{{about|the discipline concerned with the analysis and authentication of historical and other documents|the practice of conducting negotiations between groups or states|Diplomacy}}

'''Diplomatics''' (in American English, and in most anglophone countries), or '''diplomatic''' (in British English),&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|diplomatic, adj. and n.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brooke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beal"/&gt; is a scholarly discipline centred on the critical analysis of [[document]]s: especially, [[historical document]]s. It focuses on the conventions, protocols and formulae that have been used by document creators, and uses these to increase understanding of the processes of document creation, of information transmission, and of the relationships between the facts which the documents purport to record and reality.

The discipline originally evolved as a tool for studying and determining the authenticity of the official [[charter]]s and [[diploma]]s issued by royal and papal [[chancery (medieval office)|chanceries]]. It was subsequently appreciated that many of the same underlying principles could be applied to other types of official document and [[legal instrument]], to non-official documents such as private [[Letter (message)|letters]], and, most recently, to the [[metadata]] of electronic records.

Diplomatics is one of the [[auxiliary sciences of history]]. It should not be confused with its sister-discipline of [[palaeography]].&lt;ref name="Duranti12"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duranti |first=Luciana |authorlink=Luciana Duranti |title=Diplomatics: New uses for an Old Science |journal=Archivaria |volume=28 |year=1989 |url=http://archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/viewFile/11567/12513 |pages=7–27 (12) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, its techniques have more in common with those of the literary disciplines of [[textual criticism]] and [[historical criticism]].

==Etymology==
[[File:De re diplomatica 17765.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of [[Jean Mabillon]]'s ''De re diplomatica'' (1681)]]

Despite the verbal similarity, the discipline has nothing to do with [[diplomacy]]. Both terms are derived, by separate linguistic development, from the word ''diploma'', which originally referred to a folded piece of writing material—and thus both to the materials which are the focus of study in diplomatics, and to accreditation papers carried by diplomats.

The word ''diplomatics'' was effectively coined by the [[Benedictine]] monk [[Jean Mabillon]], who in 1681 published his treatise, ''De re diplomatica'' ([[Latin]]: roughly, "The Study of Documents"). From there, the word entered the French language as ''diplomatique'', and then English as ''diplomatic'' or ''diplomatics''.

==Definitions==
''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' (1828) defines diplomatics as the "science of diplomas, or of ancient writings, literary and public documents, letters, decrees, charters, codicils, etc., which has for its object to decipher old writings, to ascertain their authenticity, their date, signatures, etc."&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Dictionary'' (1828); quoted in [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (2d ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Giorgio Cencetti (1908–1970) defined the discipline as "the study of the ''Wesen'' [being] and ''Werden'' [becoming] of documentation, the analysis of genesis, inner constitution and transmission of documents, and of their relationship with the facts represented in them and with their creators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Giorgio |last=Cencetti |chapter=La Preparazione dell'Archivista |title=Antologia di Scritti Archivistici |editor-first=Romualdo |editor-last=Giuffrida |place=Rome |publisher=Archivi di Stato |year=1985 |page=285}} Translation from Duranti 1989, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commission International de Diplomatique]] has defined diplomatics as "the science which studies the tradition, the form and the issuing of written documents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cei.lmu.de/VID/VID.php?1 |title=Vocabulaire Internationale de Diplomatique |editor-first=Maria Milagros |editor-last=Cárcel Ortí |edition=2nd |place=Valencia |year=1997 |publisher=Collecció Oberta |page=21 |quote=La Diplomatique est la science qui étudie la tradition, la forme et l'élaboration des actes écrits. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More pragmatically, Peter Beal defines diplomatics as "the science or study of documents and records, including their forms, language, script and meaning. It involves knowledge of such matters as the established wording and procedures of particular kinds of document, the deciphering of writing, and document analysis and authentication".&lt;ref name="beal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter|last=Beal |title=A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology, 1450–2000 |year=2008 |place=Oxford| publisher=Oxford University Press| page=121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theo Kölzer defines diplomatics as "the teaching and the study of charters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kölzer |first=Theo |chapter=Diplomatics |title=Handbook of Medieval Studies: Terms – methods – trends |editor-first=Albrecht |editor-last=Classen |place=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |year=2010 |isbn=9783110184099 |volume=1 |pages=405–424 (405) }}&lt;/ref&gt; He treats the terms "charter", "diploma", and "document" as broadly synonymous, and refers to the German scholar [[Harry Bresslau]]'s definition of "documents" as "written declarations recorded in compliance with certain forms alternating according to the difference in person, place, time, and matter, which are meant to serve as a testimony of proceedings of a legal nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bresslau |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Bresslau |title=Handbuch der Urkundenlehre für Deutschland und Italien |volume=1 |edition=4th |year=1969 |place=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly speaking, and as usually understood by present-day scholars, diplomatics is concerned essentially with the analysis and interpretation of the linguistic and textual elements of a document. It is, however, closely associated with several parallel disciplines, including [[palaeography]], [[sigillography]], [[codicology]], and [[provenance]] studies, all of which are concerned with a document's physical characteristics and history, and which will often be carried out in conjunction with a diplomatic analysis. The term diplomatics is therefore sometimes used in a slightly wider sense, to encompass some of these other areas (as it was in Mabillon's original work, and as is implied in the definitions of both Webster and Beal quoted above). The recent development of the science in non-English Europe is expanding its scope to a cultural history of documentation including aspects of [[pragmatic literacy]] or [[symbolic communication]].

[[Christopher N. L. Brooke|Christopher Brooke]], a distinguished teacher of diplomatics, referred to the discipline's reputation in 1970 as that of "a formidable and dismal science ... a kind of game played by a few scholars, most of them medievalists, harmless so long as it does not dominate or obscure historical enquiry; or, perhaps, most commonly of all, an aid to understanding of considerable use to scholars and research students if only they had time to spare from more serious pursuits".&lt;ref name="brooke"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooke |first=Christopher N. L. |authorlink=Christopher N. L. Brooke |title=The teaching of Diplomatic |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=4 |year=1970 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1080/00379817009513930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[image:Traité de diplomatique tome 4 17008.jpg|thumb|Title page of Volume 4 of [[René-Prosper Tassin|Tassin]] and [[Charles-François Toustain|Toustain]]'s ''Nouveau traité de diplomatique'' (1759)]]
In the [[Ancient history|ancient]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] periods, the authenticity of a document was considered to derive from the document's place of preservation and storage, in, for example, temples, public offices, and archives. As a result, those with nefarious motives were able to give [[Forgery|forged documents]] a spurious authenticity by depositing them in places of authority. Diplomatics grew from a need to establish new standards of authenticity through the critical analysis of the textual and physical forms of documents.&lt;ref name="Duranti12"/&gt;

The first notable application of diplomatics was by [[Nicolas of Cusa]], in 1433, and [[Lorenzo Valla]], in 1440, who determined, independently, that the [[Donation of Constantine]], which had been used for centuries to legitimize papal temporal authority, was a forgery.  Diplomatics became important during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Duranti 1989, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Its emergence as a recognisably distinct sub-discipline, however, is generally dated to the publication of [[Jean Mabillon|Mabillon's]] ''De re diplomatica'' in 1681. Mabillon had begun studying old documents with a view towards establishing their authenticity as a result of the doubts raised by the [[Jesuit]] [[Daniel van Papenbroek]] over supposed [[Merovingian]] documents from the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], the production of spurious [[charter]]s and other documents had been common, either to provide written documentation of existing rights or to bolster the plausibility of claimed rights. Mabillon's work engendered a far livelier awareness of the potential presence of forged or spurious documents, in the fields of both [[history]] and [[law]].

Although Mabillon is still widely seen as the "father" of diplomatics, a more important milestone in the formation of the battery of practical techniques which make up the modern discipline was the publication of [[René-Prosper Tassin]] and [[Charles-François Toustain]]'s ''Nouveau traité de diplomatique'', which appeared in six volumes in 1750–65.

The most significant work in English was [[Thomas Madox]]'s ''Formulare Anglicanum'', published in 1702. In general, however, the discipline was always studied more intensively by continental scholars than by those in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison |first=Charlotte |title=Thomas Madox and the Origins of English Diplomatic Scholarship |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=147–169 |doi=10.1080/00379810902916282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomatics is often associated with the study of documents of the medieval period. However, scholars such as [[Luciana Duranti]] have argued that many of its theories and principles can be adapted and applied to contemporary [[archival science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams |first=Caroline |title=Diplomatic Attitudes: from Mabillon to Metadata |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=26 |year=2005 |pages=1–24 |doi=10.1080/00039810500047417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duranti 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The study of diplomatics is a valuable tool for [[historian]]s, enabling them to determine whether alleged [[historical document]]s and [[archive]]s are in fact genuine or [[forgery|forgeries]]. Its techniques may also be used to help date undated documents.

Diplomatics has many similar applications in the field of [[law]].

Some famous cases in which the principles of diplomatics have been employed have included:
* [[Lorenzo Valla]]'s proof of the forgery of the [[Donation of Constantine]]. Valla's work preceded Mabillon by roughly two centuries, and was the first application of the principles of modern, scientific diplomatics.
* The [[Hitler diaries]] [[hoax]] (1983).
* The [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#Forgeries discovered in 2005|National Archives forgeries]] (the Martin Allen forgeries, or [[Himmler]] forged documents) (2005).

==Diplomatic editions and transcription==
A '''diplomatic edition''' is an edition (in print or online) of an historic manuscript text that seeks to reproduce as accurately as possible in typography all significant features of the manuscript original, including spelling and punctuation, abbreviations, deletions, insertions, and other alterations. Similarly, '''diplomatic transcription''' attempts to represent by means of a system of editorial signs all features of a manuscript original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gregory A. |last=Pass |title=Descriptive Cataloging of Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and Early Modern Manuscripts |place=Chicago |publisher=Association of College and Research Libraries |year=2003 |page=144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''semi-diplomatic'' is used for an edition or transcription that seeks to reproduce only some of these features of the original. A diplomatic edition is thus distinguished from a ''normalized edition'', in which the editor, while not altering the original wording of the text, renders it using normal (modern) [[orthography]].

A diplomatic edition is also to be distinguished both from a ''[[facsimile]] edition'', which, in the modern era, normally employs photographic or digital images; and from a ''type facsimile'' (such as [[Abraham Farley]]'s [[Publication of Domesday Book#Abraham Farley's edition (1773–1783)|edition of ''Domesday Book'']]), which seeks to reproduce the appearance of the original through the use of a [[Record type|special typeface]] or [[Medieval Unicode Font Initiative|digital font]].

'''Ecolinguistics''', or '''ecological linguistics''', emerged in the 1990s as a new [[paradigm|frame of study]] of linguistic research, widening [[sociolinguistics]] to take into account not only the social context in which language is embedded, but also the [[ecology|ecological]] context.

[[Michael Halliday]]'s 1990 paper ''New ways of Meaning: the challenge to applied linguistics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K.|first=Halliday, M. A.|date=April 1990|title=New Ways of Meaning: A Challenge to Applied Linguistics.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED324960}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often credited as a seminal work which provided the stimulus for linguists to consider the ecological context and consequences of language. Among other things, the challenge that Halliday put forward was to make linguistics relevant to overarching contemporary issues, particularly the widespread destruction of the [[ecosystem]]s that life depends on. The main example Halliday gave was that of 'economic growth', describing how 'countless texts repeated daily all around the world contain a simple message: growth is good. Many is better than few, more is better than less, big is better than small, grow is better than shrink', which leads to ecologically destructive consequences. 

==Overview==
Since Halliday's initial comments, the field of ecolinguistics has developed in several directions, employing a wide range of linguistic frameworks and tools to investigate language in an ecological context. The [http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ International Ecolinguistics Association], characterizes ecolinguistics in these terms:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ecolinguistics explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org|title=The International Ecolinguistics Association|website=ecolinguistics-association.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this way, the 'eco' of ecolinguistics corresponds to ecology in its literal sense of the relationship of organisms (including humans) with other organisms and the physical environment. This is a sense shared with other ecological humanities disciplines such as ecocriticism and ecopsychology.

The term 'ecolinguistics' has also been used with a metaphorical sense of 'ecology', for example in '[[Linguistic ecology]]', 'communication ecology' and 'learning ecology' in ways which do not include consideration of other species or the physical environment. This is becoming less prevalent now as ecolingusitics becomes increasingly understood as a form of ecological humanities/social science.

Another aspect of ecolinguistics is the influence of the natural world on language. In 1996, [[David Abram]]'s book, ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World,'' described how the wider ecology (or 'the more than human world') shapes language in oral cultures (Abram, 1996), helping people attune to their environment. On the other hand, writing has gradually alienated people in literate cultures from the natural world, to the extent that 'our organic atonement to the local earth is thwarted by our ever-increasing intercourse with our own signs' (1996:267).

Overall there are three main areas of interest for ecolinguistics. The first can be described as 'The Ecological Analysis of Language', the second 'Language Diversity', and the third 'The Influence of Ecology on Language'.

==Ecological analysis of language==

The ecological analysis of language draws on a wide range of linguistic tools including critical discourse analysis, framing theory, cognitive linguistics, identity theory, rhetoric and systemic functional grammar to reveal underlying worldviews or the 'stories we live by'. The stories we live by are cognitive structures in the minds of individuals or across a society (social cognition) which influence how people treat each other, other animals, plants, forests, rivers and the physical environment. The stories are questioned from an ecological perspective with reference to an ecological framework (or ecosophy), and judged to be beneficial in encouraging people to protect the ecosystems that life depends on, or destructive in encouraging behavior which damages those ecosystems. Ecolinguistics attempts to make a practical difference in the world through resisting destructive stories and contributing to the search for new stories to live by (Stibbe 2015). Stories which have been exposed and resisted by ecolinguistics include consumerist stories, stories of unlimited economic growth, advertising stories, stories of intensive farming, and stories which represent nature as a machine or a resource. Using Positive Discourse Analysis, ecolinguistics has also searched for new stories to live by through exploring nature writing, poetry, environmental writing and traditional and indigenous forms of language around the world.

This form of analysis started with the application of critical discourse analysis to texts about the environment and environmentalism, in order to reveal hidden assumptions and messages and comment on the effectiveness of these in achieving environmental aims (e.g. Harré et al. 1999). It then developed to include analysis of any discourse which has potential consequences for the future of ecosystems, such as neoliberal economic discourse or discursive constructions of consumerism, gender, politics, agriculture and nature (e.g. Goatly 2000). The cognitive approach and the term 'stories we live by' was introduced in Stibbe (2015), which describes eight kinds of story: ideology, framing, metaphor, evaluation, identity, conviction, salience and erasure. Approaches such as [[environmental communication]] and [[ecocriticism]] have broadly similar aims and techniques to this form of ecolinguistics.

==Language diversity==

Language diversity is part of ecolinguistics because of the relationship between diversity of local languages and biodiversity. This relationship arises because of the ecological wisdom (or cultural adaptation to the environment) that is encoded in local languages. The forces of globalisation and linguistic imperialism are allowing dominant language to spread, and replace these local languages (Nettle and Romaine 2000). This leads to a loss of both sustainable local cultures and the important [[Traditional ecological knowledge|ecological knowledge]] contained within their languages. One of the goals of ecolinguistic research is to protect both cultural diversity and the linguistic diversity that supports it (Terralingua 2016, Nettle and Romaine 2000, Harmond 1996, Mühlhaüsler 1995). This research is in line with the United Nations Environment Program's position that:

"Biodiversity also incorporates human cultural diversity, which can be affected by the same drivers as biodiversity, and which has impacts on the diversity of genes, other species, and ecosystems. (UNEP 2007)"

Nettle and Romaine (2000:166) write that 'Delicate tropical environments in particular must be managed with care and skill. It is indigenous peoples who have the relevant practical knowledge, since they have been successfully making a living in them for hundreds of generations. Much of this detailed knowledge about local ecosystems is encoded in indigenous language and rapidly being lost'. Mühlhaüsler (2003:60) describes how 'The rapid decline in the world's linguistic diversity thus must be regarded with apprehension by those who perceive the interconnection between linguistic and biological diversity'.

Overall, language diversity is part of ecolinguistics because of the correlation between the diversity of language and biological diversity, with the ecological wisdom embedded in local cultures being the link between the two.

==Influence of ecology on language==

Abram's early chapter on "The Flesh of Language"  examined the contribution of the sensate body—and of the body's ongoing interaction with the earthly terrain—in the emergence of meaningful speech. A longer chapter on "Animism and the Alphabet" contrasted the discourse of indigenous, oral cultures with the discourse of literate cultures. For oral cultures, the coherence of spoken language is inseparable from the coherence of the surrounding ecology, from the expressive vitality of the more-than-human terrain. For these peoples "it is the animate earth that speaks; human speech is but a part of that vaster discourse." (p.&amp;nbsp;179) A subsequent chapter, entitled "In the Landscape of Language," drew examples from a range of divergent oral cultures to show some of the diverse ways that the local, more-than-human terrain informs and influences the discursive speech of oral cultures. Overall, Abram argues that ecology plays a key role in shaping human language in oral cultures, but with writing this role becomes less and less significant. This results in a situation where ‘our organic atonement to the local earth is thwarted by our ever-increasing intercourse with our own signs’ (1996:267). He therefore argues for using language in ways which bring ecology (or the 'more-than-human-world') back into language:

"there can be no question of simply abandoning literacy, of turning away from all writing. Our task, rather, is that of taking up the written word, with all of its potency, and patiently, carefully, writing language back into the land. Our craft is that of releasing the budded, earthy intelligence of our words, freeing them to respond to the speech of the things themselves - to the green uttering-forth of leaves from the spring branches." (Abram 1996:273)

'''English studies''' (usually called simply '''English''') is an academic discipline taught in [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]], and post-secondary education in [[English-speaking world|English-speaking countries]]; it is not to be confused with [[English as a second or foreign language|English taught as a foreign language]], which is a distinct discipline. English includes: the study of [[English literature|literature]] written in the [[English language]] (especially [[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], and [[poetry]]), the majority of which comes from Britain, the United States, and Ireland (although English-language literature from any country may be studied, and local or national literature is usually emphasized in any given country); English [[composition (language)|composition]], including writing [[essay]]s, short stories, and poetry; English [[language arts]], including the study of [[grammar]], [[linguistic prescription|usage]], and [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]]; and English [[sociolinguistics]], including [[discourse analysis]] of written and spoken texts in the English language, the [[history of the English language]], [[English language learning and teaching]], and the study of [[World English]]es. English [[linguistics]] ([[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonetics]], [[phonology]], etc.) is usually treated as a distinct discipline, taught in a department of linguistics.

The disciplinary divide between a dominant literature or usage orientation is one motivation for the division of the North American [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA) into two subgroups. At universities in non-English-speaking countries, the same department often covers all aspects of English studies, including linguistics: this is reflected, for example, in the structure and activities of the [[European Society for the Study of English]] (ESSE).

It is common for departments of English to offer courses and scholarship in the areas of the English language, literature (including [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]]), [[public speaking]] and [[speechwriter|speech-writing]], [[rhetoric]], [[composition studies]], [[creative writing]], [[philology]] and [[etymology]], [[journalism]], poetry, [[publishing]], [[literacy]], [[area studies]] (especially [[American studies]]), the [[philosophy of language]], [[theater]] and [[playwright|play-writing]], [[screenwriting]], [[communication studies]], [[technical communication]], [[cultural studies]], [[critical theory]], [[gender studies]], [[ethnic studies]], [[disability studies]], [[digital media]] and [[electronic publishing]], [[film studies]] and other [[media studies]], and various courses in the [[liberal arts]] and [[humanities]], among others. In most English-speaking countries, the study at all educational levels of texts produced in non-English languages takes place in other departments, such as departments of foreign language or of [[comparative literature]].

==English major==
The '''English Major''' (alternatively "English concentration," "B.A. in English") is a term in the United States and a few other countries for an [[undergraduate]] [[university]] degree focused around the consumption, analysis, and production of texts in the [[English language]]. The term may also be used to describe a student who is pursuing such a degree.

Students who major in English reflect upon, analyse, and interpret [[literature]] and [[film]], presenting their analyses in clear, cogent [[writing]]. Although help-wanted postings rarely solicit English majors specifically, a degree in English hones [[critical thinking]] skills essential to a number of career fields, including [[writing]], [[editing]], [[publishing]], [[teaching]], [[research]], [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[law]], and [[finance]].

===History===
The history of English studies at the modern university in Europe and America begins in the second half of the nineteenth century. Initially, English studies comprised a motley array of content: the practice of oratory, the study of rhetoric and grammar, the composition of poetry, and the appreciation of literature (mostly by authors from England, since American literature and language study was only added in the twentieth century).&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of these developments, see Gerald Graff, ''Professing Literature. An Institutional History'' (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany and several other European countries, English [[philology]], a strongly positivistic and historically interested practice of reading pre-modern texts, became the preferred scholarly paradigm, but English-speaking countries distanced themselves from philological paradigms soon after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, "''Englische Philologie'' vs. English Studies: A Foundational Conflict," in: ''Das Potential europäischer Philologien: Geschichte, Leistung, Funktion'', ed. Christoph König (Göttingen: Wallstein, 2009), pp. 34-44.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of this process, English departments tended to refocus their work on various forms of writing instruction (creative, professional, critical) and the interpreting of literary texts, and teacher education in English recovered from the neglect it had suffered because of more science-oriented paradigms.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce McComiskey, ed., ''English Studies. An Introduction to the Discipline'' (Urbana, IL: NCTE, 2006), esp. pp. 44-48, "The New English Studies."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, English departments in native-speaking countries re-evaluate their roles as sole guardians of the discipline because English is less and less native speakers' unique 'property' and has to be shared with the millions of speakers and writers from other countries for whom English is an essential means of communication and artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [http://www.english.tamu.edu/english-without-borders?destination=node%2F76 English Without Borders] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204032833/http://www.english.tamu.edu/english-without-borders?destination=node%2F76 |date=2014-02-04 }} project at Texas A&amp;M University&lt;/ref&gt;

English literature became an object of study in French universities as part of foreign (comparative) literature in the nineteenth century. A chair of foreign literature was established at the College de France in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vorachek|first=Laura|date=2017|title=Journalism and the Periodical Press in Nineteenth-Century Britain ed. by Joanne Shattock (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/682977|journal=Victorian Periodicals Review|language=en|volume=50|issue=4|pages=829–833|doi=10.1353/vpr.2017.0059|issn=1712-526X}}&lt;/ref&gt; English was first taught independently from other languages and literature in the University of Lille and in the University of Lyons and only afterwards in the Sorbonne. These three universities were the first major centres of English studies in France. The first lecturer and later professor of English studies would seem to have been Auguste Angellier. After spending several years teaching French in England in the 1860s and 1870s, he became a lecturer in English studies in the University of Lille in 1881 and a professor of English in 1893. In France nowadays, literature, civilisation, linguistics and the spoken and written language are all important in English studies in universities.&lt;ref&gt;Imelda Bonel-Elliott (2000), “English Studies in France” in: Engler, Balz and Haas, Renate, ''European English Studies: Contributions Towards a History of the Discipline''. Leicester: The English Association for ESSE, pp. 69-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English major rose to prominence in [[United States|American]] colleges during the first half of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93442.pdf|title=120 Years of American Education: A Statistical Portrait|last=National Center for Education Statistics|first=|date=January 1993|website=National Center for Education Statistics|access-date=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provided an opportunity for students to develop skills in analytical reading with the aim of improving their writing, as well as exercises in rhetoric and persuasive expression that had been traditionally only taught in [[classical studies]] and available to the very few due to language barriers and a shortage of professors who could actively engage students in the humanities. Outside the United States (originating in [[Scotland]] and then rippling out into the English-speaking world) the English major became popular in the latter half of the 19th century during a time when religious beliefs were shaken in the face of scientific discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ian/arnold.htm "Literature and Science" (Matthew Arnold [1882&amp;#93;)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Literature]] was thought to act as a replacement for [[religion]] in the retention and advancement of culture, and the English Major thus provided students with the chance to draw [[moral]], [[ethical]], and [[philosophical]] qualities and meanings of older studies from a richer and broader source of literature than that of the ancient [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Latin]] classics.

Since 2000, there have been more and more questions about the specific function of English departments at the contemporary U.S. college and university.{{By whom|date=February 2018}} The absence of a clearly defined disciplinary identity and the increasingly utilitarian goals in U.S. society present a challenge to those academic units still mostly focusing on the printed book and the traditional division in historical periods and national literatures, and neglecting allegedly non-theoretical areas such as professional writing, composition, and multimodal communication.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, "The Trouble with English," ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', 13 January 2013 (http://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/01/03/the-trouble-with-english/); and "Quo vadis, English Studies," ''Philologie im Netz'' 69 (2014): 93-100 (http://web.fu-berlin.de/phin/phin69/p69t8.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skills acquired ===

In the past an [[academic degree]] in English usually meant an intensive study of [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] literary masterpieces. Now, however, an English Major encompasses a much broader range of topics which stretch over multiple disciplines. While the requirements for an English Major vary from university to university, most English departments emphasize three core skills: analyzing literature, a process which requires [[logic]] and reflective analysis; creativity and imagination with regards to the production of good writing; and an understanding of different [[cultures]], [[civilizations]], and literary styles from various time periods. The skills gained from studying English include acquiring tools that will never lose value, understanding the ever-changing media, to explain your own world, and more.&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Major in English?|url=http://english.yale.edu/undergraduate/why-major-english|website=Yale University|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospective English Majors can expect to take college courses in [[academic writing]], [[creative writing]], [[literary theory]], [[British literature|British]] and [[United States|American]] literature, multicultural literature, several literary genres (such as [[poetry]], [[drama]], and [[film studies]]), and a number of elective multidisciplinary topics such as [[history]], courses in the [[social sciences]], and studies in a foreign language. To the end of studying these disciplines, candidates for a Major in English attain skills in professional writing with relations to [[rhetoric]], [[literary analysis]], an appreciation for the diversity of cultures, and an ability to clearly and persuasively express their ideas in writing.

=== Examples of courses ===

Most English courses fall into the broader categories of either Literature-based studies, which focus on classical authors and time periods, or Rhetorical studies, which concentrate on communication skills in preparation for specialization in a variety of professional fields. While specific graduation requirements vary from university to university, students can expect to study some of the following courses.

'''Courses in [[Writing]] and [[Composition (language)|Composition]]''': such as Academic and Professional Writing, which stress analytical writing and train students to produce clear, cohesive arguments.

'''Courses in [[British Literature]]''': Courses may focus on time periods, authors, genres, or literary movements. Examples include [[Shakespeare]]'s Tragedies, History and Theory of British Drama, Medieval English Literature, and the Victorian Novel.

'''Courses in [[American Literature]]''': Depending upon the university, these courses can either be broken down by time period, such as Nineteenth Century [[Gothic Fiction]]; authors, such as classes on [[Nathaniel Hawthorne|Hawthorne]], [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]], or [[Robert Frost|Frost]]; or Literary schools and movements, such as [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] or [[Transcendentalism]].

'''Courses in Multicultural Literature''': The value of bringing a range of cultural and multidisciplinary perspectives to the study of [[English literature]] is being increasingly recognized in a number of universities. Examples include Multi-cultural Literatures in Medieval England, Latina Narratives, and Studies in Jewish Literature.

'''Rhetorical courses''': Focus on techniques of persuasive arguing in the written form, as well as skills which involve the analysis of written texts.

=== Career opportunities ===

A major in English opens a variety of career opportunities for college graduates entering the job market. Since students who graduate with an English degree are trained to ask probing questions about large bodies of texts and then to formulate, analyze, and answer those questions in coherent, persuasive [[prose]]—skills vital to any number of careers—English majors have much to choose from after graduation. The most obvious career choices for English majors are writing, publishing, journalism, and teaching. However, other less intuitive job options include positions in [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[acting]], [[law]], [[business]], [[marketing]], [[information assurance]], and directing.

The '''Fourth Way enneagram''' is a figure published in 1949 in ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]'' by [[P.D. Ouspensky]], and an integral part of the [[Fourth Way]] esoteric system associated with [[George Gurdjieff]]. The term "[[enneagram (shape)|enneagram]]" derives from two Greek words, ''ennea'' (nine) and ''gramma'' (something written or drawn).

[[File:Enneagram as an octave.svg|thumb|400px|right|Enneagram with point numbers and octave designations for octave beginning at point 9. Points 3 and 6 show "shock points" at which a new Do may enter and develop alongside the existing octave.]]

The enneagram is a nine-pointed figure usually inscribed within a circle.  Within the circle is a triangle connecting points 9, 3 and 6. The inscribed figure resembling a web connects the other six points in a cyclic figure 1-4-2-8-5-7. This number is derived from or corresponds to the recurring decimal .[[142857 (number)|142857]] = 1/7. These six points together with the point numbered 9 are said to represent the main stages of any complete process, and can be related to the notes of a musical [[octave]], 9 being equivalent to "Doh" and 1 to "Re" etc. The points numbered 3 and 6 are said to represent "shock points" which affect the way a process develops. The internal lines between the points; that is, the three-point figure and the six-point figure, are said to show certain non-obvious connections, although here very little elucidation is offered.

==Origins==
As reported by [[P. D. Ouspensky]] the enneagram was introduced by [[George Gurdjieff]] to his study groups in [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Moscow]] in 1916. Ouspensky records this original explication in his book of Gurdjieff's teaching [[In Search of the Miraculous]] where the enneagram  appears as Figure 44 and in further diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;In Search of the Miraculous: Fragments of an Unknown Teaching, 1949, (reprinted 1977), PD Ouspensky, Routledge and Keegan Paul Ltd, London, pp. 285-295, 376-8.&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented as an ancient secret being released for the first time, the truth behind for example the [[philosopher's stone]]. Ouspensky quotes Gurdjieff as saying; "The knowledge of the enneagram has for a very long time been preserved in secret and if it now is, so to speak, made available to all, it is only in an incomplete and theoretical form without instruction from a man who knows". Gurdjieff also remarked "In order to understand the enneagram it must be thought of as in motion, as moving. A motionless enneagram is a dead symbol, the living symbol is in motion"

Although no earlier record of the Fourth Way version of the enneagram can be cited, it has been proposed that it may derive from, or be cognate to the reversed Kabbalistic [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]] as used in “Etude sur les origines de la nature du Zohar”, by S. Karppe, Paris, 1901, pp. 387, the Great Magical Arcanum of [[Eliphas Levi]] which is also composed of a circle triangle and hexad, the Magical Acanum of [[Helena Blavatsky]] in ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' (1877), and [[Leonhard Euler]]'s [[nine-point circle]]. There has also been speculation that it may be related to the Pythagorean [[Tetractys]], which also combines the numbers 3 and 7.

[[Robin Amis]] claims an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] origin, claiming that both Gurdijeff and Ouspensky developed their teaching with insights gained from visits to [[Mount Athos]].&lt;ref name="ChristianFourthWay"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Staff |first= |title=The direct connection between the Fourth Way and Inner Christianity |publisher=Praxis Research Institute |date=14 July 2006 |url=http://www.praxisinstitute.net/Praxis%20Now/Church%20of%20The%20Elders/Christian%20Fourthway.htm |accessdate=2009-08-19 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723083849/http://www.praxisinstitute.net/Praxis%20Now/Church%20of%20The%20Elders/Christian%20Fourthway.htm |archivedate=23 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background of the enneagram in Gurdjieff's cosmology ==

The enneagram according to Gurdjieff shows the "Law of Seven" and the "Law of Three" united and so some explanation of these laws is necessary here.

The Law of Seven or law of octaves, according to which phenomena evolves in seven steps; and the Law of Three, according to which phenomena are produced by three forces, are presented by Gurdjieff as global laws appearing on all scales and essential to his [[cosmology]]. This cosmology offers a view of how the world operates said to derive from [[alchemy]] and more ancient sources, and to complement or complete modern experimental science rather than to contradict it. According to this cosmology everything is material, including [[consciousness]] and [[spirit]], and all matter can be assigned a "density"; consciousness and spirit for example having lower "densities" (and therefore higher "vibrations") than,for example, [[water]] while, for example, [[Rock (geology)|rock]] has a higher "density" and lower "vibration" than water, and so on.

The [[diatonic scale]] in music is said to be an ancient application of the Law of Seven and a convenient way to study it.&lt;ref&gt;In Search of the Miraculous, page 124 Routledga and Keegan, 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; The major musical scale is used with short intervals at mi-fa and ti-do (Ouspensky refers to Ti as "Si" and So as "Sol" and the diagrams on this page reflect his usage). In other words if one thinks of a standard [[musical keyboard]] and takes for example middle C as Do then the following six white keys, DEFGAB will represent the rest of the octave, and the next white key will be the higher C. There will be black keys between each of the white keys, except between E and F (the mi-fa interval) and between B and the higher C (the si-do interval)

In any process described in terms of the Law of Seven, the Mi-Fa interval and the Ti-Do interval are said to be shock points where outside help is needed if the octave is to  continue to develop as intended. A failure to recognize this in terms of human projects is said to be a major reason why things go wrong in general.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM, page 126=129, Routledge and Kegan Paul 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; The octave of [[electromagnetic radiation]] that appears as visible [[light]], and the [[periodic table]] are said to be examples of physical phenomena where the underlying Law of Seven can be detected (although no detail is offered here). It should be noted that the musical scale Gurdjieff is quoted as using &lt;ref&gt;In Search of the Miraculous Fig 11, page 125 Routledga and Keegan, 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; is not the modern standard musical scale but  [[Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale]], a [[just intonation]] scale associated with the Renaissance composer and musical theorist [[Gioseffo Zarlino]].

The Law of Three holds that three forces act on any event, which can be called  Active, Passive, and Neutralizing forces, or simply First, Second, and Third forces respectively. These three forces can appear in any order, 123 for example or 312, giving 6 possible "triads" of forces describing 6 very broad types of event. &lt;ref&gt; [[Ouspensky: A Further Record]] p174, accessed through web, http://holybooks.lichtenbergpress.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/A-Further-Record.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;[[Human|Humanity]] is said to be "third force blind", to have difficulty recognizing the third force, which may appear to us in the guise of a result or of a background environment."People cannot perceive the third force directly any more than they can spatially perceive the '[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]'" Gurdjieff is quoted as saying.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM, page 77, Routledge and Kegan Paul 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the Law of Seven one of the three forces appears as the "do" of the octave and the other two appear as the "shocks" (which also function as the do of new octaves) The explanation of these laws in [[In Search of the Miraculous]] is largely in abstract terms, with some detail given for the so-called "food diagram" described below and the cosmic octave, the [[Ray of Creation]].

The enneagram shows the Law of Seven and the Law of Three in a single symbol with the three forces joined in a triangle at the 3,6 and 9 points, and in addition six inner lines (hexad) following the 1,4,2,8,5,7,1,... sequence. The meaning of these six inner lines is not, by Ouspensky's account, made clear by Gurdjieff. One shock point is shown on the enneagram at point 3, which is the Mi-Fa interval where it might be expected. However the other is at point 6, at the So-La interval. It might have been expected to be at the Ti-Do interval, and Gurdjieff is presented as offering this apparent mistake as a mystery to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM, page291, Routledge and Kegan Paul 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; Ouspensky offers the solution that the shock at point 3 itself develops as an octave to point 6, where its own Mi-Fa interval occurs. This second octave cannot develop unless it has a shock at its own Mi-Fa, and this is the shock which in fact occurs at point 6.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM, page378, Routledge and Kegan Paul 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; The example of the "food diagram" enneagram summarized below might clarify this.

==Application to processes: the food diagram==

As the enneagram figure is a symbol said to represent the "law of seven" and the "law of three" in unity, therefore, according to this view, the figure can be used to describe any natural whole phenomenon, cosmos, process in life or any other piece of knowledge. The figure is the central organizing glyph of the Fourth Way's view of the material world which Gurdjieff is quoted by Ouspensky as relating to [[alchemy]].

[[File:Enneagram evolution of food.svg|thumb|310px|right|Enneagram representing the evolution of food with "self remembering" at point 6]]

The most detailed example of how this is said to work, given in ''In Search of the Miraculous'', is an explanation of how Gurdjieff believed inputs to the human body ("food", "air" and "impressions", collectively regarded as types of food) are processed into the so-called "higher substances" necessary for higher consciousness to function. In Gurdjieff's view "everything is material"; consciousness and spirit are to be regarded as aspects of matter, although more refined or of a "higher vibration" than perceptible aspects. This proposition is an essential basis for Gurdjieff's view of the evolution of food into the "higher substances" necessary for higher consciousness; briefly summarized below from the account in ''In Search of the Miraculous''.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM figures 25-39, pages 182-192;figures 59 and 60, Routledge and Kegan Paul,1950&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Fourth Way]], a later collection of Ouspensky's talks, is a supplementary source for the same material.

At point 9 ordinary food (beginning as Do) is eaten and enters the body and digestion begins. The "density" of human food is assigned a number, 768.

At point 1 it is said to be processed in the gut  as Re and is refined to a "density" of 384 the same "density" as water.

At point 2 the food is further refined to  Mi and assigned a density of 192, the same density as air. It is ready to enter the blood stream.

At point 3, Mi-Fa, occurs a "shock". Air can provide this shock because it also is of density 192, and furthermore this air enters as a new Do

At point 4 the original food octave is at "Fa" but  the new air octave is at Re. They are both in the bloodstream at "density" 96, the "density" of hormones and vitamins and rarefied gases and animal magnetism "and so on". At this point we reach the end of "what is regarded as matter by our physics and chemistry" &lt;ref&gt;ISOTM 1950 page 175&lt;/ref&gt; It should be remembered that Gurdjieff is here speaking in 1916.

The substances or energies at point 5  are assigned a "density" of 48 and used in thought. These are the So or "Sol" part of the original food octave and the Mi part of the air octave.

Point 6 being where "impressions", regarded as a type of food, are said to enter the body. "Impressions" are said to also have a "density" of 48, and can serve as a shock if they are intensified by some such means as the exercise of "self-remembering" taught by Gurdjieff, thus allowing the air and impressions octaves to proceed. Otherwise only the ordinary food octave, shown in black in the diagram, proceeds.

Point 7 represents emotional and other energies, of a "density" of 24. If "self-remembering" occurs this will be the Fa point for the air octave and the Re point for the impressions octave. Otherwise it will just be the La point for the original food octave.

At point 8, the "Si" or Ti at the end of the first "ordinary food" octave represents the sexual energies, of "density" 12; which are the "highest substance" according to Gurdjieff which the body produces naturally without conscious intervention. A desire to conserve this "higher substances" for esoteric use is said to be the original reason for religious celibacy. With the conscious intervention at point 6 of "self remembering" further and more useful "higher substances" are created, represented by the air octave's So or "Sol" at point 8 and the impression octave's Mi at point 8. This Mi of "density" 12 is the "higher substance" primarily necessary for Gurdjieff's esoteric method.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM 1950, page 193&lt;/ref&gt;(Ouspensky makes some further remarks on the nature of this Mi 12 and Sol 12 in his book ''[[Fourth Way (book)|Fourth Way]]''.) A further conscious shock, requiring "a special type of control over the emotions" at point 9 would enable a new "higher" or spiritual body to begin to grow, this is represented by Gurdjieff as the aim of his and other esoteric traditions. Although not shown in the diagram on this page, the Air octave, if it has a shock at Point 6 in fact may proceed to La with a "density" of 6.

Ouspensky related the inner six-line figure  of the Food Diagram enneagram to the circulation of the blood. Point 1, he wrote, represented the digestive system, point 2 the blood stream, point 4 the breathing system, point 5 the brain, point 7 the spinal cord and point 8 the sympathetic nervous system and sex organs, and the lines "showed the direction of the flow or distribution of arterial blood in the organism and then its return in the form of venous blood" &lt;ref&gt;ISOTM 1950, page 378&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other applications to processes==
Other applications of the enneagram to describing processes can be found in writings influenced by those of Gurdjieff,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[A.G.E. Blake]]'s ''The Intelligent Enneagram'' (Shambhala, 1995), an excerpt from this book plus other material and references on the enneagram of process can be found on Blake's [http://www.duversity.org/ideas/enneagram.html "Duversity" site ], accessed 25 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; notably in the writings of [[J.G. Bennett]]. In his book ''Gurdjieff: Making a New World''&lt;ref&gt;''Gurdjieff: Making a New World'', Spiritual Classics Edition 1992, Appendix on the enneagram&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett describes the workings of a community kitchen in terms of the enneagram and offers some explanation of the meaning of the internal lines. Another of his books, ''Enneagram Studies'',&lt;ref&gt;''Enneagram Studies''. York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; is devoted to the subject, offering nine examples of enneagrams in various applications. [[Rodney Collin]] in his book ''The Theory of Celestial Influence'' relates the enneagram to the planets of the solar system, and the yearly cycle, and also offers some explanation of the inner lines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Theory-of-Celestial-Influence.pdf pages 108 and 190, Figures 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications to human typology==

The [[Enneagram of Personality]] originates from the mapping of nine "ego fixations" on the enneagram by [[Oscar Ichazo]]. A book published in 2017, "The Enneagram: Living and Dead" by Plavan N. Go, attempts to verify it from the viewpoint of Gurdjieff's theories, showing the relevance of the nine personality types and their mapping on the enneagram based on the interpretation of the enneagram according to the Law of Three, the logic of three into four (O+C+N &gt; H), and the Law of Seven.&lt;ref&gt;http://gurdjieff.la.coocan.jp/literature/The_Enneagram_ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The phrase was coined by [http://www.myriadeditions.com/creator/ian-williams/ Ian Williams]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graphic Medicine|url=http://graphicmedicine.org/#/graphic-medicine/4531707343|work=Why ''Graphic Medicine?"|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to denote "the intersection between the medium of comics and the discourse of healthcare". Comics offer an engaging, powerful, and accessible method of delivering [[illness]] [[narrative]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hektoen International.|url=http://www.hektoeninternational.org/graphicMedicine.html|work=Graphic medicine: how comics are revolutionizing the representation of illness|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic appraisal of graphic fiction is in its infancy, but its examination by academics involved in [[healthcare]]-related studies is increasing, with work emerging in journals such as ''Configurations: A Journal of Literature, Science, and Technology'' (2.2) as well as ''Journal of the Medical Humanities'' and ''Literature and Medicine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=IC|title=Graphic medicine: comics as medical narrative.|journal=Medical humanities|date=2012-01-25|pmid=22282425|doi=10.1136/medhum-2011-010093|volume=38|issue=1|pages=21–7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 January 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that the [[Medical Humanities]] movement in many medical schools (e.g., Penn State University, http://www2.med.psu.edu/humanities/) advocates the framework and use of literature in exploring illness, from practitioner and patient perspectives. A recent entry to the scholarly study of graphic mediciine is the Einstein Foundation funded project at the Freie Universität Berlin (2016-2019) under the direction of Irmela Marei Krüger-Fürhoff and with the collaboration of Susan Merrill Squier, Einstein Visiting Fellow and Brill Professor at the Pennsylvania State University: ''PathoGraphics'', the study of illness narratives or pathographies and works of graphic medicine. 
[http://www.myriadeditions.com/creator/ian-williams/ Williams] set up the [http://www.graphicmedicine.org Graphic Medicine website] in 2007 whilst writing a masters dissertation on medical narrative in comics and graphic novels, during which time he found Susan M. Squier's essays,  “Beyond Nescience: the intersectional insights of health humanities.” ''Perspectives in Biology and Medicine''. 50:3 (summer 2007): 334-47, and “So Long as They Grow Out of It: Comics, The Discourse of Developmental Normalcy, and Disability.” Journal of Medical Humanities. 29:2 (June 2008): 71-88. Scholars from around the world who were interested in comics and healthcare began to get in touch, notably [http://www.pennstatehershey.org/findaprovider/provider/178 Prof Michael Green], who had recently set up a [http://www2.med.psu.edu/humanities/graphic-narratives/ graphic narratives course] at Hershey Medical School at Penn State University, and MK Czerwiec, aka [http://www.comicnurse.com "Comic Nurse"], who had, for many years, been recording her experiences as an [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] [[Hospice care in the United States|hospice]] nurse in [[comics]] form. Green invited his colleagues Kimberley Myers, of the Medical Humanities Program at Penn State Milton Hershey Medical School and Susan M. Squier, Brill Professor of English and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, who teaches graphic medicine to Ph.D. students at the Penn State University and whose work Williams had encountered earlier, to the discussion group, and Williams introduced [http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/persons/maria-vaccarella(74c125a2-f1d2-45e7-9132-75a9e2e07e52).html Maria Vaccarella], [http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/giskin.day Giskin Day] and Columba Quigley. The group decided to hold a conference, in 2010 at The University of London, which led to a series of annual international conferences with presentations that are frequently posted as podcasts after the conference, on http://www.graphicmedicine.org

Penn State University Press published '''''The Graphic Medicine Manifesto''''' in 2015. Authors are MK Czerwiec, Ian Williams, Susan Merrill Squier, Michael J. Green, Kimberly R. Myers, and Scott T. Smith.  Content summary: "Combining scholarly essays with visual narratives and a conclusion in comics form, establishes graphic medicine as a new area of scholarship.  Demonstrates that graphic medicine narratives offer patients, family members, and medical caregivers new ways to negotiate the challenges of the medical experience.  Discusses comics as visual rhetoric"—Provided by publisher.  {{ISBN|9780271066493}}; 195 pages, includes bibliographic references.  This was the inaugural volume in the ongoing Graphic Medicine series at Penn State University Press, which is co-edited by Susan M. Squier and Ian Williams.  For recent publications in the Graphic Medicine series, see its website:

In 2014, the first American Library Association Will Eisner Graphic Novel Growth Grant was awarded to Ypsilanti District Library, (Ypsilanti, Michigan) for its proposal to build a collection of graphic medicine narratives.  To date, that collection contains over 100 titles, which can be viewed in a subject search '''Graphic Medicine''' on the library's website: www.ypsilibrary.org. Author MK Czerwiec lectured in the fall of 2014 at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital (Ypsilanti, Michigan) in support of this grant.

In [[botany]] and [[mycology]], a '''haustorium''' (plural '''haustoria''') is a structure that grows into or around another structure to absorb water or nutrients. In [[botany]], this may refer to a [[cotyledon]],{{sfn|Lersten|2004}} or to the root of a [[parasitic plant]] (such as the [[Orobanchaceae|broomrape family]] or [[mistletoe]]) that penetrates the host's tissue and draws nutrients from it. In [[mycology]], it refers to the appendage or portion of a [[parasitism|parasitic]] fungus (the [[hyphal]] tip), which performs a similar function.  Microscopic haustoria penetrate the host plant's [[cell wall]] and siphon nutrients from the space between the cell wall and [[plasma membrane]] but do not penetrate the membrane itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szabo|first1=Les|title=Hidden robbers: The role of fungal haustoria in parasitism of plants|journal=PNAS|date=July 3, 2001|volume=98|issue=14|pages=7654–7655|doi=10.1073/pnas.151262398|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/14/7654.long|accessdate=19 April 2015|pmid=11438718|pmc=35395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger (usually botanical, not fungal) haustoria do this at the [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] level.

==In fungi==

Fungi in all major divisions form haustoria. Haustoria take several forms. Generally, on penetration, the fungus increases the surface area in contact with host plasma membrane releasing enzymes that break up the cell walls, enabling greater potential movement of organic [[carbon]] from host to fungus.  Thus, an insect hosting a parasitic fungus such as ''[[Cordyceps]]'' may look as though it is being "eaten from the inside out" as the haustoria expand inside of it. 

The simplest forms of haustoria are small spheres. The largest are complex formations adding significant mass to a cell, expanding between the cell wall and cell membrane. In the ''[[Chytridiomycota]]'', the entire fungus may become enclosed in the cell, and it is arguable whether this should be considered analogous to a haustorium.

Haustoria arise from intercellular hyphae, [[appressoria]], or external hyphae. The hypha narrows as it passes through the {{what|date=October 2017}} of cell and then expands on invaginating the cell. A thickened, [[electron]]-dense collar of material is deposited around the hypha at the point of invagination. Further, the host cell wall becomes highly modified in the invaginated zone. Inclusions normally present in plasma membrane are absent, and the outer layer contains more polysaccharide. The wall of both partners is severely reduced.   

Functional exchange takes place within the haustorial complex.  The host supplies organic carbon to the fungus, and the metabolic activity within the complex is considerably greater than outside.  Carbon from the host is absorbed by the fungus, and transported to the rest of the [[thallus]].  The host plant appears to be functioning according to signals from the fungus and the complex appears to be under the control of the invader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bugs.bio.usyd.edu.au/learning/resources/Mycology/StructureFunction/haustoria.shtml Mycology - Structure and Function - Haustoria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The haustorium may be mycelium or root-shaped.

==In plants==
Mistletoes (including [[Loranthaceae]] and [[Viscaceae]]) attach to their hosts via a haustorium. This structure both anchors the mistletoe, and taps into the host plant. Mistletoes use passive mechanisms to draw water from their hosts. They keep their leaf stomata open night and day which sets up a moisture gradient between mistletoe and host&lt;ref&gt;Watson, D. M. (2011) ''Mistletoes of Southern Australia'',  [http://www.publish.csiro.au/book/6436/ CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, VIC]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14392">'''Height restriction laws''' are laws that restrict the maximum height of [[building|structures]].

There are a variety of reasons for these measures. Some restrictions limit the height of new buildings so as not to block views of an older work decreed to be an important landmark by a government.  For example, In the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] capital of [[Saint Petersburg]], buildings could not be taller than the [[Winter Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Terterov, Marat. ''Investing in St Petersburg''. GMB Publishing Ltd, 2005, pg. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other restrictions are because of practical concern, such as around [[airport]]s to prevent any danger to flight safety.

Height restriction laws sometimes become a point of contention in cities due to their use in regulating the growth of the housing supply. Fast growth of housing supply benefits renters by producing low prices and a lot of choice, while slow or no growth in housing supply benefits property owners by allowing them to charge higher prices. In this way, height restriction laws often become part of a [[class conflict]] even when their original purpose was innocuous.

==Asia==

===Middle East===

[[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Jordan]] inherited laws from the days of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] that prevent buildings from rising more than four stories above the ground except by special government permission.  In [[Amman]], these regulations have been credited with maintaining the city's architectural and urban heritage, but have also been accused of inflating housing prices and causing unsustainable [[urban sprawl]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venturemagazine.me/2015/01/low-rise-high-rise/ Venture Magazine Low Rise To High Rise?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===

PRESIDENTIAL DECREE No. 1537 dated January 4, 1978 ENTITLED "Providing for the preservation of the walls of [[Intramuros]] and the restoration of its original moat and esplanade" by including preservation and restoration of the walled city includes (Section 10) the height of buildings within the Intramuros district shall be based upon the widths of streets on which the building abuts but the total height of the structure shall not exceed 30 meters. No tower shall be 35 meters high measured from the top of the sidewalk.

===Hong Kong SAR===
To protect the ridge line along [[Hong Kong Island]] and in [[Kowloon]], height restrictions are imposed according to the location of the buildings or structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkip.org.hk/En/Content.asp?Bid=7&amp;Sid=22&amp;Id=134 HKIP's Position on Building Height Restrictions for Kwun Tong and Kowloon Bay Business Areas]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1998 closure of the [[Kai Tak Airport]], many places in [[Kowloon]] had a stricter building height restriction due to its proximity to the airport.

===Indonesia===
In [[Bali, Indonesia]], a building cannot be higher than a [[coconut tree]], which is about 15 meters.&lt;ref name=jakarta_post_bali&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2017/01/26/in-bali-trumps-planned-six-star-hotel-risks-angering-the-gods.html|date=2017-01-26|title=In Bali, Trump’s planned six-star hotel risks angering the Gods|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kompas_bali&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.kompas.com/read/2011/11/29/1151379/dikhawatirkan.bali.terus.quotdilahapquot.bangunan.tinggi|title=Dikhawatirkan, Bali Terus "Dilahap" Bangunan Tinggi|work=[[Kompas]]|language=id|date=2011-11-29|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bappeda.baliprov.go.id/files/subdomain/bappeda/Foto%20dan%20berita%20Web%20terbaru/RPJMD%20KAB/DAU/Peraturan%20Daerah%20Provinsi%20Bali%20Nomor%2016%20Tahun%202009%20tentang%20Rencana%20Tata%20Ruang%20Wilayah%20(RTRW)%20Provinsi%20Bali%20Tahun%202009-2029.pdf Bali Regional Regulation 16 of 2009], Art. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The only building that is higher than a coconut tree is the Bali Beach Hotel because the hotel was built before the height restriction was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indonesiaphoto.com/destinations/bali/item/66-sanur Sanur - Indonesia images]&lt;/ref&gt; The restriction was enforced by a [[regional regulation (Indonesia)|regional regulation]], however, how much this is enforced is in question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baliapartments.org/bali-apartments-bali-real-estate/ Bali Apartments And The Evolving Bali Real Estate Market]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
Buildings in Raffles Place, Marina Centre, Marina Bay Sands, Bugis and Kallang have height restrictions of up to 280m because of the proximity of [[Paya Lebar Airbase]].&lt;ref&gt;''Discover Singapore: The City's History &amp; Culture Redefined'' By Susan Tsang, Edward Hendricks; {{ISBN|981-261-365-X}}, 9789812613653&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
In [[Europe]], there is no official general law restricting the height of structures. There are however height restriction laws in many cities, often aimed to protect historic skylines.

In [[Athens]], buildings are not allowed to surpass twelve floors so as not to block the view towards the [[Parthenon]]. There are several exceptions though, such as the Athens Tower, the Atrina center and the OTE central building which all exceed that level. This is due to them either being built far away from the centre, or to the fact that they were constructed during periods of political instability. The city's tallest structure is the Athens Tower, reaching 103m and comprising 25 floors.

In the central area of [[Rome]], delimited by the [[Aurelian Walls]], no building can exceed the height of the dome of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], 136 meters. A skyscraper called [[Torre Eurosky]] (Eurosky Tower) built in 2012 in EUR neighbourhood exceed this limit being 155 meters high.

There is however a height restriction for new onshore wind turbines in the European Union, which set their total height to 200 metres.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energiekeuze.nl/nieuws.aspx?id=954&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

===Canada===
Canada has no national height restrictions, but many individual cities do have height restriction [[bylaws]] and building is restricted by the national aviation authority ([[Transport Canada]]) near airports.  Some examples:
* [[List of tallest buildings in Montreal|Montreal]]: until the late 1920s, all buildings were limited to 10 storeys.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=city&amp;lng=3&amp;id=montreal-canada{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently buildings are limited to a height of 200 meters and are subject to not contrasting the view of [[Mount Royal]], the city's central green space, with the only exception being antennas and communication towers, that are allowed to reach {{convert|223|m}} [[above mean sea level]].  The [[Downtown Montreal|downtown]] today possesses only one building exceeding 200 m, the [[1000 de la Gauchetière]] tower, which was built as a special project in 1992.
* [[List of tallest buildings in Ottawa-Gatineau|Ottawa-Gatineau]]: Until 1973, buildings in [[downtown Ottawa]] were limited to {{convert|45.5|m}} so that the [[Peace Tower]], part of the parliament buildings, could dominate the skyline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120726214805/http://photo.pds.org:5005/student/article?id=ar407880 Ottawa - Student World Book]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of tallest buildings in Saskatoon|Saskatoon]]: continues to limit building heights to a maximum of 76 meters due to a flight path that bisects the downtown core,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=9f6fe694-d619-44e3-a7d3-c3b78be6b95e&amp;sponsor=&lt;/ref&gt; however, the recent proposal of a 90 - 100 meter tower could potentially lead to the lifting of this height limit.&lt;ref&gt;http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=63198&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[List of tallest buildings in Vancouver|Vancouver]]: maintains "view corridors" that protect views of the [[North Shore Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/COMMSVCS/Guidelines/H005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001193939/http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/COMMSVCS/Guidelines/H005.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also has a [[density bank]] that allows developers to exceed maximum building height restrictions in exchange for preserving [[List of heritage buildings in Vancouver|heritage buildings]].
* [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]]: No buildings should be taller than four stories due to the nearby fault line. The Whitehorse Chamber of Commerce said that maintaining the height restriction of four stories would discourage businesses from coming to the city. On 2007, the city rejected the proposal to increase the height limit to eight stories. In order to exceed height limit, the developer would have to apply for an amendment to the city's official community plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2007/04/24/whse-buildings.html?ref=rss | work=CBC News | title=Whitehorse puts brakes on highrise rule change | date=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]: No buildings may exceed the height of the Niagara Escarpment, to preserve views of Lake Ontario from the Escarpment, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/downtown-secondary-plan-1.4623787|title=Hamilton approves new rule saying buildings can't be higher than the escarpment {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Both the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) have a [[rebuttable presumption]] not to build any antennae over {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} above ground level. This is to prevent those structures from being a hazard to air navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=January 4, 2017 |title=70/7460-1L Advisory Circular Marking and Lighting FAQs |url=https://oeaaa.faa.gov/oeaaa/external/searchAction.jsp?action=malFAQs |publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]] |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Timmerman |first=Jerianne |year=2014 |title=NAB Legal Guide to Broadcast Law and Regulation |page=120 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |oclc=864753069 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5G_ZBAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the FAA has requested that height limits within {{convert|10,000|ft|m}} of an airport runway be lowered from {{convert|250|ft|m}} to {{convert|160|ft|m}}, as development near airports has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 26, 2014 |title=FAA wants to lower building height limit near airports |url=https://nypost.com/2014/06/26/faa-wants-to-lower-building-height-limit-near-airports/ |work=[[New York Post]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For airports, sometimes there are [[grandfather clause|exceptions]] for height restrictions made for important infrastructure equipment, as radio towers or for structures older than the airport. These structures have to be marked with red and white paint, have flight safety lamps on top, or both.  Often red and white paint and flight safety lamps have to be installed on high structures (taller than {{convert|100|m|ft}}) far away from airports. Height restriction laws are not always kept strictly.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Several cities in the United States have local height limits, for example:

* [[Bellevue, Washington]]: maximum of {{convert|450|ft|m}} in [[Downtown Bellevue]], set in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Singer |first=Natalie |date=July 3, 2005 |title=A towering new identity in Bellevue |url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/eastsidenews/2002356444_lincolnnew.html |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Madison, Wisconsin]]: No building located within one mile of the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] may be higher than it (set in 1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=April 27, 1990 |title=1989 Wisconsin Act 222 |url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/1989/related/acts/222.pdf |publisher=[[Wisconsin State Legislature]] |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ivey |first=Mike |date=April 9, 2014 |title=By design, Madison has no tall buildings |url=http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/writers/mike_ivey/by-design-madison-has-no-tall-buildings/article_64e73570-b5e1-11e3-9e53-0019bb2963f4.html |work=[[The Capital Times]] |location=Madison, Wisconsin |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[San Jose, California]]: Due to [[Downtown San Jose]]'s close proximity to [[San Jose International Airport]], no buildings within city limits surpass {{convert|300|ft|m}}.
* [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]]: Height limits vary between 75 feet to 460 feet throughout the city, with the primary intent being to protect views of Mount Hood and the West Hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/article/585054|title=Citywide Maximum Building Heights|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=January 1, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social aspects deal with the effects of human society on one's sexuality, while spirituality concerns an individual's spiritual connection with others. Sexuality also affects and is affected by cultural, political, legal, philosophical, [[morality|moral]], [[ethical]], and religious aspects of life.&lt;ref name="S. Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolin"/&gt;

Interest in sexual activity typically increases when an individual reaches [[puberty]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Neil R. and C. Donald Heth. "Psychology: the Science of Behaviour." 4th Edition. Toronto: Pearson Canada Inc., 2007. 684.&lt;/ref&gt; Opinions differ on the origins of an individual's sexual orientation and sexual behavior. Some argue that sexuality is determined by [[genetics]], while others believe it is molded by the environment, or that both of these factors interact to form the individual's sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn-whatis"/&gt; This pertains to the [[nature versus nurture]] debate.  In the former, one assumes that the features of a person innately correspond to their natural inheritance, exemplified by drives and instincts; the latter refers to the assumption that the features of a person continue to change throughout their development and nurturing, exemplified by ego ideals and formative identifications.

Evolutionary perspectives on human coupling, reproduction and [[reproduction strategies]], and [[social learning theory]] provide further views of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;''Sexual Strategies Theory: An Evolutionary Perspective on Human Mating'' by David M. Buss and David P. Schmitt&lt;/ref&gt; Socio-cultural aspects of sexuality include historical developments and religious beliefs. Examples of these include Jewish views on sexual pleasure within marriage and some views of other religions on avoidance of sexual pleasures.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book | author = King, Bruce M. | year = 2013 | title = Human Sexuality Today | edition =  | pages =  | location =  | publisher =  | isbn = 9780136042457 | url =  | quote = }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Some cultures have been described as sexually repressive.

==Development==
===Nature versus nurture===
{{see also|Nature versus nurture}}

Certain characteristics may be innate in humans; these characteristics may be modified by the physical and social environment in which people interact.&lt;ref&gt;Csongradi, C. (n.d.). A new look at an old debate. access excellence. retrieved 12 November 2011, from www.accessexcellence.org/LC/SER/BE/whata.php&lt;/ref&gt; Human sexuality is driven by genetics and [[mental activity]].  The sexual drive affects the development of [[identity (social science)|personal identity]] and social activities.&lt;ref name="Boccadoro L. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari (1972) Anti-Oedipus pp. 322, 114–5&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's [[normative]], social, cultural, educational, and environmental characteristics moderate the sexual drive.&lt;ref name="Boccadoro L. 2008"&gt;Boccadoro L., Carulli S., (2008) Il posto dell'amore negato.  (The place of the denied love. Sexuality and secret psychopathologies – Abstract). Tecnoprint Editrice, Ancona. {{ISBN|978-88-95554-03-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two well-known schools in psychology took opposing positions in the nature-versus-nurture debate: the [[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]] school led by [[Sigmund Freud]] and the [[Behaviorist]] school which traces its origins to [[John Locke]].

Freud believed sexual drives are instinctive. He was a firm supporter of the nature argument; he said there are a large number of instincts but they are reduced into two broad groups: [[Eros]] (the life instinct), which comprises the self-preserving and erotic instincts, and [[Thanatos]] (the death instinct), which comprises instincts invoking aggression, self-destruction, and cruelty.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/freud/ |title=Freud, Sigmund [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave sexual drives a centrality in human life, actions, and behaviors that had not been accepted before his proposal. His instinct theory said humans are driven from birth by the desire to acquire and enhance bodily pleasures, thus supporting the nature debate. Freud redefined the term ''sexuality'' to make it cover any form of pleasure that can be derived from the human body.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt; He also said pleasure lowers tension while displeasure raises it, influencing the sexual drive in humans. His developmentalist perspective was governed by inner forces, especially biological drives and maturation, and his view that humans are biologically inclined to seek sexual gratification demonstrates the nature side of the debate.&lt;ref name="Crain, W. C. 1980"/&gt;
The nurture debate traces back to [[John Locke]] and his theory of the mind as a "[[tabula rasa]]" or blank slate. Later, [[behaviorists]] would apply this notion in support of the idea that the environment is where one develops one's sexual drives.&lt;ref name="Crain, W. C. 1980"&gt;Crain, W. C. (1980). Theories of development: concepts and applications (fifth edition ed.). Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender differences===
{{see also|Sex differences in psychology#Sexual behavior}}

Psychological theories exist regarding the development and expression of gender differences in human sexuality. A number of them, including [[neo-analytic]] theories, [[sociobiological]] theories, [[social learning theory]], [[social role theory]], and [[script theory]], agree in predicting that men should be more approving of casual sex (sex happening outside a stable, committed relationship such as [[marriage]]) and should also be more [[promiscuous]] (have a higher number of sexual partners) than women. These theories are mostly consistent with observed differences in males' and females' attitudes toward casual sex before marriage in the United States; other aspects of human sexuality, such as sexual satisfaction, incidence of [[oral sex]], and attitudes toward [[homosexuality]] and [[masturbation]], show little to no observed difference between males and females. Observed gender differences regarding the number of sexual partners are modest, with males tending to have slightly more than females.&lt;ref name="Oliver &amp; Hyde"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Mary Beth |last2=Hyde |first2=Janet S. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F. |title=Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings |date=2001 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-84-169019-3 |pages=29–43 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qsKNaqIsuUC&amp;pg=PA29 |language=en |chapter=Gender Differences in Sexuality: A Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical anatomy and reproduction===
Males and females are anatomically similar; this extends to some degree to the [[development of the reproductive system]]. As adults, they have different reproductive mechanisms that enable them to perform sexual acts and to reproduce. Men and women react to sexual stimuli in a similar fashion with minor differences. Women have a monthly reproductive cycle, whereas the male sperm production cycle is more continuous.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

====Brain====
The [[hypothalamus]] is the most important part of the brain for sexual functioning. This is a small area at the base of the brain consisting of several groups of nerve cell bodies that receives input from the limbic system. Studies have shown that within lab animals, destruction of certain areas of the hypothalamus causes the elimination of sexual behavior.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The hypothalamus is important because of its relationship to the [[pituitary gland]], which lies beneath it. The pituitary gland secretes hormones that are produced in the hypothalamus and itself. The four important sexual hormones are [[oxytocin]], [[prolactin]], [[follicle-stimulating hormone]], and [[luteinizing hormone]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Oxytocin, sometimes referred to as the "love hormone,"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} is released in both sexes during sexual intercourse when an [[orgasm]] is achieved.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Oxytocin has been suggested as critical to the thoughts and behaviors required to maintain close relationships.&lt;ref name="Sigelman452"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Sigelman |first1=Carol |last2= Rider |first2=Elizabeth | year = 2011 | title =Life-Span Human Development| location = Boston, MA, USA | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | page = 452 |isbn = 1111342733| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=8smBuRecmDsC&amp;pg=PT480 | access-date = 7 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hornstein"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Hornstein |first1=Theresa |last2=Schwerin |first2=Jeri | year = 2012 | title = Biology of Women | location = Boston, MA, USA | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | page = 205 | isbn = 1285401026| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=ibgKAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205 | accessdate = 7 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=February 2016}} The hormone is also released in women when they give birth or are breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book | author = Smith, Linda J. | year = 2010 | title = Impact of Birthing Practices on Breastfeeding | location = Burlington, MA, USA | publisher = [[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|Jones &amp; Bartlett]] | page = 158 | isbn = 0763763748 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=vUncnT6o4k4C&amp;pg=PA158 | access-date = 20 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both prolactin&lt;!--RIGHT?--&gt; and oxytocin stimulate milk production in women.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is responsible for ovulation in women, which acts by triggering egg maturity; in men it stimulates sperm production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Hyde|first1=Janet|authorlink1=Janet Shibley Hyde|last2=DeLamater|first2=John|authorlink2=John DeLamater| last3=Byers|first3=Sandra | year = 2013 | title=Understanding Human Sexuality | edition = 5th Canadian | location = Whitby, ON, CAN | publisher = McGraw-Hill Ryerson | isbn=9780070329720 | pages=100, 102ff | url =  | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers ovulation, which is the release of a mature egg.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

====Male anatomy and reproductive system====
{{main|Human male reproductive system}}

Males also have both internal and external genitalia that are responsible for procreation and sexual intercourse. Production of spermatozoa (sperm) is also cyclic, but unlike the female ovulation cycle, the sperm production cycle is constantly producing millions of sperm daily.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

=====External male anatomy=====
[[File:Penis with Labels.jpg|thumb|upright|External male genitals (depilated).]]
&lt;!--If removing clarifying specification of "uncircumcised", please explain why it is not helpful. Please allow tag for citation of the label content of this editor selfie to remain until the discussion in Talk has ended. (If Doc or someone check's it, against what source? That is what student readers need.) To remove preemptively is disrespectful, and begs the outcome of the discussion.--&gt;

The male genitalia are the penis and the scrotum. The penis provides a passageway for sperm and urine. An average-sized flaccid penis is about {{convert|3+3/4|inch|cm|abbr=out}} in length and {{convert|1+1/5|in|cm|abbr=out}} in diameter. When erect, the average penis is between {{convert|4+1/2|in|cm|abbr=out}} to {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=out}} in length and {{convert|1+1/2|in|cm|abbr=out}} in diameter. The penis's internal structures consist of the [[shaft (penis)|shaft]], [[glans]], and the [[root]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The shaft of the penis consists of three cylindrical bodies of spongy tissue filled with blood vessels along its length. Two of these bodies lie side-by-side in the upper portion of the penis called corpora cavernosa. The third, called the [[corpus spongiosum]], is a tube that lies centrally beneath the others and expands at the end to form the tip of the penis (glans).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innerbody.com/image/repmov.html |title=Male Reproductive System - Explore Anatomy with Detailed Pictures |publisher=Innerbody.com |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raised rim at the border of the shaft and glans is called the corona. The urethra runs through the shaft, providing an exit for sperm and urine. The root consists of the expanded ends of the cavernous bodies, which fan out to form the crura and attach to the pubic bone and the expanded end of the spongy body (bulb). The root is surrounded by two muscles; the [[bulbocavernosus muscle]] and the [[ischiocavernosus muscle]], which aid urination and ejaculation. The penis has a [[foreskin]] that typically covers the glans; this is sometimes removed by [[circumcision]] for medical, religious or cultural reasons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} In the scrotum, the testicles are held away from the body, one possible reason for this is so sperm can be produced in an environment slightly lower than normal body temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drew|first1=Liam|title=The Scrotum Is Nuts|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/07/are_testicles_external_for_cooling_galloping_display_or_something_else.1.html|accessdate=3 July 2015|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']]|date=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madaras|first1=Lynda Madaras with Area|title=The what's happening to my body? book for boys|date=2008|publisher=Newmarket|location=New York|isbn=9781557047656|edition=Rev.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zC1g5gdJc_kC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Internal male anatomy=====
[[File:Male anatomy.png|thumb|The male reproductive system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luckymojo.com/faqs/altsex/penis.html |title=The Sexual Anatomy Of Men |publisher=Luckymojo.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Male internal reproductive structures are the testicles, the duct system, the prostate and seminal vesicles, and the [[bulbourethral gland|Cowper's gland]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The testicles are the male gonads where sperm and male hormones are produced. Millions of sperm are produced daily in several hundred seminiferous tubules. Cells called the [[Leydig cell]]s lie between the tubules; these produce hormones called androgens; these consist of [[testosterone]] and [[inhibin]]. The testicles are held by the spermatic cord, which is a tubelike structure containing blood vessels, nerves, the vas deferens, and a muscle that helps to raise and lower the testicles in response to temperature changes and sexual arousal, in which the testicles are drawn closer to the body.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Sperm are transported through a four-part duct system. The first part of this system is the [[epididymis]]. The testicles converge to form the [[seminiferous tubules]], coiled tubes at the top and back of each testicle. The second part of the duct system is the [[vas deferens]], a muscular tube that begins at the lower end of the epididymis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The vas deferens passes upward along the side of the testicles to become part of the spermatic cord.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The expanded end is the ampulla, which stores sperm before ejaculation. The third part of the duct system is the ejaculatory ducts, which are {{convert|1|in|cm|abbr=out|adj=on}}-long paired tubes that pass through the prostate gland, where semen is produced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The prostate gland is a solid, chestnut-shaped organ that surrounds the first part of the urethra, which carries urine and semen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Similar to the female G-spot, the prostate provides sexual stimulation and can lead to [[orgasm]] through [[anal sex]].&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=133–135|accessdate = March 31, 2016| isbn = 0618755713|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prostate gland and the seminal vesicles produce seminal fluid that is mixed with sperm to create semen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The prostate gland lies under the bladder and in front of the rectum. It consists of two main zones: the inner zone that produces secretions to keep the lining of the male urethra moist and the outer zone that produces seminal fluids to facilitate the passage of semen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The seminal vesicles secrete fructose for sperm activation and mobilization, prostaglandins to cause uterine contractions that aid movement through the uterus, and bases that help neutralize the acidity of the vagina. The Cowper's glands, or bulbourethral glands, are two pea sized structures beneath the prostate.

====Female anatomy and reproductive system====
{{Main|Human female reproductive system}}

=====External female anatomy=====
[[File:Vulva labeled english.jpg|thumb|upright|External female genitals (depilated).]]

The mons veneris, also known as the [[Mons pubis|Mound of Venus]], is a soft layer of fatty tissue overlaying the pubic bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hyde |last2=DeLamater |last3=Byers|title=Understanding Human Sexuality 5th Canadian ed.|isbn=9780070329720|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following puberty, this area grows in size. It has many nerve endings and is sensitive to stimulation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The labia minora and labia majora are collectively known as the lips. The labia majora are two elongated folds of skin extending from the mons to the perineum. Its outer surface becomes covered with hair after puberty. In between the labia majora are the labia minora, two hairless folds of skin that meet above the clitoris to form the clitoral hood, which is highly sensitive to touch. The labia minora become engorged with blood during sexual stimulation, causing them to swell and turn red.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The labia minora are composed of connective tissues that are richly supplied with blood vessels which cause the pinkish appearance.

The vaginal opening and the urethral opening are only visible when the labia minora are parted. These opening have many nerve endings that make them sensitive to touch. They are surrounded by a ring of sphincter muscles called the [[bulbocavernosus muscle]]. Underneath this muscle and on opposite sides of the vaginal opening are the vestibular bulbs, which help the vagina grip the penis by swelling with blood during arousal. Within the vaginal opening is the [[hymen]], a thin membrane that partially covers the opening in many [[Virginity|virgins]]. Rupture of the hymen has been historically considered the loss of  one's virginity, though by modern standards, loss of virginity is considered to be the first sexual intercourse. The hymen can be ruptured by activities other than sexual intercourse. The urethral opening connects to the bladder with the urethra; it expels urine from the bladder. This is located below the clitoris and above the vaginal opening.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[breast]]s are external organs used for sexual pleasure in some cultures. Western culture is one of the few in which they are considered erotic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The breasts are the subcutaneous tissues on the front thorax of the female body.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; Breasts are modified sweat glands made up of fibrous tissues and fat that provide support and contain nerves, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; Their purpose is to provide milk to a developing infant. Breasts develop during puberty in response to an increase in estrogen. Each adult breast consists of 15 to 20 milk-producing [[mammary glands]], irregularly shaped lobes that include [[alveolar gland]]s and a lactiferous duct leading to the nipple. The lobes are separated by dense connective tissues that support the glands and attach them to the tissues on the underlying pectoral muscles.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; Other connective tissue, which forms dense strands called suspensory ligaments, extends inward from the skin of the breast to the pectoral tissue to support the weight of the breast.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; Heredity and the quantity of fatty tissue determine the size of the breasts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

=====Internal female anatomy=====
{{main|Female reproductive system}}
[[File:Female reproductive system lateral.png|thumb|The female reproductive system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luckymojo.com/faqs/altsex/vulva.html |title=The Sexual Anatomy Of Women: Vulva and Vagina |publisher=Luckymojo.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The female internal reproductive organs are the [[vagina]], [[uterus]], [[Fallopian tube]]s, and [[ovary|ovaries]]. The vagina is a sheath-like canal that extends from the vulva to the cervix. It receives the penis during intercourse and serves as a depository for sperm. The vagina is also the [[birth canal]]; it can expand to {{convert|10|cm|inch|abbr=on}} during labor and delivery. The vagina is located between the [[bladder]] and the [[rectum]]. The vagina is normally collapsed, but during [[sexual arousal]] it opens, lengthens, and produces lubrication to allow the insertion of the penis. The vagina has three layered walls; it is a self-cleaning organ with natural  bacteria that suppress the production of yeast.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The [[G-spot]], named after the [[Ernst Gräfenberg]] who first reported it in 1950, may be located in the front wall of the vagina and may cause orgasms. This area may vary in size and location between women; in some it may be absent. Various researchers dispute its structure or existence, or regard it as an extension of the clitoris.&lt;ref name=Hines&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hines T |date=August 2001 |title=The G-Spot: A modern gynecologic myth |journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol |volume=185 |issue=2 |pages=359–62 | doi=10.1067/mob.2001.115995  |pmid=11518892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balon, Segraves"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard |last1=Balon |first2=Robert Taylor |last2=Segraves|title=Clinical Manual of Sexual Disorders |publisher= [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Pub]]|year=2009|accessdate=24 January 2014|page=258|isbn=1585629057|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=YuP3Hb0TMLQC |}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is the Female G-Spot Truly a Distinct Anatomic Entity?|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|volume= 9|date=January 2012 |pmid=22240236|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02623.x|laysummary=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/19/g-spot-does-not-exist_n_1215822.html|laysource=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|laydate=19 January 2012 |last1=Kilchevsky |first1=A |last2=Vardi |first2=Y |last3=Lowenstein |first3=L |last4=Gruenwald |first4=I |issue=3|pages=719–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uterus or womb is a hollow, muscular organ where a fertilized egg (ovum) will implant itself and grow into a fetus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The uterus lies in the pelvic cavity between the bladder and the [[bowel]], and above the vagina. It is usually positioned in a 90-degree angle tilting forward, although in about 20% of women it tilts backwards.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; The uterus has three layers; the innermost layer is the [[endometrium]], where the egg is implanted. During ovulation, this thickens for implantation. If implantation does not occur, it is sloughed off during menstruation. The cervix is the narrow end of the uterus. The broad part of the uterus is the [[fundus (uterus)|fundus]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

During [[ovulation]], the ovum travels down the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. These extend about {{convert|4|inch|cm|spell=in}} from both sides of the uterus. Finger-like projections at the ends of the tubes brush the ovaries and receive the ovum once it is released. The ovum then travels for three to four days to the uterus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} After sexual intercourse, sperm swim up this funnel from the uterus. The lining of the tube and its secretions sustain the egg and the sperm, encouraging [[fertilization]] and nourishing the ovum until it reaches the uterus. If the ovum divides after fertilization, [[identical twins]] are produced. If separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm, the mother gives birth to non-identical or [[fraternal twins]].&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt;

The ovaries are the female gonads; they develop from the same embryonic tissue as the [[testicles]]. The ovaries are suspended by ligaments and are the source where ova are stored and developed before ovulation. The ovaries also produce female hormones [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]]. Within the ovaries, each ovum is surrounded by other cells and contained within a capsule called a primary follicle. At puberty, one or more of these follicles are stimulated to mature on a monthly basis. Once matured, these are called [[Graafian follicles]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The female reproductive system does not produce the ova; about 60,000 ova are present at birth, only  400 of which will mature during the woman's lifetime.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt;

Ovulation is based on a monthly cycle; the 14th day is the most fertile. On days one to four, menstruation and production of estrogen and progesterone decreases, and the endometrium starts thinning. The endometrium is sloughed off for the next three to six days. Once menstruation ends, the cycle begins again with an FSH surge from the pituitary gland. Days five to thirteen are known as the pre-ovulatory stage. During this stage, the pituitary gland secretes [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH). A negative feedback loop is enacted when estrogen is secreted to inhibit the release of FSH. Estrogen thickens the endometrium of the uterus. A surge of [[Luteinizing Hormone]] (LH) triggers ovulation. On day 14, the LH surge causes a Graafian follicle to surface the ovary. The follicle ruptures and the ripe ovum is expelled into the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tubes pick up the ovum with the [[Fimbriae of uterine tube|fimbria]]. The cervical mucus changes to aid the movement of sperm. On days 15 to 28—the post-ovulatory stage, the Graafian follicle—now called the [[corpus luteum]]—secretes estrogen. Production of progesterone increases, inhibiting LH release. The endometrium thickens to prepare for implantation, and the ovum travels down the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. If the ovum is not fertilized and does not implant, menstruation begins.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

===Sexual response cycle===

The sexual response cycle is a model that describes the physiological responses that occur during sexual activity. This model was created by [[William Masters]] and [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]]. According to Masters and Johnson, the human sexual response cycle consists of four phases; excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution, also called the EPOR model. During the excitement phase of the EPOR model, one attains the intrinsic motivation to have sex. The plateau phase is the precursor to orgasm, which may be mostly biological for men and mostly psychological for women. Orgasm is the release of tension, and the resolution period is the unaroused state before the cycle begins again.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The male sexual response cycle starts in the excitement phase; two centers in the spine are responsible for erections. Vasoconstriction in the penis begins, the heart rate increases, the scrotum thickens, the spermatic cord shortens, and the testicles become engorged with blood. In the plateau phase, the penis increases in diameter, the testicles become more engorged, and the Cowper's glands secrete pre-seminal fluid. The orgasm phase, during which rhythmic contractions occur every 0.8 seconds{{Verify source|date=May 2012}}, consists of two phases; the emission phase, in which contractions of the vas deferens, prostate, and seminal vesicles encourage ejaculation, which is the second phase of orgasm. Ejaculation is called the expulsion phase; it cannot be reached without an orgasm. In the resolution phase, the male is now in an unaroused state consisting of a [[Refractory period (sex)|refactory (rest) period]] before the cycle can begin. This rest period may increase with age.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The female sexual response begins with the excitement phase, which can last from several minutes to several hours. Characteristics of this phase include increased heart and respiratory rate, and an elevation of blood pressure. Flushed skin or blotches of redness may occur on the chest and back; breasts increase slightly in size and nipples may become hardened and erect. The onset of [[vasocongestion]] results in swelling of the clitoris, labia minora, and vagina.  The muscle that surrounds the vaginal opening tightens and the uterus elevates and grows in size. The vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating liquid. The second phase, called the plateau phase, is characterized primarily by the intensification of the changes begun during the excitement phase. The plateau phase extends to the brink of orgasm, which initiates the resolution stage; the reversal of the changes begun during the excitement phase. During the orgasm stage the heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and breathing rates peak. The pelvic muscle near the vagina, the anal sphincter, and the uterus contract. Muscle contractions in the vaginal area create a high level of pleasure, though all orgasms are centered in the clitoris.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Intimacy |first=Sinclair |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/sexual-response-dictionary1.htm |title=Discovery Health "Sexual Response" |publisher=Health.howstuffworks.com |date=25 April 2005 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proplusmedical.com/pages.html?pages_id=8 |title=Female Sexual Response Cycle |publisher=Proplusmedical.com |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koedt70"&gt;{{cite web |last = Koedt |first = Anne |title = The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |publisher = Chicago Women's Liberation Union |year = 1970 |url = http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |accessdate = 2010-11-18 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160819232224/http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |archivedate = 19 August 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of the neurobiological factors of human sexuality===
From [[rodent]] to human, the corticalization of the brain induces several changes in the control of sexual behavior, including lordosis behavior. These changes induce a "difference between the stereotyped sexual behaviors in non-human mammals and the astounding variety of human sexual behaviors".&lt;ref name="agmo"/&gt;
[[File:Evolution of the biological factors of sexual behavior.png|thumb|600px|left|Evolution of the main neurobiological factors that control the sexual behavior of mammals.&lt;ref name="agmo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nei2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wunsch2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"/&gt;]] {{clr}}

Sexual reflexes, such as the motor reflex of lordosis, become secondary. In particular, lordosis behavior, which is a motor reflex complex and essential to carry out [[copulation]] in non-primate mammals ([[rodent]]s, [[Canidae|canines]], [[bovid]]s ...), is apparently no longer functional in women. Sexual stimuli on women do not trigger any more neither immobilization nor the reflex position of lordosis. On the level of olfactory systems, the [[vomeronasal organ]] is altered in [[hominid]]s&lt;ref name="zhang"&gt;Zhang J., Webb D. M. (2003) Evolutionary deterioration of the vomeronasal [[pheromone]] transduction pathway in catarrhine primates, ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', 100(14):8337-8341.&lt;/ref&gt; and 90% of the pheromone [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[gene]]s become [[pseudogene]]s in humans.&lt;ref name="nei2008"&gt;Nei M., Niimura Y., Nozawa M.

Humans can have sex anytime during the year and [[Menstrual cycle|hormonal cycles]]. On the contrary, the importance of [[Reward system|rewards / reinforcements]] and [[cognition]] became major. Especially in humans, the extensive development of the [[neocortex]] allows the emergence of [[culture]], which has a major influence on behavior.&lt;ref name="gagnon2005"&gt;Gagnon J.

In human beings, sexuality is multifactorial, with several factors that interact (genes, hormones, conditioning, sexual preferences, emotions, cognitive processes, cultural context). The relative importance of each of these factors is dependent both on individual physiological characteristics, personal experience and aspects of the sociocultural environment.&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"/&gt;

===Sexual dysfunction and sexual problems===
{{main|Sexual dysfunction}}
Sexual disorders, according to the DSM-IV-TR, are disturbances in sexual desire and psycho-physiological changes that characterize the sexual response cycle and cause marked distress, and interpersonal difficulty. The sexual dysfunctions is a result of physical or psychological disorders. The physical causes include, hormonal imbalance, diabetes, heart disease and more. The psychological causes includes but are not limited to, stress, anxiety, and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Female Sexual Dysfunction|url=http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/sexual-dysfunction-women|website=www.webmd.com|publisher=webmd.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual dysfunction affects men and women. There are four major categories of sexual problems for women: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasmic disorders, and sexual pain disorders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The sexual desire disorder occurs when an individual lacks the sexual desire because of hormonal changes, depression, and pregnancy.The arousal disorder is a female sexual dysfunction. Arousal disorder means lack of vaginal lubrication. In addition, blood flow problems may affect arousal disorder. Lack of orgasm, also known as, anorgasmia is another sexual dysfunction in women. The anorgasmia occurs in women with psychological disorders such as guilt and anxiety that was caused by sexual assault. The last sexual disorder is the painful intercourse. The sexual disorder can be result of pelvic mass, scar tissue, sexually transmitted disease and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Female Sexual Dysfunction|url=http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/sexual-dysfunction-women?page=2|website=www.webmd.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also three common sexual disorders for men including, sexual desire, ejaculation disorder, and erectile dysfunction.  The lack of sexual desire in men is because of loss of libido, low testosterone. There are also psychological factors such as anxiety, and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male Sexual Problems|url=http://www.webmd.com/men/guide/mental-health-male-sexual-problems?page=2|website=Webmd.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ejaculation disorder has three types, Retrograde ejaculation, retarded ejaculation, premature ejaculation. The erectile dysfunction is a disability to have and maintain an erection during intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Our Bodies, Ourselves|date=2011|publisher=BOSTON WOMEN'S HEALTH BOOK COLLECTIVE|isbn=978-0-7432-5611-7|edition=35th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gender identity]] is a person's sense of self-identification as female, male, both, neither, or somewhere in between. The social construction of gender has been discussed by many scholars, including [[Judith Butler]]. More recent research has focused upon the influence of feminist theory and courtship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = D.M. | year = 2002 | title = Human mating strategies | url = | journal = Samdunfsokonemen | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 48–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, W.

Sexual behavior and intimate relationships are strongly influenced by a person's sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Coon, D. 2007"&gt;Coon, D., &amp; Mitterer, J. O. (2007). Introduction to psychology: gateways to mind and behavior (11th ed.). Australia: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation is an enduring pattern of [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[Sexual attraction|sexual]] attraction (or a combination of these) to persons of the opposite sex, same sex, or both sexes.&lt;ref name="Coon, D. 2007"/&gt; Heterosexual people are romantically/sexually attracted to the members of the opposite sex, gay and lesbian people are romantically/sexually attracted to people of the same sex, and those who are bisexual are romantically/sexually attracted to both sexes.&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn-whatis"/&gt;

Before the [[High Middle Ages]], homosexual acts appear to have been ignored or tolerated by the Christian church.&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html |title=Homosexuality and Mental Health |publisher=Psychology.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 12th century, hostility toward homosexuality began to spread throughout religious and secular institutions. By the end of the 19th century, it was viewed as a pathology.&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"/&gt; [[Havelock Ellis]] and Sigmund Freud adopted more accepting stances; Ellis said homosexuality was inborn and therefore not immoral, not a disease, and that many homosexuals made significant contributions to society.&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"/&gt; Freud wrote that all human beings as capable of becoming either heterosexual or homosexual; neither orientation was assumed to be innate.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"&gt;{{cite book | author = King, Bruce M. | year = 2009 | title = Human Sexuality Today | edition = 6th | pages =  | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA | publisher = Pearson Education | isbn =  | url =  | access-date =  | quote = }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} According to Freud, a person's orientation depended on the resolution of the Oedipus complex. He said male homosexuality resulted when a young boy had an authoritarian, rejecting mother and turned to his father for love and affection, and later to men in general. He said female homosexuality developed when a girl loved her mother and identified with her father, and became fixated at that stage.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Freud and Ellis said homosexuality resulted from reversed gender roles. In the early 21st century, this view is reinforced by the media's portrayal of male homosexuals as effeminate and female homosexuals as masculine.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} A person's conformity or non-conformity to gender stereotypes does not always predict sexual orientation. Society believes that if a man is masculine he is heterosexual, and if a man is feminine he is homosexual. There is no strong evidence that a homosexual or bisexual orientation must be associated with atypical gender roles. By the early 21st century, homosexuality was no longer considered to be a pathology. Theories have linked many factors, including genetic, anatomical, birth order, and hormones in the prenatal environment, to homosexuality.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Other than the need to procreate, there are many other reasons people have sex. According to one study conducted on college students (Meston &amp; Buss, 2007), the four main reasons for sexual activities are; physical attraction, as a means to an end, to increase emotional connection, and to alleviate insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychology |year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers |page=336|author1=Daniel L.

==Sexuality and age==

===Child sexuality===
{{Main|Child sexuality}}
In the past{{when|date=June 2015}}, children were often assumed not to have sexuality until later development. Sigmund Freud was one of the first researchers to take child sexuality seriously. His ideas, such as psychosexual development and the Oedipus conflict, have been much debated but acknowledging the existence of child sexuality was an important development.&lt;ref name="Santrock, J.W. 2008"&gt;Santrock, J.W. (2008). A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4thed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud gave sexual drives an importance and centrality in human life, actions, and behavior; he said sexual drives exist and can be discerned in children from birth. He explains this in his theory of [[infantile sexuality]], and says sexual energy ([[libido]]) is the most important motivating force in adult life. Freud wrote about the importance of interpersonal relationships to one's sexual and emotional development. From birth, the mother's connection to the infant affects the infant's later capacity for pleasure and [[attachment theory|attachment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bretherton | first1 = Inge | year = 1992 | title = The origins of attachment theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth | url = http://cmapspublic2.ihmc.us/rid=1LQX400NM-RBVKH9-1KL6/the%20origins%20of%20attachment%20theory%20john%20bowlby%20and%20mary%20ainsworth.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = 5| page = 759 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Freud described two currents of emotional life; an affectionate current, including our bonds with the important people in our lives; and a sensual current, including our wish to gratify sexual impulses. During adolescence, a young person tries to integrate these two emotional currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alcorn|first1=Jean-Michel Quinodoz; translated by David|title=Reading Freud: a chronological exploration of Freud's writings|date=2005|isbn=9781317710509|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A8hdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT165|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Kinsey]] also examined child sexuality in his [[Kinsey Reports]]. Children are naturally curious about their bodies and sexual functions. For example, they wonder where babies come from, they notice the differences between males and females, and many engage in [[genital play]], which is often mistaken for masturbation. Child sex play, also known as [[playing doctor]], includes exhibiting or inspecting the genitals. Many children take part in some sex play, typically with siblings or friends.&lt;ref name="Santrock, J.W. 2008"/&gt; Sex play with others usually decreases as children grow, but they may later possess romantic interest in their peers. Curiosity levels remain high during these years, but the main surge in sexual interest occurs in adolescence.&lt;ref name="Santrock, J.W. 2008"/&gt;

===Sexuality in late adulthood===
{{Main|Sexuality in older age}}
Adult sexuality originates in childhood. However, like many other human capacities, sexuality is not fixed, but matures and develops. A common stereotype associated with old people is that they tend to lose interest and the ability to engage in sexual acts once they reach late adulthood. This misconception is reinforced by Western popular culture, which often ridicules older adults who try to engage in sexual activities. Age does not necessarily change the need or desire to be sexually expressive or active. A couple in a long-term relationship may find that the frequency of their sexual activity decreases over time and the type of sexual expression may change, but many couples experience increased intimacy and love.&lt;ref name=jrank&gt;[http://family.jrank.org/pages/1532/Sexuality-in-Adulthood-Aging.html Sexuality in Adulthood - Aging], JRank Marriage and Family Encyclopedia, Net Industries&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sexuality can be understood as part of the social life of humans, which is governed by implied rules of behavior and the status quo. This narrows the view to groups within a society.&lt;ref name="Rathus, Spencer A. 2007"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The socio-cultural context of society, including the effects of politics and the mass media, influences and forms social norms. Before the early 21st century, people fought for their civil rights. The civil rights movements helped to bring about massive changes in social norms; examples include the sexual revolution and the rise of feminism.&lt;ref name=Escoffier2003&gt;{{cite book|editor=Escoffier, Jeffrey |title=Sexual Revolution |publisher=Running Press |year=2003 |isbn=1-56025-525-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedan&gt;{{cite news|title=Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85 |url=http://www-nc.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/national/05friedan.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=5 February 2006 |accessdate=12 October 2009}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link between constructed sexual meanings and racial ideologies has been studied. Sexual meanings are constructed to maintain racial-ethnic-national boundaries by denigration of "others" and regulation of sexual behavior within the group. According to Joane Nagel, "both adherence to and deviation from such approved behaviors, define and reinforce racial, ethnic, and nationalist regimes".&lt;ref name=Nagel&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nagel, Joane |date=August 2000 |title=Ethnicity and Sexuality |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=26 |pp=107–133 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nagel2&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nagel, Joane |year=2001 |title=Racial, Ethnic, and National Boundaries: Sexual Intersections and Symbolic Interactions |journal=Symbolic Interaction |volume=24 | issue = 2  |pp=123–139 |doi=10.1525/si.2001.24.2.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars also study the ways in which [[colonialism]] has effected sexuality today and argue that due to [[racism]] and [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] it has been dramatically changed from the way it had previously been understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rojas|first1=Maythee|title=Women of Color and Feminism|date=2009|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=978-1-58005-272-6|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3KBFhDytERkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-11-30|ref=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KBFhDytERkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes to sexuality are argued to be largely effected by the enforcement of the [[gender binary]] and [[heteropatriarchy]] as tools of colonization on colonized communities as seen in nations such as [[Hijra (South Asia)|India]], [[fa'afafine|Samoa]], and the [[First Nations]] in the Americas, resulting in the deaths and erasure of non-western genders and sexualities. In the United States people of color face the effects of colonialism in different ways with stereotypes such as the Mammy, and Jezabel for Black women; [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|lotus blossom, and dragon lady]] for Asian women; and the "spicy" Latina.&lt;ref name="Mammy Jezebel and Sistahs on Racism.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yarbrough|first1=Marilyn|last2=Bennet|first2=Crystal|title=Mammy Jezebel and Sistahs|url=http://racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1277:aawomen01a&amp;catid=72&amp;Itemid=215|website=Race, Racism and the Law!|publisher=racism.org|accessdate=2015-11-30|ref=http://racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1277:aawomen01a&amp;catid=72&amp;Itemid=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age and manner in which children are informed of issues of sexuality is a matter of sex education. The school systems in almost all developed countries have some form of sex education, but the nature of the issues covered varies widely. In some countries, such as Australia and much of Europe, age-appropriate sex education often begins in pre-school, whereas other countries leave sex education to the pre-teenage and teenage years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Think Sex |publisher=TheAge.com.au |accessdate=11 October 2009|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/education-news/think-sex/2006/05/28/1148754861223.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex education covers a range of topics, including the physical, mental, and social aspects of sexual behavior. Geographic location also plays a role in society's opinion of the appropriate age for children to learn about sexuality. According to ''TIME'' magazine and CNN,{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}} 74% of teenagers in the United States reported that their major sources of sexual information were their peers and the media, compared to 10% who named their parents or a sex education course.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

===Religious sexual morality===
{{Main|Religion and sexuality}}
In some religions, sexual behavior is regarded as primarily spiritual. In others it is treated as primarily physical. Some hold that sexual behavior is only spiritual within certain kinds of relationships, when used for specific purposes, or when incorporated into religious ritual. In some religions there are no distinctions between the physical and the spiritual, whereas some religions view human sexuality as a way of completing the gap that exists between the spiritual and the physical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion and Sexuality|url=http://www.iwgonline.org/sexuality/|publisher=Interfaith Working Group|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religious conservatives, especially those of [[Abrahamic religions]] and [[Christianity]] in particular, tend to view sexuality in terms of behavior (''i.e.'' homosexuality or heterosexuality is what someone does) and certain sexualities such as [[bisexuality]] tend to be ignored as a result of this.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} These conservatives tend to promote [[celibacy]] for gay people, and may also tend to believe that sexuality can be changed through [[conversion therapy]]&lt;ref name=Tolerance111&gt;{{cite web | title= Two Definitions and Six Interpretations | url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom6beli.htm | website=religioustolerance.org | accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[prayer]] to become an [[ex-gay]]. They may also see homosexuality as a form of mental illness, something that ought to be criminalised, an immoral abomination, caused by ineffective parenting, and view [[same-sex marriage]] as a threat to society.&lt;ref name=Tolerance222&gt;{{cite web|title=Subdividing Two Extreme Belief Systems About Homosexuality Into Six Discrete Viewpoints | url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom7beli.htm|website=religioustolerance.org | accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, most religious liberals define sexuality-related labels in terms of [[sexual attraction]] and self-identification.&lt;ref name=Tolerance111 /&gt; They may also view same-sex activity as morally neutral and as legally acceptable as opposite-sex activity, unrelated to mental illness, genetically or environmentally caused (but not as the result of bad parenting), and fixed. They also tend to be more in favor of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=Tolerance222 /&gt;

====Attitude by religion====
According to [[Judaism]], sex between man and woman within marriage is sacred and should be enjoyed; celibacy is considered sinful.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] teaches that sexuality is "noble and worthy"&lt;ref&gt;Second Vatican Council, Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the World of Today, no. 49: AAS 58 (1966), 1070&lt;/ref&gt; but that it must be used in accordance with natural law. For this reason, all sexual activity must occur in the context of a marriage between a man and a woman, and must not be divorced from the possibility of conception. Most forms of sex without the possibility of conception are considered intrinsically disordered and sinful, such as the use of contraceptives, [[masturbation]], and homosexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church: The Sixth Commandment|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm|website=vatican.va|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], sexual desire is considered to be a natural urge that should not be suppressed, although the concept of free sex is not accepted; these urges should be fulfilled responsibly. Marriage is considered to be a good deed; it does not hinder spiritual wayfaring. The term used for marriage within the [[Quran]] is ''nikah'', which literally means sexual intercourse. Although Islamic sexuality is restrained via [[Islamic sexual jurisprudence]], it emphasizes sexual pleasure within marriage. It is acceptable for a man to have more than one wife, but he must take care of those wives physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, and spiritually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Stearns, Peter N. | year =  | title = Major Patterns of Change and Continuity: World History in Brief | edition =  | pages =  | location =  | publisher =  | isbn =  | url =  | access-date =  | quote = }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}} Muslims believe that sexual intercourse is an act of worship that fulfils emotional and physical needs, and that producing children is one way in which humans can contribute to God's creation, and Islam discourages celibacy once an individual is married. However, homosexuality is strictly forbidden in Islam, and some Muslim lawyers have suggested that gay people should be put to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam: beliefs about love and sex|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/relationships/isloveandsexrev1.shtml|publisher=GCSE BBC Bitesize|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some have argued that Islam has an open and playful approach to sex&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10031095/Sex-What-Muslim-women-really-want-in-the-bedroom.html], Article titled "Sex: What Muslim women really want in the bedroom", by Shelina Janmohamed, The Telegraph, 2 May 2013, accessed on 23 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "100 facts"&gt;[http://facts.randomhistory.com/islam-facts.html 100 Interesting Facts About Islam]{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; so long as it is within marriage, free of lewdness, fornication and adultery. For many Muslims, [[sex with reference to the Quran]] indicates that – bar anal intercourse and adultery – a Muslim marital home bonded by ''[[Nikah]]'' marital contract between husband and his wife(s) should enjoy and even indulge, within the privacy of their marital home, in limitless scope of [[heterosexual]] sexual acts within a [[monogamous]] or [[polygamous]] marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lifeinsideislam.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/sex-in-reference-to-the-quran/ Sex in reference to Quran] by A Taha, Accessed on 22 October 2015{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism]] emphasizes that sex is only appropriate between husband and wife, in which satisfying sexual urges through sexual pleasure is an important duty of marriage. Any sex before marriage is considered to interfere with intellectual development, especially between birth and the age of 25, which is said to be brahmacharya and this should be avoided. [[Kama]] (sensual pleasures) is one of the four purusharthas or aims of life (dharma, artha, kama, and moksha).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/relationships/hiloveandsexrev1.shtml |title=GCSE Bitesize: Hindu views |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' deals partially with sexual intercourse; it is not exclusively a sexual or religious work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indrasinha.com/kama-sutra/ Common misconceptions about ''Kama Sutra''.] "The ''Kama Sutra'' is neither exclusively a sex manual nor, as also commonly used art, a sacred or religious work. It is certainly not a [[Tantra|tantric]] text. In opening with a discussion of the three aims of ancient Hindu life&amp;nbsp;– [[dharma]], [[artha]] and [[kama]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Vātsyāyana|Vatsyayana's]] purpose is to set kama, or enjoyment of the senses, in context. Thus dharma or virtuous living is the highest aim, artha, the amassing of wealth is next, and kama is the least of three." —[[Indra Sinha]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Carroll| first = Janell| title = Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]| year = 2009| page = 7| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&amp;pg=PA7| isbn = 978-0-495-60274-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Devi| first = Chandi| title = From Om to Orgasm: The Tantra Primer for Living in Bliss| publisher = [[AuthorHouse]]| year = 2008| page = 288| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gIqhh84DGToC&amp;pg=PA288| isbn = 978-1-4343-4960-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sikhism]] views [[chastity]] as important, as Sikhs believe that the divine spark of ''[[Waheguru]]'' is present inside every individual's body, therefore it is important for one to keep clean and pure. Sexual activity is limited to married couples, and extramarital sex is forbidden. Marriage is seen as a commitment to ''Waheguru'' and should be viewed as part of spiritual companionship, rather than just sexual intercourse, and [[monogamy]] is deeply emphasised in Sikhism. Any other way of living is discouraged, including celibacy and homosexuality. However, in comparison to other religions, the issue of sexuality in Sikhism is not considered one of paramount importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sikhism: beliefs about love and sex|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/relationships/sikhloveandsexrev1.shtml|publisher=GCSE BBC Bitesize|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexuality has been an important, vital part of human existence throughout history.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite book | author = Stearns, Peter N. | year =  | title = Sexuality in World History | edition =  | pages =  | location =  | publisher =  | isbn = 9780415777773 | url =  | quote = }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} All civilizations have managed sexuality through sexual standards, representations, and behavior.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Before the rise of agriculture, groups of hunter/gatherers (H/G) and nomads inhabited the world. Within these groups, some implications of male dominance existed, but there were signs that women were active participants in sexuality, with bargaining power of their own. These hunter/gatherers had less restrictive sexual standards that emphasized sexual pleasure and enjoyment, but with definite rules and constraints. Some underlying continuities or key regulatory standards contended with the tension between recognition of pleasure, interest, and the need to procreate for the sake of social order and economic survival. H/G groups also placed high value on certain types of sexual symbolism. Two common tensions in H/G societies are expressed in their art, which emphasizes male sexuality and prowess, with equally common tendencies to blur gender lines in sexual matters. One example of these male-dominated portrayals is the [[Egyptian creation myth]], in which the sun god [[Atum]] masturbates in the water, creating the [[Nile River]]. In [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] myth, the Gods' semen filled the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Once agricultural societies emerged, the sexual framework shifted in ways that persisted for many millennia in much of Asia, Africa, Europe, and parts of the Americas. One common characteristic new to these societies was the collective supervision of sexual behavior due to urbanization, and the growth of population and population density. Children would commonly witness parents having sex because many families shared the same sleeping quarters. Due to landownership, determination of children's paternity became important, and society and family life became patriarchal. These changes in sexual ideology were used to control female sexuality and to differentiate standards by gender. With these ideologies, sexual possessiveness and increases in jealousy emerged. With the domestication of animals, new opportunities for [[bestiality]]  arose. Males mostly performed these types of sexual acts and many societies acquired firm rules against it. These acts also explain the many depictions of half-human, half-animal mythical creatures, and the sports of gods and goddesses with animals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; While retaining the precedents of earlier civilizations, each classical civilization established a somewhat distinctive approach to gender, artistic expression of sexual beauty, and to behaviors such as homosexuality. Some of these distinctions are portrayed in sex manuals, which were also common among civilizations in China, Greece, Rome, Persia, and India; each has its own sexual history.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

During the beginning of the [[industrial revolution]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, many changes in sexual standards occurred. New, dramatic, artificial birth control devices such as the [[condom]] and [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] were introduced. Doctors started claiming a new role in sexual matters, urging that their advice was crucial to sexual morality and health. New pornographic industries grew and Japan adopted its first laws against homosexuality. In western societies, the definition of homosexuality was constantly changing; western influence on other cultures became more prevalent. New contacts created serious issues around sexuality and sexual traditions. There were also major shifts in sexual behavior. During this period, puberty began occurring at younger ages, so a new focus on adolescence as a time of sexual confusion and danger emerged. There was a new focus on the purpose of marriage; it was increasing regarded as being for love rather than only for economics and reproduction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Alfred Kinsey]] initiated the modern era of sex research. He collected data from questionnaires given to his students at [[Indiana University]], but then switched to personal interviews about sexual behaviors. Kinsey and his colleagues sampled 5,300 men and 5,940 women. He found that most people masturbated, that many engaged in [[oral sex]], that women are capable of having multiple orgasms, and that many men had had some type of homosexual experience in their lifetimes. Many{{who|date=June 2015}} believe he was the major influence in changing 20th century attitudes about sex. [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction]] at Indiana University continues to be a major center for the study of human sexuality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Before [[William Masters]], a physician, and [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]], a [[behavioral scientist]], the study of anatomy and physiological studies of sex was still limited to experiments with laboratory animals. Masters and Johnson started to directly observe and record the physical responses in humans that are engaged in sexual activity under laboratory settings. They observed 10,000 episodes of sexual acts between 312 men and 382 women. This led to methods of treating clinical problems and abnormalities. Masters and Johnson opened the first sex therapy clinic in 1965. In 1970, they described their therapeutic techniques in their book, ''[[Human Sexual Inadequacy]]''.{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

People both consciously and subconsciously seek to attract others with whom they can form deep relationships. This may be for companionship, procreation, or an intimate relationship. This involves interactive processes whereby people find and attract potential partners and maintain a relationship. These processes, which involve attracting one or more partners and maintaining sexual interest, can include:
* [[Flirting]], the attraction of the sexual attention of another to encourage romance or sexual relations. It can involve [[body language]], conversation, joking, or brief physical contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html SIRC Guide to Flirting. What Social Science can tell you about flirting and how to do it.] Retrieved 13 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Flirting is a socially accepted way of attracting someone. There are different types of flirting, and most people usually have one way of flirting that makes them most comfortable. When flirting, people can be polite, playful, physical, etc. Sometimes it is difficult to know whether or not the person is interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.ku.edu/2013/09/11/new-book-outlines-five-types-flirting-styles |title= New book outlines five types of flirting styles |last=Schmidt |first=Megan | publisher=KU News Service |date=9 November 2013 |website=University of Kansas |access-date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flirting styles vary according to culture. Different cultures have different social etiquette. For example, length of eye contact, or how closely one stands by someone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,419712,00.html |title=Scoring a German: Flirting with Fräuleins, Hunting for Herren - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |access-date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Seduction]], the process whereby one person deliberately entices another to engage in sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Greene, Robert | authorlink=Robert Greene (author) | title=The Art of Seduction | publisher=[[Penguin Books]]| year=2003 | isbn=0-14-200119-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is one that the person you are seducing would not usually do, unless sexually aroused. Seduction can be seen as both a positive and a negative. Since the word seduction has a Latin meaning, which is "to lead astray" it can be viewed negatively.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (1996) ''The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual attraction===
{{Main|Sexual attraction}}
Sexual attraction is [[Attractiveness|attraction]] on the basis of [[sexual desire]] or the quality of arousing such interest.&lt;ref name="Sexual attraction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual attraction| publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|accessdate=December 16, 2011|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sexual+attraction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexual attraction2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual attraction| publisher=[[Reference.com]]|accessdate=December 16, 2011|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+attraction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual attractiveness or sex appeal is an individual's ability to attract the sexual or [[erotic]] interest of another person, and is a factor in [[sexual selection]] or [[mate choice]].  The attraction can be to the [[physical attraction|physical]] or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context in which they appear. The attraction may be to a person's [[aesthetics]] or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors. The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume, [[long hair|hair length]] and [[hair style|style]], and anything else which can attract the sexual interest of another person. It can also be influenced by [[individual]] [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities of the person. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and also on the criteria of the person who is attracted.

Though attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness, and measure it as [[individual capital|one of several bodily forms of]] [[capital asset]] (''see [[erotic capital]]''), a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and [[sexual orientation]]. For example, a [[Homosexuality|gay or lesbian person]] would typically find a person of the [[Same-sex attraction|same sex]] to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A [[bisexuality|bisexual person]] would find either sex to be attractive. In addition, there are [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, who usually do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction (homoromantic, biromantic or heteroromantic). [[Interpersonal attraction]] includes factors such as [[propinquity|physical or psychological similarity]], [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiarity]] or possessing a preponderance of [[Koinophilia#Physical attractiveness|common or familiar features]], [[similarity (psychology)|similarity]], [[Interpersonal compatibility|complementarity]], [[reciprocal liking]], and [[reinforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R., Perlman, D., and Brehm, S.S. Intimate Relationships, 4th Edition, McGrawHill Companies.{{page needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of a person's physical and other qualities to create a sexual interest in others is the basis of their use in [[sex in advertising|advertising]], [[music video]], [[pornography]], [[Sex in film|film]], and other visual media, as well as in [[Model (person)|modeling]], [[sex work]] and other occupations.

===Legal issues===
{{one source|section|date=June 2016}}
{{Main|Human sexual activity#Legal issues|Sex and the law}}
Globally, laws regulate human sexuality in several ways, including criminalizing particular sexual behaviors, granting individuals the privacy or [[autonomy]] to make their own sexual decisions, protecting individuals with regard to equality and non-discrimination, recognizing and protecting other individual rights, as well as legislating matters regarding marriage and the family, and creating laws protecting individuals from violence, harassment, and persecution.&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Mills |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Haste |first2=Polly |last3=Wood |first3=Stephen | date = 17 June 2016 | title = 1. Issues and Debates; How is sexuality regulated in law? | work = Sexuality and Social Justice: A Toolkit | location = Brighton, UK | publisher = Institute of Development Studies, Sexuality, Poverty and Law Programme | url = http://www.spl.ids.ac.uk/sexuality-and-social-justice-toolkit/1-issues-and-debates/how-sexuality-regulated-law  | access-date =  17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there are two fundamentally different approaches, applied in different states, regarding the way the law is used to attempt to govern a person's sexuality.  The “black letter” approach to law focuses on the study of pre-existing legal precedent, and attempts to offer a clear framework of rules within which lawyers and others can work.&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1/&gt; In contrast, the socio-legal approach focuses more broadly on the relationship between the law and society, and offers a more contextualized view of the relationship between legal and social change.&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1/&gt; Both approaches are used to guide changes in the legal system of states, and both have an effect.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Issues regarding human sexuality and human sexual orientation have come to the forefront in Westerm law in the latter half of the twentieth century, as part of the [[gay liberation]] movement's encouragement of LGBT individuals to "[[come out of the closet]]" and engaging with the legal system, primarily through courts. Therefore, many issues regarding human sexuality and the law are found in the opinions of the courts.&lt;ref name=Minnesota1&gt;{{cite web|title=Researching Legal Issues of Sexual Orientation|url=https://library.law.umn.edu/researchguides/sexual-orientation.html|website=library.law.umn.edu|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=3 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705012329/https://library.law.umn.edu/researchguides/sexual-orientation.html|archivedate=5 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual privacy====
{{See also|Sexual and reproductive health and rights}}
While the issue of privacy has been useful to sexual rights claims, some scholars have criticized its usefulness, saying that this perspective is too narrow and restrictive. The law is often slow to intervene in certain forms of coercive behavior that can limit individuals' control over their own sexuality (such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[forced marriages]] or lack of access to reproductive health care). Many of these injustices are often perpetuated wholly or in part by private individuals rather than state agents, and as a result, there is an ongoing debate about the extent of state responsibility to prevent harmful practices and to investigate such practices when they do occur.&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1 /&gt;

State intervention with regards to sexuality also occurs, and is considered acceptable by some, in certain instances (e.g. same-sex sexual activity or [[prostitution]]).&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1 /&gt;

{{About|biological waste products of the human body|other kinds of waste produced by humans|waste}}

{{Refimprove|date=February 2013}}
'''Human waste''' (or '''human excreta''') refers to the waste products of the [[human digestive system]] and the human [[metabolism]], namely [[feces]] and [[urine]]. As part of a [[sanitation]] system that is in place, human waste is collected, transported, treated and disposed of or reused by one method or another, depending on the type of [[toilets|toilet]] being used, ability by the users to pay for services and other factors. 

The sanitation systems in place differ vastly across the world, with many people in [[Developing country|developing countries]] having to resort to [[open defecation]] where human waste is deposited in the environment, for lack of other options. People in [[Developed country|developed countries]] tend to use [[Flush toilet|flush toilets]] where the human waste is mixed with water and  transported to [[sewage treatment plants]]. 

Children's excreta can be disposed of in [[diaper]]s and mixed with [[municipal solid waste]]. Diapers are also sometimes dumped directly into the environment, leading to [[public health]] risks.

The term "human waste" is used in the general media to mean several things, such as [[sewage]], [[sewage sludge]], [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] - in fact anything that may contain some [[human feces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Waste May Be Flush With Gold, Silver, And Other Valuable Metals|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/25/poop-gold-human-waste-metals_n_6936262.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=8 June 2015|date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the stricter sense of the term, human waste is in fact human excreta, i.e. [[urine]] and [[human feces|feces]], with or without water being mixed in. For example, [[dry toilet|dry toilets]] collect human waste without the addition of water.

==Health aspects==
Human waste is considered a [[Biomedical waste|biowaste]], as it is a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for both [[Virus disease|viral]] and [[Pathogenic bacteria|bacterial]] diseases.  It can be a serious health hazard if it gets into sources of drinking water.  The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that nearly 2.2 million people die annually from diseases caused by contaminated water.  A major accomplishment of human civilization has been the reduction of [[Transmission_(medicine)|disease transmission]] via human waste through the practice of [[hygiene]] and [[sanitation]], which can employ a variety of different technologies.

== Environmental aspects ==
Even high-mountains are not free from human waste. Each year, millions of mountaineers visit high-mountain areas. They generate tonnes of feces and urine annually which cause environmental pollution. The authorities of mountain regions, especially in the [[Global South]] countries do not pay enough attention to the problem of excreta from mountaineers. Human feces pose a greater threat to the mountain environment than uncontrolled deposit of urine, due to the higher pathogen content of feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Apollo|first=Michal|date=2017-01-02|title=The good, the bad and the ugly – three approaches to management of human waste in a high-mountain environment|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2016.1227225|journal=International Journal of Environmental Studies|volume=74|issue=1|pages=129–158|doi=10.1080/00207233.2016.1227225|issn=0020-7233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of processing==

Methods of processing depend on the type of human waste: 
* Sewage is treated via [[sewage treatment]] 
* Sewage sludge is treated by [[sewage sludge treatment]] 
* Fecal matter from [[dry toilet|dry toilets]] may undergo [[composting]]
* Fecal sludge from pit latrines is treated and managed with an approach called [[fecal sludge management]]
The amount of water mixed with human waste can be reduced by the use of waterless [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]]s and [[composting toilet]]s and by recycling [[greywater]]. The most common method of human waste treatment in rural areas where municipal sewage systems are unavailable is the use of [[septic tank]] systems. In remote rural places without sewage or septic systems, small populations allow for the continued use of [[Bucket toilet|honey bucket]]s and sewage lagoons (see [[anaerobic lagoon]]) without the threat of disease presented by places with denser populations. [[Bucket toilet|Bucket toilets]] are used by rural villages in [[Alaska]] where, due to [[permafrost]], conventional waste treatment systems cannot be utilized.

==Uses==
{{Main|Reuse of excreta}}
Human waste in the form of wastewater (sewage) is used to irrigate and fertilize fields in many parts of the developing world where fresh water is unavailable. There is great potential for wastewater agriculture to produce more food for consumers in urban areas, as long as there is sufficient education about the dangers of eating such food uncooked.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/08/080821-human-waste.html Human Waste Used by 200 Million Farmers, Study Says]'', National Geographic News, August 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucideon (formerly Ceram)''' is an independent materials development, testing and assurance company based in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and in the US. Lucideon owns testing facilities around the world.

==History==
The British Refractories Research Association was formed in 1920. The pottery industry was required by the [[Import Duties Act 1932|Import Duties Advisory Committee]] in 1937 to create a [[research association]], so the British Pottery Research Association was formed in 1937. The two combined in April 1948 as the '''British Ceramic Research Association'''.

The main building on Queens Road in [[Penkhull]] was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh in December 1951. In May 1986 it changed its name to British Ceramic Research Ltd, having been incorporated as a company on 18 November 1985.

From the late 1990s the company traded under the abbreviated name Ceram. On 1 February 2014 the company name changed to Lucideon Limited.

==Structure==
Lucideon is situated south of the [[University Hospital of North Staffordshire]].

Lucideon incorporates:
* [https://www.lucideon.com UK Headquarters] - (formerly CERAM Research Ltd)
* [https://www.lucideon.com/assurance Assurance Services] - Lucideon CICS Limited
* [https://www.lucideon.com US Laboratories] - (formerly M+P Labs) based in [[Schenectady, New York]], [[Greenville, South Carolina]] and offices in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]

Lucideon's laboratories and techniques are accredited by the [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service]] (UKAS).

[[File:Lycoperdon-perlatum.jpg|thumb|right|Puffball species like ''[[Lycoperdon perlatum]]'' produce copious amounts of spores when they are mature.]]
'''Lycoperdonosis''' is a [[respiratory disease]] caused by the inhalation of large amounts of [[spore]]s from mature [[puffball]]s. It is classified as a [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]] (also called extrinsic allergic alveolitis)—an inflammation of the [[alveoli]] within the lung caused by [[hypersensitivity]] to inhaled natural dusts.&lt;ref name=Barrios2008/&gt; It is one of several types of hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by different agents that have similar clinical features.&lt;ref name=PerosGolubicic2006/&gt; Typical progression of the disease includes symptoms of a [[common cold|cold]] hours after spore inhalation, followed by [[nausea]], rapid pulse, crepitant [[rales]] (a sound like that made by rubbing hairs between the fingers, heard at the end of inhalation), and [[dyspnea]]. Chest [[radiograph]]s reveal the presence of [[nodule (medicine)|nodules]] in the lungs.&lt;ref name=Alenghat2010/&gt; The early symptoms presented in combination with pulmonary abnormalities apparent on chest radiographs may lead to misdiagnosis of the disease as [[tuberculosis]], [[histiocytosis]], or [[Pneumocystis pneumonia|pneumonia]] caused by ''[[Pneumocystis carinii]]''. Lycoperdonosis is generally treated with [[corticosteroid]]s, which decrease the [[inflammatory response]]; these are sometimes given in conjunction with [[antimicrobial]]s.&lt;ref name=Munson1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=MMWR1994/&gt;

The disease was first described in the medical literature in 1967 by R.D.&amp;nbsp;Strand and colleagues in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''.&lt;ref name=Strand1967/&gt; In 1976, a 4-year-old was reported developing the disease in Norway after purposely inhaling a large quantity of ''[[Lycoperdon]]'' spores to stop a nosebleed. ''Lycoperdon'' species are sometimes used in [[folk medicine]] in the belief that their spores have [[haemostatic]] properties.&lt;ref name=Henriksen1976/&gt; A 1997 case report discussed several instances of teenagers inhaling the spores. In one severe case, the individual inhaled enough spores so as to be able to blow them out of his mouth. He underwent [[bronchoscopy]] and then had to be on [[life support]] before recovering in about four weeks. In another instance, a teenager spent 18 days in a coma, had portions of his lung removed, and suffered severe [[liver damage]].&lt;ref name=Munson1997/&gt; In [[Wisconsin]], eight teenagers who inhaled spores at a party presented clinical symptoms such as cough, [[fever]], [[shortness of breath]], [[myalgia]], and fatigue within a week. Five of the eight required hospitalization; of these, two required [[intubation]] to assist in breathing.&lt;ref name=MMWR1994/&gt; The disease is rare, possibly because of the large quantity of spores that need to be inhaled for clinical effects to occur.&lt;ref name=Munson1997/&gt; Lycoperdonosis also occurs in dogs; in the few reported cases, the animals had been playing or digging in areas known to contain puffballs.&lt;ref name=Alenghat2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubensohn2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckeridge2011/&gt; Known species of puffballs implicated in the [[etiology]] of the published cases include the widespread ''[[Lycoperdon perlatum]]'' (the "devil's snuff-box", ''L.&amp;nbsp;gemmatum'') and ''[[Calvatia gigantea]]'', both of the [[Lycoperdaceae]] family.&lt;ref name=Strand1967/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubensohn2009/&gt;

The '''mean time between coincidences''' ('''MTBC''') is used in [[safety engineering]] and is defined as the reciprocal of the average frequency of dangerous [[coincidence]]s:

&lt;math&gt;MTBC=\frac{1}{\lambda\ _{d}} = \frac{2}{\lambda\ \mu\ \tau\ }&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22277">'''Modular art''' is art created by joining together standardized units ([[Modular design|module]]s) to form larger, more complex compositions. In some works the units can be subsequently moved, removed and added to – that is, ''modulated'' – to create a new work of art, different from the original or ensuing configurations.

== Origins ==
Historically, alterable objects of art have existed since the [[Renaissance]], for example, in the [[Triptych]] "[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]" by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] or in the so-called "alterable [[altarpiece]]s", such as the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] by [[Matthias Grünewald]], or [[Albrecht Dürer|Albrecht Dürer's]] [[Paumgartner altarpiece]], where changing motifs could be revised in accord with the changing themes of the ecclesiastical calendar.

== 20th century ==
Beginning in the first half of the 20th century, a number of contemporary artists sought to incorporate [[kinetic art|kinetic techniques]] into their work in an attempt to overcome what they saw as the predominantly static nature of art. [[Alexander Calder|Alexander Calder's]] mobiles are among the most widely known demonstrations of physical dynamism in the visual arts, in which form has the potential to continually vary through perpetual motion, sometimes even without the agency of the human hand. [[Jean Tinguely|Jean Tinguely's]] efforts to create a self-destructive art machine constitute perhaps the ultimate expression of art's mutability, in this case by taking the form of its total eradication. [[Victor Vasarely]] postulated in his ''Manifest Jaune'' in 1955 in Paris that works of art should feature the properties of being multiplicable and repeatable in series. More recently, the notion that visual art need not be conceived solely in terms of perpetually fixed objects is embodied in performance and installation art by virtue of their unfolding and temporary qualities.&lt;ref&gt;See "Modularity in the arts" in [[Modularity]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Industrial design and architecture ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Image:Pfarrkirche Liesing - Erwin Hauer Design 3.JPG|thumb|alt=An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.|An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.]][[Modularity]] enters the modern artistic repertory largely through the disciplines of industrial design and architecture. Belgian architect [[Louis Herman De Koninck]] led a team of countrymen in creating one of the first modular product systems in their Cubex kitchen series of 1932. The series consisted of standardized and industrially produced components that could be combined and arrayed in limitless combinations to accommodate almost any size kitchen. New York designer [[Gilbert Rohde]] crafted several lines of modular casework for the [[Herman Miller (office equipment)|Herman Miller Corporation]] in the 1930s and 40s; like De Koninck, Rohde standardized the units in dimensions, materials and configurations to facilitate mass production and interchangeability. His Executive Office Group (EOG) line, launched in 1942, was a similarly ground-breaking systems approach to office furniture. Just a year before [[Eero Saarinen]] and [[Charles Eames]] had jointly produced a suite of modular domestic furniture for the Red Lion Company, a result of a competition held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1950 Herman Miller brought out the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100526040623/http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Eames-Desk-and-Storage-Units EAS Storage Unit series] by Charles and Ray Eames, a very successful modular shelving and wall unit system that remains in production today.

The module enjoys a long history in the realm of architecture. In antiquity architects utilized the module primarily as a unit of measurement guiding the proportions of plan and elevation. The Roman author and architect Vitruvius deployed the modular method in his descriptions of the classical orders and the composition of buildings in his treatise ''Ten Books on Architecture'', the only complete text on architecture to survive from antiquity. Architects of the Renaissance perpetuated the Vitruvian system in their resurrection of the classical orders, a tradition which continues to the present day. Among modern architects, the module is frequently employed as a design and planning tool.

=== Modular constructivism ===
{{main|Modular Constructivism}}
Architecture and modular sculpture intersected starting in the 1950s in the work of [[Norman Carlberg]], [[Erwin Hauer]] and Malcolm Leland. All three received commissions to design perforated architectural screens built out of repetitive modular motives cast in concrete. Non-structural, the screens were used on building exteriors to divide space, filter light and create visual interest. Their work has come to be described as [[Modular Constructivism]], reflecting both its compositional methodology and its architectural context. Each created stand-alone modular-themed sculptures into the 1960s and after as well.

=== Modularity in the fine arts===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s [https://www.flickr.com/photos/ondahalfoster/2546134482/ "White Painting"] of 1951; consisting of just four equal white squares, with its geometry of interlocking forms, is among the earliest statements of modularity as an autonomous subject of art. Rauschenberg explored this theme that same year in a three- and seven-panel format; the linear array of rectangular panels in these versions suggests their potentially infinite replication.  The cool abstraction of these canvases presages the emergence of modularity as a full-fledged topic of [[Minimalist art]] in the 1960s. [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Flavin]] and [[Donald Judd]] are among this school's most prolific exponents during the period. In particular, the work of Smith is key to understanding the transformation of modularity from a compositional and production tool into a broadly investigated artistic theme in its own right.

[[Image:Minneapolis14.jpg|thumb|alt=Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, Minnesota.|Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, MN.]]Smith began his career as an architectural designer. To further his education he apprenticed himself on some projects by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] for a couple of years starting in 1938. From Wright he learned to utilize modular systems in generating architectural designs in two-dimensional plans as well as in three-dimensional applications, such as the development of building sections and interior built-ins. As an architect, Wright himself was part of a centuries-old continuum stretching back through [[Vitruvius]] to Greco-Roman antiquity in which the module was utilized to proportion built and sculpted form. In the case of Wright, the interest in modular design also may have derived from his familiarity with [[tatami|modular practice in traditional Japanese architecture]].

Wright's Hanna House of 1937 is a clear example of the master's facility with modern modular design in multiple dimensions. Its striking angled forms are built up from the individual hexagonal modules that define the floor plan and various vertical elements. Wright's use of the hexagon here is by no means an arbitrary aesthetic choice, but an example of how he rooted his architecture in nature by drawing from its forms and principles – the interlocking hexagonal cells of the bee's honeycomb being nature's most perfect representation of modular design. Not surprisingly, this project is sometimes  referred to as the "Honeycomb House".

Smith would employ the hexagon and other elemental geometries in his own architectural practice and again in the sculpture he began to fabricate in the early 1960s. Freed from the programmatic and extensive structural requirements of his architectural work, Smith's sculptures are three-dimensional extrusions of modular form with no ostensible pragmatic purpose beyond aesthetic contemplation.

Significantly, Smith himself did not manually fabricate the final version of his sculptures. Instead, he outsourced their production to skilled ironworkers in foundries and industrial facilities, who worked off his drawings and models to manufacture the designs. In part this reflects Smith's training as an architect, who customarily designs and documents but does not construct his art. It further reinforces the idea of modular art as a [[generative art|generative system]] in which the arrangement of pre-determined formal units – rather than wholesale imaginative invention – defines the creative act. Finally, it is consistent with the notion implicit in modularity that the supply of modules in a modular system must be infinite, that is, that they be industrially rather than artisanally produced, for the system to be realized. (Bees in a honeycomb are essentially operating as an industrial enterprise insofar as the production of cells is without end.)

The work of Smith and the minimalist school constitute the most far-ranging exploration of modularity in art before the millennium. However, neither it nor the explorations of movable and alterable art in the preceding centuries synthesized the two central features of modular art. Mobiles and other kinetic pieces were not modular, and the modular work of the mid-century Minimalist artists was, with a few exceptions, not changeable.

=== Co-creativity ===
A school of thought coming out of the United States emphasizes modular art's alignment with the [[post-industrial]] character of 21st century culture and its contrast with traditional notions of art.&lt;ref&gt;[Rattner, Donald]. "A Comparison of Conventional and Modular Art" in ''[http://issuu.com/art-rethought/docs/art_catalogue?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed A.R.T. Catalogue v2.0]''. New York: lulu.com, 2010. Pp. C-1ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Core characteristics of post-industrialism, as largely defined by the theorist [[Daniel Bell]] in his 1973 book ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'', include the emergence of a service economy in place of a manufacturing one; the social and economic pre-eminence of the creative, professional and technical classes; the central place of theoretical knowledge as a font of innovation; the strong influence of technology on daily life; and high levels of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Daniel. ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society''. New York: Harper Colophon Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modular art appears to synchronize perfectly with several of these criteria. For example, its manual changeability opens up the possibility of co-creative art, in which the collector or user collaborates with the originating modular artist to jointly determine the appearance of the work of art. This presupposes the existence of creative people capable of and interested in serving such a role – a demographic evolution that was already underway in Bell's time and that has since been studied in works like Richard Florida's ''Rise of the Creative Class'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Florida, Richard. ''The Rise of the Creative Class and How It's Transforming Work, Leisure and Everyday Life''. Basic Books, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Co-creation]] is closely associated with [[mass customization]], a production model that combines the opportunity for individual personalization with mass production. Modular art and mass customization share a commonality in their synthesis of two opposing qualities. On the one hand, as previously stated the very concept of modularity implies a limitless supply of identical modules such as only industrial production can provide; on the other hand, the ability of the individual to re-arrange these modules in the work of art based on aesthetic criteria re-injects a subjective and purely human dimension into the creative act.

Mass customization is itself only made possible with the advent of computers and a type of software known as a [[configurator]]. A configurator is a software tool used by the buyer to configure a product from the options made available by the vendor. Applied to the purpose of composing a work of modular art onscreen, it can greatly facilitate the design of a modular assembly by allowing the user to study multiple design options more quickly and in far greater depth than by using analog methods. Once the design is established a computer file is then sent over the air to a manufacturing facility where robotically controlled equipment produces the object according to its specifications. Not only does this computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) allow for the customization of mass-produced objects, it also enables a much higher level of precision and fit – qualities critical for modules to be physically joined together. Bell's identification of technology as a central axis of post-industrial life is underscored in the intertwining of the digital with the physical realization of modular art.

=== The de- and re-constructive approach in Europe ===
In Europe, where the 1960s Minimalist school of modular art was often seen as a principally American phenomenon, the discussion of modularity often focuses on its changeability. For example, the mutability of art is a core principle of [[Arte Povera]], a contemporaneous movement that emerged in Italy which holds that works of art "should not be seen as fixed entities", but as objects of change and movement to "include time and space in a new manner. At stake is the issue of transferring the phenomenology of human experience" into the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monopol-magazin.com/magazine/2009/09/interview-carolyn-christov-bakargiev Interview with Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev.] See also: Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn. ''Arte Povera (Themes &amp; Movements)''. New York: Phaidon Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the artist [[Leda Luss Luyken]] has produced modular paintings, composed of movable painted panels set in steel frames. Luss Luyken has dubbed her work "ModulArt".&lt;ref&gt;The term "ModulArt" was first mentioned in 1975 in a German arts encyclopedia as "a form of art […] made by movable elements that […] transfer the object into a new state of being by moving their variable parts" in: Ludewig, Werner (Ed.). ''Kunst – Literatur – Musik, Daten und Fakten''. Lexikon-Institut Bertelsmann, 1975, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, changing the configuration of a modular painting constitutes a form of motion, offering the spectator alternative views and alternative interpretations, and thus aligning the work more closely than a static object to the dynamism of physical human experience.&lt;ref&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/ModulArt&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian and theorist [[Denys Zacharopoulos]] called this "a new way of motion in painting".&lt;ref&gt;von Kap-herr, Georg (Ed.). ''ModulArt''. Bobingen (Germany), 2008, pp. 6-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of modular art allows the user to de-compose and to re-compose a work of art that is already completed by re-arranging its parts, thus providing numerous possibilities for ever newer pictures not yet imagined. The original painting can be re-contextualized ad libitum and ad infinitum.

== Modular artists and their work ==

===Visual artists===
Working in the 1950-60s in Manchester (UK), American artist [[Mitzi Cunliffe]] developed sculptures consisting of multiple blocks about twelve inches square which she put together in a variety of combinations to give a sculptured effect on a large scale. She referred to them as ''modular sculptures''. The University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) acquired some of these works, although there are no references to them in published accounts of her work.&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated 19 December 08 by Prof. E.G. Wedell, Manchester (UK), friend and landlord of Mitzi Cunliffe in Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptor and ceramicist Malcolm Leland designed in 1954 a similar [http://www.mocad.org/store/Vessel_LS_Fountain.html modular sculpture system] based on a single 23-inch tall module that could be stacked vertically by means of a centering pin; the module has a generally biomorphic, curvilinear outline that yields an undulating silhouette when multiple modules are placed on top of each other. The technique of stacking repetitive elements in the round recalls [[Endless Column|Brancusi's "Endless Column"]] of 1938.

Starting in the 1970s, Leland's contemporary Norman Carlberg produced groups of [http://www.francisfrost.com/carlbergprint.html square framed prints] which he placed together on a wall in a tight grid, each print conceived as an independent module. The viewer is then invited to rotate or reposition them to generate new composite images. The abstract quality of the prints enhanced the creative possibilities of their re-orientation insofar as they are non-directional and geometrically inter-related.

Greek-born [[conceptual artist]] [[Leda Luss Luyken]], who was initially trained as an architect, has been exploring [[modularity]] in the medium of painting since the 1990s. In her work standardized canvas panels are mounted as modules onto a steel frame within which they can be moved and rotated.

In the U.S. Moshé Elimelech creates what he has called [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107101439/http://www.mosheart.com/cubes/index.html "Cubic Constructions"]. These are multiple groupings of approximately three-inch cubes set inside pockets in a framed shadow box. On each cube he applies paint in fields of bright color and abstract pattern with precise, controlled brush strokes. Like Carlsberg, Elimelech then invites the viewer to reposition any or all of the cubes to display one of their six sides, each of which is painted in a different pattern. Exhibiting since the 1980s, Elimelech shows primarily in California galleries, and has work represented in several museum design stores as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807164738/http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |archive-date=2003-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another portfolio of interactive modular art comes out of [http://www.s4aa.com Studio for A.R.T. and Architecture], a New York-based firm headed by Donald Rattner. Rattner has designed modular art in the media of wall sculpture, rotational paintings, tapestries, artist's wallpapers and artist's books. To bring his work and those of other "modulartists" to the marketplace, Rattner founded [http://www.art-rethought.com A.R.T. (art-rethought)], an art storefront focused on co-creative and modular work. In his writings Rattner has emphasized the post-industrial aspect of the most recent trends in modular art, coining the term "New Industrialism" to denote mass customization, production on demand, open innovation, co-creative design, tele-fabrication, robotics and other computer-driven technologies that are re-defining how things are made in the global marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/the_studio_portfolio/docs/studio_portfolio_-_art?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true. Pp. A-3f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composers===
Modularity in music can be seen as bringing two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting:{{Clarify|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--Painting? What has this to do with music?--&gt; [[Variation (music)|variation]] of a theme and [[Moving image|movement]] of and within a picture. For this very reason the contemporary composer Minas Borboudakis has dedicated the third part of his trilogy ROAI III for piano and electronics to the modular methodology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Italian composer and arts theoretician [[Stefano Vagnini]] has developed a theory of [[Open source|open-source composition]] based on modular aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;Vagnini, Stafano, ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, 161 pp, Rome: Falcon Valley Music, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a musical work of art being something closed, limited and immobile disappears in favor of a process of numerous aggregations that allow a composition to become infinite in principle. Several such compositions were performed in Europe, South America, Asia and in North America and discussed through conferences in Europe. The approach is being academically discussed at the [[University of West Georgia]] and the Carrollton Cultural Arts Centre in the USA. Writer, painter, and art theorist Gian Ruggero Manzoni described the modularity of Vagnini's compositions  as “circular like the existence, his works are not finished, but merely stimulus for new voices”. &lt;ref&gt;Gian Ruggero Manzoni, in: Vagnini, Stefano:'' SalmodieSubliminali'', Campanotto Editions, Udine, 2007, pp 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11579">{{for|the record label|Nature Sounds}}
'''Natural sounds''' are sounds produced by natural sources in their normal [[soundscape]]. It is a category whose definition is open for discussion, see the section below. The category includes the sounds of any living organism, from insect larvae to the largest living mammal on the planet, whales, and those generated by natural, non-biological sources.  In most respects, the natural habitats from which these acoustic sources emanate, are defined as not heavily impacted by human intervention. With all these sounds, it creates an [[acoustic space]]

The historical background of natural sounds as they have come to be defined, begins with the recording of a single bird, by Ludwig Koch, as early as 1889. Koch's efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries set the stage for the universal audio capture model of single-species—primarily birds at the outset—that subsumed all others during the first half of the 20th century and well into the latter half and into the early 21st, as well. In late 1968, influenced by acoustic efforts in the fields of music and film, this model began to evolve into a much more holistic effort with attention paid to the acoustic experience of entire habitats, inclusive of all the wild animal voices. Expressed as wild soundscapes, these phenomena included sounds primarily from two main sources, non-human and non-domestic wild ones, and non-biological sources in relatively undisturbed habitats. In the early years of the 21st century, the definition of the soundscape was broken down into three components: the [[geophony]], non-biological natural sounds that include the effects of water by a stream or waves at the ocean, the effects of wind in the trees or grasses, and sound generated by the earth, itself, for example, glaciers, avalanches and earthquakes; the [[biophony]], all the non-human, non-domestic sounds that emanate from a relatively undisturbed habitat; and [[anthrophony]], all sound generated by human endeavor, whether music, theatre, or electromechanical.

== Definition ==
Humans are a product of nature this could be considered part of nature. Except that humans have long-considered themselves to be separate and in conflict. For that reason, a special category of the soundscape has been set aside for human, alone. Called anthrophony, it includes all of the sound that humans produces, whether structured (i. e. music, theatre, film, etc.), or entropic, as in the electromechanical chaotic and uncontrolled signals we generate by whatever means. Anthrophony has a profound effect on the natural soundscape and the featured organisms who play seminal roles in those habitats. But the nature of that effect varies with the types and families of sound and their relative intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Krause 1998, 2002, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Anatomy of the Soundscape," Bernie Krause, Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, Number 56, 1/2 2008, January/February.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernie Krause, "Wild Soundscapes: Discovering the Voice of the Natural World," Wilderness Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0899972961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernie Krause, "The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places," Little Brown, New York, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-316-08687-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural sounds are restricted to natural sources in their normal [[soundscape]] because clips of isolated natural sources are like [[sound bites]]: without context the sounds are prone to be misinterpreted.

== Humans ==
Humans can benefit from [[natural environment]]s to restore from stress and directed attention fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan 1995&lt;/ref&gt; A human can endure high levels of stress for short time periods as long as these periods are interrupted by restoration moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ai.rug.nl/~tjeerd/publications/Botteldooren_2011.pdf |title=Botteldooren et al. 2011 |access-date=2012-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224646/http://www.ai.rug.nl/~tjeerd/publications/Botteldooren_2011.pdf |archive-date=2013-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a natural environment provides more sensory input than the soundscape there are indications that the soundscape alone also affords restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarsson et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of humans indicate that they find natural sounds pleasurable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ai.rug.nl/~tjeerd/publications/Andringa_2011S1.pdf |title=Andringa |access-date=2012-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232942/http://www.ai.rug.nl/~tjeerd/publications/Andringa_2011S1.pdf |archive-date=2013-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animals ==

===Territory sounds===

These are sounds, calls, or audible signals made by any one species to its own or any other species, establishing boundaries so like or unlike species will not transgress those boundaries.

Male baboons make sounds heard for miles by other baboons, communicating to those other male baboons, the [[territory (animal)|territory]] of that male [[baboon]]. The strength, volume, and [[timbre]], inherent in that "call", determine whether or not rival males attempt to invade that male baboon's territory.

They do this to make them sound impressive and then to attract the female to them.

===Courtship and/or mate attracting sounds===

These are sounds made by the male baboon to attract females to his territory for courtship and mating. Again, the strength, quality, and timbre of those sounds, often determine the ability of that species to attract females for reproduction.  These mating calls, often low and guttural, are the main criteria, used by the female baboon to determine which male she mates with.

The '''New Chronology''' is a [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical theory]] which argues that the conventional [[chronology]] of Middle Eastern and European history is fundamentally flawed, and that events attributed to the civilizations of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Egypt]] actually occurred during the [[Middle Ages]], more than a thousand years later. The central concepts of the New Chronology are derived from the ideas of Russian scholar [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Nikolai Morozov]] (1854–1946),&lt;ref name="billington83"&gt;{{cite book |last=Billington |first=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2004 |pages=83 |quote=The radical revisionism of Nosovsky and Fomenko's ''New Chronology of Rus'' has its origins in the attempt by Nicholai Morozov to synthesize science and history during twenty-five years in prison}}&lt;/ref&gt; although work by French scholar [[Jean Hardouin]] (1646–1729) can be viewed as an earlier predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colavito|2004}} "Today an intellectual successor to Hardouin claims that it is not classical antiquity that was forged, but instead the history of the Middle Ages. Russian mathematician Anatoly Fomenko has devised a system he calls the 'New Chronology'..."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the New Chronology is most commonly associated with Russian mathematician [[Anatoly Fomenko]] (born 1945), although published works on the subject are actually a collaboration between Fomenko and several other mathematicians. The concept is most fully explained in ''History: Fiction or Science?'', originally published in [[Russian language|Russian]].

The New Chronology also contains ''a reconstruction'', an alternative chronology, radically shorter than the standard historical timeline, because all ancient history is "folded" onto the Middle Ages. According to Fomenko's claims, the [[recorded history|written history]] of humankind goes only as far back as [[Anno Domini|AD]] 800, there is almost no information about events between AD 800–1000, and most known historical events took place in AD 1000–1500.

The New Chronology is rejected by mainstream [[historian]]s and is inconsistent with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating]] techniques used in the wider [[academia|scholarly community]]. The majority of scientific commentators consider The New Chronology to be [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="prezRAS1999"&gt;[http://rc.nsu.ru/text/news/Physics/057.html Проблемы борьбы с лженаукой (обсуждение в Президиуме РАН)] — {{Interlanguage link multi|Вестник Российской академии наук|ru}} 1999, том&amp;nbsp;69, №&amp;nbsp;10, с.&amp;nbsp;879—904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prezRAS2003"&gt;[http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/JOURNAL/VRAN/2004/FALSCI.HTM Чем угрожает обществу лженаука?

==History of New Chronology==
The idea of chronologies that differ from the conventional chronology can be traced back to at least the early 17th century. [[Jean Hardouin]] then suggested that many ancient historical documents were much younger than commonly believed to be. In 1685 he published a version of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' in which he claimed that most Greek and Roman texts had been forged by [[Benedictine]] monks. When later questioned on these results, Hardouin stated that he would reveal the monks' reasons in a letter to be revealed only after his death. The executors of his estate were unable to find such a document among his posthumous papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diacu | first = Florin

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]], examining the current chronology of [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Ancient Near East]], expressed discontent with prevailing theories and in ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'' proposed one of his own, which, basing its study on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]'s ''[[Argonautica]]'', changed the traditional dating of the Argonautic Expedition, the [[Trojan War]], and the [[Founding of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1887, [[Edwin Johnson (historian)|Edwin Johnson]] expressed the opinion that [[early Christianity|early Christian history]] was largely invented or corrupted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | last = Johnson | first = Edwin | authorlink = Edwin Johnson (historian) | title = Antiqua Mater | chapter = Preface | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911155951/http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | archivedate = 2006-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 [[Otto Rank]] made note of duplications in literary history of a variety of cultures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;almost all important civilized peoples have early woven myths around and glorified in poetry their heroes, mythical kings and princes, founders of religions, of dynasties, empires and cities—in short, their national heroes. Especially the history of their birth and of their early years is furnished with phantastic traits; the amazing similarity, nay literal identity, of those tales, even if they refer to different, completely independent peoples, sometimes geographically far removed from one another, is well known and has struck many an investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rank | first = Otto | authorlink = Otto Rank
 | title = Der Mythos von der Geburt des Helden | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fomenko became interested in Morozov's theories in 1973. In 1980, together with a few colleagues from the mathematics department of [[Moscow State University]], he published several articles on "new mathematical methods in history" in peer-reviewed journals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The articles stirred a lot of controversy, but ultimately Fomenko failed to win any respected historians to his side. By the early 1990s, Fomenko shifted his focus from trying to convince the scientific community via peer-reviewed publications to publishing books. Beam writes that Fomenko and his colleagues were discovered by the Soviet scientific press in the early 1980s, leading to "a brief period of renown"; a contemporary review from the Soviet journal ''Questions of History'' complained, "Their constructions have nothing in common with Marxist historical science."&lt;ref name="beam"&gt;{{cite news|title=A shorter history of civilization|last=Beam|first=Alex|date=1991-09-16|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1996 his theory had grown to cover Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Nosovsky G. V., Fomenko A. T., "Empire. Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, Egypt. New mathematical chronology of ancient times / Носовский Г. В., Фоменко А. Т. Империя. Русь, Турция, Китай, Европа, Египет. Новая математическая хронология древности." (in Russian), 1996, with at least 6 later editions — М.: Факториал, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fomenko's claims==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}
Central to Fomenko's New Chronology is his claim of the existence of a vast Slav-Turk empire, which he called the "Russian Horde", which he says played the dominant role in Eurasian history before the 17th century. The various peoples identified in ancient and medieval history, from the [[Scythians]], [[Huns]], [[Goths]] and [[Bulgars]], through the [[Polans (eastern)|Polyane]], [[Dulebes|Duleby]], [[Drevlyans|Drevliane]], [[Pechenegs]], to in more recent times, the [[Cossacks]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Belarusians]], are nothing but elements of the single Russian Horde. For the New Chronologists, peoples such as the Ukrainians, Belarusians, [[Mongols#Russia|Mongols]], and others who assert their national independence from Russia, are suffering from a historical delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) pp. 5, 8, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko claims that the most probable prototype of the historical Jesus was [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] (allegedly AD 1152 to 1185), the emperor of Byzantium, known for his failed reforms; his traits and deeds reflected in 'biographies' of many real and imaginary persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.
 | script-title=ru:Царь Славян | language = Russian
 | publisher = СПб.: Нева | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical [[Jesus]] is a composite figure and reflection of the Old-Testament prophet [[Elisha]] (850–800 BC?), [[Pope Gregory VII]] (1020?–1085), Saint [[Basil of Caesarea]] (330–379), and even [[Li Yuanhao]] (also known as Emperor Jingzong or "Son of Heaven" - emperor of [[Western Xia]], who reigned in 1032–48), Euclides, Bacchus and Dionysius. Fomenko explains the seemingly vast differences in the biographies of these figures as resulting from difference in languages, points of view and time-frame of the authors of said accounts and biographies. He claims that the historical Jesus may have been born in 1152 and was crucified around AD 1185 on the [[Joshua's Hill]], overlooking the [[Bosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = А.Т.Фоменко | author2 = Г.В.Носовский | title = Датировка Рождества Христова серединой XII века | language = Russian | url = http://chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | format = download | accessdate = 2008-04-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413014454/http://www.chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | archivedate = 2008-04-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also merges the cities and histories of Jerusalem, Rome and Troy into "New Rome" = Gospel [[Jerusalem]] (in the 12th and 13th centuries) = [[Troy]] = [[Yoros Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.

 | publisher = М.: Астрель, АСТ | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the south of [[Yoros Castle]] is [[Joshua's Hill]] which Fomenko alleges is the hill [[Calvary]] depicted in the Bible.

Fomenko claims the [[Hagia Sophia]] is actually the biblical [[Temple of Solomon]]. He identifies Solomon as sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1494–1566).

On the other hand, according to Fomenko the word "Rome" is a placeholder and can signify any one of several different cities and kingdoms. He claims the "First Rome" or "Ancient Rome" or "Mizraim" is an ancient Egyptian kingdom in the delta of the [[Nile]] with its capital in [[Alexandria]]. The second and most famous "New Rome" is Constantinople. The third "Rome" is constituted by three different cities: Constantinople (again), Rome in Italy, and Moscow. According to his claims, Rome in Italy was founded around AD 1380 by [[Aeneas]] and Moscow as the third Rome was the capital of the great "Russian Horde".&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7 .&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Specific claims===
{{cleanup list|date=May 2015}}
In volumes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of ''History: Fiction or Science?'', Fomenko and his colleagues make numerous claims:
* Historians and translators often "assign" different dates and locations to different accounts of the same historical events, creating multiple "phantom copies" of these events. These "phantom copies" are often misdated by centuries or even millennia and end up incorporated into conventional chronology.
* This chronology was largely manufactured by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] in ''Opus Novum de emendatione temporum'' (1583) and ''Thesaurum temporum'' (1606), and represents a vast array of dates produced without any justification whatsoever, containing the repeating sequences of dates with shifts equal to multiples of the major cabbalistic numbers 333 and 360. The [[Jesuit]] [[Denis Pétau|Dionysius Petavius]] completed this chronology in ''De Doctrina Temporum'', 1627 (v.1) and 1632 (v.2).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One might wonder why we should want to revise the chronology of ancient history today and base our revision on new empirical-statistical methods. It would be worthwhile to remind the reader that in the XVI-XVII century chronology was considered to be a subdivision of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chronology | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* 37 complete Egyptian [[horoscope]]s found in Denderah, Esna, and other temples have unique valid astronomical solutions with dates ranging from AD 1000 and up to as late as AD 1700. &lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Egyptian astronomical symbols once applied to horoscopes from temples allows for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is sufficient for unique dating. There are symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation and the symbols do not change from one temple horoscope to another. The horoscopes from temples contain data about eclipses visible in Egypt allowing their exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = Astronomy Vs History | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The [[Book of Revelation]], as we know it, contains a horoscope, dated to 25 September - 10 October 1486, compiled by cabbalist [[Johannes Reuchlin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As we have already noted, the inability of the latter day commentators to comprehend the astronomical symbolism of the Apocalypse is directly resulting from the loss of knowledge about the correct chronology and the distortions introduced by historians of the XVI-XVIII century. Another possibility is that there was an unspoken general taboo on what concerned a subject quite as dangerous, which resulted in the misdating of the Apocalypse. One way or another, the understanding of the astronomical descriptions that the Apocalypse contains got lost at some point. The Apocalypse had lost its distinctive astronomical hue in the eyes of the readers. However, its “astronomical component” is not simply exceptionally important – it alone suffices for the dating of the book itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Apocalypse as seen by Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The horoscopes found in Sumerian/Babylonian tablets do not contain sufficient astronomical data; consequently, they have solutions every 30–50 years on the time axis and are therefore useless for purposes of dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Babylonian astronomical symbols once applied to clay tablets don't allow for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is not sufficient for unique dating. Either there not enough symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation or  the symbols change from one clay tablet to another. The clay tablets contain data about eclipses visible in Babylon  that could have taken place  every 30-40 years, therefore don’t allow there exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The Chinese tables of eclipses are useless for dating, as they contain too many eclipses that did not take place astronomically. Chinese tables of comets, even if true, cannot be used for dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chinese eclipse observations can neither confirm nor refute any chronology of China at all, be it veracious or erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chinese Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fomenko's methods==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}

===Statistical correlation of texts===
One of Fomenko's simplest methods is statistical [[correlation]] of texts. His basic assumption is that a text which describes a sequence of events will devote more space to more important events (for example, a period of [[war]] or an [[unrest]] will have much more space devoted to than a period of [[peace]]ful, non-eventful years), and that this irregularity will remain visible in other descriptions of the period. For each analysed text, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is devised which maps each year mentioned in the text with the number of pages (lines, letters) devoted in the text to its description (which could be zero). The function of the two texts are then compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 1

 | chapter = 1. The local maxima method | pages = 187–194
 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Fomenko compares the contemporary history of Rome written by [[Titus Livius]] with a modern history of Rome written by [[Russia]]n [[historian]] [[Vladimir Sergeevich Sergeev|V. S. Sergeev]], calculating that the two have high [[correlation]], and thus that they describe the same period of history, which is undisputed.&lt;ref name=F2&gt;{{cite book

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also compares modern texts which describe different periods, and calculates low correlation, as expected.&lt;ref name=F2/&gt; However, when he compares, for example, the ancient history of Rome and the medieval history of Rome, he calculates a high correlation, and concludes that ancient history of Rome is a copy of medieval history of Rome, thus clashing with mainstream accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical correlation of dynasties===
[[Image:Fomenko - Roman Empire parallelism.jpg|thumb|Sample Fomenko parallelism]]
In a somewhat similar manner, Fomenko compares two [[dynasty|dynasties]] of rulers using statistical methods. First, he creates a [[database]] of rulers, containing relevant information on each of them. Then, he creates "survey codes" for each pair of the rulers, which contain a number which describes degree of the match of each considered property of two rulers. For example, one of the properties is the way of death: if two rulers were both poisoned, they get value of +1 in their property of the way of death; if one ruler was poisoned and another killed in combat, they get -1; and if one was poisoned, and another died of illness, they get 0 (Fomenko claims there is possibility that chroniclers were not impartial and that different descriptions nonetheless describe the same person). An important property is the length of the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. |authorlink= Anatoly Fomenko

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko lists a number of pairs of unrelated dynasties &amp;ndash; for example, dynasties of kings of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and emperors of late [[Western Roman Empire]] (AD 300-476) &amp;ndash; and claims that this method demonstrates correlations between their reigns. (Graphs which show just the length of the rule in the two dynasties are the most widely known; however, Fomenko's conclusions are also based on other parameters, as described above.) He also claims that the regnal history from the 17th to 20th centuries never shows correlation of "dynastic flows" with each other, therefore Fomenko insists history was multiplied and outstretched into imaginary antiquity to justify this or other "royal" pretensions.

Fomenko uses for the demonstration of correlation between the reigns exclusively the data from the ''Chronological Tables'' of J. Blair (Moscow 1808–09). Fomenko says that Blair’s tables are all the more valuable to us since they were compiled in an epoch adjacent to the time of Scaligerian chronology. According to Fomenko these tables contain clearer signs of “Scaligerite activity” which were subsequently buried under layers of paint and plaster by historians of the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Astronomical evidence===
Fomenko examines astronomical events described in ancient texts and claims that the chronology is actually [[medieval]]. For example:

* He says the mysterious drop in the value of the lunar acceleration parameter D" ("a linear combination of the [angular] accelerations of the Earth and Moon"&lt;ref name="Newton72"&gt;[[Robert Russell Newton|R.R. Newton]], [http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/atext/newton1.htm "Astronomical Evidence Concerning Non-Gravitational Forces in the Earth–Moon System"]. ''[[Astrophysics and Space Science]]'' vol. 16 (1972), pp. 179–200.&lt;/ref&gt;) between the years AD 700–1300, which the American astronomer [[Robert Russell Newton|Robert Newton]] had explained in terms of "non-gravitational" (i.e., tidal) forces.&lt;ref name="Newton72"/&gt; By eliminating those anomalous early eclipses the New Chronology produces a constant value of D" beginning around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Anatoly T. Fomenko, ''History: Fiction or Science'' vol.I, Chronology, 2nd. ed. (Paris, London, New York: Delamere Publishing, 2006), pp.93-94, 105-6. Newton's analysis has since been criticized as suffering "from two fundamental defects. The two parameters he sought to determine were highly correlated; and he also adopted a somewhat arbitrary weighting scheme in analysing suspected observations of total solar eclipses. Many of the observations he investigated were of doubtful reliability. Hence, despite the low weight he assigned them, they had a disproportionate effect on his solutions." F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.23-2.24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* He associates initially the [[Star of Bethlehem]] with the AD 1140 (±20) [[supernova]] (now [[Crab Nebula]]) and the [[Chronology of Jesus|Crucifixion Eclipse]] with the total [[solar eclipse]] of AD 1170 (±20). He also believes that [[Crab Nebula]] [[supernova]] could not have been seen in AD 1054, but probably in AD 1153. He connects it with total eclipse of AD 1186. Moreover he holds in strong doubt the veracity of ancient Chinese astronomical data.
* He argues that the [[star catalog]] in the ''Almagest'', ascribed to the Hellenistic astronomer [[Claudius Ptolemy]], was compiled in the 15th to 16th centuries AD. With this objective in sight he develops new methods of dating old stellar catalogues and claims that the ''Almagest'' is based on data collected between AD 600 and 1300, whereby the telluric obliquity{{clarify|date=June 2013}} is well taken into account.
* He refines and completes [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Morozov's]] analysis of some ancient [[horoscopes]], most notably, the so-called [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera Zodiacs]]—two horoscopes drawn on the ceiling of the [[Hathor temple|temple of Hathor]]—and comes to the conclusion that they correspond to either the 11th or the 13th century AD. Moreover, in his ''History: Fiction or Science'' series finale, he makes computer-aided dating of all 37 Egyptian horoscopes that contain sufficient astronomical data, and claims they all fit into 11th to 19th century timeframe.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} Traditional history usually either interprets these horoscopes as belonging to the 1st century BC or suggests that they weren't meant to match any date at all.
* In his final analysis of an eclipse triad described by the ancient Greek [[Thucydides]] in ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', Fomenko dates the eclipses to AD 1039, 1046 and 1057. Because of the layered structure of the manuscript, he claims that Thucydides actually lived in medieval times and in describing the [[Peloponnesian War]] between the [[Sparta]]ns and [[Athens|Athenians]] he was actually describing the conflict between the medieval [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarrans]] and [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]] in Spain from AD 1374 to 1387.
* Fomenko claims that the abundance of dated astronomical records in cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia is of little use for dating of events, as the astronomical phenomena they describe recur cyclically every 30–40 years.

=== Rejection of common dating methods ===

On archaeological dating methods, Fomenko claims:

{{quote|Archaeological, dendrochronological, paleographical and carbon methods of dating of ancient sources and artifacts are both non-exact and contradictory, therefore there is not a single piece of firm written evidence or artifact that could be reliably and independently dated earlier than the XI century|Anatoly Fomenko|''History: Fiction or Science? (Chronology 1) [Second edition]''}}

[[Dendrochronology]] is rejected with a claim that, for dating of objects much older than the oldest still living trees, it isn't an absolute, but a [[relative dating]] method, and thus dependent on traditional chronology. Fomenko specifically points to a break of dendrochronological scales around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also cites a number of cases where [[carbon dating]] of a series of objects of known age gave significantly different dates. He also alleges undue cooperation between physicists and archaeologists in obtaining the dates, since most radiocarbon dating labs only accept samples with an age estimate suggested by historians or archaeologists. Fomenko also claims that carbon dating over the range of AD 1 to 2000 is inaccurate because it has too many sources of error that are either guessed at or completely ignored, and that calibration is done with a statistically meaningless number of samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

Consequently, Fomenko concludes that carbon dating is not accurate enough to be used on historical scale.

Fomenko rejects [[numismatics|numismatic]] dating as circular, being based on the traditional chronology, and points to cases of similar coins being minted in distant periods, unexplained long periods with no coins minted and cases of mismatch of numismatic dating with historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Reception==
Fomenko's historical ideas have been universally rejected by mainstream scholars, who brand them as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitaly L. Ginzburg]], [http://humanism.al.ru/en/articles.phtml?num=000051 ''Pseudoscience and the Need to Combat It'']. Ginzburg is a [[Nobel laureate]] and a member of the Commission to Combat Pseudoscience and the Falsification of Scientific Research of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;/ref&gt; but were popularized by former world chess champion [[Garry Kasparov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new-tradition.org/view-garry-kasparov.htm Mathematics of the Past]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newc.narod.ru/article/nx/ksprv.htm Некоторые выступления Г.

Kasparov also felt it illogical that the Romans and the Greeks living under the banner of [[Byzantium]] could fail to use the mounds of scientific knowledge left them by Ancient Greece and Rome, especially when it was of urgent military use. However, Kasparov does not support the reconstruction part of the New Chronology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=44FE98F9E4576 "Answers of Kasparov"] (in Russian). Kasparov.ru ([[gazeta.ru]]). September 6, 2006. Retrieved 2009-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian critics tended to see Fomenko's New Chronology as "an embarrassment and a potent symbol of the depths to which the Russian academy and society have generally sunk ... since the fall of Communism".&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Western critics see his views as part of a renewed Russian imperial ideology, "keeping alive an imperial consciousness and secular messianism in Russia".&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 at the Moscow International Book Fair, Anatoly Fomenko with his coauthor [[Gleb Vladimirovich Nosovsky|Gleb Nosovsky]] were awarded for their books on "New Chronology" the anti-prize called [[:ru:Антипремия «Абзац»|"Abzatz"]] (literally 'paragraph', a Russian slang word meaning 'disaster' or 'fiasco') in the category "Pochotnaya bezgramota" (the term is a pun upon "Pochotnaya gramota" ([[Russian Federation Presidential Certificate of Honour|Certificate of Honor]]) and may be translated either "Certificate of Dishonor" or literally, "Respectable Illiteracy" ) for the worst book published in Russia.

Critics have accused Fomenko of altering the data to improve the fit with his ideas and have noted that he [[Confirmation bias|violates a key rule of statistics]] by selecting matches from the historical record which support his chronology, while ignoring those which do not, creating artificial, better-than-chance correlations, and that these practices undermine Fomenko's statistical arguments.&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt; The new chronology was given a comprehensive critical analysis in a round table on "The 'Myths' of New Chronology" chaired by the dean of the department of history of [[Moscow State University]] in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;V.L.

Fomenko).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the participants in that round table, the distinguished Russian archaeologist, [[Valentin Yanin]], compared Fomenko's work to "the sleight of hand trickery of a [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Valentin Yanin|V. L. Yanin]], [http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/janin.htm "Зияющие высоты" академика Фоменко] (The "Gaping Heights" of Academician Fomenko); passage translated in James H. Billington, ''Russia in Search of Itself'', (Washington: Woodrow Wilson Center Press / Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 2004, pp. 83-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Andrey Zaliznyak]] argued that by using the Fomenko's approaches one can "prove" any historical correspondence, for example, between Ancient Egyptian pharaohs and French kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2011/12/02_a_3855010.shtml|script-title=ru:«Фоменко — жертва фанатизма»|last=Малянов|first=Дмитрий|date=2 December 2011|publisher=[[Gazeta.ru]]|language=Russian|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/fomenko/zaliznk.htm|script-title=ru:Лингвистика по А.

[[James H. Billington|James Billington]], formerly professor of Russian history at [[Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Librarian of Congress]] from 1987-2015 placed Fomenko's work within the context of the political movement of [[Eurasianism]], which sought to tie Russian history closely to that of its Asian neighbors. Billington describes Fomenko as ascribing the belief in past hostility between Russia and the Mongols to the influence of Western historians. Thus, by Fomenko's chronology, "Russia and Turkey are parts of a previously single empire."&lt;ref name="James H. Billington 2004, pp. 82-4"/&gt; A French reviewer of Billington's book noted approvingly his concern with the phantasmagorical conceptions of Fomenko about the global "new chronology".&lt;ref name="monderusse.revues.org" /&gt;

H.G. van Bueren, professor emeritus of astronomy at the [[University of Utrecht]], concluded his scathing review of Fomenko's work on the application of mathematics and astronomy to historical data as follows:
{{quote|text=It is surprising, to say the least, that a well-known (Dutch) publisher could produce an expensive book of such doubtful intellectual value, of which the only good word that can be said is that it contains an enormous amount of factual historical material, untidily ordered, true; badly written, yes; mixed-up with conjectural nonsense, sure; but still, much useful stuff. For the rest of the book is absolutely worthless. It reminds one of the early Soviet attempts to produce [[Pathological science|tendentious science]] ([[Lysenkoism|Lysenko]]!), of [[polywater]], of [[cold fusion]], and of modern [[creationism]]. In brief: a useless and misleading book.|sign=H.G. van Bueren|source="Mathematics and Logic"&lt;ref name="Bueren 1994"/&gt;}}

===Convergence of methods in archaeological dating===

While Fomenko rejects commonly accepted dating methods, archaeologists, conservators and other scientists make extensive use of such techniques which have been rigorously examined and refined during decades of use.&lt;ref&gt;See the international journal [http://www.radiocarbon.org/ ''Radiocarbon''] for examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[dendrochronology]], Fomenko claims that this fails as an absolute dating method because of gaps in the record. However, independent dendrochronological sequences beginning with living trees from various parts of [[North America]]&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Ferguson and D. A. Graybill, [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume25/Number2/azu_radiocarbon_v25_n2_287_288_v.pdf "Dendrochronology of Bristlecone Pine: A Progress Report"], ''Radiocarbon'', 25 (1983): 287-288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minze Stuiver, [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume24/Number1/azu_radiocarbon_v24_n1_1_26_v.pdf "A High-Precision Calibration of the AD Radiocarbon Time Scale"], ''Radiocarbon'', 24 (1982): 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe&lt;ref&gt;M.

Reimer, ''et al.'', [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume46/Number3/azu_radiocarbon_v46_n3_1029_1058_v.pdf "INTCAL04 Terrestrial Radiocarbon Age Calibration, 0–26 Cal Kyr BP"], ''Radiocarbon'' 46 (2004): 1029-1058; data online at http://www.radiocarbon.org/IntCal04%20files/intcal04.14c .&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, archaeologists have developed a ''fully anchored'' dendrochronology series going back past 10,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich M, Remmele S, Kromer B, Hofmann J, Spurk M, Kaiser KF, Orcel C, Küppers M (2004).

"The 12,460-year Hohenheim Oak and pine tree-ring chronology from central Europe: A unique annual record for radiocarbon calibration and paleoenvironment reconstructions" ''Radiocarbon'' 2004, vol. 46, no3, pp. 1111-1122 [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16599079]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misuse of historical sources and forced pattern matching===

Critics of Fomenko's theory claim that his use of historical sources is highly selective and ignores the basic principles of sound historical scholarship.&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fomenko ... provides no fair-minded review of the historical literature about a topic with which he deals, quotes only those sources that serve his purposes, uses evidence in ways that seem strange to professionally-trained historians and asserts the wildest speculation as if it has the same status as the information common to the conventional historical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They also note that his method of statistically correlating of texts is very rough, because it does not take into account the many possible sources of variation in length outside of "importance". They maintain that differences in language, style, and scope, as well as the frequently differing views and focuses of historians, which are manifested in a different notion of "important events", make quantifying historical writings a dubious proposition at best. What's more, Fomenko's critics allege that the parallelisms he reports are often derived by alleged forcing by Fomenko of the data &amp;ndash; rearranging, merging, and removing monarchs as needed to fit the pattern.

For example, on the one hand Fomenko asserts that the vast majority of ancient sources are either irreparably distorted duplicate accounts of the same events or later forgeries. In his identification of [[Jesus]] with [[Pope Gregory VII]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fSvlaZYbcwUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;sig=2_vZeaAnuN5U6iITpdkuUK-eIlI#PPA51,M1 Book 2, Chapter 2, pg 51]&lt;/ref&gt; he ignores the otherwise vast dissimilarities between their reported lives and focuses on the similarity of their appointment to religious office by baptism. (The evangelical Jesus is traditionally believed to have lived for 33 years, and he was an adult at the time of his encounter with [[John the Baptist]]. In contrast, according to the available primary sources, Pope Gregory VII lived for at least 60 years and was born 8 years after the death of Fomenko's John-the-Baptist equivalent [[John Crescentius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06791c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope St. Gregory VII]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Critics allege that many of the supposed correlations of regnal durations are the product of the selective parsing and blending of the dates, events, and individuals mentioned in the original text.{{sfn|Colavito|2004}} Another point raised by critics is that Fomenko does not explain his altering the data (changing the order of rulers, dropping rulers, combining rulers, treating interregna as rulers, switching between theologians and emperors, etc.) preventing a duplication of the effort and effectively making this whole theory an [[ad hoc hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt;

===Selectivity in reference to astronomical phenomena===

Critics point out that Fomenko's discussion of astronomical phenomena tends to be selective, choosing isolated examples that support the New Chronology and ignoring the large bodies of data that provide statistically supported evidence for the conventional dating. For his dating of the Almagest star catalog, Fomenko arbitrarily selected eight stars from the more than 1000 stars in the catalog, one of which (Arcturus) has a large systematic error. This star has a dominant effect on Fomenko's dating.&lt;ref&gt;Yu. N. Efremov, [http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/efremov.htm Астрономия и синдром “новой хронологии”] (Astronomy and the Syndrome of "New Chronology").&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis using the same method for all "fast" stars points to the antiquity of the Almagest star catalog.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Dambis and Yu. N. Efremov, "Dating Ptolemy's Star Catalogue through Proper Motions: The Hipparchan Epoch", [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000JHA....31..115D ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 31 (2000): 115-134;] see especially note 17 (p. 134).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Gorodetsky, [http://www.newchrono.net/fomenko/starwars.htm Звездные войны с историей (верификация датировки Альмагеста)] (Starry wars with history (Verification of the dating of the Almagest)).&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlins points out further that Fomenko's statistical analysis got the wrong date for the ''Almagest'' because he took as constant Earth's [[axial tilt|obliquity]] when it is a variable that changes at a very slow, but known, rate.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Rawlins, "Recovering Hipparchos’ Last Lost Lustrous Star", [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w43.pdf ''DIO'' 4.3 (1994): 119]. Like Dambis and Efremov, Rawlins provides evidence that the Almagest star catalog was based on observations made in the 2nd century BCE by [[Hipparchus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko's studies ignore the abundance of dated astronomical records in [[cuneiform]] texts from [[Mesopotamia]]. Among these texts is a series of [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]], which records precise astronomical observations of the Moon and planets, often dated in terms of the reigns of known historical figures extending back to the 6th century BCE. Astronomical retrocalculations for all these moving objects allow us to date these observations, and consequently the rulers' reigns, to within a single day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asger Aaboe]], ''Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy,'' (New York: Springer, 2001) pp. 39-40 {{ISBN|0-387-95136-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The observations are sufficiently redundant that only a small portion of them are sufficient to date a text to a unique year in the period 750 BCE to 100 CE. The dates obtained agree with the accepted chronology.&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Stephenson and J. M. Steele, "Astronomical Dating of Babylonian Texts Describing the Total Solar Eclipse of S.E. 175", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 37 (2006): 55-69. This study showed that either the description of the phenomena observed at the solar eclipse or of a set of conjunctions of the slow planets [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Mars]] were sufficient to equate [[Seleucid era|S.E.]] 175 with 137/6 BCE. Additional details in these texts provided further confirmation of this dating.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, F. R. Stephenson has demonstrated through a systematic study of a large number of [[Babylonia]]n, Ancient and Medieval European, and [[China|Chinese]] records of eclipse observations that they can be dated consistently with conventional chronology at least as far back as 600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.22-2.27.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Fomenko's missing centuries, Stephenson's studies of eclipse observations find an accumulated uncertainty in the timing of the rotation of the earth of 420 seconds at 400 BCE, and only 80 seconds at 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Espenak, [http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html Eclipse Predictions and Earth's Rotation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716020131/sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html |date=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnitude and consistency of conspiracy theory===
Fomenko states that world history prior to 1600 was deliberately falsified for political reasons. The consequences of this conspiracy theory are twofold. Documents that conflict with New Chronology are said to have been edited or fabricated by conspirators; the Vatican, the Holy Roman Empire and pro-German [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; New Chronology taps traditionally Russian anti-Western thoughts and ideas of Germany as a chief enemy. Further, the theory is Russocentric diminishing achievements of other cultures and claiming major civilization accomplishments as Russian and by proposing a giant "Russian Horde" empire and eliminating historical time before its existence.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; The theory also claimed to undermine nationalism in countries neighboring Russia by positioning divisions and conflicts as fabricated.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; Unlike other popular conspiracy theories New Chronology is not [[anti-semitic]] ''per se'', but it contains claims that may be unwelcome by Jewish communities like that the [[Old Testament]] is newer than the [[New Testament]], placing Jerusalem in [[Constantinople]] and projecting stereotypes of [[Jew]]s by proposing that Jews originate from bankers in the Russian Horde that adopted the religion of Judaism, itself a derivative of Christianity and [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|not the other way round]].&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; 

The theory provides an alternate history account of the "true" history centered around a world empire called the "Russian Horde".&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; The scope of the New Chronology has been compared to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy world.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011&gt;{{cite journal |last= Halperin |first= Charles J. |year= 2011 |title= False Identity and Multiple Identities in Russian History: The Mongol Empire and Ivan the Terrible |url= http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/160 |journal= The Carl Beck Papers |publisher= The Center for Russian and East European Studies|volume= |number= 2103 |pages= 1–71|doi= 10.5195/cbp.2011.160|access-date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of pages has been written about it and authors address a wide range of objections.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt;

===Popularity in forums and amongst Russian imperialists===

Fomenko has published and sold over one million copies of his books in his native [[Russia]]. Many [[Internet forum]]s have appeared which aim to supplement his work with additional amateur research.&lt;ref&gt;Melleuish et al. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His critics have suggested that Fomenko's version of history appealed to the Russian reading public by keeping alive an imperial consciousness to replace their disillusionment with the failures of Communism and [[Russian oligarchs|post-Communist corporate oligarchies]].&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"/&gt;

'''Oxygen balance''' ('''OB''', or '''OB%''') is an expression that is used to indicate the degree to which an explosive can be oxidized. If an explosive molecule contains just enough oxygen to form [[carbon dioxide]] from [[carbon]], water from [[hydrogen]] molecules, all of its [[sulfur dioxide]] from [[sulfur]], and all metal oxides from metals with no excess, the molecule is said to have a '''zero oxygen balance'''. The molecule is said to have a '''positive oxygen balance''' if it contains more oxygen than is needed and a '''negative oxygen balance''' if it contains less oxygen than is needed; the combustion will then be incomplete, and large amount of toxic gases like [[carbon monoxide]] will be present. The sensitivity, [[strength (explosive)|strength]], and [[brisance]] of an explosive are all somewhat dependent upon oxygen balance and tend to approach their maxima as oxygen balance approaches zero.

The oxygen balance is calculated from the empirical formula of a compound in percentage of oxygen required for complete conversion of carbon to carbon dioxide, hydrogen to water, and metal to metal oxide.

The procedure for calculating oxygen balance in terms of 100 grams of the explosive material is to determine the number of [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s of oxygen that are excess or deficient for 100 grams of a compound.

:&lt;math&gt;OB\% = \frac{-1600}{Mol. wt. of compound} \times (2X + (Y/2) + M - Z)&lt;/math&gt;

where

''X'' = number of atoms of carbon, ''Y'' = number of atoms of hydrogen, ''Z'' = number of atoms of oxygen, and ''M'' = number of atoms of metal (metallic oxide produced).

In the case of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),

Molecular weight = 227.1

''X'' = 7 (number of carbon atoms)

''Y'' = 5 (number of hydrogen atoms)

''Z'' = 6 (number of oxygen atoms)

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;OB\% = \frac{-1600}{227.1} \times (14 + 2.5 - 6)&lt;/math&gt;

:OB% = −73.97% for TNT

Because sensitivity, [[brisance]], and strength are properties resulting from a complex explosive chemical reaction, a simple relationship such as oxygen balance cannot be depended upon to yield universally consistent results. When using oxygen balance to predict properties of one explosive relative to another, it is to be expected that one with an oxygen balance closer to zero will be the more brisant, powerful, and sensitive; however, many exceptions to this rule do exist. More complicated predictive calculations, such as those discussed in the next section of the [[explosive materials]] article, result in more accurate predictions.

One area in which oxygen balance can be applied is in the processing of mixtures of explosives. The family of explosives called [[amatol]]s are mixtures of [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. Ammonium nitrate has an oxygen balance of +20% and TNT has an oxygen balance of −74%, so it would appear that the mixture yielding an oxygen balance of zero would also result in the best explosive properties. In actual practice a mixture of 80% ammonium nitrate and 20% TNT by weight yields an oxygen balance of +1%, the best properties of all mixtures, and an increase in strength of 30% over TNT.

Examples of materials with negative oxygen balance are e.g. [[trinitrotoluene]] (−74%), [[aluminium]] powder (−89%), [[sulfur]] (−100%), or [[carbon]] (−266.7%).

Examples of materials with positive oxygen balance are e.g. [[ammonium nitrate]] (+20%), [[ammonium perchlorate]] (+34%), [[potassium chlorate]] (+39.2%), [[sodium chlorate]] (+45%), [[potassium nitrate]] (+47.5%), [[tetranitromethane]] (+49%), [[lithium perchlorate]] (+60%), or [[nitroglycerine]] (+3.5%).

The theoretical compound [[trinitrotriazine]] has an oxygen balance of zero.

Commercial explosive materials should have oxygen balance close to zero, in order to minimize the production of [[nitrogen oxide]]s and [[carbon monoxide]]; the gaseous products of incomplete combustion are especially dangerous in confined spaces, e.g. [[coal mine]]s.

'''''Persian Letters''''' ({{lang-fr|Lettres persanes}}) is a literary work, written in 1721, by [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu]], recounting the experiences of two [[Persia]]n noblemen, Usbek and Rica, who are traveling through [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url =http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1051588x/f5.image.r=| title =  Lettres persanes | access-date= 13 June 2016 | year = 1721| publisher = P.

==Plot summary==
In 1711 Usbek leaves his [[seraglio]] in [[Isfahan]] to take the long journey to France, accompanied by his young friend Rica. He leaves behind five wives (Zashi, Zéphis, Fatmé, Zélis, and Roxane) in the care of a number of black [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]], one of whom is the head or first eunuch. During the trip and their long stay in [[Paris]] (1712–1720), they comment, in letters exchanged with friends and [[mullah]]s, on numerous aspects of Western, Christian society, particularly French politics and [[Moors]], ending with a biting satire of the System of [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]. Over time, various disorders surface back in the seraglio, and, beginning in 1717 (Letter 139 [147]), the situation there rapidly unravels. Usbek orders his head eunuch to crack down, but his message does not arrive in time, and a revolt brings about the death of his wives, including the vengeful suicide of his favorite, Roxane, and, it appears, most of the eunuchs.

The Chronology breaks down as follows:

*Letters 1–21 [1–23]: The journey from Isfahan to France, which lasts almost 14 months (from 19 March 1711 to 4 May 1712).
*Letters 22 [24]–89 [92]: Paris in the reign of [[Louis XIV]], 3 years in all (from May 1712 to September 1715).
*Letters 90 [93]–137 [143] or [supplementary Letter 8 =145]: the Regency of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d’Orléans]], covering five years (from September 1715 to November 1720).
*Letters 138 [146]– 150 [161]: the collapse of the seraglio in Isfahan, approximately 3 years (1717–1720).

The first edition of the novel, which consists of 150 letters, appeared in May 1721 under the rubric Cologne: [[Pierre Marteau]], a front for the Amsterdam publisher Jacques Desbordes whose business is now run by his widow, Susanne de Caux.{{clarify|date=November 2014}} Called edition A, this is the text utilized in the recent critical edition of ''Lettres persanes'' for the complete works of Montesquieu published by the Voltaire Foundation in 2004. A second edition (B) by the same publisher later in the same year, for which there is so far no entirely satisfactory explanation, curiously included three new letters but omitted thirteen of the original ones. All subsequent editions in the author’s lifetime (i.e., until 1755) derive from A or B. A new edition in 1758, prepared by Montesquieu’s son, included eight new letters – bringing the total to 161 – and a short piece by the author entitled "Quelques réflexions sur les ''Lettres persanes''." This latter edition has been used for all subsequent editions until the ''Œuvres complètes'' of 2004, which reverts to the original edition but includes the added letters marked as "supplementary" and, in parentheses, the numbering scheme of 1758.

==An epistolary novel==
[[File:Persianische Briefe.jpg|thumb|An early illustration depicting Usbek and Rica]]
Montesquieu never referred to ''Lettres persanes'' (Persian Letters) as a [[novel]] until "Quelques remarques sur les ''Lettres persanes''," which begins: "Nothing about the ''Lettres persanes'' was more ingratiating than to find in it unexpectedly a sort of novel. There is a visible beginning, development, and ending […]." Initially, for most of its first readers as well as for its author, it was not considered primarily a novel, and even less an "[[epistolary novel]]" (as it is often classified now), which was not at that time a constituted genre. Indeed, it has little in common with the sole model at the time, Guilleragues’s ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun|Lettres portugaises]]'' of 1669. A collection of "letters" in 1721 would more likely evoke the recent tradition of essentially polemical and political periodicals, such as ''Lettres historiques'' (1692–1728), the Jesuits’ famous ''Lettres édifiantes et curieuses'' (1703–1776), not to mention [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer|Mme Dunoyer’s]] ''Lettres historiques et galantes'' (1707–1717) which, in the form of a correspondence between two women, provide a chronicle of the end of the reign of Louis XIV and the beginning of the Regency. The ''Lettres persanes'' thus helped confirm the vogue of a format that was already established. But it is in its numerous imitations – such as ''Lettres juives'' (1738) and ''Lettres chinoises'' (1739) of [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens|Boyer d’Argens]], ''Lettres d’une Turque à Paris, écrites à sa sœur'' (1730) by Poullain de Saint-Foix (published several times in conjunction with ''Lettres persanes''), and perhaps especially [[Françoise d'Issembourg d'Happoncourt, Madame de Graffigny|Françoise de Graffigny]]’s ''Lettres d’une Péruvienne'' (1747) – not to mention the letter-novels of [[Samuel Richardson|Richardson]] – which, between 1721 and 1754, had in effect transformed ''Lettres persanes'' into an "epistolary novel." Whence this remark in Montesquieu’s ''Mes Pensées'': "My ''Lettres persanes'' taught people to write letter-novels" (no. 1621).

The [[Epistolary novel|epistolary structure]] is quite flexible: nineteen correspondents in all, with at least twenty-two different recipients. Usbek and Rica by far dominate with sixty-six letters for the former and forty-seven for the latter (of the final 161). Ibben, who functions more as addressee than correspondent, writes only two letters but receives forty-two. Likewise, an unnamed person (designated only as ***) – if always the same – receives eighteen letters and writes none at all. There is even one complete anomaly, a letter from Hagi Ibbi to Ben Josué (Letter 37 [39]), neither of whom is mentioned elsewhere in the novel.

The letters are apparently all dated in accordance with a [[lunar calendar]] which, as [[Robert Shackleton]] showed in 1954, in fact corresponds to our own, by simple substitution of Muslim names, as follows: Zilcadé (January), Zilhagé (February), Maharram (March), Saphar (April), Rebiab I (May), Rebiab II (June), Gemmadi I (July), Gemmadi II (August), Rhegeb (September), Chahban (October), Rhamazan (November), Chalval (December).

==Social commentary==

In Paris, the Persians express themselves on a wide variety of subjects, from governmental institutions to salon caricatures. The difference of temperament of the two friends is notable, Usbek being more experienced and asking many questions, Rica less implicated and more free, and more attracted by Parisian life. Both retain Montesquieu's rich satirical tone, as in Rica's ''Lettre 72'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Je me trouvai l’autre jour dans une compagnie où je vis un homme bien content de lui. Dans un quart d’heure, il décida trois questions de morale, quatre problèmes historiques, et cinq points de physique : Je n’ai jamais vu un décisionnaire si universel ; son esprit ne fut jamais suspendu par le moindre doute. On laissa les sciences ; on parla des nouvelles du temps : il décida sur les nouvelles du temps. Je voulus l’attraper, et je dis en moi-même : Il faut que je me mette dans mon fort ; je vais me réfugier dans mon pays. Je lui parlai de la Perse ; mais, à peine lui eus-je dit quatre mots, qu’il me donna deux démentis, fondés sur l’autorité de messieurs Tavernier et Chardin. Ah ! bon Dieu ! dis-je en moi-même, quel homme est-ce là ? Il connoîtra tout à l’heure les rues d’Ispahan mieux que moi ! Mon parti fut bientôt pris : je me tus, je le laissai parler, et il décide encore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Lettres_persanes/Lettre_72 Lettre 72]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I found myself recently in a company where I met am man very well satisfied with himself. In a quarter of an hour, he decided three questions in morals, four historical problems, and five points in physics. I have never seen so universal a decider; his mind was not once troubled with the least doubt. We left science, and talked of the current news: he decided upon the current news. I wished to catch him, so I said to myself, “I must get to my strong point; I will betake me to my own country.” I spoke to him of Persia; but hardly had I opened my mouth, when he contradicted me twice, basing his objections upon the authority of Tavernier and Chardin. “Ah! Good heavens!” said I to myself, “what kind of man is this? He will know next all the streets in Ispahan better than I do!” I soon knew what part to play-to be silent, and let him talk; and he is still laying down the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Persian_Letters/Letter_72 Letter 72], trans. [[John Davidson (poet)|John Davidson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although this takes place in the declining years of the aged king, much of what he has accomplished is still admired in a Paris where the Invalides is being completed and cafés and theatre proliferate. We observe the function of parliaments, tribunals, religious bodies ([[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Jesuits]], etc.), public places and their publics (the [[Tuileries]], the [[Palais Royal]]), state foundations (the hospital of the Quinze-Vingts [300] for the blind, the [[Les Invalides|Invalides]] for those wounded in war). They describe a thriving culture, where even the presence of two Persians quickly becomes a popular phenomenon, thanks to the proliferation of prints (letter 28 [30]). The café&amp;nbsp;– where debates take place (letter 34 [36])&amp;nbsp;– has become established as a public institution, as were already the theatre and opera. There are still people foolish enough to search at their own expense for the [[philosopher's stone]]; the newsmonger and the periodical press are beginning to play a role in everyday life. Everything from institutions (the [[University of Paris|university]], the [[Académie française|Academy]], Sciences, the Bull ''[[Unigenitus]]'') via groups (fashion, dandies, coquettes) to individuals (the opera singer, the old warrior, the rake, and so forth) comes to the eye of the reader.

Usbek for his part is troubled by religious contrasts. Though it never occurs to him to cease being a [[Muslim]], and while he still wonders at some aspects of Christianity (the [[Trinity]], [[Communion rite|communion]]), he writes to austere authorities to inquire, for example, why some foods are considered to be unclean (letters 15–17 [16–18]). He also assimilates the two religions and even all religions with respect to their social utility.

Certain sequences of letters by a single author develop more fully a particular subject, such as letters 11–14 from Usbek to Mirza on the Troglodytes, letters 109–118 (113–122) from Usbek to Rhedi on [[demography]], letters 128–132 (134–138) from Rica on his visit to the library at Saint-Victor. They sketch analyses that will later be developed in [[The Spirit of the Laws|''L’Esprit des lois'']] for many subjects such as the types of powers, the influence of climate and the critique of colonization.

==The dénouement==

While Usbek appreciates the freer relations among men and women in the West, he remains, as master of a seraglio, a prisoner of his past. His wives play the role of languorous and lonely lovers, he the role of master and lover, with no true communication and without revealing much about their true selves. Usbek’s language with them is as constrained as theirs with him. Knowing, moreover, from the outset that he is not assured of a return to Persia, Usbek is also already disabused about their attitude (letters 6 and 19 [20]). The seraglio is a hothouse from which he increasingly distances himself, trusting his wives no more than his eunuchs (Letter 6).

Everything cascades in the final letters (139–150 [147–161]), thanks to a sudden analepse of more than three years with respect to the preceding letters. From letter 69 (71) to letter 139 (147) – chronologically from 1714 to 1720 – not a single letter from Usbek relates to the seraglio, which is unmentioned in any guise from letter 94 to 143 (and even in the edition of 1758 from supplementary letter 8 (97) to 145. Moreover, all the letters from 126 (132) to 137 (148) are from Rica, which means that for about fifteen months (from 4 August 1719 to 22 October 1720) Usbek is completely silent. Although he has in the meantime received letters, the reader does not learn of them until the final series, which is more developed after the addition of supplementary letters 9–11 (157, 158, 160) of 1758. Although Usbek has learned as early as October 1714 that "the seraglio is in disorder" (letter 63 [65]). As the spirit of rebellion advances, he decides to act, but too late; with delays in the transmission of letters and the loss of some, the situation is beyond remedy.

A dejected Usbek is apparently resigned to the necessity of returning, with little hope, to Persia; on 4 October 1719 he laments: "I shall deliver my head to my enemies" (147 [155]). He nevertheless does not do so: late in 1720 he is still in Paris, for letters 134–137 (140–145), which contain the whole history of Law’s "System," are in fact posterior to Roxane’s last missive (dated 8 May 1720), which he must already have received – the usual time for delivery being about five months – when he writes the latest in date of his own (supplementary letter 8 and letter 138 [145 and 146]), in October and November 1720.

==Sources==

Montesquieu’s "sources" are legion, since they doubtless extend to readings and conversations which are modified en route. The impact of [[Jean Chardin]]’s ''Voyages en Perse'', to which he owes most of his information about Persia – which is far from superficial – must of course be recognized; he owned the two-volume edition of 1687 and purchased the extended edition in ten volumes in 1720. To a lesser degree, he drew on the ''Voyages'' of [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]] and [[Paul Rycaut]], not to mention many other works which his vast library afforded him. Everything having to do with contemporary France or Paris, on the other hand, comes from his own experience, and from conversations of anecdotes related to him.

Various aspects of the book are doubtless indebted to particular models, of which the most important is Giovanni Paolo Marana’s ''L’Espion dans les cours des princes chrétiens'' (''[[Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy]]''), widely known at the time, even though Montesquieu’s characters obviously are Persians and not Turks. While the great popularity of [[Antoine Galland]]’s ''Mille et Une Nuits'' (''[[The Arabian Nights]]'') contributes, as do the Bible and the Qu’ran, to the general ambiance of oriental subjects, in fact it has almost nothing in common with the ''Lettres persanes''.

==Critical history==

The ''Lettres persanes'' was an immediate success and often imitated, but it has been diversely interpreted over time. Until the middle of the twentieth century, it was its "spirit" of the Regency which was largely admired, as well as the caricature in the classical tradition of [[Jean de La Bruyère|La Bruyère]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]]. No one had the notion of attaching it to the novelistic genre. The Persian side of the novel tended to be considered as a fanciful decor, the true interest of the work lying in its factitious "oriental" impressions of French society, along with political and religious satire and critique.

In the 1950s began a new era of studies based on better texts and renewed perspectives. Particularly important were the extensively annotated edition by Paul Vernière and the research of [[Robert Shackleton]] on Muslim chronology; also studies by Roger Laufer, Pauline Kra and Roger Mercier, which put new focus on the work’s unity and integrated the seraglio into its overall meaning. Others who have followed have looked into the ramifications of epistolary form, the structure and meaning of the seraglio, Usbek’s contradictions. Beginning about 1970 it is religion (Kra) and especially politics (Ehrard, Goulemot, Benrekassa) which predominate in studies on ''Lettres persanes'', with a progressive return to the role of the seraglio with all its women and eunuchs (Delon, Grosrichard, Singerman, Spector) or the cultural cleavage of Orient and Occident.

The American philosopher [[Marshall Berman]] devotes several chapters in his book ''The Politics of Authenticity'' (1970) to the radical humanism of the Persian Letters.

===The Jewish Letters===
{{main article|Jewish Letters}}
The Jewish Letters of [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens|Boyer d'Argens]] were published in 1738, composed in a total of 180 letters that originally spanned 30 volumes. Although they are certainly an imitation of the Persian Letters, they are not considered plagiarism due to the distinction of content between the two works. Although he titled himself as the work's "translator", he is most ascribed as the work's author.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8761">'''Protocol engineering''' is the application of systematic methods to the development of [[communication protocol]]s. It uses many of the principles of [[software engineering]], but it is specific to the development of distributed systems.

== History ==

When the first experimental and commercial [[computer networks]] were developed in the 1970ies, the concept of protocols was not yet well developed. These were the first [[distributed computing|distributed systems]]. In the context of the newly adopted layered protocol architecture (see [[OSI model]]), the definition of the protocol of a specific layer should be such that any entity implementing that specification in one computer would be compatible with any other computer containing an entity implementing the same specification, and their interactions should be such that the desired communication service would be obtained. On the other hand, the protocol specification should be abstract enough to allow different choices for the implementation on different computers. 

It was recognized that a precise specification of the expected service provided by the given layer was important &lt;ref name="Boch1980"&gt; G. v. Bochmann and C. A. Sunshine, Formal methods in communication protocol design, IEEE Tr. COM-28, No. 4 (April 1980), pp. 624-631.&lt;/ref&gt;. It is important for the verification of the protocol, which should demonstrate that the communication service is provided if both protocol entities implement the protocol specification correctly. This principle was later followed during the standardization of the [[OSI model|OSI protocol stack]], in particular for the [[Transport layer]].

It was also recognized that some kind of formalized protocol specification would be useful for the verification of the protocol and for developing implementations, as well as test cases for checking the conformance of an implementation against the specification &lt;ref&gt;See the series of conferences on [https://dblp.org/db/conf/pstv/index Protocol Specification Testing and Verification] (PSTV) since 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;. While initially mainly finite-state machine were used as (simplified) models of a protocol entity &lt;ref name="Boch2010"&gt; G. v. Bochmann, D. Rayner and C. H. West, Some notes on the history of protocol engineering, Computer Networks journal, 54 (2010), pp 3197–3209.&lt;/ref&gt;, in the 1980ies three formal specification languages were standardized, two by ISO &lt;ref&gt;C. A. Vissers, G. v. Bochmann and R. L. Tenney, Formal description techniques, Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 71, 12, pp. 1356-1364, Dec. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; and one by ITU &lt;ref&gt;G.J. Dickson ; P.E. de Chazal, Status of CCITT description techniques and application to protocol specification, Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 71, 12, pp. 1346-1355 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;. The latter, called [[Specification and Description Language|SDL]], was later used in industry and has been merged with [[UML state machine]]s. 

== Principles ==

[[File:Protocol architecture.svg|thumb|Layered protocol architecture]]
[[File:Communication service architecture.svg|thumb|Layered protocol architecture: More abstract view – showing the communication service provided.]]

The following are the most important principles for the development of protocols:&lt;ref name="Boch1980"/&gt;

* Layered architecture: A protocol layer at the level n consists of two (or more) entities that have a service interface through which the service of the layer is provided to the users of the protocol, and which uses the service provided by a local entity of level (n-1). 

* The service specification of a layer describes, in an abstract and global view, the behavior of the layer as visible at the service interfaces of the layer. 

* The protocol specification defines the requirements that should be satisfied by each entity implementation.

* Protocol verification consists of showing that two (or more) entities satisfying the protocol specification will provide at their service interfaces the specified service of that layer.

* The (verified) protocol specification is used mainly for the following two activities:

# The development of an entity implementation. Note that the abstract properties of the service interface are defined by the service specification (and also used by the protocol specification), but the detailed nature of the interface can be chosen during the implementation process, separately for each entity. 
# Test suite development for [[conformance testing]]. Protocol conformance testing checks that a given entity implementation conforms to the protocol specification. The conformance test cases are developed based on the protocol specification and are applicable to all entity implementations. Therefore standard conformance test suites have been developed for certain protocol standards.&lt;ref name="Boch2010"/&gt;

== Methods and tools ==

Tools for the activities of protocol verification, entity implementation and test suite development can be developed when the protocol specification is written in a formalized language which can be understood by the tool. As mentioned, [[formal specification]] languages have been proposed for protocol specification, and the first methods and tools where based on finite-state machine models. [[Reachability analysis]] was proposed to understand all possible behaviors of a distributed system, which is essential for protocol verification. This was later complemented with [[model checking]]. However, finite-state descriptions are not powerful enough to describe constraints between message parameters and the local variables in the entities. Such constraints can be described by the standardized formal specification languages mentioned above, for which powerful tools have been developed. 

It is in the field of protocol engineering that [[model-based development]] was used very early. These methods and tools have later been used for [[software engineering]] as well as hardware design, especially for distributed and real-time systems. On the other hand, many methods and tools developed in the more general context of software engineering can also be used of the development of protocols, for instance [[model checking]] for protocol verification, and [[Agile software development|agile methods]] for entity implementations. 

== Constructive methods for protocol design ==

Most protocols are designed by human intuition and discussions during the standardization process. However, some methods have been proposed for using constructive methods possibly supported by tools to automatically derive protocols that satisfy certain properties. The following are a few examples:

* Semi-automatic protocol synthesis &lt;ref&gt;P. Zafiropulo, C. West, H. Rudin, D. Cowan, D. Brand : Towards analyzing and synthesizing protocols, IEEE Transactions on Communications ( Volume: 28, Issue: 4, Apr 1980 ) &lt;/ref&gt;: The user defines all message sending actions of the entities, and the tool derives all necessary reception actions (even if several messages are in transit).

* Synchronizing protocol &lt;ref&gt;M.G. Gouda and Y.T. Yu, Synthesis of communicating Finite State Machines with guaranteed progress, IEEE Trans. on Comm., vol. Com-32, No. 7, July 1984, pp. 779-788.&lt;/ref&gt;: The state transitions of one protocol entity are given by the user, and the method derives the behavior of the other entity such that it remains in states that correspond to the former entity.

* Protocol derived from service specification &lt;ref&gt;M.F. Al-hammouri and G.v. Bochmann, Realizability of service specifications, Proc. System Analysis and Modelling (SAM) conference 2018, Copenhagen, LNCS, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;: The service specification is given by the user and the method derives a suitable protocol for all entities.

* Protocol for control applications &lt;ref&gt;G. v. Bochmann, Using logic to solve the submodule construction problem, Journal on Discrete Event Dynamic Systems, Vol. 23 (1), Springer, March 2013, pp. 27-59.&lt;/ref&gt;: The specification of one entity (called the plant - which must be controlled) is given, and the method derives a specification of the other entity such that certain fail states of the plant are never reached and certain given properties of the plant's service interactions are satisfied. This is a case of [[supervisory control theory|supervisory control]].

'''Quantitative psychological research''' is defined as [[psychology|psychological]] research which performs [[mathematical modeling]] and [[statistical estimation]] or [[statistical inference]] or a means for testing objective theories by examining the relationship between variables.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|last=Creswell|first=J.|title=Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches|year=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first definition distinguishes it from [[qualitative psychological research]]; however, there has been a long debate on the difference between quantitative and qualitative research. It has been argued that because this debated has not found an end, the differences are enough that both quantitative and qualitative research is valuable in ways that both should be used in the gathering of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=K.|title=Quantitative versus Qualitative Research: An Attempt to Clarify the Issue|journal=Educational Researcher|date=March 1983|volume=12|issue=3|pages=6–13|jstor=1175144|doi=10.3102/0013189x012003006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[Statistics]] is widely used in quantitative psychological research. Typically a project begins with the collection of data based on a theory or hypothesis, followed by the application of descriptive or inferential statistical methods. Often it is necessary to collect a very large volume of data, which require validating, verifying and recording. Software packages such as [[SPSS]] and [[R (programming language)|R]] are typically used for this purpose, and for subsequent analysis. Causal relationships are studied by manipulating factors thought to influence the phenomena of interest while controlling other variables relevant to the experimental outcomes. Researchers might measure and study the relationship between education and measurable psychological effects, whilst controlling for other key variables. Quantitatively based surveys are widely used by psychologists, and statistics such as the proportion of respondents who display one or more psychological traits reported. In such surveys, respondents are asked a set of structured questions and their responses are tabulated. The software can then perform correlation analysis or other procedures on the data. Surveys are a common example of how statistics and quantitative research are utilized to gather data.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Quantitative research falls under the category of [[empirical studies]] (or [[statistical study|statistical studies]]). Research designs include experimental studies, quasi-experimental studies, pretest-postest designs, and others. Randomization, the control of variables, and valid, reliable measures are used to relate the results of the smaller subject pool to the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman, Benz|first=I., C.|title=Qualitative-Quantitative Research Methodology: Exploring the Interactive Continuum|year=1998|publisher=Southern Illinois University|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4473">'''Reduced Level''' in [[surveying]] refers to  equating  elevations of survey points  with reference to a common assumed datum. It is a vertical distance between survey point and adopted datum plane.&lt;ref name="Reduced Level"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whycos.org/fck_editor/upload/File/Pacific-HYCOS/Surface_Waters/Levelling_and_surveying.pdf | title=Reduced Level explanation | accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is considered as the base elevation which is used as reference to reckon heights or depths of other important places.&lt;ref&gt;Tides and Currents. http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datum_options.html&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced here means equating and Level means Elevations. Datum may be real or imaginary location with a nominated elevation of straight [[zero]].&lt;ref name="Reduced Level2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dlsweb.rmit.edu.au/toolbox/plumbing/toolbox12_01/units/cpcpdr4002a_stormwater/01_plan/page_003a.ht | title=Reduced Level definition | accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Datum used==
The most common and convenient datum which is internationally accepted is [[mean sea level]]. Countries take their nearby sea levels  as datum planes for calculations of Reduced levels . For example, [[Pakistan]] takes sea near [[Karachi]] as its datum while [[India]] takes sea near [[Mumbai]]  as its  datum for  calculation of Reduced levels of different places in their respective countries. The term Reduced Level is denoted shortly by ‘RL’. National survey departments of each country determines RL’s of significantly important locations or points. These points are called as ''permanent [[Benchmark (surveying)|benchmarks]]'' and this survey process is known as Great Trigonometrical Surveying (GTS). The permanent bench marks act  as reference points for determining RL’s of other locations in a particular country.&lt;ref name="Datum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.agriinfo.in/?page=topic&amp;superid=8&amp;topicid=54 | title=Datum of India and Pakistan | accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Datum2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_global_station.shtml?stnid=490-021 | title=Datum Surface | accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
The instruments used to determine reduced level include:-
* Optical Levelling instruments like Automatic Level, Y-Level, Dumpy level
and Coke’s reversible level. Anyone of these can be used at a time for the purpose.
* Levelling Staff.
* Tripod stand&lt;ref name="My Agricultural information bank."&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.agriinfo.in/?page=topic&amp;superid=8&amp;topicid=54 | title=Instruments used to determine reduced level | accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RL calculation==
RL of a survey point can be determined by two methods:-
# Height of Instrument method
# Rise and Fall method

==Significance==
# For drainage of [[water]] under [[gravity]] a suitable slope is required. Thus roads are built in the fashion that their RL’s on  sides  are comparatively smaller than the RL at the mid-span of the road. This ensures proper drainage of water from roads.
# To construct a buildings, roads, [[dams]] a horizontal  levelled surface is required. So, at construction sites, RLs of different points are obtained. The ground surface is then being levelled to the RL which is obtained by taking [[arithmetic mean]] of RLs of different points.&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite book | title=A text book of Surveying Vol. 1 | author=Dr. B.C Punmia and Ashok Kumar Jain. | chapter=Levelling | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5734">'''Robert Frodeman''' Professor and former Chair, Dept of [[Philosophy]] and Religion Studies, [[University of North Texas]], previously at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], is Director of UNT's Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity. A student of [[Alphonso Lingis]] and [[Stanley Rosen]], Frodeman works in the areas of [[environmental ethics]] and [[environmental philosophy]], the philosophy of geology, and the philosophy of science policy, and has written an extensive body of peer-reviewed academic work in these areas. Throughout his work he emphasizes the role that philosophy can play in addressing ongoing societal controversies such as [[acid mine drainage]], [[global climate change]], and [[Hurricane Katrina]]. His most recent work focuses on the theory and practice of interdisciplinary approaches to knowledge. Frodeman also is part of UNT's emphasis on 'field philosophy' where philosophers emphasize working with scientists, engineers, and policy makers rather than an extensive focus on writing and working with other philosophers.

As of the fall of 2008 Frodeman is the founding director of UNT's Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity (CSID). CSID focuses on identifying best practices for interdisciplinary research and education, and views the last 100 years of disciplinarity across the academy as breaking down under the pressure of complex problems and the overproduction of knowledge. Frodeman is also the editor of the Oxford Handbook of Interdisciplinarity (2010), second edition forthcoming 2015.

==Biography==
Frodeman attended [[St. Louis University]], where he gained degrees in History and Philosophy, [[Pennsylvania State University]], where he obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Philosophy]], and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], where he then obtained a [[Master's degree|M.S. degree]] in [[Geology]]. In the 1990s he consulted for the [[US Geological Survey]] on questions of science policy.

His research focuses on environmental philosophy and public policy and the theory and practice of interdisciplinary research and education. The UNT PhD program in Philosophy that he directs emphasizes 'field' approaches to philosophy where philosophers work with scientists, engineers, and policy makers.

He has written 100 articles, has authored or edited 10 books, and has held grants and awards totaling $2 million. From 2001 he directed the interdisciplinary project New Directions: Science, Humanities, Policy [http://www.ndsciencehumanitiespolicy.org/]—absorbed by CSID in 2008. CSID was closed in 2014.

It is distinct from bacteria that may cause [[infection]] in the glands. It differs from the oral microbiome which is located in the oral cavity.

== Characteristics ==
Unlike the [[uterine microbiome|uterine]], [[placental microbiome|placental]] and [[Vaginal flora|vaginal microbiome]]s, the types of organisms in the salivary microbiota remain relatively constant. There is no difference between populations of microbes of based upon [[sex|gender]], age, [[nutrition|diet]], [[obesity]], alcohol intake, race, or [[smoking|tobacco use]].&lt;ref name = Lind2016&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Salivary Microbiome in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and Its Association with Disease-Related Parameters: A Pilot Study|first1=Lisa|last1=Lindheim|first2=Mina|last2=Bashir|first3=Julia|last3=Münzker|first4=Christian|last4=Trummer|first5=Verena|last5=Zachhuber|first6=Thomas R.|last6=Pieber|first7=Gregor|last7=Gorkiewicz|first8=Barbara|last8=Obermayer-Pietsch|date=25 August 2016|publisher=|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=7 Central|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.01270|pmid=27610099|pmc=4996828}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Porphyromonas|''Porphyromonas,'']] ''[[Solobacterium]], [[Haemophilus]], [[Corynebacterium]], [[Cellulosimicrobium]], [[Streptococcus]]'' and ''[[Campylobacter]]'' are some of the genera found in the [[saliva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep22943|title=Preliminary analysis of salivary microbiome and their potential roles in oral lichen planus|first1=Kun|last1=Wang|first2=Wenxin|last2=Lu|first3=Qichao|last3=Tu|first4=Yichen|last4=Ge|first5=Jinzhi|last5=He|first6=Yu|last6=Zhou|first7=Yaping|last7=Gou|first8=Joy D Van|last8=Nostrand|first9=Yujia|last9=Qin|first10=Jiyao|last10=Li|first11=Jizhong|last11=Zhou|first12=Yan|last12=Li|first13=Liying|last13=Xiao|first14=Xuedong|last14=Zhou|date=10 March 2016|publisher=|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|issue=1|accessdate=6 May 2017|doi=10.1038/srep22943|pmid=26961389|pmc=4785528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic markers and diagnostic testing ==

"There is high diversity in the salivary microbiome within and between individuals, but little geographic structure. Overall, ∼13.5% of the total variance in the composition of genera is due to differences among individuals, which is remarkably similar to the fraction of the total variance in neutral genetic markers that can be attributed to differences among human populations."&lt;ref name="Nas2009"/&gt;

"[E]nvironmental variables revealed a significant association between the genetic distances among locations and the distance of each location from the equator. Further characterization of the enormous diversity revealed here in the human salivary microbiome will aid in elucidating the role it plays in human health and disease, and in the identification of potentially informative species for studies of human population history."&lt;ref name="Nas2009"/&gt;

Sixty new [[Genus|genera]] have been identified from the salivary glands. A total of 101 different genera were identified in the salivary glands. Out of these, 39 genera are not found in the oral microbiome. It is not known whether the resident species remain constant or change.&lt;ref name="Nas2009"/&gt;

Though the association between the salivary microbiome is similar to that of the oral microbiome, there also exists an association the salivary microbiome and the gut microbiome. Saliva sampling may be a non-invasive way to detect changes in the gut microbiome and changes in [[systemic disease]]. The association between the salivary microbiome those with [[Polycystic ovary syndrome|Polycistic Ovarian Syndrome]] has been characterized: "saliva microbiome profiles correlate with those in the stool, despite the fact that the bacterial communities in the two locations differ greatly. Therefore, saliva may be a useful alternative to stool as an indicator of bacterial [[dysbiosis]] in systemic disease."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2016.01270/full|title=The Salivary Microbiome in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and Its Association with Disease-Related Parameters: A Pilot Study|first1=Lisa|last1=Lindheim|first2=Mina|last2=Bashir|first3=Julia|last3=Münzker|first4=Christian|last4=Trummer|first5=Verena|last5=Zachhuber|first6=Thomas R.|last6=Pieber|first7=Gregor|last7=Gorkiewicz|first8=Barbara|last8=Obermayer-Pietsch|date=1 January 2016|publisher=|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=7|accessdate=6 May 2017|via=Frontiers|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.01270|pmid=27610099|pmc=4996828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sugar concentration in salivary secretions can vary. Blood sugar levels are reflected in salivary gland secretions. High salivary glucose (HSG) levels are a glucose concentration ≥ 1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/d, n = 175) and those with low salivary glucose (LSG) levels are &lt; 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/dL n = 2,537). Salivary gland secretions containing high levels of sugar change the oral microbiome and contributes to an environment that is conductive to the formation of dental caries and gingivitis.&lt;ref name="NasGood2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nascimento|first1=Marcelle|last2=Goodson|first2=J.

==Salivary glands==
[[File:Illu quiz hn 02.jpg|thumb|[[Salivary glands]]: 1.[[parotid gland|parotid]], 2.[[submandibular]], 3.[[sublingual]].]]
Organisms of the salivary microbiome reside in the three major [[salivary gland]]s: [[parotid gland|parotid]] [[submandibular gland|submandibular]], and [[sublingual gland|sublingual]]. These glands secrete [[electrolyte]]s, [[protein]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, genetic material, [[polysaccharide]]s, and other molecules. Most of these substances enter the salivary gland [[acinus]] and duct system from surrounding capillaries via the intervening tissue fluid, although some substances are produced within the glands themselves. The level of each salivary component varies considerably depending on the health status of the individual and the presence of pathogenic and commensal organisms.

The '''Scottish Ministerial Code''' applies to members of the [[Scottish Government]] (the First Minister, Cabinet Secretaries and Law Officers) and junior Scottish Ministers. The guidance is issued by the [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] and is a collection of standards around expected behaviours and responsibilities. Since 2008 there has been a mechanism for an independent review of any suspected breaches of the code.

==History==
Drafting of the new Scottish Ministerial Code was discussed at the first meeting of the Cabinet on 20 May 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/heritage/people-places/donald-dewar-s-cabinet-minutes-unveiled-1-3648391 |title=Donald Dewar's cabinet minutes unveiled |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=31 December 2014 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on a [[Ministerial Code|code]] used in [[Government of the United Kingdom|Whitehall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/jim-gallagher-time-to-crack-the-scottish-ministerial-code-1-2733388 |title=Time to crack the Scottish Ministerial Code |first=Jim |last= Gallagher |authorlink=Jim Gallagher (civil servant) |work=The Scotsman |date=12 January 2013 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first version was issued in August 1999.

The 2008 version introduced changes that specifically prohibited ministers from making misleading statements in the Parliament chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/outside-scrutiny-needed-to-keep-ministers-on-best-behaviour-1-1264050 |title=Outside scrutiny needed to keep ministers on best behaviour |first=Patrick |last=Harvie |authorlink=Patrick Harvie |work=The Scotsman |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 changes were made to allow Ministers to confirm whether they have received legal advice on a specific topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13412794.SNP_Government_changes_ethics_code_without_input_from_MSPs/ |title=SNP Government changes ethics code without input from MSPs |first=Paul |last=Hutcheon |work=[[The Sunday Herald]] |date=14 June 2015 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ministerial parliamentary aides were originally not able to sit on committees that provided scrutiny of their Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/ian-swanson-scottish-politics-1-943845 |title=Scottish Politics |first=Ian |last=Swanson |work=The Scotsman |date=28 February 2002 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This positions became known as Parliamentary Liaison Officers (PLOs) and the restriction was removed in 2007. In August 2016&lt;ref name="Herald 8Dec2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14952675.Sturgeon_to_toughen_Ministerial_Code_on_Holyrood_aides/ |title=First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to toughen Ministerial Code on Holyrood aides |first=Tom |last=Gordon |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow |date=8 December 2016 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement was introduced for PLOs to declare this on the first occasion that they took part in parliamentary business within the remit of their Cabinet Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.holyrood.com/articles/news/scottish-government-removes-ministerial-aides-committees-after-conflict-interest |title=Scottish Government removes ministerial aides from committees after 'conflict of interest' pressure |first=Tom |last=Freeman |work=[[Holyrood (magazine)|Holyrood]] |date=31 August 2016 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December this had been tightened up to extend to every occasion.&lt;ref name="Herald 8Dec2016"/&gt;

The February 2018 version contained new sections to guard against harassment, bullying and other such inappropriate behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/12318/scottish-ministerial-code-updated-clamp-down-harassment |title=Scottish ministerial code updated to clamp down on harassment |first=Caitlin |last=Logan |work=[[CommonSpace]] |date=9 February 2018 |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scrutiny==
In 2008 an independent Panel was created to review any concerns, with former Presiding Officers Lord [[David Steel]] and [[George Reid (Scottish politician)|George Reid]] appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14527259 |title=Lord Steel quits standards role over Supreme Court row |work=[[BBC News]] |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steel and Reid left their positions in mid-2011. Following this [[Peter Fraser, Baron Fraser of Carmyllie|Lord Peter Fraser]] and [[Dame Elish Angiolini]] were appointed. [[David Bell (university administrator)|David Bell]] was appointed in October 2012, then in 2013 [[James Hamilton (Director of Public Prosecutions)|James Hamilton]], a former Director of Public Prosecutions on Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13090578.Ministerial_code_role_for_ex_prosecutor/ |title=Ministerial code role for ex-prosecutor |work=The Herald |date=2 February 2013 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sphere of influence''' is a region around a [[supermassive black hole]] in which the [[gravitational potential]] of the black hole dominates the gravitational potential of the host [[galaxy]]. The radius of the sphere of influence is called the "(gravitational) influence radius".

There are two definitions in common use for the radius of the sphere of influence. The first&lt;ref name=Peebles&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peebles|first=J.|title=Star Distribution Near a Collapsed Object|journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=December 1972 | volume=178 | pages=371–376 | doi=10.1086/151797|bibcode = 1972ApJ...178..371P }}&lt;/ref&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;r_h = \frac{GM_{\rm BH}}{\sigma^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where M&lt;sub&gt;BH&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the black hole, ''σ'' is the stellar [[velocity dispersion]] of the host [[Bulge (astronomy)|bulge]], and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].
 
The second definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Merritt | first=David | authorlink=David Merritt |editor-first=Luis |editor-last=Ho |title=Coevolution of Black Holes and Galaxies | journal=Coevolution of Black Holes and Galaxies |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2004 |pages=263–275 |chapter=Single and Binary Black Holes and their Influence on Nuclear Structure | series=Carnegie Observatories Astrophysics Series | volume=1 | bibcode=2004cbhg.symp..263M | chapter-url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521824494#contributors|arxiv = astro-ph/0301257 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the radius at which the enclosed mass in stars equals twice M&lt;sub&gt;BH&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e.

&lt;math&gt;M_\star(r&lt;r_h) = 2 M_{\rm BH} &lt;/math&gt;.

Which definition is most appropriate depends on the physical question that is being addressed. The first definition takes into account the bulge's overall effect on the motion of a star, since &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is determined in part by stars that have moved far from the black hole. The second definition compares the force from the black hole to the local force from the stars.

It is a minimum requirement that the sphere of influence be well [[Angular resolution|resolved]] in order that the mass of the black hole be determined dynamically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ferrarese | first = Laura | last2 = Ford | first2 = Holland

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rotational influence sphere==
If the black hole is rotating, there is a second radius of influence associated with the rotation.&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=D.|authorlink=David Merritt |title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|date=2013|page=284|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9781400846122|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the radius inside of which the [[Lense-Thirring precession|Lense-Thirring torques]] from the black hole are larger than the Newtonian torques between stars. Inside the rotational influence sphere, stellar orbits [[precession|precess]] at approximately the Lense-Thirring rate; while outside this sphere, orbits evolve predominantly in response to perturbations from stars on other orbits. Assuming that the [[Sagittarius A*|Milky Way black hole]] is maximally rotating, its rotational influence radius is about 0.001 parsec,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Merritt |first=David | authorlink=David Merritt |last2=Alexander |first2=Tal |last3=Mikkola | first3 = Seppo | last4=Will | first4=Clifford |date= 2010|title=Testing properties of the Galactic center black hole using stellar orbits |journal=Physical Review D |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=062002 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.81.062002| name-list-format=vanc |arxiv = 0911.4718 |bibcode = 2010PhRvD..81f2002M }}&lt;/ref&gt; while its radius of gravitational influence is about 3 parsecs.

The '''Tharrawaddy Min Bell''' ({{lang-my|သာယာဝတီမင်း ခေါင်းလောင်းတော်}}), also known as the '''Maha Tissada Gandha Bell''', is a large [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] located at the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] in [[Yangon]], [[Myanmar]] (Burma). It was donated in 1841 by [[Tharrawaddy Min|King Tharrawaddy]], of [[Konbaung Dynasty]]. The official [[Pali]] name of the bell is Maha Tissada Gandha, which means "Great Three-toned Sweet Sound".&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.mm/books?id=NWJI4bK9kQ8C&amp;pg=PT233&amp;lpg=PT233&amp;dq=Tharrawaddy+Min+bell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KTaaw_VbAd&amp;sig=yJiRpgw4T3ASZathHCiIKb2MC7I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9xFBU_CeM8uCrgeRz4CoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Tharrawaddy%20Min%20bell&amp;f=false |title=Asian Art - MobileReference - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.mm |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sacred-destinations1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/burma/yangon-shwedagon-pagoda |title=Shwedagon Pagoda - Yangon, Burma |publisher=Sacred-destinations.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History of the Shwedagon Pagoda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shwedagon.org/history.php |title=History of the Shwedagon Pagoda |publisher=Shwedagon.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="towerbells1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towerbells.org/data/APGreatBellsO.html |title=Great Bells - Asia and the Pacific Rim |publisher=Towerbells.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''urban planner''' is a professional who practices in the field of [[urban planning]]. 

An urban planner may focus on a specific area of practice and have a title such as city planner, town planner, regional planner, long-range planner, transportation planner, infrastructure planner, environmental planner, parks planner, physical planner, health planner, planning analyst, urban designer, community development director, economic development specialist or other similar combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning Specializations|url=https://www.planning.org/choosingplanning/specializations/|website=Choosing the Planning Profession|publisher=American Planning Association|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Job Titles - Urban and land use planners (NOC 2153-A)|url=https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/job_titles-eng.do;jsessionid=755C0BE610A7CF0F664ADE37A76DE867.imnav4?area=9219&amp;lang=eng&amp;noc=2153&amp;backurl=%2Freport-eng.do%3Farea%3D9219%26lang%3Deng%26noc%3D2153|website=National Occupational Classification 2011 -ESDC|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An international association of planning professionals - ISOCARP - was established in 1965 in the Netherlands and currently has about 700 members in more than 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home - ISOCARP|url = http://isocarp.org/|website = ISOCARP|access-date = 2018-10-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home - Wikipedia/ISOCARP|url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISOCARP|website = Wikipedia|access-date = 2018-10-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities==
{{see also|Planning permission}}
The responsibilities of an urban planner vary between [[jurisdictions]], and sometimes within jurisdictions. The following is therefore a general description of the responsibilities of an urban planner, of which an urban planner may well typically practice two or more of. An urban planner may also specialize in one responsibility only.
 
===Land use planning===

Urban planners specializing in [[land use planning]] are predominantly concerned with the regulation of [[land use]], [[Land development|development]] and [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]], with the intent of achieving the desired urban planning outcome.

Regulation of land use and development is achieved via the drafting and adoption of planning instruments designed to influence the land use and built form goals of the jurisdiction. The planning instruments take the form of legislation and policy, and have a wide variety of terms across jurisdictions including [[Primary and secondary legislation|acts and regulations]], rules, [[Code of law|codes]], schemes, plans, policies, and manuals; and often a combination of some of these. The planning instruments often spatially zone land or reserve the land for certain purposes, presented in the form of a [[Zoning|zoning map or plan]]. The urban planner is tasked with preparing planning instruments and zoning plans. Further, given urban development is rarely static and the goals of urban planning change from time to time, the urban planner will be responsible for continuously maintaining planning instruments and zoning plans to ensure they are kept up-to-date.

Consultation with the community and other stakeholders is generally desired by urban planners in most jurisdictions when planning instruments are prepared and updated. The level of consultation will vary depending on the project.

The urban planner will also be responsible for implementing the planning instruments. This is achieved through a permit process, where the proponent of a proposed development, a change in land use, or the proposed subdivision of an allotment will be required to obtain a permit, approval, licence, or consent for the proposed development or change of use. An urban planner will be tasked with considering the proposal and determining whether it complies with the intent and the specific provisions of the applicable planning instruments and zoning plans. Depending on the jurisdiction, the urban planner may have authority to determine the proposal; otherwise the planner will present a recommendation to the decision-maker, often a panel of non-planners (for example, the elected council of a local government).

While concerned with future development, an urban planner will occasionally be responsible for investigating development or land use which had been undertaken without authorization. In many jurisdictions urban planners can require that unauthorized land use cease and unauthorized development is returned to its predevelopment condition; or alternatively retrospectively approve the unauthorized development or land use.

===Strategic urban planning===

In order to plan effectively for long term development and growth, an urban planner will be responsible for the preparation of a strategic plan (also known in different jurisdictions by names such as [[development plan]], [[Core strategy document|core strategy]], [[Comprehensive planning|comprehensive plan]], planning strategy, [[structure plan]], etc.). Strategic urban planning sets the high-level goals and growth principles for a jurisdiction, which will in turn inform the preparation and amendment of the legal planning instruments within that jurisdiction.

===Regional planning===
{{main|Regional planning}}
Regional planning deals with the planning of land use, infrastructure and settlement growth over a geographical area which extends to a whole city or beyond. In this sense, the urban planner's role is to consider urban planning at a macro scale. Regional planning is not concerned with planning at the local (neighborhood) level.

===Heritage and conservation===

An urban planner may be responsible for identifying, protecting and [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conserving / restoring]] buildings and places which are identified by a community as having [[cultural heritage]] significance. This may include the task of compiling and maintaining a [[heritage register]], finding and making available incentives for encouraging conservation works, and the consideration of proposals to redevelop or use a heritage-listed place.

===Urban renewal===

As urban areas decline, an urban planner may be tasked with preparing a plan for the redevelopment of an urban area. Such plans are not limited to an individual development site, but rather encompass a locality or district over which an urban renewal (or redevelopment) plan is prepared.

Urban renewal often relies on obtaining funding from government sources to assist in the regeneration of an area; the funding may be used for a variety of purposes such as improvement of public roads, parks and other public spaces, development of infrastructure, and acquisition of land. The urban planner will be responsible for costing an urban renewal plan and obtaining funding for infrastructure works necessary to implement the urban renewal plan.

The urban planner for an urban renewal project will need to liaise closely with stakeholders during the preparation and implementation of the plan, including government agencies, landowners and community groups.

===Master planning===

A master plan will be prepared for many [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] development projects. The purpose of a master plan is to plan for the ultimate spatial layout of the land uses for a future development area. A master plan will consider the required infrastructure to service the development and determine the need and location of urban amenities including commercial and industrial land, community facilities, schools, parks, public transport, major roads, and land uses, both within and outside the master plan area, and consider the staging of development of a master planned area.

The urban planner will be responsible for coordinating the various professional consultant inputs, and to lay out the master plan infrastructure and land uses. It will often be necessary for the urban planner to consult with landowners and government agencies affected by the master plan.

===Transportation planning===

An urban planner may be responsible for planning for [[transport]] facilities and infrastructure in urban and inter-regional areas.

===Economic development===

An urban planner's responsibility may extend to economic development. In this sense, an urban planner may be responsible for identifying opportunities for [[economic growth]], and encourage [[investment]] in an area.

===Environmental planning===

An urban planner may be concerned with the impact of land use, development and subdivision on the [[Natural resource|natural environment]] including land, water, flora, and fauna, to achieve [[sustainable]] outcomes.

===Urban design===

An urban planner will develop the design of public spaces (streets, squares, parks, etc.) and the relationship between built form and public spaces. Depending on the country and planner's training they may work with other design professionals such as civil engineers, architects or landscape architects to complete and construct the design.

===Infrastructure planning===

An urban planner may be required to plan for the future provision of [[public works]] [[infrastructure]] such as [[water supply]], [[sewerage]], [[electricity]], [[telecommunications]], and [[transport]] infrastructure, and community infrastructure including [[schools]], [[hospitals]] and [[parks]].

==Education and training==

''See [[Urban planning education]] for a discussion of this topic.''

Urban Planning as a profession is a relatively young discipline. Few government agencies restrict or license the profession. As a result, a number of other related disciplines actively claim to have the training, expertise and professional scope to practice urban planning. While organizations such as the [[American Planning Association]], the [[Canadian Institute of Planners]] and the [[Royal Town Planning Institute]] certify professional planners, others in related fields like [[Landscape Architecture]] also claim to have professional autonomy in urban planning. Efforts internationally have attempted to define the role of urban planners through licensure acts. The State of [[New Jersey]] licenses Professional Planners. The Canadian Provinces of Ontario and Alberta protect the title of [[Registered Professional Planner]] to only those who have an accredited CIP education and experience or equivalent.

==Urban planners by nation==

===Canada===

Urban planners in Canada usually hold bachelor's degrees in planning or a master's degree, typically accredited as an M.Pl, MUP (Master of Urban Planning) MCP (Master of City Planning), MScPl, MES (Master of Environmental Studies) or simply an MA.

===Greece===

Urban planners in [[Greece]] typically graduate from  [[Engineering]] faculties. [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] and [[University of Thessaly]] are the two universities that provide undergraduate studies in [[urban planning]] in [[Greece]].

===India===

Though planning is not a recognized profession under Indian law, the profession began in 1941 with the [[School of Planning and Architecture]] as a Department of Architecture of Delhi College of Engineering now the [[Delhi Technological University]]. It was later integrated with the School of Town and Country Planning which was established in 1955 by the [[Government of India]] to provide facilities for rural, urban and regional planning. On integration, the school was renamed as School of Planning and Architecture in 1959. Today, it is one of the premier schools of pursuing planning studies at bachelor, masters and post doctorate levels.

The [http://itpi.org.in/content/default.aspx Institute of Town Planners, India] (ITPI), set up on the lines of the [[Royal Town Planning Institute]] in [[London]] is the body representing planning professionals in India. A small group formed itself into an Indian Board of Town Planners which after three years of continuous work formed the ITPI. The institute, which was established in July 1951, today, has a membership of over 2800, apart from a sizable number of student members, many of whom have qualified Associateship Examination (AITP) conducted by ITPI. As of 2012, the institute has 21 regional chapters across India.
School of Planning and Architecture(SPA),Delhi is one of the premier institute in dissemination knowledge of Architecture and Planning in India. It was established in 1941.In 1979, the Government of India, through the then Ministry of Education and Culture, conferred on the School of Planning and Architecture the status of "Deemed to be a University"(http://spa.ac.in/Home.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f)
[[School of Planning and Architecture-Bhopal]] (M.P.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spabhopal.ac.in/&lt;/ref&gt; and School of Planning and Architecture-Vijayawada established in year 2008 by Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India.
Centre for Environment Planning and Technology (CEPT) University [http://cept.ac.in] in Ahmedabad and Malaviya National Institute of Technology (NIT) Jaipur, Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (N.I.T) in Bhopal along with NIT Patna are one of the pioneering Institutes in India where urban planning is taught.

===Israel===

The [[Israel Planners Association]] was founded in 1965. Urban planning is taught by the [[Technion]] [http://architecture.technion.ac.il/en/ Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning] in [[Haifa]] and the [http://curs.net.technion.ac.il/ Center for Urban and Regional Studies].

===Mexico===

Urban planners in Mexico typically graduate from an Architecture background provided by major universities in the country. Most of such degrees can be awarded at Masters' graduate studies, although there are also bachelor's degrees available.

===New Zealand===

A planner brings professional expertise and knowledge to the development and implementation of policy in the interests of productive, liveable and sustainable environments. Planners support communities and provide leadership in making informed choices about the consequences of human actions and in bridging the gap between the present and the future. Planners must consider and balance a range of strategic, policy, technical, legal, administrative, community and environmental factors in their contributions to informed decision-making.

Planners are employed in diverse public and private roles. They use their knowledge and experience in various institutional and community settings to provide leadership, undertake research, solve problems, evaluate alternatives and outcomes, manage change, and envision, advise on and enact desirable future directions.

In applying their expertise, planners must be aware of and responsive to cultural, social, economic, environmental, ethical and political values. In New Zealand, these include the bicultural mandate for planning, including the partnership relationships established by the Treaty of Waitangi/te Tiriti o Waitangi, and New Zealand’s increasingly multicultural society.

A key attribute of a planner is the ability to work across disciplinary and institutional boundaries and to integrate knowledge from a range of disciplines within the distinctive framework of the discipline of planning.

A professional planner is someone who has gained a professional qualification through tertiary study, continues to learn post qualification, undertakes continuing professional development, is a member or is working towards becoming a member of the [http://www.planning.org.nz/ New Zealand Planning Institute (NZPI)], contributes to the planning profession, and is committed to upholding the principles and ethical practices of the planning profession.

===Nigeria===

In [[Nigeria]], the [[Nigerian Institute of Town Planners]] (NITP) and the [[Town Planners Registration Council]] (TOPREC) are the leading bodies tasked with the responsibility of improving the training, education and professional practice of planning in Nigeria.

To be a town planner in Nigeria, first must complete a degree in Urban and regional planning or a relevant discipline and then complete a final year in the form of a masters in Urban and regional planning  which must be accredited by the [[Town Planners Registration Council]] (TOPREC ), or a four-year degree encapsulating all aspects. they can then become eligible to be a member of the [[Nigerian Institute of Town Planners]] (NITP), but must first complete two years work based training, to be a full member, and subsequently register and sit for the TOPREC professional examination, to become a registered town planner.

===South Africa===

The [[South African Council for Planners]] ([http://www.sacplan.org.za SACPLAN]) is the statutory Council of nominated members appointed in terms of the Planning Profession Act, 2002 (Act 36 of 2002) by the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform (Department of Rural Development and Land Reform) to regulate the Planning Profession(Planning is both the organizational process of creating and maintaining a plan) in terms of the Act. The Planning Profession Principles applies to all registered planners. The SACPLAN through the Act assures quality in the planning profession through the identification of planning profession work that only registered planners can undertake. The functions of the SACPLAN are contained in Section 7 of the Act. The powers and duties of the SACPLAN are contained in Section 8 of the Act. The Act further prescribes a Professional Code of Conduct for registered planners &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacplan.org.za|title=SACPLAN - SACPLAN|author=Administrator|work=sacplan.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Planners in the U.S. typically complete an undergraduate or graduate degree from a university offering the program of study.  Professional certification is only offered through the [[American Institute of Certified Planners]] (AICP), a branch of the [[American Planning Association]].  To gain AICP certification, a planner must meet specific educational and experience requirements, as well as pass an exam covering the nature and practice of the discipline.  Although AICP certification is not required to be a practicing planner, it does serve as a means in which a planner can verify his or her professional expertise.

===Palestine===
Planners in Palestine took responsibility after the Palestinian Authority took governance in the West Bank and Gaza- Palestine. Planners have been trained by a Norwegian consultants As Plan Viak at the very beginning as part of the institutional capacity training project funded by the Norwegian Government. Both Birzeit and Alanjah Universities run bachelor and master degree in planning and planners could specialized in different fields.
