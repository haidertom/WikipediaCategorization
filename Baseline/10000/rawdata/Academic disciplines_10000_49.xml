      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11606">'''4D BIM''', an acronym for 4D [[Building Information Modeling]] and a term widely used in the [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] industry, refers to the intelligent linking of individual [[3D CAD]] components or assemblies with time- or schedule-related information.&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-01/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mills|first1=Fred|title=What is 4D BIM?|url=http://www.theb1m.com/video/what-is-4d-bim|website=www.TheB1M.com|publisher=The B1M Limited|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;The use of the term 4D is intended to refer to the fourth dimension: time, i.e. 4D is 3D plus schedule (time).&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-02/&gt; 

The construction of the 4D models enables the various participants (from architects, designers, contractors to clients) of a construction project, to visualize the entire duration of a series of events and display the progress of construction activities through the lifetime of the project.&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-03/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-04/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-05/&gt; This BIM-centric approach towards project management technique has a very high potential to improve the project management and delivery of construction project, of any size or complexity.

==History==
In 1998, Sir [[John Egan (industrialist)|John Egan]], in his report ''[[Egan Report|Rethinking Construction]]'',&lt;ref name=Egan&gt;Egan, J. (1998) ''Rethinking Construction: Report of the Construction Task Force'', London: HMSO. (Copy of report available on Constructing Excellence website: [http://www.constructingexcellence.org.uk/pdf/rethinking%20construction/rethinking_construction_report.pdf report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108223227/http://www.constructingexcellence.org.uk/pdf/rethinking%20construction/rethinking_construction_report.pdf |date=2011-11-08 }}. Accessed: 8 September 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that certain principles and management techniques could successfully cross-over from other industries like manufacturing to serve the project delivery demands of the construction industry. The Egan Report cited "Technology as a Tool":

:"One area in which we know new technology to be a very useful tool is in the design of buildings and their components, and in the exchange of design information throughout the construction team. There are enormous benefits to be gained, in terms of eliminating waste and rework for example, from using modern CAD technology to prototype buildings and by rapidly exchanging information on design changes. Redesign should take place on computer, not on the construction site."

4D BIM adds a new dimension (time) to 3D CAD or solid modelling, it enables a sequence of events to be depicted visually on a time line that has been populated by a 3D model (augmenting traditional Gantt charts and Critical Path (CPM) schedules often used in project management).&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-16/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-17/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-19/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-20/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-21/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-22/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-23/&gt; Construction sequences can be reviewed as a series of problems using 4D BIM, enabling users to explore options, manage solutions and optimize results. It enables construction product development, collaborative and transparent project implementation, partnering with the supply chain and production of components, and is in keeping with Egan's vision: "sustained improvement should then be delivered through use of techniques for eliminating waste and increasing value for the customer."

As an advanced construction management technique, it is increasingly used by project delivery teams working on larger projects.&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-08/&gt; For example, it is used in the construction of projects including tall buildings, bridges, highways, tunnels, university campuses and hospital complexes, luxury residential, residential and infrastructure such as courthouses, levee systems, hydro-electric power generation stations, mining and industrial process facilities. 4D BIM has traditionally been used for higher end projects due to the associated costs, but technologies are now emerging that allow the process to be used by laymen or to drive processes such as manufacture.&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-14/&gt;

'''Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles''' (also called '''AP CSP''') is an [[AP Computer Science]] course and examination offered by the [[College Board]] to [[high school]] students as an opportunity to earn college credit for a [[college]]-level [[computer science]] course. '''AP Computer Science Principles'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-principles AP Computer Science Principles Home Page], The College Board&lt;/ref&gt; is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester course in computer science. Assessment for AP Computer Science Principles is divided into two parts, both an end of course exam as well as the creation of artifacts throughout the course.&lt;ref name="apstudent.collegeboard.org"&gt;[https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-principles/about-the-exam AP Computer Science Principles About The Exam Page], The College Board&lt;/ref&gt;

The AP Computer Science Principles Exam was administered for the first time on May 5, 2017.

==Topic Outline==
'''Curriculum Overview'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-curriculum-framework.pdf |title=AP Computer Science Principles: Curriculum Framework 2016-2017 |format=PDF |pages=2–3 |publisher=College Board |date=Fall 2010 |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The framework focuses on computational thinking practices which are applied throughout the curriculum. The concept outline included in the curriculum is divided into seven units called "Big Ideas". Each unit contains a series of "Learning Objectives". Each "Learning Objective" is a general benchmark of student performance or understanding which has an associated "Enduring Understanding". An "Enduring Understanding" is a core comprehension which students should retain well after completing the course. Each "Learning Objective" is split into multiple "Essential Knowledge" standards, which are specific facts or content which the student must know to demonstrate mastery of the  learning objective when assessed.

{{italic title}}
'''''Acta Eruditorum''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "reports/acts of the scholars") was the first [[scientific journal]] of [[Germany|the German lands]], published from 1682 to 1782.&lt;ref name="aeinfo"&gt;[http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/publications/journals/ActaEruditorum.html Information on Acta ''Eruditorum'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Acta Eruditorum'' was founded in 1682 in [[Leipzig]] by [[Otto Mencke]], who became its first editor, and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].&lt;ref name="aeinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''[http://runeberg.org/nfbp/0055.html Leibniz]''', article in ''[[Nordisk Familjebok]]'', 2nd ed. (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; It was published by [[Johann Friedrich Gleditsch]], and patterned after the French ''[[Journal des savants]]'' and Italian ''Giornale de'letterati''. ''Acta Eruditorum'' was a monthly publication edited in Latin language and contained excerpts from new writings, reviews, small essays and notes. Most of them were devoted to the [[natural sciences]] and mathematics. Since its inception many eminent scientists published there – apart from Leibniz, e.g., [[Jakob Bernoulli]], [[Humphry Ditton]], [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus]], [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Jérôme Lalande]] but also humanists and philosophers such as [[Veit Ludwig von Seckendorff]], [[Stephan Bergler]], [[Christian Thomasius]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]].

Although Mencke once exchanged letters and publications with [[Isaac Newton]], Newton was not a correspondent of ''Acta''.&lt;ref&gt;H. Laeven, ''The "Acta Eruditorum" under the Editorship of Otto Mencke. The History of an International Learned Journal between 1682 and 1707'', trans. L. Richards, Amsterdam: APA-Holland University Press, 1990, p. 158, 202&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute between Newton and Leibniz over credit for the development of differential calculus started with a contribution by Leibniz to the May 1697 issue of ''Acta Eruditorum'', in response to which [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier|Fatio de Duillier]], feeling slighted by being omitted from Leibniz's list of the best mathematicians of Europe, announced that Newton had discovered calculus before Leibniz and the last had probably even relied on Newton's achievements. In the following acrimonious squabble, ''Acta'' by and large acted as a mouthpiece for Leibniz's camp, much as ''[[Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' did for Newton's. Mencke tried to tone down the dispute, but rebuttals from both sides were too forceful. "Where Mencke was powerless to call the tune, he did his utmost at least to set the tone," says H. Laeven in his description of the row.&lt;ref&gt;H. Laeven, ''The "Acta Eruditorum" under the Editorship of Otto Mencke. The History of an International Learned Journal between 1682 and 1707'', trans. L. Richards, Amsterdam: APA-Holland University Press, 1990, p. 177-178&lt;/ref&gt; This dispute also influenced ''Acta'' to express the feelings of national cohesion and defining German scholarship within the international field of influence.&lt;ref&gt;H. Laeven, ''The "Acta Eruditorum" under the Editorship of Otto Mencke. The History of an International Learned Journal between 1682 and 1707'', trans. L. Richards, Amsterdam: APA-Holland University Press, 1990, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Otto Mencke]]'s death ''Acta Eruditorum'' were directed by his son, Johann Burckhardt Mencke, who died in 1732. The journal changed its name by then and was called ''Nova Acta Eruditorum''. Since 1756 it was led by Karl Andreas Bel.

Throughout history, forms of [[art]] have gone through periodic abrupt changes called '''artistic revolutions'''.  Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways.  See also [[cultural movement]]s.

== Artistic revolution and political revolutions ==

The role of [[fine art]] has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful. So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society's changes due not to any prescience, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their talent of seeing.

Artists who succeeded enough to portray visions that future generations could live to see, often had to navigate an often treacherous path between their own capacity to see and execute what lesser artists could not, while still appealing to powerful patrons who could finance their visions. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 17th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;

No art owes quite as much to state power as French painting does. It was in the age of absolute monarchy launched by Louix XIV in the 17th century that the likes of Poussin and Le Brun put France in the forefront of European art. Versailles found its stately mirror in the powerful idea of classicism – a painting style, enduring in later artists like Ingres, whose austerity and grandeur express the authority of a world where Jove is very much in his throne.&lt;ref&gt;jonathanjonesblog&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of revolutionary art in conjunction with cultural and political movements:

*[[Trotskyist]] &amp; [[Diego Rivera]]
*[[Black Panther Party]] &amp; [[Emory Douglas]]
*Cuban [[Poster art]]
*[[Social realism]] &amp; [[Ben Shahn]]
*[[Feminist art]] &amp; the [[Guerrilla Girls]]
*[[Industrial Workers of the World]] &amp; [[Woody Guthrie]]

== Artistic revolution of style ==

[http://www.art-head-start.com/3d/squid/revolution300.jpg Here] is an example of an Artistic Revolution Pieces

== Scientific and Technological ==

Not all artistic revolutions were political. Sometimes, science and technological innovations have brought about unforeseen transformations in the works of artists.  The stylistic revolution known as [[Impressionism]],  by painters eager to more accurately capture the changing colors of light and shadow, is inseparable from discoveries and inventions in the mid-19th century in which the style was born.

[[Eugene Chevreul]], a French chemist hired as director of dyes at a French tapestry works,  began to investigate the optical nature of color in order to improve color in fabrics.  Chevreul realized It was the eye, and not the dye, that had the greatest influence on color, and from this, he revolutionized color theory by grasping what came to be called the law of simultaneous contrast: that colors mutually influence one another when juxtaposed, each imposing its own complementary color on the other.  The French painter Eugène Delacroix, who had been experimenting with what he called broken tones,  embraced Chevreul's book, "The Law of Contrast of Color (1839) with its explanations of how juxtaposed colors can enhance or diminish each other, and his exploration of all the visible colors of the spectrum.  Inspired by Chevreul’s 1839 treatise, Delacroix passed his enthusiasm on to the young artists who were inspired by him. It was Chevreul who led the Impressionists to grasp that they should apply separate brushstrokes of pure color to a canvas and allow the viewer’s eye to combine them optically.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Eugene-Chevreul&lt;/ref&gt;

They were aided greatly in this by innovations in oil paint itself. Since the Renaissance,  painters had to grind pigment, add oil and thus create their own paints; these time-consuming paints also quickly dried out, making studio painting a necessity for large works, and limiting painters to mix one or two colors at a time and fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out.  in 1841, a little-known American painter named John G. Rand invented a simple improvement without which the Impressionist movement could not have occurred: the small, flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be stored.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/never-underestimate-the-power-of-a-paint-tube-36637764/?no-ist, May 2013, by Perry Hurt&lt;/ref&gt;   Oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist and usable -- and quite portable. For the first time since the Renaissance, painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried.

Paints in tubes could be easily loaded up and carried out into the real world,  to directly observe the play of color and natural light, in shadow and movement, to paint in the moment.  Selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments -  chrome yellow, cadmium blue - invented by 19th century industrial chemists. The tubes freed the Impressionists to paint quickly, and across an entire canvas, rather than carefully delineated single-color sections at a time; in short, to sketch directly in oil - racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of "impressionists" - since such speedy, bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions, not finished paintings, which were to have no visible brush marks at all, seamless under layers of varnish.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir said, “Without colors in tubes, there would be no Cézanne, no Monet, no Pissarro, and no Impressionism.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/never-underestimate-the-power-of-a-paint-tube-36637764/#P4ovFKfbRLyMIhQT.99&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the careful, hyper-realistic techniques of French neo-classicism were seen as stiff and lifeless when compared to the remarkable new vision of the world as seen through the new invention of photography by the mid-1850s.  It was not merely that the increasing ability of this new invention, particularly by the French inventor Daguerre, made the realism of the painted image redundant as he deliberately competed in the Paris diorama with large-scale historical paintings.&lt;ref&gt;"Speculating Daguerre: Art and Enterprise in the Work of L. J. M. Daguerre" by Stephen C. Pinson, Chicago, (2012) p. 1-12&lt;/ref&gt;  The neo-classical subject matter,  limited by Academic tradition to Greek and Roman legends, historical battles and Biblical stories, seemed oppressively cliched and limited to artists eager to explore the actual world in front of their own eyes revealed by the camera - daily life, candid groupings of everyday people doing simple things, Paris itself, rural landscapes and most particularly the play of captured light -  not the imaginary lionizing of unseen past events.&lt;ref&gt;Review of "The Lens of Impressionism," at University of Michigan Museum of Art, October- Dec. 2009 by Simon Kelly, Volume 9, Issue 1 Spring 2010, http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/spring10/the-lens-of-impressionism&lt;/ref&gt; Early photographs influenced Impressionist style by its use of asymmetry, cropping and most obviously the blurring of motion, as inadvertently captured in the very slow speeds of early photography.

 [[Edgar Degas]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]  - in their framing, use of color, light and shadow, subject matter  - put these innovations to work to create a new language of visual beauty and meaning.

== Faking revolution: the C.I.A. and Abstract Expressionism ==

Their initial break with realism into an exploration of light, color and the nature of paint was brought to an ultimate conclusion by the  [[Abstract Expressionists]] who broke away from recognizable content of any kind into works of pure shape, color and painterliness which emerged at the end of the second world war.  At first thought of as primitive, inept works - as in "my four year old could do that"—these works were misunderstood and neglected until given critical and support by the rise of art journalists and critics who championed their work in the 1940s and 50's,  expressing the power of such work in aesthetic terms the artists themselves seldom used, or even understood.  [[Jackson Pollock]] who pioneered splatter painting, dispensing with a paint brush altogether, soon became lionized as the angry young man in a large spread in Life Magazine.

In fact, in a deliberate, secret and successful effort to separate artistic revolutions from political ones,  abstract expressionists like Pollack, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko, while seemingly difficult, pathbreaking artists, were in fact secretly supported for twenty years by the C.I.A. in a Cold War policy begun in 1947 to prove that the United States could foster more artistic freedom than the Soviet bloc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html&lt;/ref&gt;  "It was recognized that Abstract Expressionism was the kind of art that made Socialist Realism look even more stylized and rigid and confined than it was, " said former C.I.A. case worker Donald Jameson, who finally broke the silence on this program in 1995.  Ironically, the covert C.I.A. support for these radical works was required because an attempt to use government funds for a European tour of these works during the Truman administration led to a public uproar in conservative McCarthy-era America, with Truman famously remarking, "If that's art, I'm a Hottentot."  Thus the program was hidden under the guise of fabricated foundations and the support of wealthy patrons who were actually using C.I.A. funds, not their own, to sponsor traveling exhibitions of American abstract expressionists all over the world, publish books and articles praising them and to purchase and exhibit Abstract Expressionist works in major American and British museums. Thomas Braden, in charge of these cultural programs for the C.I.A.. in the early years of the Cold War, had formerly been executive secretary of the Museum of Modern Art, America's leading institution for 20th Century art and the charges of collusion between the two echoed for many years after this program was revealed, though most of the artists involved had no idea they were being used in this way and were furious when they found out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/17/unpopular-front&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic Movements ==

=== [[Art in ancient Greece|Ancient &amp; Classical Art]] ===
Key dates: 15000 BCE / 400 BCE-200CE / 350 CE-450CE&lt;br /&gt;
Ancient - There are few remaining examples with early art often favouring drawing over colour. Work has been found recently in tombs, Egyptian frescoes, pottery and metalwork.&lt;br /&gt;
Classical - Relating to or from ancient Roman or Greek architecture and art. Mainly concerned with geometry and symmetry rather than individual expression.&lt;br /&gt;
Byzantine - A religious art characterised by large domes, rounded arches and mosaics from the eastern Roman Empire in the 4th Century.&lt;ref name=artmovements&gt;http://www.artmovements.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Gothic architecture|Medieval &amp; Gothic]]===
Key dates: 400CE&lt;br /&gt;
Medieval - A highly religious art beginning in the 5th Century in Western Europe. It was characterised by iconographic paintings illustrating scenes from the bible.&lt;br /&gt;
Gothic - This style prevailed between the 12th century and the 16th century in Europe. Mainly an architectural movement, Gothic was characterised by its detailed ornamentation most noticeably the pointed archways and elaborate rib vaulting.&lt;br /&gt;
First developed in France, Gothic was intended as a solution to the inadequacies of Romanesque architecture. It allowed for cathedrals to be built with thinner walls and it became possible to introduce stained glass windows instead of traditional mosaic decorations. Some of the finest examples of the style include the cathedrals of Chartres, Reims and Amiens. The term was also used to describe sculpture and painting that demonstrated a greater degree of naturalism.&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Renaissance]]===
Key dates: 14th century&lt;br /&gt;
This movement began in Italy in the 14th century and the term, literally meaning rebirth, describes the revival of interest in the artistic achievements of the Classical world. Initially in a literary revival Renaissance was determined to move away from the religion-dominated Middle Ages and to turn its attention to the plight of the individual man in society. It was a time when individual expression and worldly experience became two of the main themes of Renaissance art. The movement owed a lot to the increasing sophistication of society, characterised by political stability, economic growth and cosmopolitanism. Education blossomed at this time, with libraries and academies allowing more thorough research to be conducted into the culture of the antique world. In addition, the arts benefited from the patronage of such influential groups as the Medici family of Florence, the Sforza family of Milan and Popes Julius II and Leo X. The works of Petrarch first displayed the new interest in the intellectual values of the Classical world in the early 14th century and the romance of this era as rediscovered in the Renaissance period can be seen expressed by Boccaccio. Leonardo da Vinci was the archetypal Renaissance man representing the humanistic values of the period in his art, science and writing. Michelangelo and Raphael were also vital figures in this movement, producing works regarded for centuries as embodying the classical notion of perfection. Renaissance architects included Alberti, Brunelleschi and Bramante. Many of these artists came from Florence and it remained an important centre for the Renaissance into the 16th century eventually to be overtaken by Rome and Venice. Some of the ideas of the Italian Renaissance did spread to other parts of Europe, for example to the German artist Albrecht Dürer of the 'Northern Renaissance'. But by the 16th century Mannerism had overtaken the Renaissance and it was this style that caught on in Europe. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, Filippo Brunelleschi, Raphael da Urbino, Titian, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Donatello Bardi.&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Mannerism]]===
Key dates: 1520-1600&lt;br /&gt;
Artists of the Early Renaissance and the High Renaissance developed their characteristic styles from the observation of nature and the formulation of a pictorial science. When Mannerism matured after 1520(The year Raphael died), all the representational problems had been solved. A body of knowledge was there to be learned. Instead of nature as their teacher, Mannerist artists took art. While Renaissance artists sought nature to find their style, the Mannerists looked first for a style and found a manner. In Mannerist paintings, compositions can have no focal point, space can be ambiguous, figures can be characterized by an athletic bending and twisting with distortions, exaggerations, an elastic elongation of the limbs, bizarre posturing on one hand, graceful posturing on the other hand, and a rendering of the heads as uniformly small and oval. The composition is jammed by clashing colors, which is unlike what we've seen in the balanced, natural, and dramatic colors of the High Renaissance. Mannerist artwork seeks instability and restlessness. There is also a fondness for allegories that have lascivious undertones. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Andrea del Sarto, Jacopo da Pontormo, Correggio&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Baroque]]===
Key dates: 17th century&lt;br /&gt;
Baroque Art emerged in Europe around 1600, as a reaction against the intricate and formulaic Mannerist style which dominated the Late Renaissance. Baroque Art is less complex, more realistic and more emotionally affecting than Mannerism.&lt;br /&gt;
This movement was encouraged by the Catholic Church, the most important patron of the arts at that time, as a return to tradition and spirituality.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the great periods of art history, Baroque Art was developed by Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, and Gianlorenzo Bernini, among others. This was also the age of Rubens, Rembrandt, Velázquez, and Vermeer.&lt;br /&gt;
In the 18th century, Baroque Art was replaced by the more elegant and elaborate Rococo style.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Gianlorenzo Bernini, Rubens, Rembrandt, Nicolas Poussin&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Rococo]]===
Key dates: 18th century&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout the 18th century in France, a new wealthy and influential middle-class was beginning to rise, even though the royalty and nobility continued to be patrons of the arts. Upon the death of Louis XIV and the abandonment of Versailles, the Paris high society became the purveyors of style. This style, primarily used in interior decoration, came to be called Rococo. The term Rococo was derived from the French word "rocaille", which means pebbles and refers to the stones and shells used to decorate the interiors of caves. Therefore, shell forms became the principal motif in Rococo. The society women competed for the best and most elaborate decorations for their houses. Hence the Rococo style was highly dominated by the feminine taste and influence.&lt;br /&gt;
François Boucher was the 18th century painter and engraver whose works are regarded as the perfect expression of French taste in the Rococo period. Trained by his father who was a lace designer, Boucher won fame with his sensuous and light-hearted mythological paintings and landscapes. He executed important works for both the Queen of France and Mme. de Pompadour, Louis XV's mistress, who was considered the most powerful woman in France at the time. Boucher was Mme. de Pompadour's favorite artist and was commissioned by her for numerous paintings and decorations. Boucher also became the principal designer for the royal porcelain factory and the director of the Gobelins tapestry factory. The Vulcan Presenting Venus with Arms for Aeneas is a template for a tapestry made by this factory. &lt;br /&gt;
Characterized by elegant and refined yet playful subject matters, Boucher's style became the epitome of the court of Louis XV. His style consisted of delicate colors and gentle forms painted within a frivolous subject matter. His works typically utilized delightful and decorative designs to illustrate graceful stories with Arcadian shepherds, goddesses and cupids playing against a pink and blue sky. These works mirrored the frolicsome, artificial and ornamented decadence of the French aristocracy of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
The Rococo is sometimes considered a final phase of the Baroque period.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
François Boucher, William Hogarth, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Angelica Kauffman, Giovanni Antonio Canaletto, Velázquez Vermeer&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Neoclassicism|Neo-classical]]===
Key dates: 1750-1880&lt;br /&gt;
A nineteenth-century French art style and movement that originated as a reaction to the Baroque. It sought to revive the ideals of ancient Greek and Roman art. Neoclassic artists used classical forms to express their ideas about courage, sacrifice, and love of country. David and Canova are examples of neo-classicists.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Jacques-Louis David, Sir Henry Raeburn, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Thomas Gainsborough, Antonio Canova, Arnold Bocklin&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Romanticism]]===
Key dates: 1800-1880&lt;br /&gt;
Romanticism was basically a reaction against Neoclassicism, it is a deeply felt style which is individualistic, beautiful, exotic, and emotionally wrought.&lt;br /&gt;
Although Romanticism and Neoclassicism were philosophically opposed, they were the dominant European styles for generations, and many artists were affected to a greater or lesser degree by both. Artists might work in both styles at different times or even mix the styles, creating an intellectually Romantic work using a Neoclassical visual style, for example.&lt;br /&gt;
Great artists closely associated with Romanticism include J.M.W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich, John Constable, and William Blake.&lt;br /&gt;
In the United States, the leading Romantic movement was the Hudson River School of dramatic landscape painting.&lt;br /&gt;
Obvious successors of Romanticism include the Pre-Raphaelite movement and the Symbolists. But Impressionism, and through it almost all of 20th-century art, is also firmly rooted in the Romantic tradition. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
George Stubbs, William Blake, John Martin, Francisco Goya, Sir Thomas Lawrence, John Constable, Eugène Delacroix, Sir Edwin landseer, Caspar David Friedrich, JMW Turner&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

'''Arts integration''' is an approach to teaching that integrates the fine and performing arts as primary pathways to learning. Arts integration differs from traditional education by its inclusion of both the arts discipline and a traditional subject as part of learning (e.g. using improvisational drama skills to learn about conflict in writing.) The goal of arts integration is to increase knowledge of a general subject area while concurrently fostering a greater understanding and appreciation of the fine and performing arts.  The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts defines arts integration as "an approach to teaching in which students construct and demonstrate understanding through an art form. Students engage in a creative process which connects an art form and another subject and meets evolving objectives."

==History of arts education and arts integration==
Arts integration is related to [[Arts in education|arts education]] in schools. Arts education, while existing in different forms during the 19th century, gained popularity as part of [[John Dewey]]'s Progressive Education Theory. The first publication that describes a seamless interplay between the arts and other subjects (arts integration) taught in American schools was Leon Winslow's ''The Integrated School Art Program (1939).'' For the remainder of the 20th century, arts education's role in public schools ebbed and flowed with the country's political leanings and financial well-being.

According to Liora Bresler, during the 1970s and 1980s, two advocates for arts integration emerged: Harry Broudy and Elliot Eisner. Broudy advocated for the arts on the basis of strengthening the imagination. Broudy viewed imagination as an essential component of learning that should be cultivated in schools, and he advocated for the integration of aesthetic education into all subject matters in his work,'' Enlightened Cherishing''. Eisner followed Broudy, citing that the arts were important to varying types of [[cognition]]. He believed that arts brought about a deeper understanding of the world due to their interactivity—the arts move learning beyond what is written or read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bresler | first1 = Liora | year = | title = The Subservient, Co-Equal, Affective, and Social Integration Styles and their Implications for.. | url = | journal = Arts Education Policy Review | volume = 96 | issue = 5| page = 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cassandra B. Whyte]] emphasized the importance of artistic experiences for students to encourage creative and independent thought processes that would be important throughout an individual's lifetime. The arts helped students with problem solving and decision making and those processing experiences could be adapted in general life situations.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Bolyard Cassandra. (1973). Creativity: An Integral Part of the Secondary School Curriculum.Education.Nov.-Dec.190-191.&lt;/ref&gt; Whyte advocated including aspects of art education with [[locus of control]] identification counseling experiences to help higher education students develop confidence in their unique problem solving abilities in the classroom and in life.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Cassandra B. (1978). Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen.Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance.6. (4). January, 198-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, [[No Child Left Behind]] legislation describes arts education as "essential to every child's education," and include it as one of the Core Subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/tools/initiative/updates/040826.html The Importance of Arts Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002052454/http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/tools/initiative/updates/040826.html |date=October 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No Child Left Behind legislation also emphasizes accountability through assessment (often taking the form of the standardized test.) While no standardized assessment has been mandated in any of the arts, the need for academic accountability in the arts, as well as in other academic subject areas, has led to increased research on and advocacy of arts integration and its impact on student learning.&lt;ref&gt;Please see Renaissance in the Classroom's sub-chapter entitled "The Arts in American Public Education: A Brief History" for a more comprehensive reading with additional references&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core]] and close adaptions of it are changing the way schools approach learning. Common Core's approach to art integration is that it enhances education by making learning interesting and fun. With Common Core becoming the norm for many school districts through the United States, teachers are integrating art into the classroom now more than ever. The rise of popularity in art integration has increased the amount of resources available to include the classroom, making it easier than ever to use art integration in the classroom. 

==Arts integration research and advocacy==
Arts advocacy discourse currently presents two main opposing views in support of arts in education. The first points to economic grounds that art teaches "21st-century skills" like collaboration and innovation, which are necessary only as a means to breed productivity for the growth of the market. The second, alternative approach focuses instead on the philosophical value of creative inquiry that art instills in students, arguing lifelong development with no end in mind as a necessary habit borne out of an arts education. Tension between the utilitarian, workplace-focused view and the educational, growth-centered framework on advocacy continues to shape and reshape the arts education universe as revisions to the&amp;nbsp;[http://www.nationalartsstandards.org/ National Core Arts Standards]&amp;nbsp;reflect fluctuations in advocacy rhetoric.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Logsdon|first=Leann F.|date=2013|title=Questioning the Role of "21st-Century Skills" in Arts Education Advocacy Discourse|jstor=43288769|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=100|issue=1|pages=51–56|doi=10.2307/43288769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key players ===
The impetus for the arts integration is a growing body of research that demonstrates how learners experience success when taught why and how to use music, visual art, drama/dance, theatre and the literary arts to both express and understand ideas, thoughts and feelings. Critical Links,&lt;ref&gt;Deasy, Richard, et al. Critical Links : Learning in the Arts and Student Academic and Social Development. Washington, DC: Arts Education Partnership, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; a compendium published by the Arts Education Partnership ([http://www.aep-arts.org/e.com AEP]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}), includes 62 studies which examine the relationship between arts learning, academic achievement, and social development of students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aep-arts.org/resources/toolkits/criticallinks Arts Education Partnership : : Publication Toolkits : : Critical Links] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826130015/http://www.aep-arts.org/resources/toolkits/criticallinks |date=August 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights include studies which explore the use of drama to increase students' reading comprehension and studies which examine the relationship between music and math concepts. The Arts Education Partnership has also published The Third Space,&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, L. M., R. Deasy, and A. E. Partnership. Third Space: When Learning Matters. Arts Education Partnership, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; which profiles ten arts-integrated schools across the [[United States]].

Another American organization conducting research in arts integration is the Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capeweb.org/ |title=CAPE &amp;#124; Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education |publisher=Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education (CAPE) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has published, through Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Renaissance in the Classroom: Arts Integration and Meaningful Learning.&lt;ref&gt;Renaissance in the Classroom : Arts Integration and Meaningful Learning. Mahwah, N.J.: L. Erlbaum Associates, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The book, edited by Gail Burnaford, Ph.D, former professor at [[Northwestern University]] and current professor at Florida Atlantic University; Cynthia Weiss, teaching artist and former CAPE associate (2000 to 2002); and Arnold Aprill, CAPE's Founding &amp; Creative Director, combines the contributions of two-hundred seventy-two participants in CAPE's arts integration partnerships. James Catterall, arts education researcher and professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]'s Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, has collaborated with CAPE on publications.

[[Harvard University]]'s Graduate School of Education supports [https://web.archive.org/web/20070814120148/http://www.pzweb.harvard.edu/ Project Zero], an educational research group founded in 1967 by Nelson Goodman, which investigates learning in the arts. Former directors of Project Zero include David Perkins and [[Howard Gardner]]. Currently, it is directed by Steve Seidel, and has expanded its research in arts learning to include other branches of education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pzweb.harvard.edu/History/History.htm History of Project Zero] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611210538/http://pzweb.harvard.edu/History/History.htm |date=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Gardner]]'s [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] has been used as part of the rationale for the use of integrated arts models in teaching and learning.

For over 30 years, [http://www.kennedy-center.org the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts] in Washington, D.C., has been offering arts integration learning opportunities for educators.  Locally, through its [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/ceta/ Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA)] program, the Kennedy Center provides professional learning for Washington, D.C. area educators that are implementing arts integration in their classrooms or teaching about an art form.  To develop a school-wide culture of arts integration, a network of CETA schools partner with the Kennedy Center to engage their teachers in in-depth professional learning focused on arts integration.  The CETA program has added to the research about the impact of arts integration on students, teachers, and school culture through multiple evaluation studies.  To reach educators throughout the nation, the Kennedy Center hosts an annual Arts Integration Conference, in which educators actively explore arts integration concepts and strategies.  The Kennedy Center’s online resource, [http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/educators.aspx ARTSEDGE], also hosts a web series of arts integration resources that explain the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of arts integration, provides examples of arts integration in practice, and links to a range of resources.  A series of Kennedy Center Seminars for Teaching Artists that focus on arts integration, as well as practices for developing strong arts-integrated residencies for students and workshops for teachers are available throughout the nation. A National Seminar for Teaching Artists is offered bi-annually at the Kennedy Center during the summer. 
Three other Kennedy Center national initiatives support practices and partnerships in arts integration and arts education: [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/anygivenchild/ Any Given Child], [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/partners/ Partners in Education], and [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/vsa/ VSA].

[[The Kennedy Center]] Partners in Education, headquartered in [[Washington, DC]], is an organization that has promoted arts integration for over two decades. While The Kennedy Center does conduct research in arts learning, they also provide networking opportunities for arts education programs nationwide through The Kennedy Center Alliance for Arts Education Network [https://web.archive.org/web/20071013044855/http://kennedy-center.org/education/kcaaen/home.html KCAAEN]. This organization advocates for arts education, fosters collaboration between artists and schools to support arts learning, develops and conducts professional development in arts education for teachers, and recognizes achievement in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/kcaaen/home.html KCAAEN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013044855/http://kennedy-center.org/education/kcaaen/home.html |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, [[Lesley University]] in Cambridge,  MA, has been educating classroom teachers across the US in the implementation of arts integration through a [http://www.lesley.edu/academics/graduate/curriculum-instruction-integrated-teaching-through-the-arts-professional-teacher professional development master's degree program]. A [http://www.artsedsearch.org/summaries/voices-from-the-field-teachers%E2%80%99-views-on-the-relevance-of-arts-integration 2012 research study], funded by the Ford Foundation, has found that teachers who graduate from the program and integrate the arts into their teaching are more resilient and remain committed to their profession. Their students engage in deep learning through arts integrated activities, leading to a greater interest in school.&lt;ref&gt;Bellisario, K. &amp; Donovan, L. (2012).

ArtsNow [http://www.artsnowlearning.org] provides professional development training for educators, focused on building the skills needed to integrate arts across the curriculum. Through the innovative Foundational Training course, teachers learn to identify opportunities to integrate all art forms - visual, dance, and music - into lessons in all class subjects for grades K-12, meeting both state and national curriculum standards (including Common Core standards). ArtsNow offers free Ignite Curriculum Guides through its website.&lt;ref&gt;ArtsNow Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

EducationCloset [http://educationcloset.com] provides professional development in arts integration and innovation in teaching.  With an annual Arts Integration conference, [https://educationcloset.com/integrated-curriculum/ Arts Integrated Curriculum], courses, webinars and publications available, teachers, artists, arts educators, administrators, and arts advocates can find rigorous, high-quality resources for Arts Integration which connect to Common Core State Standards and STEM.

With a focus on the classroom practice of arts integration, a nonprofit called Arts Integration Solutions (formerly the Opening Minds through the Arts Foundation) [http://www.artsintegration.com] provides professional development for teachers and program planning and implementation for schools and school districts. AiS has developed a set of tenets that are the basis for arts integration and a cycle that helps teachers develop daily lessons in math, science, reading and writing that use the arts to fully engage students. AiS has developed programming for use of arts integration in teaching the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) and Literacy.

==Art education obstacles==
The three major skills in education that are considered the “core” subjects to teach students include math, writing, and reading comprehension. These important areas are considered by many the tools for success for student achievement. A consequence of predominately emphasizing these three areas of academic study is a lack of attention to other major areas of academics, mainly the arts. Viewing the arts as insignificant has had a major impact on teaching creativity to students.

===No Child Left Behind===
The importance of teaching the arts to students has recently been viewed as less essential than teaching other core studies, particularly by school administrators. Educational institutions are attempting to maintain federal standards to receive government funding. These standards focus predominantly on subjects such as English and math and are also highly emphasized during standardized testing. If schools can improve student achievement within these areas, they do not become vulnerable to a loss or reduction in federal funding. Robin Pogrebin of the New York Times states, “In a time when President Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policy emphasizes test results, the arts do not easily lend themselves to quantifiable measurements”.&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, Robin. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/04/arts/design/04stud.html“Book Tackles Old Debate: Role of Art in Schools]. [[The New York Times]]. (2007). 7 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, schools are placing a large emphasis on teaching students to excel in these areas of study. This includes more time allotted for the instruction of these classes as well as a large amount of the school budget to enhance these courses.

===School budgets===
While a sizable amount of the educational budget is spent on these important areas of academic study, schools are finding that there is less money for what some would consider as non-essential courses, such as higher level music and art. According to the academic journal The Electronic Musician, “On March 2, 2011, both the House and Senate agreed to eliminate a number of small education programs at the U.S. Department of Education, including the complete defunding of the Arts in Education program, a $40 million fund that supports competitive grants and national initiatives”.&lt;ref&gt;"The FY11 Budget Deal: What Does It Mean For The Arts?." Electronic Musician 27.7 (2011): 13. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While small reductions to budgets are common during a recession, some states have reduced their arts budgets drastically. According to the Teaching Artists Journal, “In 2004, total state funding for the arts will drop to $272 million, a 23% decrease in just the last year. And nearly two-thirds of that total decrease comes from cutbacks in just three of the hardest hit states: California, Michigan and Florida”.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Heather. "The Simple Facts." Teaching Artist Journal 2.3 (2004): 189. Academic Search Premier. Web. 7 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While the reduction of funding for the arts has been reduced nearly a quarter in different areas, educators often struggle to maintain their arts program as a vital skill to teach to students. The funds that have been reduced now disallow the arts to provide furnishings and supplies as well as instructor salaries that are essential to these programs. As a result, art courses are not regarded with the same amount of respect and students are denied a creative outlet within their education.

Budget issues and the reduction of spending for the arts has caused numerous schools to attempt to find additional sources to help support their arts program. School administrators frequently look towards state funding to assist in financing the arts. Grants and other means to finance the arts are increasingly becoming more frequent, but they are temporary solutions to fund these programs. Schools often work with local and state governments to receive income; however numerous state governments are experiencing other budget deficit issues and can rarely afford to finance such a program in the amount that is needed. So to help support the arts, often there is need for assistance from private contributors. Still, as with grants, private contributors cannot donate enough funds to adequately support the arts in education and cannot contribute as consistently as the government could. Funding the arts in education still remains a large and unresolved issue for many school districts nationwide.

===Practical uses===
Advocacy for the arts raises an issue of how essential teaching the arts to students actually is. Due to statistical analysis of a perceived lapse in mathematical and reading skills of our youth, many parents feel that importance of the arts is less crucial than other fundamental areas of academic study. This is namely due, in part, by the fact that art is viewed as less needed in the workforce. However many advocates argue that students in the arts excel in interpreting and analyzing visual and spatial information. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, "Educators have acknowledged that the arts are basic to the acquisition of a well-rounded education. The arts provide meaning to learning. They serve as a vehicle for acquiring the skills to which educational reformers have said students should aspire: problem-solving, higher order thinking, flexibility, persistence, and cooperation."&lt;ref&gt;“What Does the NEAP Arts Assessment Measure?” National Center for Educational Statistics. 2009. 16 Nov, 2011. &lt;http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/arts/whatmeasure.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These skills that are acquired by the arts are actually needed characteristics in the modern workforce. The stress of the importance for the arts then becomes one that benefits the students for their future careers. While many view the arts as inapplicable in today’s modern workforce, many would argue that the arts provide positive results for students competing in today’s competitive job market.

===Arts integrated teachers===
An issue commonly brought is that “not all teachers are artists,” meaning that there aren’t enough teachers capable of doing art to teach in every classroom. However, this is not the case, as any teacher can become an arts teacher. While art is, to its core, incredibly subjective, there is a basis for every practice. In the fine arts there are the elements and principles of design, the color wheel, etc. In music there is basic music theory. In drama, there is basic play structure, acting theory, etc. Whether or not a teacher can do these things is irrelevant; if they can be taught, that information can be passed on from the teacher to the student. The goal is not to create master artists, but rather teach basic arts skills, processes, and aesthetic quality, and encourage creative teaching techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oreck |first=Barry |title=Artistic choices: A study of teachers who use the arts in the classroom |url=http://ijea.asu.edu/v7n8/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205121705/http://ijea.asu.edu/v7n8/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2007 |publisher=International Journal of Education &amp; the Arts |accessdate=12 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic understanding can then be passed on to the students, who then learn by doing. These skills are simple and easy to learn and teach, and will be infinitely useful in creating lesson plans and in practice. Once an arts-integrated environment is established, techniques, examples, and information can be shared amongst colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dittrich |last2=Pool |last3=Pool |first=Charles |first2=Jonelle |first3=Ken|title=Arts Integration in Teacher Preparation: Teaching the Teachers|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ985616.pdf|publisher=ERIC Institute of Education Sciences|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They can discuss findings and share what works and does not work within the classroom.

Funding and advocacy for the arts still remains the largest issue that is currently facing teaching this important area to students. Many districts and supporters speak out for more funding to ensure advancement in the arts, however there is little money to be shared across the many programs in education. Many fear that certain arts programs may be removed from some schools due to these concerns. While art education is considered one of the core subjects in the No Child Left Behind Act, there are many who fear for its future.

==The contribution of arts education to children’s development==
The arts are often perceived as a hobby, an interest or purely as a recreational occupation. In a society where the entire educational system is based on preparing a future work force, focus is put on the STEM field (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and the arts are neglected. In a time of economic instability resources are strictly distributed and the arts are ever so often first to get cut. Yet, research on the effects of arts education on children’s learning and development show significant positive outcomes on children exposed to arts programs with teacher supervision compared to children not exposed to arts education. Research shows that children exposed to arts do better in school, develop greater social, cognitive and emotional skills and are more likely to earn higher degrees of education later in life.

===Academic effects===
Participation in arts programs is positively correlated with increased academic achievement, including higher math and verbal SAT scores, when compared to the performance of students without arts education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. (2011). Reinvesting in arts education: Winning America’s future through creative schools. http://www.pcah.gov/sites/default/files/PCAH_Reinvesting_4web.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

Research by the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS;88), a panel study which has followed more than 25,000 students in American secondary schools for 10 years, show significant results on the positive outcomes from children exposed to high arts in school with a teacher supervising. The study examines the time from 8th grade through 10th and 12th grade and throughout high school. Furthermore, this study, conducted by James Catterall and colleagues, which started in the mid-90s followed up on the same students at age 26 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Catterall, J. S. (2009). Doing Well and Doing Good by Doing Art: The Effects of Education in the Visual and Performing Arts on the Achievements and Values of Young Adults. Los Angeles/London: Imagination Group/I‐Group Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exploratory study published by the [[National Art Education Association]] looked at the integration of arts in classroom curriculum and concluded that this integration enhanced academic learning because of the fully immersive engagement of the arts, which allows students to understand different perspectives, safely take risks, express feelings through less restrictive modes, and draw parallels between the arts and traditional core subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Patricia|date=2007|title=Making Meaning Many Ways: An Exploratory Look at Integrating the Arts with Classroom Curriculum|jstor=27696226|journal=Art Education|volume=60|issue=4|pages=33–38|doi=10.2307/27696226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-emotional development===
A significant consensus among research on arts education exists and this is that arts reach students who are not otherwise being reached and that the arts reach students in ways that they are otherwise not being reached.&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, E. B. (1999). Champions of Change - The Impact of the Arts on Learning. Washington, D.C.: The Arts Education Partnership &amp; The President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities.&lt;/ref&gt; Students failing is commonly explained by disengaged students and finding that arts provide students a reason and a motivation for being engaged with school and thus preventing students from dropping out of school.&lt;ref&gt;Achbacher, P. &amp;. (1991). The Humanitas Program evaluation, 1990-91. Center for the Study of Evaluation, UCLA Graduate School of Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt; This motivation found within can be examined through the way that engagement in arts enhances self-awareness, self-confidence, trust and empowerment. Creating art is a personal experience and involves the student’s personal resources implicating a greater involvement and investment in a work without right or wrong answers.  Personal investment nourishes self-directed learning and encourages the learning experience itself rather than learning as a means of test score performance. The confidence, collaboration, and creativity that arts education fosters has a circular, positive effect on academics as well as cultural engagement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Socio-cultural development===
Positive outcomes by means of socio-cultural development, through exposure to minorities and different cultures, is a contribution of arts education aiming at breaking stereotypes and developing teamwork skills, tolerance and appreciation of diversity. One study, collected by the Association for the Advancement of Arts Education (AAAE), on students’ exposure to Native American music using an interdisciplinary approach incorporating the teaching of instrumental music and bringing in guest artists, showed decreased stereotypical attitudes and greater cultural awareness and sensitivity. These changes were measured by the American Indian Belief Inventory was measured on four groups exposed to Native American culture and a fifth group with no cultural exposure. All of the four groups showed improvement while the fifth control group did not.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, K. (1994). North American Indian Music Instruction : Influences upon attitudes, cultural perceptions, and achievement.D.M.A. dissertation. Tempa, Arizona.: Arizona State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Longitudinal studies have shown that students with arts education are more civically engaged. This socio-cultural effect of arts integration is disproportionately stronger for at-risk students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S.|first=Catterall, James|date=March 2012|title=The Arts and Achievement in At-Risk Youth: Findings from Four Longitudinal Studies.

===Cognitive development===
Research on the contribution of the arts to the cognitive field show a great array of cognitive developments in spatial-temporal abilities, verbal skills, memory and spatial reasoning.
A study by Chan ''et al.'' using sixty female college students in the U.S showed a relationship of the students’ music training before age 12 and their verbal memory. The students with music training showed a significantly better recall than those without formal training. 
A meta-analysis by the American Psychological Association furthermore showed how listening to music can result in progressive relaxation and that listening to classical music one hour a day increases greater brain coherence and more time spent in the alpha state (state of aware relaxation stimulating imagination, intuition and higher awareness).&lt;ref&gt;Malyarenko. (1996). Music Alters Children's Brainwaves, Human Physiology, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on premature babies have also found that while receiving special care and being exposed to classical music they physically and mentally developed significantly faster than those babies who weren’t exposed to classical music.  Further studies have also indicated that incorporating Art into academic education for disabled children better supported cognitive development and improved communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Rawley A.

== Integration of arts in classroom curriculum ==
Jessica Davis presents eight different frameworks for considering the role of the arts in education.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jessica Hoffman|date=1999-05-01|title=Nowhere, Somewhere, Everywhere: The Arts in Education|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10632919909599472|journal=Arts Education Policy Review|volume=100|issue=5|pages=23–28|doi=10.1080/10632919909599472|issn=1063-2913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gullatt|first=David E.|date=2008|title=Enhancing Student Learning through Arts Integration: Implications for the Profession|jstor=40364094|journal=The High School Journal|volume=91|issue=4|pages=12–25|doi=10.1353/hsj.0.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her categories and methods are as follows:
# ''Arts-Based -'' Art is at the core of learning, providing a lens through which students can understand other subjects. Art serves as the basic threshold for general learning.
# ''Arts-Injected (or Infused) -'' Art is "injected" from the outside as a matter of enrichment (e.g., a period of music, visiting artists, etc.)
# ''Arts-Included'' - Art is offered alongside traditional curriculum, not necessarily for interdisciplinary purposes but rather as its own course of study.
# ''Arts-Expansion'' - Art is an exploratory adventure that takes students outside of school (e.g., field trips to a museum, concert hall, etc.)
# ''Arts-Professional'' - This approach treats art training as a means for a professional career in the arts, and turning students into artists is the primary goal.
# ''Arts-Extras'' - Art is sometimes offered as an additional commitment outside of regular school curriculum (e.g., school newspaper, after-school dance clubs, etc.).
# ''Arts-Education -'' Referred to by some as aesthetic education, this approach uses art as a way of knowing, turning its study more philosophical to interpret and apply to experiences.
# ''Arts-Cultura'' - Art connects individual students' "culture" to collective community "cultures" to more structured racial/national "Cultures" to the ultimate universal "Culture." It is through this interplay that art encourages students to take risks, think critically, and make meaning.
It is often difficult to fully integrate the arts with traditional classroom instruction in a way that allows for the arts-cultura model. This is largely due to the disconnect between art teachers and teachers of other subjects, who are not given the time or ability to coordinate and interweave lesson plans that apply art to core subjects and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Arts Technology Integration ===
As technology continually advances, arts integration evolves to match. The challenge in integrating arts in today's technology-first education lies not in implementing production labs on school campuses or accessing the latest computer software, but rather in effectively managing the sheer amount of information that technology makes available. Students must learn to select relevant data, assess these data, and draw critically from them in order to make meaning, answer questions, or form new ones. Technology also presents more channels of expression, whether through digital art or artificial intelligence, which, if supported by arts-technology integration, can cultivate the experimentation and inquiry that arts education champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayo|first=Sherry|date=2007|title=Implications for Art Education in the Third Millennium: Art Technology Integration|jstor=27696216|journal=Art Education|volume=60|issue=3|pages=45–51|doi=10.2307/27696216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO Arts Integration Program ===
The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), a special agency of the UN that operates from Paris, France, advocates the need for the integration of arts, culture, and creativity in all educational platforms worldwide. This agenda is in line with the structure of “Quality Education” and “Education for All” to support methodologies for promoting and protecting diversity of cultural manifestation. For example, UNESCO Bangkok took the initiative of upholding research activities related to Arts Education and swap of information along with case studies among educators, artists, and other stakeholders within Asia and the Pacific. The very first international congress on arts education was held in Seoul (Korea) in 2006 and the second in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bangkok.unesco.org/content/releasing-power-arts-%E2%80%93-exploring-arts-education-asia-pacific|title=Releasing the Power of the Arts – Exploring Arts Education in the Asia-Pacific|work=UNESCO Bangkok|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Conclusion==
Due to current economic recession many schools across see their arts programs cut off in favor of core curriculum subject such as English, math and science. Despite the lack of apparent and secure job possibilities within the arts and a pressuring need for a strong work force within the [[STEM fields]] (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) research show that arts education is crucial in children’s learning process and development. In 2013 a congressional resolution sought to include "A" for Art in the STEM acronym, changing it to STEAM.&lt;ref name="113HR51"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hres51ih/pdf/BILLS-113hres51ih.pdf |title=H. RES. 51 House of Representatives Joint Resolution|year=2012 |author= |publisher=113th Congress, 2013–2015|accessdate=2013-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that children exposed to arts education throughout childhood through primary, secondary and tertiary school show greater scores on academic achievements as well as greater social, cultural, emotional and cognitive development. Some of the measured improvement are greater self-confidence, communicative skills, cultural awareness and sensitivity alongside greater stimulated creativity and overall academic achievement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1296">'''Casting television''' is a competition [[television program]] where the winner wins a recording contract, or takes part in a competition.

== Slovakia ==

Slovakia's competition is Superstars, and the prize is a car, cash and recording contracts. Stars such as [[Zdenka Predna]] came to prominence this way.

== United Kingdom ==

Simon Cowell's "Popstars" is perhaps the most famous one of the lot, and other shows on a similar focus are ''[[Stars in Their Eyes]]'', and Andrew Lloyd Webber's ''[[How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?]]''.

== United States ==
Following directly on the UK template is the ''[[American Idol]]'' competition.

== Republic of Ireland ==

Ireland's version, called ''[[You're a Star]]'', had a unique twist: winners came into the Eurovision Song Contest as the prize.  However, after the disaster of the [[McCall Twins]] that format has been abandoned. The most famous winner and most successful in Eurovision (though he did not win) was [[Mickey Joe Harte]].

'''Catherine Bell''' (1953 – 23 May 2008)&lt;!-- year given in Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data --&gt; was an American [[religious studies]] scholar who specialised in the study of [[Chinese religions]] and [[ritual studies]]. From 1985 until her death she worked at [[Santa Clara University]]'s religious studies department, of which she was chair from 2000 to 2005.

Born in [[New York City]], she studied at [[Manhattanville College]] and [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] before briefly teaching in Japan at the [[Seishin Joshi Gakuin]] and [[International University of Japan]]. Returning to the United States, she began work at Santa Clara in 1985, devoting her research to Chinese ritual, resulting in her most prominent publication, ''Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice'' (1992). In 1998 she became the Bernard Hanley Professor of Religious Studies, before becoming chair of the religious studies department in 2000. Retiring due to persistent health problems in 2005, she continued to research until her death.

==Biography==

Born in [[New York City]], Bell undertook her undergraduate studies at [[Manhattanville College]], gaining a double-major BA in philosophy and religion in 1975.{{sfn|Divinity School|2004}} She proceeded to complete her MA in the History of Religion at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[University of Chicago Divinity School|Divinity School]] in 1976, continuing with a PhD there, completed in 1983.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}}{{sfn|Divinity School|2004}} Moving to Japan, she taught at the [[Seishin Joshi Gakuin]] in [[Tokyo]] from 1982 to 1983, before moving to the [[International University of Japan]] in [[Niigata (city)|Nigata]] in 1983.{{sfn|Divinity School|2004}} She then undertook a post-doctoral fellowship for Chinese language study in Taiwan.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} Covering the costs for her international research, she obtained award fellowships from the [[Mellon Foundation]], the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} Becoming a fellow of the Center for Chinese Studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and involved in their Chinese Popular Culture project, her studies of ritual praxes in Chinese religions led to her book ''Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice'', published in 1992.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}}

In 1985 she began work at Santa Clara University.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} Focused on teaching undergraduates, courses she ran included "Ways of Studying Religion," "Asian Religions," "Magic, Science and Religion," "Time and the Millennium" and "Religion and Violence," each of which she based around a core intellectual question.{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=viii}} Involved in restructuring the department's curriculum, in 1996 she was awarded the Brutocao Award for Excellence in Curriculum Innovation.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} She was also involved in the creation of a Women's Faculty Group and Faculty Development Program to aid junior members in the department.{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=ix}} In 1998 she was named Bernard Hanley Professor of Religious Studies, that year being awarded the [[Santa Clara University College of Arts &amp; Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]]' Beyma Research Award.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} In 2001 she was then awarded the President's Award for distinction.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}}

Bell served as chair of the department from 2000 to 2005, then stepping down to become [[professor emeritus]]; she took early retirement due to an inability to cope following her diagnosis with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 2000.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}}{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=x}} In 2005, the University of Chicago Divinity School named her "Alumna of the Year", on their website praising her as "a great scholar and teacher... [and] a skilled administrator".{{sfn|Divinity School|2004}}{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} She began work on a new project, ''Believing: Assuming Universality, Describing Particularity in the Study of Religion'', funded by another fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities, but it was left unfinished at the time of her death.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} Her unfinished manuscript, titled ''Believing and the Practice of Religion'', was later stored in Santa Clara's university library.{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=ix}}

Bell died aged 55 on 23 May 2008, after a long illness.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} She was survived by her mother, sister, three brothers, and husband, Steven Gelber, who was a professor of history at Santa Clara.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} The chair of the Santa Clara religious studies department, Paul Crowley, described her as "a magnificent colleague, a scholar of international standing, [and] an inspiring mentor to generations of students".{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} Historian of religion Reza Aslan asserted that she would be remembered for generations to come due to her "rigorous scholarship", and that she was "unmatched" as an academic. Having known her personally, Aslan also commented on her "razor sharp wit, her boundless compassion, and refusal to accept anything but the best from her students."{{sfn|Aslan|2009|pp=vii&amp;ndash;viii}}

==Published work==

===''Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice''===
The work was published in two editions, the original Oxford University Press edition in 1992, and an edition also from Oxford University Press in 2009 with a new prologue, which is also available in electronic versions.  Both editions share the same pagination.

Religious studies scholar Diane Jonte-Pace opined that the book "changed the framework for understanding the nature and function of ritual", constituting Bell's "greatest contribution" to religious studies.{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=vii}} Having known Bell personally, Jonte-Pace thought that the book exhibited her "fearless intellectual style" and "sense of freedom" from past frameworks.{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=viii}} Historian of religion Reza Aslan claimed that it "launched a revolution" in the way that scholars understood the subject, becoming "required reading" for students of religious studies.{{sfn|Aslan|2009|p=vii}}

It was awarded "Best First Book in the History of Religions" from the [[American Academy of Religion]] in 1994.{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=viii}}{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}}

Because of the importance of this work for the field of ritual studies, a survey of the work is in order.  The book is organized into three major sections:  "The Practice of Ritual Theory" (chapters 1-3), which generally surveys the prior work in the field and situates Bell's book in that context; "The Sense of Ritual" (chapters 4-6), which develops the concept of ritual in terms of bodies and the external systems within which they work; and "Ritual and Power" (chapters 7-9), which frames the discussion of ritual in society, with the attending questions of power and authority.

====Chapter 1, Constructing Ritual====
Catherine Bell introduces the study of ritual theory in chapter 1. (19) She presents the idea of dichotomies and how they differentiate between conceptual blueprints (such as beliefs and myths) and ritual (something acted out). Ritual is seen as a performance of conceptual orientations. (19) Bell integrates the ideas and theories of [[Edward Shils]], [[Durkheim]], [[Stanley Tambiah]], [[Victor Turner]], [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Levi-Strauss|Claude Levi-Strauss]] all pertaining to ritual studies. Ritual is understood as a structural mechanism that reintegrates the two opposing dichotomies of thought and action, which is equivalent to the belief and behavior dichotomy. (20) In the sense of community, ritual is seen as a way to create a collective set of beliefs or ideals. In an ever changing society, ritual is the bridge between tradition and constant social change. (20) Ritual symbolism plays a role in the natural struggle of humans with their moral self and external “socio-political” order and constraints of the world. (24) However, this theory of ritual symbolism is seen as incomplete because 1) it does not have any cultural analysis in its explanation and 2) it does not take into consideration the duality of human nature. Bell reestablishes the different dichotomies that are at play against one another: continuity and change, individual experience and social forms, beliefs and behaviors, and thought and action. (25)

====Chapter 2, Constructing Meaning====
Catherine Bell maintains the idea that a successful ritual is one in which both cultural and sociological aspects work together. (34, 35) Bell bases her model of ritual on three elements: ritual as an activity, as a fusion of thought and activity, and the [[dichotomy]] between actor and thinker. (31) Ritual performs and enacts a system of symbols by integrating the conceptual and dispositional (i.e., the worldview and ethos). Ritual actors integrate worldview and the [[ethos]] (conceptual and dispositional) while the theorist integrates these conceptual categories. (32)

Building on the idea of the "acting actor", (31) ritual is now seen as “cultural performance” (37) and is “dramatisized”. (38)  Comparing symbols with either [[indexicality]] or iconicity allows for many interpretations of symbolism. (42) Iconicity, for example, within [[Christianity]] might include all images of a man hanging on a cross symbolize to a [[crucifix]] (reference: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/crucifix) . Ritual may be understood as communication among people, rather than individuals with the [[divine]]. (43) An Islamic example might be going to "[[jumu'ah]]" so others perceive the actor as pious. After a debate of what meaning is, from the views of [[Clifford Geertz]] and [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah]], the next dichotic lens in which to view ritual is drama vs. performance. (43-44) Drama insinuates the individual participating in the ritual is like an [[actor]]; they are simply doing the actions and saying things, while their internal thoughts are irrelevant. (43) [[Performance]] may simply be the act of the ritual, the participant may be disregarded. Through text analogy one may see ritual as a text. (43) Text may be seen as unchanging, knowable and designed to be knowable, yet when studying text one may interpret and analyze it for oneself; that allows for variation of meaning, change over time, fluidity, which is essential for ritual. (43-45) However, texts are made to communicate directly with a reader, yet not all rituals communicate in the same way. (45)

====Chapter 5, The Ritual Body====
The body is seen in various ways with different functionalities and uses, where some view its purpose as a connector between the individual and society. (94) Bell discusses the ideas of [[Durkheim]], [[Mauss]], and [[Hertz]] on the body, arguing that bodily expressions are social in nature and acquired in practice. (94) In contrast to this perception, Bell includes [[Lakoff]]’s argument that these basic categories are inherent and rooted in the sociobiological body. (96) Bell argues that the body is no longer a physical instrument to perform rituals but in fact a social body that connects to society. (97)

The ritualized body is one that contains a ‘sense’ of values of ritual.(98) The ritual body is produced through interactions of the body with structure and a structured environment, therefore forming a relationship between the body and the environment around it, such as Muslims' prayer in a [[mosque]]. The actions that take place in a “ritual space” have a connection to the environment because it molds the way the environment is presented.(100) Yet the physical actions such as standing up straight or kneeling down during ''[[salat]]'' do not express inner states such as emotions or intentions of the individual. What one individual sees in terms of ritual action is not the display of one’s inner state or values.(100) Many rituals take part in certain performances that are mandated by the authority of history, such as Muslims sacrificing animals on the day of [[Eid Al-Adha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moonsighting.com/articles/adha-paper.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525201545/http://www.moonsighting.com/articles/adha-paper.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If one believes in the exact repetition of an age-old ritual in the present day then no ritual style is autonomous.(101)

Bell describes a hierarchical system created via linguistic or physical means and organized by the creation of oppositions through ritualization. (104) She describes that although these oppositions may be in contrast, they do not always necessarily balance one another out, and some dominate over others (for example, the receiving of Eucharist (or the inner) dominates the act of lifting and lowering heads (or the outer) in the Catholic church). (102) She describes how the body molds a ritualized agent through the production of a structured environment based on oppositions. (106) However, this interaction of body and environment, or ritualization, simply shifts the nature of social problems to endless circular schemes, where no resolution is produced, only implied. (106-7)

Bell holds, ritualized agents see their purpose, but not what they actually do in ritually changing a situation. This is what she states [[Althusser]] views as the “...intrinsic blindness of practice.” (108) As far as ritual and language are concerned, Bell states that there are two main controversies: first, comparing ritual language to verbal/textual language; second, the role of aforementioned verbal/textual language in ritual. (110)  Bell mentions Tambiah and other scholars see ritual communication as not only another form of expression, but a way of expressing things that would be impossible to express in any other manner. (111) Bell argues language may be the most important part of some rituals. (113) She closes this section stating, “That is to say within the medium of formally explicit discourse, there is nothing there to grasp, just a variety of culturally instinctive and flexible schemes with which to avoid and undermine everything but the ritual acts themselves.” (114)

Since there is a difference between thought and action in ritual the same idea applies for what theoretical practice sees and does not see itself doing (the object-unity of theoretical discourse). (114) Seeing and not-seeing is the production of agents embodying sense of ritual constituted by and expressed in particular schemes of ritualization.(114) The schemes start to shape the world and spread out causing disposition of ritualization.(115) Shared culture may strategically transform the way one group practices from another in terms of the simple alterations of actions in ritual, which are then deployed around the area.The saying "[[fake it till you make it]]" is a good way to sum up the thoughts of Bell because as children are younger they learn so many rituals in our respective faiths but it is not until later in life that they give those rituals meaning and practice them as more than mere action. It is necessary to explore the actual contexts of ritualization by looking at a more accurate actions for ritualization, and the history behind the traditions practiced.(117)

====Chapter 8, Ritual, Belief, and Ideology====
In chapter 8, Bell evaluates the symbiotic relationship between ritual and belief. (182) Bell states that ritual is typically viewed as an expression of belief and holds social power, which generates change. (182) Bell believes that religious belief is understood in many different ways and that personal interpretation makes it difficult to analyze in a social context, despite being social in nature. (183) Bell also points out that belief is complex and its association with ritual is challenged. The intended belief behind ritual may be misunderstood by the participants, indicating that their participation in the ritual may not necessarily support or understand the initial institutional belief. (183)

Bell gives a detailed description of two notions of [[ideology]].  Although Bell describes two views, she discusses ideology implemented within a society as a way for the dominant class to maintain power and control. (188-92) Bell maintains [[Gramsci]]’s belief that the dominated class rarely passively accepts and internalizes the dominant class' values, but instead consents to a more appropriate alternative. (190)  She concludes that in this way, ideology is a unifying form of power which creates a greater distribution of control than relationships that exist with the use of pure force. (193)

Bell’s presentation maintains the notion that ritual, political power and legitimation of power are  three interdependent theories. Historically, ritual was cast as a mere “artifice” used to conceal the "brute exercise of real power". Thus sacred kingships throughout the past centuries used ritual as a tool to install hierarchy and fulfill political agendas. She invites the readers to question ritual as no longer a self-fulfilling tool but also a power tool for mass governance. Ritual constructs an argument, all while maintaining social order. It does not ‘disguise the exercise of power’ - it is in itself the power.

====Chapter 9, The Power of Ritualization====
[[power (social and political)|Power]] and [[authority]] play a strong role in Bell’s view of ritual: one does not necessarily have both. (197) A person in power may use that control to affect views within society, limiting other’s individual autonomy. (198) The power may be used through [[symbolic power]], where it may be used to help understand the actions and meanings of the world. (199) The top of the hierarchy only has power if the bottom responds to the directions from the top. (200) The individual, she concludes, is ultimately in power. (203) Bell seems to present the power relationship between individuals and society as a complex strategy to organize social norms. (204)

One aspect of ritualization is the differentiation and privileging of certain activities. (204) Features by which these activities differentiate themselves are not universal. Since ritual is a “way of acting” that is distinguished by a certain culture or situation, generalizing ritual strategies into a universal phenomenon undermines its logic. (205) Ritualizing strategies may be implemented without the involvement of religious activities. The purpose of ritualization might be to incite a controversy or to create certain impressions. Any moderately socialized person may use ritualization, both in its cultural and situational forms, as a strategy by distinguishing or blurring the boundary that makes an activity a “specific way of acting”. (206) Bell suggests that the deployment of ritualization is the construction of power relationships - one of domination, consent or resistance. While ritualization may be an effective strategy of power in some certain conditions, it has specific limits and may even be counterproductive in other scenarios. (206) Ritualization has two basic dimensions. The first dimension is the dynamics of the social body and its projection of a structured environment, where ritualization produces and objectifies the constructions of power. (207) The second dimension illustrates the limits of most ritual practice, which is the empowerment of those who were initially controlled by ritual relations, due to the fact that participation in ritual activities requires a conscious consent. (209) Bell then emphasizes that both participation in ritualization and objectification of power are negotiated processes, and since ritualization may foster a misrecognition of the level of consensus, it limits the social efficacy of ritualization and affects both those who dominate and those who are dominated. (210)

Ritualization may be viewed as a source of power and authority for people in a position to influence ritual, and as a source of power for the individual. (211)  In one form, ritual may be seen as a “‘blunt tool.’” (212) Bell asserts that ritual power is interpreted as an external power tapped into by whoever holds an office. She maintains that there are three forms of empowerment for those in charge of ritualization:  objectification of office, hierarchization of practices, and creating tradition. (211) Furthermore, in some ways ritual defines the self. Tambiah and Bloch in contrast to some other scholars view the formalization of ritual as furthering the divide between one’s sense of self and one’s ritual practices. (216) Bell in part looks at ritual through the lens of individual empowerment. "The person who has prayed to his or her god, appropriating the social schemes of the hegemonic order in terms of an individual redemption, may be stronger because these acts are the very definitions of power, personhood, and the ability to act.” (217-8)

===''Ritual:  Perspectives and Dimensions''===
Bell's second major work was published in  1997.  She intended it to be "a more holistic and pragmatic orientation to multiple dimensions of the phenomenon of ritual" &lt;ref&gt;Bell, ''Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions''. Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1997, ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">'''Censorship of student media''' pertains to the suppression of free speech by school administrative bodies of student-run news operations. Typically this involves interfering with the operation and final publishing authority of a [[school newspaper]], radio, television or other electronic online content generated by students. 

While this has typically consisted of schools enforcing their authority to control the funding and distribution of publications, sometimes forms of censorship extend to expression not funded by or under the official auspices of the school system or college (for example, confiscating independently produced "underground" publications or imposing discipline for material posted on off-campus websites).

==United States==
The states of Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts and Oregon have all passed legislation fortifying student journalists' right to free expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Student Press Law Center |url=http://www.splc.org/knowyourrights/law_library.asp |title=Student Press Law center - Law Library |publisher=SPLC |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The nonprofit [[Student Press Law Center]] tracks and provides pro-bono legal aid to student-run media organizations in the U.S.

Some notable cases in the [[United States]] include:
* [[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier]],1988- A [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision that held that public school curricular student newspapers that have not been established as forums for student expression are subject to a lower level of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protection than independent student expression or newspapers established (by policy or practice) as forums for student expression. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1987/86-836&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]], 1969&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1968/21&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rosenberger v. University of Virginia]], 1995&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1994/94-329&lt;/ref&gt;
* Papish v. Board of Curators of University of Missouri - A [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that the University of Missouri could not discipline a college student for profanity and "indecent" sexual references in an "underground" publication that she funded and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;"Papish v. Board of Curators of the University of Missouri, 410 U.S. 667 (1973)." [http://media.okstate.edu/faculty/jsenat/jb3163/papish.html Papish v. Board of Curators of the University of Missouri], 410 U.S. 667 (1973). Accessed October 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Morse v. Frederick]], 2007- A [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in the case of 18-year-old Joseph Frederick, punished for displaying a banner reading "BONG HiTS 4 JESUS" across the street from a school during the 2002 Olympic Torch Relay, concluding that speech promoting illegal drug use during school-sanctioned events is unprotected. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/2006/06-278&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Earthquake Studies''' ('''CES'''), is an academic earth science, [[Earthquake engineering|earthquake studies]] and mathematical national research institute, located in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Center for Earthquake Studies"&gt;{{cite web|last=Center for Earthquake Studies|title=Center for Earthquake Studies|url=http://www.ncp.edu.pk/ces.php|work=Center for Earthquake Studies|publisher=Center for Earthquake Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The institute is headquartered in the campus area of the [[National Centre for Physics]] (NCP) and conducts mathematical research in [[earth science]]s, with the close coordination with the NCP.&lt;ref name="Center for Earthquake Studies"/&gt;

==History==
The institute was founded by the [[Government of Pakistan]] after taking the scientific advice from the science adviser dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]].&lt;ref name="Islamic Academy of Sciences"&gt;{{cite web|last=IAS|title=Dr. Professor Ishfaq Ahmad|url=http://www.ias-worldwide.org/profiles/prof81.htm|work=Islamic Academy of Sciences|publisher=Islamic Academy of Sciences|accessdate=13 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214010934/http://www.ias-worldwide.org/profiles/prof81.htm|archivedate=14 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was established in response to the deadliest and devastating [[2005 Pakistan earthquake|earthquake]] in Pakistan, on October 8, 2005.&lt;ref name="Daily Pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff report|title=Timely prediction can reduce quake devastation|url=http://dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\10\09\story_9-10-2009_pg11_2|accessdate=13 January 2013|newspaper=Daily Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially established as the Earthquake Studies Department at the National Center for Physics, it gained its independence shortly after its establishment. The CES undertakes research scientific studies in the development of expertise in anomalous [[Geophysics|geophysical phenomenon]] prior to the [[Seismic activity|seismic activities]]. The CES primarily produces its research outcomes by using the [[computer simulation]] and [[mathematical model]]ling to interpret the seismic activities and the [[earthquake prediction]]s.&lt;ref name="Center for Earthquake Studies"/&gt;

The CES's campus also includes the various ATROPATENA stations network, and supports its research and development with the close collaboration with the Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes.&lt;ref name="Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes"&gt;{{cite web|last=GNFE|title=International Station for the Forecasting of Earthquakes ATROPATENA-PK, Pakistan, Islamabad|url=http://seismonet.org/page.html?id_node=157|work=Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes|publisher=Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first and founding director was dr. [[Ahsan Mubarak]] who is still designated as the CES's senior scientist.&lt;ref name="Daily Pakistan"/&gt; As of current, dr. Muhammad Qaisar is the CES's current administrator.

''Not to be confused with [[computer engineering]].''

'''Computational science and engineering''' (CSE) is a relatively new discipline that deals with the development and application of computational models and simulations, often coupled with [[high-performance computing]], to solve complex physical problems arising in engineering analysis and design (computational engineering) as well as natural phenomena ([[computational science]]). CSE has been described as the "third mode of discovery" (next to theory and experimentation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cseprograms.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/CSEHandbook-Students-v11.pdf |title=Computational Science and Engineering Program: Graduate Student Handbook | website=cseprograms.gatech.edu |date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many fields, computer simulation is integral and therefore essential to business and research. Computer simulation provides the capability to enter fields that are either inaccessible to traditional experimentation or where carrying out traditional empirical inquiries is prohibitively expensive. CSE should neither be confused with pure [[computer science]], nor with [[computer engineering]], although a wide domain in the former is used in CSE (e.g., certain algorithms, data structures, parallel programming, high performance computing) and some problems in the latter can be modeled and solved with CSE methods (as an application area).

It is typically offered as a [[Master of Science|masters]] or [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] program at several institutions.

==Methods==
Computational Science and Engineering methods and frameworks include:
* [[High performance computing]] and techniques to gain efficiency (through change in computer architecture, parallel algorithms etc.)
* [[Computer model|Modeling]] and [[simulation]]
* [[Algorithms]] for solving discrete and continuous problems
* Analysis and visualization of data
* Mathematical foundations: Numerical and applied linear algebra, initial &amp; boundary value problems, Fourier analysis, optimization
* [[Data_science|Data Science]] for developing methods and algorithms to handle and  extract  knowledge from large scientific data
With regard to computing, computer programming, algorithms, and parallel computing play a major role in CSE. The most widely used programming language in the scientific community is [[FORTRAN]]. Recently, [[C++]] and C have increased in popularity over FORTRAN. Due to the wealth of legacy code in FORTRAN and its simpler syntax, the scientific computing community has been slow in completely adopting C++ as the lingua franca. Because of its very natural way of expressing mathematical computations, and its built-in visualization capacities, the proprietary language/environment [[MATLAB]] is also widely used, especially for rapid application development and model verification. [[Python (programming language)|Python]] along with external libraries (such as [[NumPy]], [[SciPy]], [[Matplotlib]]) has gain some popularity as a free and [[Copycenter]] alternative to MATLAB.
==Applications==

The '''disengagement theory''' of [[Ageing|aging]] states that "aging is an inevitable, mutual withdrawal or disengagement, resulting in decreased interaction between the aging person and others in the social system he belongs to".&lt;ref name="CummingHenry1979"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elaine Cumming|author2=William Earl Henry|title=Growing Old|year=1961|publisher=New York: Basic|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory claims that it is natural and acceptable for older adults to withdraw from society.&lt;ref name="Ebersole2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Priscilla Ebersole|title=Gerontological nursing and healthy aging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUlB72lFtIIC&amp;pg=PA108|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=8 April 2005|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-03165-3|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple variations on disengagement theory, such as moral-disengagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bandura |first=Albert |date=December 23, 2015 |title=Moral Disengagement: How People Do Harm and Live with Themselves |url= |location= |publisher=Worth Publishers |page= |isbn=978-1464160059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heald |first=seth |date= |title=The Pope's Climate Message in the United States: Moral Arguments and Moral Disengagement |url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2016/May-June%202016/pope_full.html |journal=[[Environment (magazine)|Environment]] |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |volume= |issue=May–June 2016 |pages= |doi= |access-date=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disengagement theory was formulated by Cumming and Henry in 1961 in the book ''Growing Old'', and it was the first theory of aging that [[Social sciences|social scientists]] developed.&lt;ref name="Achenbaum1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=W. Andrew Achenbaum|title=Crossing frontiers: gerontology emerges as a science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xD3pjIaa_CQC&amp;pg=PA107|accessdate=4 June 2011|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48194-6|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this theory has historical significance in [[gerontology]]. Since then, it has faced strong criticism since the theory was proposed as innate, [[Cultural universal|universal]], and unidirectional.&lt;ref name="BengtsonPutney2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vern L. Bengtson|author2=Norella Putney|title=Handbook of theories of aging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lQv7-xPm_jsC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=4 June 2011|year=2009|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8261-6251-9|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disengagement theory is one of three major psychosocial theories which describe how people develop in old age.&lt;ref name="Ebersole2005"/&gt; The other two major psychosocial theories are the [[Activity theory (aging)|activity theory]] and the [[Continuity theory (aging)|continuity theory]], and the disengagement theory comes to odds with both.

==Postulates==
Cumming and Henry provided the following nine postulates for the "process of disengagement":

*'''Postulate 1''': Everyone expects death, and one's abilities will likely deteriorate over time. As a result, every person will lose ties to others in his or her society.
*'''Postulate 2''': Because individual interactions between people strengthen norms, an individual who has fewer varieties of interactions has greater freedom from the norms imposed by interaction. Consequently, this form of disengagement becomes a circular or self-perpetuating process.
*'''Postulate 3''': Because men have a centrally instrumental role in America, and women a socioemotional one, disengagement differs between men and women.
*'''Postulate 4''': The individual's life is punctuated by ego changes. For example, aging, a form of ego change, causes knowledge and skill to deteriorate. However, success in an industrialized society demands certain knowledge and skill. To satisfy these demands, age-grading ensures that the young possess sufficient knowledge and skill to assume authority and the old retire before they lose their skills. This kind of disengagement is effected by the individual, prompted by either ego changes or the organisation—which is bound to organisational imperatives—or both.
*'''Postulate 5''': When both the individual and society are ready for disengagement, complete disengagement results. When neither is ready, continuing engagement results. When the individual is ready and society is not, a disjunction between the expectations of the individual and of the members of this social systems results, but engagement usually continues. When society is ready and the individual is not, the result of the disjunction is usually disengagement. 
*'''Postulate 6''': Man's central role is work, and woman's is marriage and family. If individuals abandon their central roles, they drastically lose social life space, and so suffer crisis and demoralisation unless they assume the different roles required by the disengaged state.
*'''Postulate 7:''' This postulate contains two main concepts.
**(a) Readiness for disengagement occurs if: 
***An individual is aware of the shortness of life and scarcity of time.
***Individuals perceive their life space decreasing.
***A person loses ego energy.
**(b) Each level of society grants individuals permission to disengage because of the following:
***Requirements of the rational-legal occupational system in an affluent society
***The nature of the nuclear family
***The differential death rate
*'''Postulate 8:''' Fewer interactions and disengagement from central roles lead to the relationships in the remaining roles changing. In turn, relational rewards become more diverse, and vertical solidarities are transformed to horizontal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cumming|first=Elaine|last2=Dean|first2=Lois R.|last3=Newell|first3=David S.|last4=McCaffrey|first4=Isabel|date=1960|title=Disengagement-A Tentative Theory of Aging|jstor=2786135|journal=Sociometry|volume=23|issue=1|pages=23–35|doi=10.2307/2786135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Postulate 9:''' Disengagement theory is independent of culture, but the form it takes is bound by culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">'''Elmore delay'''&lt;ref name="Elmore"/&gt; is a simple approximation to the delay through an [[RC network]] in an electronic system.  It is often used in applications such as [[logic synthesis]], [[delay calculation]], [[static timing analysis]], [[Placement (EDA)|placement]] and [[Routing (EDA)|routing]], since it is simple to compute (especially in [[Tree network|tree structured networks]],  which are the vast majority of signal nets within ICs) and is reasonably accurate.  Even where it is not accurate, it is usually faithful, in the sense that reducing the Elmore delay will almost always reduce the true delay, so it is still useful in optimization.

Elmore delay can be thought of in several ways, all mathematically identical.
*For tree structured networks, find the delay through each segment as the R ([[electrical resistance]]) times the downstream C (electrical [[capacitance]]).  Sum the delays from the [[Root_node#Root_nodes|root]] to the [[Traffic flow (computer networking)|sink]].
*Assume the output is a simple exponential, and find the exponential that has the same integral as the true response.  This is also equivalent to ''moment matching'' with one moment, since the first moment is a pure exponential.
*Find a one pole approximation to the true frequency response.  This is a first-order [[Padé approximant|Padé approximation]].

There are many extensions to Elmore delay.  It can be extended to upper and lower bounds,&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt; to include [[inductance]] as well as R and C, to be more accurate (higher order approximations)&lt;ref name="Tutuianu"/&gt; and so on.  See [[delay calculation]] for more details and references.

{{Emotion}}
'''Empathy''' is the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference, that is, the capacity to place oneself in another's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=392335 | title=The importance of empathy as an interviewing skill in medicine | author1=Bellet, Paul S. | author2=Michael J. Maloney | journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] | year=1991 | volume=226 | issue=13 | pages=1831–1832 | doi=10.1001/jama.1991.03470130111039 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626101006/http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=392335 | archivedate=June 26, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many definitions for empathy that encompass a broad range of [[emotional state]]s. Types of empathy include cognitive empathy, emotional empathy, and [[Wiktionary:somatic#Etymology|somatic]] empathy.&lt;ref name="Rothschild, B. 2006"&gt;Rothschild, B. (with Rand, M. L.). (2006). ''Help for the Helper: The psychophysiology of compassion fatigue and vicarious trauma.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The English word ''empathy'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word εμπάθεια (''empatheia'', meaning "physical affection or passion"). This, in turn, comes from εν (''en'', "in, at") and πάθος (''[[pathos]]'', "passion" or "suffering").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2334198 Empatheia, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was adapted by [[Hermann Lotze]] and [[Robert Vischer]] to create the German word ''Einfühlung'' ("feeling into"), which was translated by [[Edward B. Titchener]] into the English term empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Titchener E.B. (1909/2014) [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-01.pdf Introspection and empathy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726132552/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-01.pdf |date=July 26, 2014 }} Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences  2014; 7: 25–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| citeseerx=10.1.1.143.2396 | first = Vittorio | last = Gallese | year = 2003 | title = The Roots of Empathy: The Shared Manifold Hypothesis and the Neural Basis of Intersubjectivity | journal = Psychopathology | volume = 36 | pages = 171–180 | doi = 10.1159/000072786 | pmid=14504450 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in modern Greek, εμπάθεια means "malice", "hostility".

''[[Alexithymia]]'' is a word used to describe a deficiency in understanding, processing or describing emotions ''in oneself'' as opposed to in others.&lt;ref name="Bar-On"&gt;Bar-On, Reuven; Parker, James DA (2000). ''The Handbook of Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Development, Assessment, and Application at Home, School, and in the Workplace''. San Francisco, California: Jossey-Bass. {{ISBN|0-7879-4984-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This term comes from the combination of two Ancient Greek words: ἀλέξω (''alekso'', meaning "push away, repel, or protect") and ''θυμός'' (''thymos'', meaning "the soul, as the seat of emotion, feeling and thought"). Thus alexithymia literally means "pushing away your emotions".

== Definitions ==

Empathy definitions encompass a broad range of emotional states, including caring for other people and having a desire to help them; experiencing emotions that match another person's emotions; discerning what another person is thinking or feeling;&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G H M Pijnenborg, G.H.M. |author2=Spikman, J.M. |author3=Jeronimus, B.F. |author4=Aleman, A. |year=2012|title= Insight in schizophrenia: associations with empathy |journal= European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience|volume=263|issue=4|pages=299–307|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-012-0373-0|doi=10.1007/s00406-012-0373-0|pmid=23076736}}&lt;/ref&gt; and making less distinct the differences between the self and the other.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, S.D., &amp; Klein, K.J. (2001). Regulating the costs of empathy: the price of being human. ''Journal of Socio-Economics''.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be understood as having the separateness of defining oneself and another a blur.&lt;ref name="Decety, J" /&gt;

It also is the ability to feel and share another person's emotions. Some believe that empathy involves the ability to match another's emotions, while others believe that empathy involves being tenderhearted toward another person.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2011"&gt;Snyder, C. R., Shane J. Lopez, and Jennifer T. Pedrotti. Positive Psychology: The Scientific and Practical Explorations of Human Strengths. Second ed. Los Angeles: SAGE, 2011. 267–75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having empathy can include having the understanding that there are many factors that go into decision making and cognitive thought processes. Past experiences have an influence on the decision making of today. Understanding this allows a person to have empathy for individuals who sometimes make illogical decisions to a problem that most individuals would respond with an obvious response. Broken homes, childhood trauma, lack of parenting and many others factors can influence the connections in the brain which a person uses to make decisions in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dietrich|first1=Cindy|title=Decision Making: Factors that Influence Decision Making, Heuristics Used, and Decision Outcomes|url=https://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|website=Inquiries Journal|publisher=Inquiries Journal/Student Pulse LLC|accessdate=6 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003124530/http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|archivedate=October 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Hoffman]] is a psychologist who studied the development of empathy. According to Hoffman everyone is born with the capability of feeling empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth-Hanania|first=Ronit|last2=Davidov|first2=Maayan|last3=Zahn-Waxler|first3=Carolyn|date=2011-06-01|title=Empathy development from 8 to 16 months: Early signs of concern for others|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638311000506|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|volume=34|issue=3|pages=447–458|doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2011.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compassion]] and [[sympathy]] are terms associated with empathy.  Definitions vary, contributing to the challenge of defining empathy. Compassion is often defined as an emotion we feel when others are in need, which motivates us to help them. Sympathy is a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need. Some include in sympathy an [[empathic concern]], a feeling of concern for another, in which some scholars include the wish to see them better off or happier.&lt;ref name="Batson, C.D. 2009 pp. 3"&gt;Batson, C.D. (2009). These things called empathy: Eight related but distinct phenomena. In J. Decety and W. Ickes (Eds.), The Social Neuroscience of Empathy (pp.&amp;nbsp;3–15). Cambridge: [[MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Empathy is distinct also from [[pity]] and [[emotional contagion]].&lt;ref name="Batson, C.D. 2009 pp. 3"/&gt; Pity is feeling that another is in trouble and in need of help as they cannot fix their problems themselves, often described as "feeling sorry" for someone. Emotional contagion is when a person (especially an infant or a member of a [[crowd|mob]]) imitatively "catches" the emotions that others are showing without necessarily recognizing this is happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hatfield E. |author2=Cacioppo J. L. |author3=Rapson R. L. |year=1993 |title=Emotional contagion |url=http://www.elainehatfield.com/ch50.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=96–99 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119002643/http://www.elainehatfield.com/ch50.pdf |archivedate=November 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since empathy involves understanding the emotional states of other people, the way it is characterized is derived from the way emotions themselves are characterized. If, for example, emotions are taken to be centrally characterized by bodily feelings, then grasping the bodily feelings of another will be central to empathy. On the other hand, if emotions are more centrally characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires, then grasping these beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy. The ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated imaginative process. However, the basic capacity to recognize emotions is probably innate&lt;ref name="Baird, James D., and Laurie Nadel, 2010"&gt;Happiness Genes: Unlock the Positive Potential Hidden in Your DNA, New Page Books (April, 2010) {{ISBN|978-1-60163-105-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be achieved unconsciously. Yet it can be trained&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = O'Malley W. J. | year = 1999 | title = Teaching Empathy | url = | journal = America | volume = 180 | issue = 12| pages = 22–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved with various degrees of intensity or accuracy.

Empathy necessarily has a "more or less" quality. The paradigm case of an empathic interaction, however, involves a person communicating an accurate recognition of the significance of another person's ongoing intentional actions, associated emotional states, and personal characteristics in a manner that the recognized person can tolerate. Recognitions that are both accurate and tolerable are central features of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2002 | title = From passivity to competence: A conceptualization of knowledge, skill, tolerance, and empathy | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 338–345 | doi=10.1521/psyc.65.4.338.20239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2013 | title = The parameters of empathy: Core considerations for psychotherapy and supervision | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.2393689 | journal = Advances in Descriptive Psychology | volume = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human capacity to recognize the bodily feelings of another is related to one's imitative capacities, and seems to be grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in another with the [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Meltzoff A.N. |author2=Decety J. | year = 2003 | title = What imitation tells us about social cognition: A rapprochement between developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 358 | issue = 1431| pages = 491–500 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2002.1261 | pmid=12689375 | pmc=1351349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans seem to make the same immediate connection between the tone of voice and other vocal expressions and inner feeling.

In the field of positive psychology, empathy has also been compared with altruism and egotism. Altruism is behavior that is aimed at benefitting another person, while egotism is a behavior that is acted out for personal gain. Sometimes, when someone is feeling empathetic towards another person, acts of altruism occur. However, many question whether or not these acts of altruism are motivated by egotistical gains. According to positive psychologists, people can be adequately moved by their empathies to be [[altruistic]].&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/empathy/ |title=Empathy |publisher=plato.stanford.edu |date=2008-03-31 |accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification and types of empathy ==

Empathy is generally divided into two major components:&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers K, Dziobek I, Hassenstab J, Wolf OT, Convit A | date = Apr 2007 | title = Who cares?

== Development of empathy ==

=== Evolutionary development across species ===

An increasing number of studies in [[ethology|animal behavior]] and [[neuroscience]] claim that empathy is not restricted to humans, and is in fact as old as the mammals, or perhaps older. Examples include [[dolphin]]s saving humans from drowning or from [[shark attack]]s. Professor Tom White suggests that reports of [[cetacea]]ns having three times as many spindle cells — the nerve cells that convey empathy — in their brains as we do might mean these highly-social animals have a great awareness of one another's feelings.&lt;ref&gt;White, T. I. (2007). In defense of dolphins: the new moral frontier. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

A multitude of behaviors has been observed in [[primate]]s, both in captivity and in the wild, and in particular in [[bonobo]]s, which are reported as the most empathetic of all the primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandin|first=Jo|title=Bonobos: Encounters in Empathy|year=2007|publisher=Zoological Society of Milwaukee &amp; The Foundation for Wildlife Conservation, Inc.|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0-9794151-0-4|page=109|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bonobos-Encounters-Empathy-Jo-Sandin/dp/0979415101|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124025312/https://www.amazon.com/Bonobos-Encounters-Empathy-Jo-Sandin/dp/0979415101|archivedate=November 24, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The age of empathy: nature's lessons for a kinder society By: Waal, F.

For University of Chicago neurobiologist Jean Decety, [empathy] is not specific to humans. He argues that there is strong evidence that empathy has deep evolutionary, biochemical, and neurological underpinnings, and that even the most advanced forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core mechanisms associated with affective communication, social [[attachment theory|attachment]], and [[parental care]].&lt;ref name="Decety, J"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Decety J | year = 2011 | title = The neuroevolution of empathy | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1231 | issue = 1| pages = 35–45 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06027.x | pmid=21651564|bibcode = 2011NYASA1231...35D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Core neural circuits that are involved in empathy and caring include the [[brainstem]], the [[amygdala]], [[hypothalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Svetlova M. | year = 2012 | title = Putting together phylogenetic and ontogenetic perspectives on empathy | url = | journal = Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 1–24 | doi = 10.1016/j.dcn.2011.05.003 | pmid = 22682726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since all definitions of empathy involves an element of for others, all distinctions between egoism and empathy fail at least for beings lacking self-awareness. Since the first [[mammal]]s lacked a self-aware distinction between self and other, as shown by most mammals failing at [[mirror test]]s, the first mammals or anything more evolutionarily primitive than them cannot have had a context of default egoism requiring an empathy mechanism to be transcended. However, there are numerous examples in artificial intelligence research showing that simple reactions can carry out de facto functions the agents have no concept of, so this does not contradict evolutionary explanations of parental care. However, such mechanisms would be unadapted to self-other distinction and beings already dependent on some form of behavior benefitting each other or their offspring would never be able to evolve a form of self-other distinction that necessitated evolution of specialized non-preevolved and non-preevolvable mechanisms for retaining empathic behavior in the presence of self-other distinction, and so a fundamental neurological distinction between egoism and empathy cannot exist in any species.&lt;ref&gt;How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence, 2006, by Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence of Apes and Other Rational Beings 2003, Duane M.

=== Ontogenetic development in the individual ===
By the age of two years, children normally begin to display the fundamental behaviors of empathy by having an emotional response that corresponds with another person's emotional state.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, M.L. (2000). ''Empathy and Moral Development''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier, at one year of age, infants have some rudiments of empathy, in the sense that they understand that, just like their own actions, other people's actions have goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Meyer M. | year = 2008 | title = From emotion resonance to empathic understanding: A social developmental neuroscience account | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 1053–1080 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579408000503 | pmid = 18838031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., Spinrad, T.L., &amp; Sadovsky, A.

''Nature Neuroscience'', 9&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, [[toddler]]s will comfort others or show concern for them at as early an age as two. Also during the second year, toddlers will play games of falsehood or "pretend" in an effort to fool others, and this requires that the child know what others believe before he or she can manipulate those beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zahn-Waxler C. |author2=Radke-Yarrow M. | year = 1990 | title = The origins of empathic concern | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 107–130 | doi = 10.1007/BF00991639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to develop these traits, it is essential to expose your child to face-to-face interactions and opportunities and lead them away from a [[sedentary lifestyle]].

According to researchers at the [[University of Chicago]] who used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), children between the ages of 7 and 12 years appear to be naturally inclined to feel empathy for others in pain. Their findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Michalska K.J. |author3=Akitsuki Y. | year = 2008 | title = Who caused the pain?

The research also found additional aspects of the brain were activated when youngsters saw another person intentionally hurt by another individual, including regions involved in moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/542456/ Brain Scans Show Children Naturally Prone to Empathy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102202203/http://newswise.com/articles/view/542456/ |date=January 2, 2009 }} Newswise. Retrieved July 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being able to show some signs of empathy, including attempting to comfort a crying baby, from as early as 18 months to two years, most children do not show a fully fledged [[theory of mind]] until around the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wimmer H. |author2=Perner J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–28 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind involves the ability to understand that other people may have beliefs that are different from one's own, and is thought to involve the cognitive component of empathy.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, 2003"/&gt; Children usually become capable of passing "false belief" tasks, considered to be a test for a theory of mind, around the age of four. Individuals with [[autism]] often find using a theory of mind very difficult (e.g. Baron-Cohen, Leslie &amp; Frith, 1988; the [[Sally-Anne test]]).

Empathetic maturity is a cognitive structural theory developed at the Yale University School of Nursing and addresses how adults conceive or understand the personhood of patients. The theory, first applied to nurses and since applied to other professions, postulates three levels that have the properties of cognitive structures. The third and highest level is held to be a meta-ethical theory of the moral structure of care. Those adults operating with level-III understanding synthesize systems of justice and care-based ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Douglas|title=Empathetic Maturity: Theory of Moral Point of View in Clinical Relations|journal=Advances in Nursing Science|date=September 2001|volume=24|issue=1|pages=36–46|url=http://www.nursingcenter.com/library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=430999|pmid=11554532|doi=10.1097/00012272-200109000-00006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907234403/http://www.nursingcenter.com/library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=430999|archivedate=September 7, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major theories and empirical findings ==

=== Influence of empathy on helping behavior ===
Emotions motivate individual behavior that aids in solving communal challenges as well as guiding group decisions about social exchange. Additionally, recent research has shown individuals who report regular experiences of gratitude engage more frequently in prosocial behaviors. Positive emotions like empathy or gratitude are linked to a more positive continual state and these people are far more likely to help others than those not experiencing a positive emotional state.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, M. 2006" /&gt; Thus, empathy's influence extends beyond relating to other's emotions, it correlates with an increased positive state and likeliness to aid others. Measures of empathy show that mirror neurons are activated during arousal of sympathetic responses and prolonged activation shows increased probability to help others.

Research investigating the social response to natural disasters looked at the characteristics associated with individuals who help victims. Researchers found that cognitive empathy, rather than emotional empathy, predicted helping behavior towards victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marjanovic|first=Zdravko|author2=Struthers, Greenglass |title=Who Helps Natural-Disaster Victims? Assessment of Trait and Situational Predictors|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|date=August 8, 2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=245–267|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2011.01262.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2011.01262.x/asset/asap1262.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hvtvu9nj&amp;s=2892713f7a99d42574ccda68fa2bbfc1c1578249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have posited that taking on the perspectives of others (cognitive empathy) allows these individuals to better empathize with victims without as much discomfort, whereas sharing the emotions of the victims (emotional empathy) can cause emotional distress, helplessness, victim-blaming, and ultimately can lead to avoidance rather than helping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einolf|first=Christopher|title=Is Cognitive Empathy More Important than Affective Empathy? A Response to "Who Helps Natural-Disaster Victims?"|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|date=March 13, 2012|volume=12|issue=1|pages=268–271|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2012.01281.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2012.01281.x/asset/asap1281.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hvtvq647&amp;s=df598d6cfad7025a88420f2f5c207c0c980672fa|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, despite this evidence for empathy-induced altruistic motivation, egoistic explanations may still be possible. For example, one alternative explanation for the problem-specific helping pattern may be that the sequence of events in the same problem condition first made subjects sad when they empathized with the problem and then maintained or enhanced subjects’ sadness when they were later exposed to the same plight. Consequently, the negative state relief model would predict substantial helping among imagine-set subjects in the same condition, which is what occurred. An intriguing question arises from such findings concerning whether it is possible to have mixed motivations for helping. If this is the case, then simultaneous egoistic and altruistic motivations would occur. This would allow for a stronger sadness-based motivation to obscure the effects of an empathic concern-based altruistic motivation. The observed study would then have sadness as less intense than more salient altruistic motivation. Consequently, relative strengths of different emotional reactions, systematically related to the need situation, may moderate the predominance of egoistic or altruistic motivation (Dovidio, 1990). But it has been shown that researchers in this area who have used very similar procedures sometimes obtain apparently contradictory results. Superficial procedural differences such as precisely when a manipulation is introduced could also lead to divergent results and conclusions. It is therefore vital for any future research to move toward even greater standardization of measurement. Thus, an important step in solving the current theoretical debate concerning the existence of altruism may involve reaching common methodological ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dovidio J.F. |author2=Allen J.L. |author3=Schroeder D.A. | year = 1990 | title = Specificity of empathy-induced helping: Evidence for altruistic motivation | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 249–260 | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1991-01135-001 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroscientific basis of empathy ===
Contemporary neuroscience has allowed us to understand the neural basis of the human mind's ability to understand and process emotion. Studies today enable us to see the activation of mirror neurons and attempt to explain the basic processes of empathy. By isolating these mirror neurons and measuring the neural basis for human mind reading and emotion sharing abilities,&lt;ref name="Keen Suzanne 2006 207–36"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Keen | first = Suzanne | year = 2006 | title = A Theory of Narrative Empathy | url = | journal = Narrative | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 207–36 | doi=10.1353/nar.2006.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; science has come one step closer to finding the reason for reactions like empathy. Neuroscientists have already discovered that people scoring high on empathy tests have especially busy mirror neuron systems in their brains (Dr. Christian Keysers). {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect, provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another's emotional state. In a way we mirror or mimic the emotional response that we would expect to feel in that condition or context, much like sympathy. Unlike personal distress, empathy is not characterized by aversion to another's emotional response. Additionally, empathizing with someone requires a distinctly sympathetic reaction where personal distress demands avoidance of distressing matters. This distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy, or empathetic concern, and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action.&lt;ref name="Keen Suzanne 2006 207–36"/&gt; Empathy leads to sympathy by definition unlike the over-aroused emotional response that turns into personal distress and causes a turning-away from another's distress.

In empathy we feel what we believe are the emotions of another, which makes it both affective and cognitive by most psychologists.&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"/&gt; In this sense, arousal and empathy promote prosocial behavior as we accommodate each other to feel similar emotions. For social beings, negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to survival as being able to navigate the physical landscape.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, M. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bartlett M.

=== Gender differences ===
The literature commonly indicates that females tend to have more cognitive empathy than males. On average, female subjects score higher than males on the [[Empathy Quotient]] (EQ), while males tend to score higher on the [[Systemizing Quotient]] (SQ). Both males and females with [[Autism spectrum|autistic spectrum disorders]] usually score lower on the EQ and higher on SQ ([[#Autism|see below]] for more detail on autism and empathy).&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, 2003"/&gt; However, a series of studies, using a variety of neurophysiological measures, including [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cheng Y. |author2=Tzeng O.J. |author3=Decety J. |author4=Hsieh J.C. | year = 2006 | title = Gender differences in the human mirror system: a magnetoencephalography study | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 17 | issue = 11| pages = 1115–1119 | doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000223393.59328.21 | pmid=16837838}}&lt;/ref&gt; spinal reflex excitability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cheng Y. |author2=Decety J. |author3=Hsieh J.C. |author4=Hung D. |author5=Tzeng O.J. | year = 2007 | title = Gender differences in spinal excitability during observation of bipedal locomotion | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 18 | issue = 9| pages = 887–890 | doi=10.1097/WNR.0b013e3280ebb486 | pmid=17515795}}&lt;/ref&gt; electroencephalography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yang C.Y. |author2=Decety J. |author3=Lee S. |author4=Chen G. |author5=Cheng Y. | year = 2009 | title = Gender differences in the Mu rhythm during empathy for pain: An electroencephalographic study | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1251 | issue = | pages = 176–184 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2008.11.062 | pmid = 19083993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cheng Y., Lee P., Yang C.Y., Lin C.P., Decety J. | year = 2008 | title = Gender differences in the mu rhythm of the human mirror-neuron system | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 3 | issue = 5| page = e2113 | bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.2113C | last2 = Lee | last3 = Yang | last4 = Lin | last5 = Hung | last6 = Decety | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002113 | editor1-last = Rustichini | editor1-first = Aldo | pmid=18461176 | pmc=2361218}}&lt;/ref&gt; and N400 paradigm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When neurons do not mirror the agent's intentions: Sex differences in neural coding of goal-directed actions|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41190212_When_neurons_do_not_mirror_the_agent's_intentions_Sex_differences_in_neural_coding_of_goal-directed_actions|journal = Neuropsychologia|pages = 1454–1463|volume = 48|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.01.015|first = Alice Mado|last = Proverbio|first2 = Federica|last2 = Riva|first3 = Alberto|last3 = Zani|year = 2010|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908202105/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41190212_When_neurons_do_not_mirror_the_agent%27s_intentions_Sex_differences_in_neural_coding_of_goal-directed_actions|archivedate = September 8, 2017|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; have documented the presence of an overall gender difference in the human mirror neuron system, with female participants tending to exhibit stronger motor resonance than male participants.

Using [[fMRI]], neuroscientist [[Tania Singer]] showed that empathy-related neural responses tended to be significantly lower in males when observing an "unfair" person experiencing pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singer T, Seymour B, O'Doherty JP, Stephan KE, Dolan RJ, Frith CD |date=Jan 2006 | title = Empathic neural responses are modulated by the perceived fairness of others | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 439 | issue = 7075| pages = 466–9 | bibcode = 2006Natur.439..466S | last2 = Seymour | last3 = O'Doherty | last4 = Stephan | last5 = Dolan | last6 = Frith | doi = 10.1038/nature04271 | pmid = 16421576 | pmc = 2636868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An analysis from the journal of ''[[Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews]]''  also found that, overall, there are sex differences in empathy from birth, growing larger with age and which remains consistent and stable across lifespan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Females, on average, were found to have higher empathy than males, while children with higher empathy regardless of gender continue to be higher in empathy throughout development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Empathy: Gender effects in brain and behavior|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265859585_Empathy_Gender_Effects_in_Brain_and_Behavior|journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|pages = 604–627|volume = 46|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.09.001|first = Leonardo|last = Christov-Moore|first2 = Elizabeth A.|last2 = Simpson|first3 = Gino|last3 = Coudé|first4 = Kristina|last4 = Grigaityte|first5 = Marco|last5 = Iacoboni|first6 = Pier Francesco|last6 = Ferrari|pmid = 25236781|pmc = 5110041|year = 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170814055810/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265859585_Empathy_Gender_Effects_in_Brain_and_Behavior|archivedate = August 14, 2017|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis of brain tools such as event related potentials found that females who saw human suffering tended to have higher ERP waveforms than males.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Another investigation with similar brain tools such as [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] amplitudes found, on average, higher N400 in females in response to social situations which positively correlated with self-reported empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Structural fMRI studies also found females to have larger [[grey matter]] volumes in posterior [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior frontal]] and anterior [[Inferior parietal lobule|inferior parietal cortex]]  areas which are correlated with [[mirror neuron]]s in [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] literature.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Females also tended to have a stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The researchers found that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely to be explained by any environment influences but rather might have some roots in human evolution and inheritance.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Throughout prehistory, females were the primary nurturers and caretakers of children; so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions. According to the ''Primary Caretaker Hypothesis'', prehistoric males did not have the same selective pressure as primary caretakers; so therefore this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Empathy in educational contexts ===
Another growing focus of investigation is how empathy manifests in education between teachers and learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = McAlinden | first = Maggie | contribution = Can teachers know learners' minds?

This theory also states that empathy is learnable. However, research also shows that it is more difficult to empathize when there are differences between people including status, culture, religion, language, skin colour, gender, age and so on.&lt;ref name="Tettegah, S. 2007"/&gt;

An important target of the method [[Learning by teaching]] (LbT) is to train systematically and, in each lesson, teach empathy. Students have to transmit new content to their classmates, so they have to reflect continuously on the mental processes of the other students in the classroom. This way it is possible to develop step-by-step the students' feeling for group reactions and networking. Carl R. Rogers pioneered research in effective psychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or caring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to have. Other research and publications by Tausch, Aspy, Roebuck. Lyon, and meta-analyses by Cornelius-White, corroborated the importance of these person-centered traits.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius-White, J. H. D., and A. P. Harbaugh. (2010).

=== Empathy in intercultural contexts ===
In order to achieve intercultural empathy, psychologists have employed empathy training. One study hypothesized that empathy training would increase the measured level of relational empathy among the individuals in the experimental group when compared to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Keillor|first=Robin Michelle|date=1999|title=Empathy and intergroup relations: a study in cross-cultural relationship building|publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|oclc=44999879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also hypothesized that empathy training would increase communication among the experimental group, and that perceived satisfaction with group dialogue would also increase among the experimental group. To test this, the experimenters used the Hogan Empathy Scale, the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory, and questionnaires.  Using these measures, the study found that empathy training was not successful in increasing relational empathy. Also, communication and satisfaction among groups did not increase as a result of the empathy training. While there didn’t seem to be a clear relationship between empathy and relational empathy training, the study did report that "relational empathy training appeared to foster greater expectations for a deep dialogic process resulting in treatment differences in perceived depth of communication".

US researchers William Weeks, Paul Pedersen et al. state that developing intercultural empathy enables the interpretation of experiences or perspectives from more than one worldview.&lt;ref&gt;William Weeks, Paul Pedersen, &amp; Richard Brislin (1979).

University of Portland.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developmental and environmental influences ===

The environment has been another interesting topic of study. Many theorize that environmental factors, such as parenting style and relationships, play a significant role in the development of empathy in children. Empathy promotes pro social relationships, helps mediate aggression, and allows us to relate to others, all of which make empathy an important emotion among children.

A study done by Caroline Tisot  looked at how a variety of environmental factors affected the development of empathy in young children. Parenting style, parent empathy, and prior social experiences were looked at. The children participating in the study were asked to complete an effective empathy measure, while the children's parents completed the Parenting Practices Questionnaire, which assesses parenting style, and the Balanced Emotional Empathy scale.

This study found that a few parenting practices – as opposed to parenting style as a whole – contributed to the development of empathy in children. These practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings. The results also show that the development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent. Paternal warmth was found to be significantly important, and was positively related to empathy within children, especially in boys. However, maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy within children, especially in girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Tisot|first=Caroline Monforte|date=2003|title=Environmental contributions to empathy development in young children|publisher=[[Temple University]]|oclc=56772472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been found that empathy can be disrupted due to trauma in the brain such as a stroke. In most cases empathy is usually impaired if a lesion or stroke occurs on the right side of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Richard|last2=Oishi|first2=Kenichi|last3=Hsu|first3=John|last4=Lindquist|first4=Martin|last5=Gottesman|first5=Rebecca F.|last6=Jarso|first6=Samson|last7=Crainiceanu|first7=Ciprian|last8=Mori|first8=Susumu|last9=Hillis|first9=Argye E.|date=2013-08-01|title=Acute lesions that impair affective empathy|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/136/8/2539|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=136|issue=8|pages=2539–2549|doi=10.1093/brain/awt177|issn=0006-8950|pmc=3722353|pmid=23824490|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129031206/http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/136/8/2539|archivedate=November 29, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this it has been found that damage to the frontal lobe, which is primarily responsible for emotional regulation, can impact profoundly on a person's capacity to experience empathy toward another individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sousa|first=Arielle de|last2=McDonald|first2=Skye|last3=Rushby|first3=Jacqueline|date=2012-07-01|title=Changes in emotional empathy, affective responsivity, and behavior following severe traumatic brain injury|journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology|volume=34|issue=6|pages=606–623|doi=10.1080/13803395.2012.667067|issn=1380-3395|pmid=22435955}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have suffered from an acquired brain injury also show lower levels of empathy according to previous studies.

This is again suggestive of the fact that understanding one's own emotions is key in being able to identify with another individual’s emotional state.

== Applications ==

The empathy-altruism relationship also has broad  for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential pro-social goals, thus inducing a type of bias. Researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater collective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a person for whom empathy is felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Batson C.

On a more positive note, aroused individuals in an empathetic manner may focus on the long-term welfare rather than just the short-term of those in need. Empathy-based socialization is very different from current practices directed toward inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping, modeling and internalized guilt. Therapeutic programs built around facilitating altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective taking and empathetic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations, especially in the long-term. At a societal level, experiments have indicated that empathy-induced altruism can be used to improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups, even used to improve racial attitudes, actions toward people with AIDS, the homeless and even convicts. Such resulting altruism has also been found to increase cooperation in competitive situations.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, C.R. and Lopez, S.J. (Eds.). (2009). Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology. Second ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Individual differences ==

Empathy in the broadest sense refers to a reaction of one individual to another's emotional state. Recent years have seen increased movement toward the idea that empathy occurs from motor neuron imitation. But, how do we account for individual differences in empathy? It cannot be said that empathy is a single unipolar construct but rather a set of constructs. In essence, not every individual responds equally and uniformly the same to various circumstances. The Empathic Concern scale assesses "other-oriented" feelings of sympathy and concern and the Personal Distress scale measures "self-oriented" feelings of personal anxiety and unease. The combination of these scales helps reveal those that might not be classified as empathetic and expands the narrow definition of empathy. Using this approach we can enlarge the basis of what it means to possess empathetic qualities and create a multi-faceted definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = Mark H | year = 1983 | title = Measuring Individual Differences in Empathy: Evidence for a Multidimensional Approach | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113–26 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral and neuroimaging research show that two underlying facets of the personality dimensions Extraversion and Agreeableness (the Warmth-Altruistic personality profile) are associated with empathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions important for empathic processing (medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=BW|last2=Brook|first2=M|last3=Remillard|first3=L|last4=Ishak|first4=A|last5=Anderson|first5=IW|last6=Filkowski|first6=MM|title=I know how you feel: the warm-altruistic personality profile and the empathic brain.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2015|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0120639|pmid=25769028|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0120639|pmc=4359130|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1020639H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empathic anger and distress ==

=== Anger ===

Empathic anger is an [[emotion]], a form of empathic distress.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w126637624m00103/ |title= Empathy and justice motivation|doi=10.1007/BF00991641 |accessdate=August 29, 2012 |year=1990|last1=Hoffman|first1=Martin L.|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=14|issue=2|pages=151–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empathic anger is felt in a situation where someone else is being hurt by another person or thing. It is possible to see this form of anger as a [[pro-social]] emotion.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Empathic anger has direct effects on both helping and punishing desires. Empathic anger can be divided into two sub-categories: trait empathic anger and state empathic anger.&lt;ref&gt;Abstract: Assessing a new dimension of empathy: Empathic anger as a predictor of helping and punishing desires, Vitaglione, Guy D. &amp; Barnett, Mark A. {{cite web |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15290642 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514194128/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15290642 |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between empathy and anger response towards another person has also been investigated, with two studies basically finding that the higher a person's perspective taking ability, the less angry they were in response to a provocation. Empathic concern did not, however, significantly predict anger response, and higher personal distress was associated with increased anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mohr P. |author2=Howells K. |author3=Gerace A. |author4=Day A. |author5=Wharton M. | year = 2007 | title = The role of perspective taking in anger arousal | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 507–517 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.12.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Day A. |author2=Mohr P. |author3=Howells K. |author4=Gerace A. |author5=Lim L. | year = 2012 | title = The role of empathy in anger arousal in violent offenders and university students | url = | journal = International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology | volume = 56 | issue = 4|pages = 599–613 | doi = 10.1177/0306624X11431061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distress ===

Empathic distress is feeling the perceived pain of another person. This feeling can be transformed into empathic anger, feelings of injustice, or [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. These emotions can be perceived as pro-social, and some say they can be seen as motives for moral behavior.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;

== Impairment in psychopathology ==

A difference in distribution between affective and cognitive empathy has been observed in various conditions. [[Psychopathy]] and [[narcissism]] have been associated with impairments in affective but not cognitive empathy, whereas [[bipolar disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder|borderline traits]] have been associated with deficits in cognitive but not affective empathy.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; [[Autism spectrum disorder]]s have been associated with various combinations, including deficits in cognitive empathy as well as deficits in both cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldwell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zero degrees" /&gt; [[Schizophrenia]], too, has been associated with deficits in both types of empathy.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017 |title=Empathic abilities in people with schizophrenia. |year=2008 |last1=Bora |first1=E. |last2=Gökçen |first2=S. |last3=Veznedaroglu |first3=B. |pmid=18514324 |volume=160 |issue=1 |journal=Psychiatry Res |pages=23–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in people without conditions such as these, the balance between affective and cognitive empathy varies.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt;

=== Autism ===

The interaction between empathy and [[autism spectrum|autism]] is a complex and ongoing field of research. Several different factors are proposed to be at play.

A study of [[high-functioning autism|high-functioning]] adults with autistic spectrum disorders found an increased prevalence of [[alexithymia]],&lt;ref name="Hill et al."&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hill E. |author2=Berthoz S. |author3=Frith U |year=2004 |title=Brief report: cognitive processing of own emotions in individuals with autistic spectrum disorder and in their relatives. |url=http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/2585/1/hill_berth_frith_jadd04.pdf |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=229–235 |doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000022613.41399.14 |pmid=15162941 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619122446/http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/2585/1/hill_berth_frith_jadd04.pdf |archivedate=June 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a personality construct characterized by the inability to recognize and articulate emotional arousal in oneself or others.&lt;ref name="Hill et al." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, G.J. and Bagby, R.M &amp; Parker, J.D.A.

One study found that, relative to typically developing children, high-functioning autistic children showed reduced [[mirror neuron]] activity in the brain's [[inferior frontal gyrus]] (pars opercularis) while imitating and observing emotional expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dapretto M. |author2=Davies M.S. |author3=Pfeifer J.H. |author4=Scott A.A. |author5=Sigman M. |author6=Bookheimer S.Y. |author7=Iacoboni M. | year = 2006 | title = Understanding emotions in others: mirror neuron dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 28–31 | doi=10.1038/nn1611 | pmid=16327784 | pmc=3713227}}&lt;/ref&gt; EEG evidence revealed that there was significantly greater mu suppression in the sensorimotor cortex of autistic individuals. Activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain, suggesting that a dysfunctional mirror neuron system may underlie social and communication deficits observed in autism, including impaired theory of mind and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Oberman. – 'EEG evidence for mirror neuron dysfunction in autism spectrum' in Brain Research (2005) p.190&lt;/ref&gt; The mirror neuron system is essential for emotional empathy.&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;

Previous studies have suggested that autistic individuals have an impaired [[theory of mind]]. Theory of mind is the ability to understand the perspectives of others.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; The terms cognitive empathy and [[theory of mind]] are often used synonymously, but due to a lack of studies comparing theory of mind with types of empathy, it is unclear whether these are equivalent.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; Theory of mind relies on structures of the temporal lobe and the pre-frontal cortex, and empathy, i.e. the ability to share the feelings of others, relies on the sensorimotor cortices as well as limbic and para-limbic structures.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The lack of clear distinctions between [[theory of mind]] and cognitive empathy may have resulted in an incomplete understanding of the empathic abilities of those with Asperger syndrome; many reports on the empathic deficits of individuals with Asperger syndrome are actually based on impairments in theory of mind.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gillberg | first1 = C.

Studies have found that individuals on the autistic spectrum self-report lower levels of empathic concern, show less or absent comforting responses toward someone who is suffering, and report equal or higher levels of personal distress compared to controls.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The combination in those on the autism spectrum of reduced empathic concern and increased personal distress may lead to the overall reduction of empathy.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; Professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] suggests that those with classic [[autism]] often lack both cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="zero degrees" /&gt; However, other research has found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton AF | title = Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 881–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19508497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.621.6275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that people with [[Asperger syndrome]] may have problems understanding others' perspectives in terms of theory of mind, but the average person with the condition demonstrates equal empathic concern as, and higher personal distress, than controls.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; The existence of individuals with heightened personal distress on the autism spectrum has been offered as an explanation as to why at least some people with autism would appear to have heightened emotional empathy,&lt;ref name="response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;Phoebe Caldwell, "Letters", London Times, Dec 30 2005&lt;/ref&gt; although increased personal distress may be an effect of heightened egocentrism, emotional empathy depends on [[mirror neuron]] activity (which, as described previously, has been found to be reduced in those with autism), and empathy in people on the autism spectrum is generally reduced.&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The empathy deficits present in autism spectrum disorders may be more indicative of impairments in the ability to take the perspective of others, while the empathy deficits in psychopathy may be more indicative of impairments in responsiveness to others’ emotions. These “disorders of empathy” further highlight the importance of the ability to empathize by illustrating some of the consequences to disrupted empathy development.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Nicole M., and Daniel S. Messinger. "The development of empathy: How, when, and why." ''Moral Behavior and Free Will: A Neurobiological and Philosophical Aprroach'' (2011): 341-368.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] (E-S) suggests that people may be classified on the basis of their capabilities along two independent dimensions, empathizing (E) and systemizing (S). These capabilities may be inferred through tests that measure someone's Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ). Five different "brain types" can be observed among the population based on the scores, which should correlate with differences at the neural level. In the E-S theory, autism and Asperger syndrome are associated with below-average empathy and average or above-average systemizing. The E-S theory has been extended into the Extreme Male Brain theory, which suggests that people with an autism spectrum condition are more likely to have an "Extreme Type S" brain type, corresponding with above-average systemizing but challenged empathy.&lt;ref name="e-s theory"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon |year=2009 |title=Autism: The Empathizing–Systemizing (E-S) Theory |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |volume=1156 |issue=The Year in Cognitive Neuroscience 2009 |pages=68&amp;ndash;80 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x |bibcode = 2009NYASA1156...68B |pmid=19338503 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Extreme Male Brain (EMB) theory proposes that individuals on the autistic spectrum are characterized by impairments in empathy due to sex differences in the brain: specifically, people with autism spectrum conditions show an exaggerated male profile.

While the discovery of a higher incidence of diagnosed autism in some groups of second generation immigrant children was initially explained as a result of too little vitamin D during pregnancy in dark-skinned people further removed from the equator, that explanation did not hold up for the later discovery that diagnosed autism was most frequent in children of newly immigrated parents and decreased if they immigrated many years earlier as that would further deplete the body's store of vitamin D. Nor could it explain the similar effect on diagnosed autism for some European migrants America in the 1940s that was reviewed in the 2010s as a shortage of vitamin D was never a problem for these light-skinned immigrants to America. The decrease of diagnosed autism with the number of years the parents had lived in their new country also cannot be explained by the theory that the cause is genetic no matter if it is said to be caused by actual ethnic differences in autism gene prevalence or a selective migration of individuals predisposed for autism since such genes, if present, would not go away over time. It have therefore been suggested that autism is not caused by an innate deficit in a specific social circuitry in the brain, also citing other research suggesting that specificalized social brain mechanisms may not exist even in neurotypic people, but that particular features of appearance and/or minor details in behavior are met with exclusion from socialization that shows up as apparently reduced social ability.&lt;ref&gt;"Immigrant Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: The Relationship between the Perspective of the Professionals and the Parents’ Point of View" 2013 Milena Pereira Pondé PhD, Cécile Rousseau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Prevalence of autism according to maternal immigrant status and ethnic origin" 2011 Marie-Jose Dealberto&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychopathy ===

Psychopathy is a personality disorder partly characterized by antisocial and aggressive behaviors, as well as emotional and interpersonal deficits including shallow emotions and a lack of [[remorse]] and empathy.&lt;ref name="Cleckly, 1941"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cleckly|first=H.

A large body of research suggests that psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of fear and [[sadness]]), including decreased activation of the [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] and [[Extrastriate cortex|extrastriate cortical]] regions, which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear, and impairments of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Skelly, L.

A recent study on psychopaths found that, under certain circumstances, they could willfully empathize with others, and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls. Psychopathic criminals were brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual. The psychopaths' empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual, and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt. The research suggests how psychopaths could switch empathy on at will, which would enable them to be both callous and charming. The team who conducted the study say it is still unknown how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have, though they propose it could be possible to bring psychopaths closer to rehabilitation by helping them to activate their "empathy switch". Others suggested that despite the results of the study, it remained unclear whether psychopaths' experience of empathy was the same as that of controls, and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic.&lt;ref name="empathy switch"&gt;{{cite news |title=Psychopathic criminals have empathy switch |first=Melissa |last=Hogenboom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |newspaper=BBC News |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727080108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |archivedate=July 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Tanya.

Work conducted by Professor [[Jean Decety]] with large samples of incarcerated psychopaths offers additional insights. In one study, psychopaths were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being intentionally hurt. They were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of pain. The participants in the high-psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], [[amygdala]] and [[periaqueductal gray]] parts of the brain, but more activity in the [[striatum]] and the [[insular cortex|insula]] when compared to control participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Decety | first1 = J. | last2 = Skelly | first2 = L.

It was predicted that people who have high levels of psychopathy would have sufficient levels of cognitive empathy but would lack in their ability to use affective empathy. People that scored highly on psychopathy measures were less likely to portray affective empathy. There was a strong negative correlation showing that psychopathy and affective empathy correspond strongly. The DANVA-2 portrayed those who scored highly on the psychopathy scale do not lack in recognising emotion in facial expressions. Therefore, individuals who have high scores on psychopathy and do not lack in perspective-talking ability but do lack in compassion and the negative incidents that happen to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mullins-Nelson | first1 = Jana L. | last2 = Salekin | first2 = Randall T. | last3 = Anne-Marie | first3 = R.

Despite studies suggesting deficits in emotion perception and imagining others in pain, professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] claims psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy, which would imply an intact ability to read and respond to behaviors, social cues and what others are feeling. Psychopathy is, however, associated with impairment in the other major component of empathy—affective (emotional) empathy—which includes the ability to ''feel'' the suffering and emotions of others (what scientists would term as [[emotional contagion]]), and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims. Such a dissociation of affective and cognitive empathy has indeed been demonstrated for aggressive offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winter|first=Korina|last2=Spengler|first2=Stephanie|last3=Bermpohl|first3=Felix|last4=Singer|first4=Tania|last5=Kanske|first5=Philipp|date=2017-04-06|title=Social cognition in aggressive offenders: Impaired empathy, but intact theory of mind|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00745-0|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-00745-0|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2017NatSR...7..670W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with [[Autism spectrum disorder|autism]], on the other hand, are claimed to be often impaired in both affective and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name="zero degrees"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baron-Cohen |first=Simon |title=Zero Degrees of Empathy: A New Theory of Human Cruelty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QUPgbxY4C4C |accessdate=August 8, 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Penguin UK |location= |isbn= 9780713997910|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem with the theory that the ability to turn empathy on and off constitutes psychopathy is that such a theory would classify socially sanctioned violence and [[punishment]] as psychopathy, as it means suspending empathy towards certain individuals and/or groups. The attempt to get around this by standardizing tests of psychopathy for cultures with different norms of punishment is criticized in this context for being based on the assumption that people can be classified in discrete cultures while cultural influences are in reality mixed and every person encounters a mosaic of influences (e.g. non-shared environment having more influence than family environment). It is suggested that psychopathy may be an artefact of psychiatry's standardization along imaginary sharp lines between cultures, as opposed to an actual difference in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;“How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain” 2017 Lisa Feldman Barrett&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Role of Culture in Empathy: The Consequences and Explanations of Cultural Differences in Empathy at the Affective and Cognitive Levels" 2014 David Atkins&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other conditions ===

Research indicates atypical empathic responses are also correlated with a variety of other conditions.

[[Borderline personality disorder]] is characterized by extensive behavioral and interpersonal difficulties that arise from emotional and cognitive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Minzenberg et al., 2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minzenberg|first=M.J.|first2=M.|last2=Fisher-Irving|first3=J.H.|last3=Poole|first4=S.|last4=Vinogradov|year=2006|title=Reduced self-referential source memory performance is associated with interpersonal dysfunction in borderline personality disorder|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|url=http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516001713/http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|archivedate=May 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysfunctional social and interpersonal behavior has been shown to play a crucial role in the emotionally intense way people with borderline personality disorder react.&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; While individuals with borderline personality disorder may show their emotions too much, several authors have suggested that they might have a compromised ability to reflect upon mental states (impaired [[cognitive empathy]]), as well as an impaired [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; People with borderline personality disorder have been shown to be very good at recognizing emotions in people's faces, suggesting increased empathic capacities.&lt;ref name="Wagner and Linehan, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=A.W.|author2=M.M Linehan|year=1999|title=Facial expression recognition ability among women with borderline personality disorder: implications for emotion regulation?|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynch|first=T.R.|first2=M.Z. |last2=Rosenthal |first3=D.S. |last3=Kosson |first4=J.S. |last4=Cheavens |first5=C.W. |last5=Lejuez |first6=R.J. |last6=Blair|year=2006|title=Heightened sensitivity to facial expressions of emotion in borderline personality disorder.|journal=Emotion|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.4.647 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=647–655}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, possible that impaired cognitive empathy (the capacity for understanding another person's experience and perspective) may account for borderline personality disorder individuals' tendency for interpersonal dysfunction, while "hyper-emotional empathy"{{Verify source|date=August 2013}} may account for the emotional over-reactivity observed in these individuals.&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; One primary study confirmed that patients with borderline personality disorder were significantly impaired in cognitive empathy, yet there was no sign of impairment in affective empathy.&lt;ref name=Harari&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harari|first=Hagai|author2=Simone G.

One diagnostic criterion of [[narcissistic personality disorder]] is a lack of empathy and an unwillingness or inability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR npd"&gt;[http://behavenet.com/narcissistic-personality-disorder Narcissistic personality disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120212711/http://behavenet.com/narcissistic-personality-disorder |date=January 20, 2013 }} – [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of [[schizoid personality disorder]] include emotional coldness, detachment, and impaired [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] corresponding with an inability to be empathetic and sensitive towards others.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR spd"&gt;[http://behavenet.com/schizoid-personality-disorder Schizoid personality disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115182207/http://behavenet.com/schizoid-personality-disorder |date=November 15, 2012 }}, ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guntrip"&gt;Guntrip, Harry.

A study conducted by [[Jean Decety]] and colleagues at the [[University of Chicago]] demonstrated that subjects with aggressive [[conduct disorder]] elicit atypical empathic responses to viewing others in pain.&lt;ref name="Decety_BiologicalPsy2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety, J. |author2=Michalska, K.J. |author3=Akitsuki, Y. |author4= Lahey, B. |last-author-amp=yes |year=2008 |title=Atypical empathic responses in adolescents with aggressive conduct disorder: a functional MRI investigation |journal=Biological Psychology |pmid=18940230|volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=203–11 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2008.09.004 |pmc=2819310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects with conduct disorder were at least as responsive as [[Scientific control|controls]] to the pain of others but, unlike controls, subjects with conduct disorder showed strong and specific activation of the [[amygdala]] and [[ventral striatum]] (areas that enable a general arousing effect of [[Reward system|reward]]), yet impaired activation of the [[Biological neural network|neural]] regions involved in self-regulation and [[metacognition]] (including [[moral reasoning]]), in addition to diminished processing between the amygdala and the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Decety_BiologicalPsy2008" /&gt;

[[Schizophrenia]] is characterized by impaired affective empathy,&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; as well as severe cognitive and empathy impairments as measured by the Empathy Quotient (EQ).&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017"/&gt; These empathy impairments are also associated with impairments in social cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017" /&gt;

Lieutenant Colonel [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]], in his book ''[[On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society|On Killing]]'', suggests that military training artificially creates depersonalization in soldiers, suppressing empathy and making it easier for them to kill other human beings.&lt;ref name="Grossman 1996"/&gt;

Proper empathic engagement helps an individual understand and anticipate the behavior of another. Apart from the automatic tendency to recognize the emotions of others, one may also deliberately engage in empathic reasoning. Two general methods have been identified here. An individual may simulate fictitious versions of the beliefs, desires, character traits and context of another individual to see what emotional feelings it provokes. Or, an individual may simulate an emotional feeling and then access the environment for a suitable reason for the emotional feeling to be appropriate for that specific environment.&lt;ref name="DeWaal"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Waal F.

Some research suggests that people are more able and willing to empathize with those most similar to themselves. In particular, empathy increases with similarities in culture and living conditions. Empathy is more likely to occur between individuals whose interaction is more frequent. (See Levenson and Reuf 1997 and Hoffman 2000: 62). A measure of how well a person can infer the specific content of another person's thoughts and feelings has been developed by William Ickes (1997, 2003). [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] an anti-empathy crusader claims emotional engagement of empathy leads to racism and prejudice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} In 2010, team led by Grit Hein and Tania Singer gave two groups of men wristbands according to which football team they supported. Each participant received a mild electric shock, then watched another go through the same pain. When the wristbands matched, both brains flared: with pain, and empathic pain. If they supported opposing teams, the observer was found to have little empathy.&lt;ref name="HeinSilani2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hein|first1=Grit|last2=Silani|first2=Giorgia|last3=Preuschoff|first3=Kerstin|last4=Batson|first4=C.

He ascertains empathy as an exhaustive process that limits us in morality and if low empathy makes for bad people, bundled up in that unsavoury group would be many who have Asperger’s or autism and reveals his own brother is severely autistic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
Early indicators for a lack of empathy:
#Frequently finding oneself in prolonged arguments
#Forming opinions early and defending them vigorously
#Thinking that other people are overly sensitive
#Refusing to listen to other points of view
#Blaming others for mistakes
#Not listening when spoken to
#Holding grudges and having difficulty to forgive
#Inability to work in a team{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

There are concerns that the empathizer's own emotional background may affect or distort what emotions they perceive in others (e.g. Goleman 1996: p.&amp;nbsp;104). It is evidenced that societies that promote individualism have lower ability for empathy.&lt;ref name="WeinerCraighead2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Irving B. Weiner|author2=W.

== Ethical issues ==

The extent to which a person's emotions are publicly observable, or mutually recognized as such has significant social consequences. Empathic recognition may or may not be welcomed or socially desirable. This is particularly the case where we recognize the emotions that someone has towards us during real time interactions. Based on a metaphorical affinity with touch, philosopher Edith Wyschogrod claims that the proximity entailed by empathy increases the potential vulnerability of either party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wyschogrod E | year = 1981 | title = Empathy and sympathy as tactile encounter | url = | journal = J Med Philos | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 25–43 | doi = 10.1093/jmp/6.1.25 | pmid = 7229562 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriate role of empathy in our dealings with others is highly dependent on the circumstances. For instance, [[Tania Singer]] says that clinicians or caregivers must be objective to the emotions of others, to not over-invest their own emotions for the other, at the risk of [[compassion fatigue|draining away]] their own resourcefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/12/tania-singer-compassion-burnout|title=Compassion over empathy could help prevent emotional burnout|work=Wired UK|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515020421/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/12/tania-singer-compassion-burnout|archivedate=May 15, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an awareness of the limitations of empathic accuracy is prudent in a [[caregiving]] situation.

==== Ethics ====

In his 2008 book, ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time:Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong]]'', writer [[Iain King]] presents two reasons why empathy is the "essence" or "DNA" of right and wrong. First, he argues that empathy uniquely has all the characteristics we can know about an ethical viewpoint&lt;ref&gt;''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong'', (2008), {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; – including that it is "partly self-standing", and so provides a source of motivation that is partly within us and partly outside, as moral motivations seem to be.&lt;ref name="King2008-74"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=empathy%20iain%20king&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q=empathy%20iain%20king&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 28, 2013|publisher=Continuum|date=16 October 2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=74|quote=Empathy is special, because it always and automatically has the characteristics of right and wrong&amp;nbsp;... Something rooted in empathy must have more of the essence of good about it than something which is not.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows empathy-based judgements to have sufficient distance from a personal opinion to count as "moral". His second argument is more practical: he argues, "Empathy for others really is the route to value in life", and so the means by which a selfish attitude can become a moral one. By using empathy as the basis for a system of ethics, King is able to reconcile ethics based on [[Consequentialism|consequences]] with [[Virtue Ethics|virtue-ethics]] and [[Deontological ethics|act-based]] accounts of right and wrong.&lt;ref name="King2008-227"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;lpg=PA227|publisher=Continuum|location=London|date=2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; His empathy-based system has been taken up by some [[Buddhism|Buddhists]],&lt;ref&gt;A Buddhist account of Iain King's ideas is set out in [http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics this] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020235032/http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics |date=October 20, 2012 }} Global Oneness article.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to address some practical problems, such as when to tell [[Lie#Ethics|lies]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Publishers Weekly]] state that "King is even able to formulate a credible rule that tells us when to lie" [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 here.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030514/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 |date=November 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and how to develop culturally-neutral [[Romance (love)#In philosophy|rules for romance]].

In the 2007 book ''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', philosopher [[Michael Slote]] introduces a theory of care-based ethics that is grounded in empathy. His claim is that moral motivation does, and should, stem from a basis of empathic response. He claims that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by empathy. He explains that the limits and obligations of empathy and in turn morality are natural. These natural obligations include a greater empathic, and moral obligation to family and friends, along with an account of temporal and physical distance. In situations of close temporal and physical distance, and with family or friends, our moral obligation seems stronger to us than with strangers at a distance naturally. Slote explains that this is due to empathy and our natural empathic ties. He further adds that actions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for others on the part of the agent.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', Michael Slote, Oxford University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phenomenology ====

In [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], empathy describes the experience of something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and [[Other (philosophy)|other]]. This draws on the [[sense of agency]]. In the most basic sense, this is the experience of the other's body and, in this sense, it is an experience of "my body over there". In most other respects, however, the experience is modified so that what is experienced is experienced as being the other's experience; in experiencing empathy, what is experienced is not "my" experience, even though ''I'' experience it. Empathy is also considered to be the condition of [[intersubjectivity]] and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;''Empathy in the Context of Philosophy'', Lou Agosta, Palgrave/Macmillan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===

Some postmodern historians such as [[Keith Jenkins]] in recent years have debated whether or not it is possible to empathize with people from the past. Jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in the present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant [[Liberalism|liberal]] discourse of modern society and can be connected to [[John Stuart Mill]]'s concept of reciprocal freedom. Jenkins argues the past is a foreign country and as we do not have access to the [[epistemological]] conditions of by gone ages we are unable to empathize.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, K. (1991) ''Re-thinking History'' London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

It is impossible to forecast the effect of empathy on the future.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} A past subject may take part in the present by the so-called historic present. If we watch from a fictitious past, can tell the present with the future tense, as it happens with the trick of the false prophecy. There is no way of telling the present with the means of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Pozzi, G. (1976) Prefazione 6. L'elemento storico e politico -sociale, in G.B. Marino, ''L'Adone'' Milano&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapy ===

[[Heinz Kohut]] is the main introducer of the principle of empathy in psychoanalysis. His principle applies to the method of gathering unconscious material. The possibility of not applying the principle is granted in the cure, for instance when you must reckon with another principle, that of reality.

In evolutionary psychology, attempts at explaining pro-social behavior often mention the presence of empathy in the individual as a possible variable. While exact motives behind complex social behaviors are difficult to distinguish, the "ability to put oneself in the shoes of another person and experience events and emotions the way that person experienced them" is the definitive factor for truly altruistic behavior according to Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis. If empathy is not felt, social exchange (what's in it for me?) supersedes pure altruism, but if empathy is felt, an individual will help by actions or by word, regardless of whether it is in their self-interest to do so and even if the costs outweigh potential rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aronson | first = Elliot | authorlink = Elliot Aronson | last2 = Wilson |first2=Timothy D. |last3=Akert |first3=Robin | title = Social Psychology, 6th Edition | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-13-238245-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business and management ===

In the 2009 book ''Wired to Care'', strategy consultant [[Dev Patnaik]] argues that a major flaw in contemporary business practice is a lack of empathy inside large corporations. He states that lacking any sense of empathy, people inside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions and often get fooled into believing they understand their business if they have quantitative research to rely upon. Patnaik claims that the real opportunity for companies doing business in the 21st century is to create a widely held sense of empathy for customers, pointing to [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Harley-Davidson]], and [[IBM]] as examples of "Open Empathy Organizations". Such institutions, he claims, see new opportunities more quickly than competitors, adapt to change more easily, and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredtocare.com|title=Wired To Care|work=wiredtocare.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210095811/http://www.wiredtocare.com/|archivedate=December 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 book ''The Empathy Factor'', organizational consultant [[Marie Miyashiro]] similarly argues the value of bringing empathy to the workplace, and offers [[Nonviolent Communication]] as an effective mechanism for achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Empathy Factor: Your Competitive Advantage for Personal, Team, and Business Success

== Measurement ==
{{citation style|section|date=July 2013}}
Research into the measurement of empathy has sought to answer a number of questions: who should be carrying out the measurement? What should pass for empathy and what should be discounted? What unit of measure (UOM) should be adopted and to what degree should each occurrence precisely match that UOM are also key questions that researchers have sought to investigate.

Researchers have approached the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives.

Behavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain either predetermined or ad-hoc behaviors in the subjects they are monitoring. Both verbal and non-verbal behaviors have been captured on video by experimenters such as Truax (1967b).&lt;ref&gt;Truax, C. B. (1967). Rating of Accurate Empathy. The Therapeutic Relationship and its Impact. A Study of Psychotherapy with Schizophrenics. Eds. C. R. Rogers, E. T. Gendlin, D. J. Kiesler and C. B. Truax. Madison, Wisconsin, The University of Wisconsin Press pp.&amp;nbsp;555–568.&lt;/ref&gt; Other experimenters, including Mehrabian and Epstein (1972),&lt;ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mehrabian A. |author2=Epstein N. | year = 1972 | title = A measure of emotional empathy | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 525–543 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1972.tb00078.x | pmid = 4642390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have required subjects to comment upon their own feelings and behaviors, or those of other people involved in the experiment, as indirect ways of signaling their level of empathic functioning to the raters.

Physiological responses tend to be captured by elaborate electronic equipment that has been physically connected to the subject's body. Researchers then draw inferences about that person's empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Levenson R. W. |author2=Ruef A. M. | year = 1992 | title = Empathy: a physiological substrate | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 234–246 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.234 | pmid = 1403614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie et al., 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leslie K. R. |author2=Johnson-Frey S. H. | year = 2004 | title = Functional imaging of face and hand imitation: towards a motor theory of empathy | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 601–607 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.038 | pmid = 14980562 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Bodily or "somatic" measures can be looked upon as behavioral measures at a micro level. Their focus is upon measuring empathy through facial and other non-verbally expressed reactions in the empathizer. These changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of "emotional contagion" or mirroring (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992*; Leslie et al., 2004*). It should be pointed out that these reactions, whilst appearing to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer, could also, if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period, be reflecting the results of emotional reactions that are based upon more pieces of thinking through (cognitions) associated with role-taking ("if I were him I would feel&amp;nbsp;...").

Paper-based indices involve one or more of a variety of methods of responding. In some experiments, subjects are required to watch video scenarios (either staged or authentic) and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy (e.g. Geher, Warner and Brown, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Geher G. |author2=Warner R. M. | year = 2001 | title = Predictive validity of the emotional accuracy research scale | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 373–388 | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(00)00045-3 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;); scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form (e.g. Mehrabian and Epstein, 1972&lt;ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543"/&gt;). Measures also frequently require subjects to self-report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy, using Likert-style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to tap into the affective, cognitive-affective or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning. Some questionnaires claim to have been able to tap into both cognitive and affective substrates (e.g. Davis, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis M. H. | year = 1980 | title = A multidimensional approach to individual differences in empathy | url = | journal = JSAS Catalogue of selected documents in psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 1–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). More recent paper-based tools include The [[Empathy Quotient]] (EQ) created by [[Simon Baron-Cohen|Baron-Cohen]] and Wheelwright&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Baron-Cohen S. |author2=Wheelwright S. |year=2004 |title=The empathy quotient: an investigation of adults with Asperger Syndrome or high functioning autism, and normal sex differences |url=http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/services/ASDAssessmentTemplate/ResourcesfromRobertGauthierfromRARCworkshop2014/EQArticle.pdf |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=163–175 |doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00 |pmid=15162935 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304035846/http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/services/ASDAssessmentTemplate/ResourcesfromRobertGauthierfromRARCworkshop2014/EQArticle.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which comprises a self-report questionnaire consisting of 60 items.

For the very young, picture or puppet-story indices for empathy have been adopted to enable even very young, pre-school subjects to respond without needing to read questions and write answers (e.g. Denham and Couchoud, 1990). Dependent variables (variables that are monitored for any change by the experimenter) for younger subjects have included self reporting on a 7-point smiley face scale and filmed facial reactions (Barnett, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barnett M. A. | year = 1984 | title = Similarity of experience and empathy in preschoolers | url = | journal = Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 145 | issue = 2| pages = 241–250 | doi = 10.1080/00221325.1984.10532271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A certain amount of confusion exists about how to measure empathy. These may be rooted in another problem: deciding what empathy is and what it is not. In general, researchers have until now been keen to pin down a singular definition of empathy which would allow them to design a measure to assess its presence in an exchange, in someone's repertoire of behaviors or within them as a latent trait. As a result, they have been frequently forced to ignore the richness of the empathic process in favor of capturing surface, explicit self-report or third-party data about whether empathy between two people was present or not. In most cases, instruments have unfortunately only yielded information on whether someone had the potential to demonstrate empathy (Geher et al., 2001)*. Gladstein (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Gladstein, G. A. (1987). What It All Means. Empathy and counseling: explorations in theory and research. G. A. Gladstein. New York, Springer-Verlag: 173–189.&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes the position noting that empathy has been measured from the point of view of the empathizer, the recipient for empathy and the third-party observer. He suggests that since the multiple measures used have produced results that bear little relation to one another, researchers should refrain from making comparisons between scales that are in fact measuring different things. He suggests that researchers should instead stipulate what kind of empathy they are setting out to measure rather than simplistically stating that they are setting out to measure the unitary phenomenon "empathy"; a view more recently endorsed by Duan and Hill (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Duan C. |author2=Hill C. E. | year = 1996 | title = The current state of empathy research | url = | journal = Journal of Counselling Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 261–274 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.43.3.261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of medicine, a measurement tool for carers is the ''Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Health Professional Version (JSPE-HP)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen D, Lew R, Hershman W, Orlander J |year= 2007 |title= A cross-sectional measurement of medical student empathy |journal= J Gen Intern Med |volume= 22 |issue= 10 |pages= 1434–8 |publisher= |doi= 10.1007/s11606-007-0298-x |pmc= 2305857 |pmid= 17653807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) is the only published measurement tool to date that accounts for a multi-dimensional assessment of empathy. It comprises a self-report questionnaire of 28 items, divided into four 7-item scales covering the above subdivisions of affective and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis M | year = 1983 | title = Measuring individual differences in empathy: evidence for a multidimensional approach | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113–126 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983" /&gt;

== Other animals ==

Research has shown that the ability of empathy in other species is attainable. Many instances of empathy have been recorded throughout many species, including (but not limited to) canines, felines, dolphins, primates, rats and mice {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. In animals, empathy-related responding could have an ulterior motive such as survival, the sharing of food, companionship and pack-oriented mentality. It is certainly difficult to understand an animal's intention behind an empathic response. Many researchers{{Who|weasel|date=May 2014}} maintain that applying the term empathy in general to animal behavior is an act of [[anthropomorphism]].

Researchers Zanna Clay and [[Frans de Waal]] studied the socio-emotional development of the [[bonobo]] chimpanzee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clay|author2=Zanna|title=Development of socio-emotional competence in bonobos.|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=November 5, 2014|volume=110|issue=45|pages=18121–18126|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=181339d9-1520-40c7-a9e4-ce8ac385d6d9%40sessionmgr115&amp;hid=120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-39226-002|doi=10.1073/pnas.1316449110|bibcode = 2013PNAS..11018121C |pmc=3831480}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy-related responding, and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events, related to themselves (loss of a fight) and of stressful events of others. It was found that the bonobos  sought out body contact as a coping mechanism with one another. A finding of this study was that the bonobos sought out more body contact after watching a distressing event upon the other bonobos rather than their individually experienced stressful event. Mother-reared bonobos as opposed to orphaned bonobos sought out more physical contact after a stressful event happened to another. This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding, and how it may be crucial to successful socio-emotional development, such as empathic-like behaviors.

Empathic-like responding has been observed in [[chimpanzees]] in various different aspects of their natural behaviors. For example, chimpanzees are known to spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in natural and unnatural settings, a behavior recognized as consolation. Researchers Teresa Romero and co-workers observed these empathic and sympathetic-like behaviors in chimpanzees at two separate outdoor housed groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|author2=Teresa|title=Consolation as possible expression of sympathetic concern among chimpanzees|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=July 6, 2010|volume=107|issue=27|pages=12110–12115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1006991107|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=11&amp;sid=24706b87-cfc3-4942-8f8f-8d4fa8b29f28%40sessionmgr198&amp;hid=128&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2010-14411-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014|bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712110R |pmc=2901437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of consolation was observed in both of the groups of chimpanzees. This behavior is found in humans, and particularly in human infants. Another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic-like responding was disproportionately provided to individuals of kin. Although comforting towards non-family chimpanzees was also observed, as with humans, chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close/loved ones. Another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average. The only exception to this discovery was that high-ranking males showed as much empathy-like behavior as their female counterparts. This is believed to be because of policing-like behavior and the authoritative status of high-ranking male chimpanzees.

It is thought that species that possess a more intricate and developed prefrontal cortex have more of an ability of experiencing empathy. It has however been found that empathic and altruistic responses may also be found in sand dwelling Mediterranean ants. Researcher Hollis studied the ''[[Cataglyphis cursor]]'' sand dwelling Mediterranean ant and their rescue behaviors by ensnaring ants from a nest in nylon threads and partially buried beneath the sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollis|first=Karen|title=A comparative analysis of precision rescue behaviour in sand-dwelling ants|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=March 2013|volume=85|series=Animal Behaviour|issue=3|pages=537–544|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.12.005|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=bf4000d0-6a9c-4225-8ebf-82db56f427e8%40sessionmgr113&amp;hid=128&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-01472-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ants not ensnared in the nylon thread proceeded to attempt to rescue their nest mates by sand digging, limb pulling, transporting sand away from the trapped ant, and when efforts remained unfruitful, began to attack the nylon thread itself; biting and pulling apart the threads.  Similar rescue behavior was found in other sand-dwelling Mediterranean ants, but only ''[[Cataglyphis floricola]]'' and ''[[Lasius grandis]]'' species of ants showed the same rescue behaviors of transporting sand away from the trapped victim and directing attention towards the nylon thread. It was observed in all ant species that rescue behavior was only directed towards nest mates. Ants of the same species from different nests were treated with aggression and were continually attacked and pursued, which speaks to the depths of ants discriminative abilities. This study brings up the possibility that if ants have the capacity for empathy and/or altruism, these complex processes may be derived from primitive and simpler mechanisms.

[[Dog|Canines]] have been hypothesized to share empathic-like responding towards human species. Researchers Custance and Mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-012-0510-1 |last=Custance|first=Deborah|author2=Jennifer Mayer|title=Empathetic-like responding by domestic dogs (canis familiaris) to distress in humans|journal=Animal Cognition|date=29 May 2012|volume=15|issue=851–859|doi=10.1007/s10071-012-0510-1|accessdate=October 5, 2014|pages=851–859|pmid=22644113}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the participants were talking or humming, the dog showed no behavioral changes, however when the participants were pretending to cry, the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger. The dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion, by sniffing, licking and nuzzling the distressed person. The dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement, tail wagging or panting. Since the dogs did not direct their empathic-like responses only towards their owner, it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior. Although this could insinuate that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy, this could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior.

When witnessing chicks in distress, domesticated hens, ''[[Gallus gallus domesticus]]'' show emotional and physiological responding. Researchers Edgar, Paul and Nicol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=J|author2=Paul|title=Protective Mother Hens: Cognitive influences on the avian maternal response|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=Aug 2013|volume=86|issue=2|pages=223–229|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.004|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=c35dba7e-d8a4-4b46-8855-20319f7a74e3%40sessionmgr4001&amp;hid=4214&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-21521-001 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger, the mother hens heart rate increased, vocal alarms were sounded, personal preening decreased and body temperature increased. This responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if they were in danger. Mother hens experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick's behavior correlated with the perceived threat. Animal maternal behavior may be perceived as empathy, however, it could be guided by the evolutionary principles of survival and not emotionality.

It can also mean the incorporation of women into a group or a profession that was once dominated by men. &lt;ref name="douglas"&gt;Ann Douglas (1977). ''The Feminization of American Culture''.

== Introduction of feminization ==
Defining the term "feminization" can be complicated due to its meaning being unstable, as it can be portrayed as either a social process or as a critique of a process. Feminization has two basic meanings. The first concerns a person who was not initially feminine but becomes feminine later in their life through the perceptions of both the individual and those around them. According to gender theorist [[Judith Butler]], a person's gender is not solely an act of will or self-description, as it is also shaped by the people who describe, categorize, and treat the person according to their own perceptions of their gender. The second meaning of the term feminization describes when a person who originally had feminine qualities begins to incorporate more feminine attributes into their personality in some way, shape, or form. The term has often been used to describe females, however over time it shifted to where the term can be used to describe the process of someone or something becoming more feminine by adopting feminine qualities.&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Imhoff | first = Sarah | title = The myth of American Jewish feminization | journal = Jewish Social Studies | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 126&amp;ndash;152 | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | doi = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | jstor = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | date = Spring–Summer 2016 | url = https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/21871/The%20Myth%20of%20American%20Jewish%20Feminization.pdf?sequence=1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization of poverty ==
Women are more likely than men to live below the poverty line, a phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty. The 2015 poverty rates for men and women in the U.S. were 10% and 15% respectively. Women are less likely to pursue advanced degrees  and tend to have low paying jobs. It has been argued that even with the same level of education and occupational role, women earn much less than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/followup/session/presskit/fs1.htm|title=Beijing +5 – Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century Twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, 5-9 June 2000|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources have disputed the idea of a wage gap in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/harvard-prof.-takes-down-gender-wage-gap-myth/article/2580405|title=Harvard prof. takes down gender wage gap myth|last=Schow|first=Ashe|website=The Washington Examiner|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization of the labor force ==
Feminization of the labor force in present day associations is inescapable in that females make up half of the labor force and the revelation of them as a potential profitable asset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/anisha-motwani/the-feminization-of-workp_b_8258716.html|title=Why The Feminisation Of The Workplace Is Good News For Everyone|work=Huffington Post India|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post war there has been almost a movement of women flowing into the workforce in the North America and Europe economies with women making considerable advances in balancing the workforce when comparing women and men's job status and pay rates. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/1320929|title=Feminization of the labor force : paradoxes and promises in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization and the living wage movement ==
Feminists of the modern day living wage movement began in Baltimore, Maryland in the early 1990's right in the very heart and depths of the struggling urban poor. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Around this same time, Baltimore churches became involved in providing the poor with needed social services. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even though national prosperity and rising stock markets seemed to be showing growth, more and more full-time workers were relying on soup kitchens, low-income housing assistance, and thrift store purchases for clothing. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their jobs did not pay enough to keep families above the poverty line. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whole communities became known as the "working poverty."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf''' ('''HZDR''') is a German research laboratory in Dresden and member of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]]. Research is conducted in three of the Helmholtz Association's research areas: matter, health, and energy. While the research center was formerly known as ''Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf'' (since 1992), the research site dates back as far as 1956, when the ''Zentralinstitut für Kernforschung'' (national institute for nuclear research) in [[East Germany]] was founded.

HZDR conducts research in the sectors matter, health, and energy in Dresden and at three other locations in Germany and France. In [[Grenoble]], France, it operates a beamline for materials and radiochemistry research at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ([[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility|ESRF]]). Three of HZDR's five large-scale facilities are also available to international scientists.

'''Matter'''
HZDR scientists are investigating the structure and function of new materials in order to better understand, optimize, and use them for specific applications. This includes research on novel superconducting and semiconducting materials using extremely high [[magnetic fields]] or [[ion beams]]. What's more, they are developing detectors applied in medicine and technology, and they are advancing modern technologies for particle acceleration.

'''Health''' 
HZDR aims at making progress in early diagnosis and therapy of [[cancer]], which sees 450.000 incidences in Germany each year. It collaborates closely with partners from university medicine (National Center for Radiation Research in Oncology - OncoRay - in Dresden, Germany). Cancer research at the HZDR focuses on three major fields: new [[radioactive pharmaceuticals]] for cancer diagnosis and therapy, innovative [[medical imaging]] methods used in oncology as well as particle acceleration using new laser technologies for [[radiation oncology]].

'''Energy'''
HZDR researchers are looking for economically and ecologically feasible solutions for the energy supply in the future. At the Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, a joint initiative of HZDR and [[TU Bergakademie Freiberg]], they are targeting at new technologies for the exploration, mining, and use of strategically important metals and minerals, e.g. biotechnological methods for metal [[recycling]]. Scientists are also dealing with energy intensive processes in industry, like steel casting or in the chemical industry. They are doing research into nuclear repositories and reactors. And they are contributing to new storage technologies, developing a liquid metal battery.

==Research facilities==

* [[:de:ELBE (Strahlungsquelle)|ELBE]] is a Center for High-Power Radiation Sources and HZDR's largest research facility. It encompasses a superconducting Electron Linear accelerator for beams with high Brilliance and low Emittance (ELBE) and two [[free electron lasers|FEL]] for the mid and far infrared. In addition, the electron beam delivers multiple other secondary beams (quasi-monochromatic [[X-rays]], polarized [[Bremsstrahlung]], pulsed neutron beams, pulsed mono-energetic [[positron]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=145|title=Radiation Source ELBE|publisher=HZDR}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 150 TW laser system [[:de:Dresden Laser Acceleration Source|Dresden Laser Acceleration Source (DRACO)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=28111&amp;pNid=0|title=DRACO|publisher=HZDR}}&lt;/ref&gt; is part of HZDR's ELBE Center for High-Power Radiation Sources.
* The [[Dresden High Magnetic Field Laboratory]] has set out to achieve an ambitious goal in providing 100 Tesla for materials research. It serves as a research facility for both in-house and user projects. The laboratory was erected in the vicinity of ELBE, which offers unique magneto-optical experiments. Under the program EuroMagNETII/[[Emfl|EMFL]] the EU funds the laboratory as an international user center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=580|title=Dresden High Magnetic Field Laboratory|publisher=HZDR}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* HZDR operates an Ion Beam Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=1984|title=Ion Beam Center|publisher=HZDR}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the application of ion beams in materials research. Plasma and ion sources generate ions of all species at energies between 10 eV and 50 MeV. The center is funded as user facility by the EU.
* ROBL, the Rossendorf Beamline at the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility|ESRF]] in Grenoble/ France, comprises two facilities for materials research and for radiochemical experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=247|title=Rossendorf Beamline at ESRF|publisher=HZDR}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=270|title=PET Center|publisher=HZDR}}&lt;/ref&gt; is operated together with [[TU Dresden|Technische Universität Dresden]] and University Hospital Dresden. Researchers are developing imaging methods for cancer diagnosis as well as new approaches to cancer treatment.
* The thermohydraulic test facility TOPFLOW is used for investigations into stationary and transient phenomena in two-phase flows as well as for the development and validation of the models derived from Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) Codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=1003|title=TOPFLOW - Transient Two Phase Flow Test Facility|publisher=HZDR}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The DREsden Sodium facility for DYNamo and thermohydraulic studies (DRESDYN) is intended as a platform both for large scale experiments related to geo- and astrophysics as well as for experiments related to thermohydraulic and safety aspects of liquid metal batteries and liquid metal fast reactors. The most ambitious projects in the framework of DRESDYN are a homogeneous hydromagnetic dynamo driven solely by precession and a large Taylor-Couette type experiment for the combined investigation of the magnetorotational instability and the Tayler instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1201.5737|title=DRESDYN - A new facility for MHD experiments with liquid sodium|journal=Magnetohydrodynamics  (), pp|volume=48|issue=2012|pages=103–113|publisher=F.

The HZDR has a staff of about 1,000 persons, working on four different research sites, the headquarters being in Dresden.

== Technology transfer ==
The HZDR Innovation GmbH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hzdr-innovation.de/index.php?id=84&amp;L=1|title=HZDR Innovation GmbH|publisher=HZDR Innovation GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt; corporation offers industrial services using HZDR's knowhow and infrastructures in ion implantation. This technology is applied for doping the surfaces of materials with foreign atoms or to produce defects in semiconductors. It is also used to create materials with targeted features like oxidation resistance, which is important for aviation or automotive lightweight construction, or like biocompatibility for medical implants.

== Students and young scientists ==
There are roughly 160 doctoral students. The HZDR has installed several junior research groups to promote excellent young scientists, the topics of which are (last update: 2013): ion beam processed functional materials for [[spintronics]] and [[photovoltaics]], computational radiation physics, spinelectronics, reactor physics, [[magnetization dynamics]] and magnetostatic, tumor specific [[positron emission tomography|PET]] tracers, in-vivo [[dosimetry]] for new types of radiation (together with the Dresden-based National Center for Radiation Research in Oncology - OncoRay). What is more, the HZDR operates an International Helmholtz Research School for Nanoelectronic Networks (NANONET)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=36374&amp;pNid=2870|title=NANONET|publisher=HZDR}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a Summer Student Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=34387&amp;pNid=2519|title=Summer Student Program|publisher=HZDR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 1956, the former research center in Rossendorf was part of the [[German Academy of Sciences Berlin|German Academy of Sciences]]. The German-born British physicist [[Klaus Fuchs]], who took part in the [[Manhattan Project]] and acted as a spy for the [[Soviet Union]], was deputy director until 1974.

After the [[German reunification]] the "Forschungszentrum Rossendorf" (FZR) was founded. In 2006 the name changed to "Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf", to emphasize the connection to the research infrastructure in the city of Dresden. In 2011 the center became a member of [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=473&amp;pOid=28830 |title=Pressemitteilung vom 22.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="87309">The '''history of advertising''' can be traced to ancient civilizations. It became a major force in [[capitalist]] economies in the mid-19th century, based primarily on [[newspaper]]s and magazines. In the 20th century, [[advertising]] grew rapidly with new technologies such as [[direct mail]], [[radio]], [[television]], the internet and mobile devices.

[[File:Advertising as a percent of Gross Domestice Product in the United States.svg|thumb|Advertising as a percent of Gross Domestic Product in the United States, 1919 to 2007 per Douglas Galbi.]]

Between 1919 and 2007 advertising averaged 2.2 percent of [[Gross Domestic Product]] in the United States.

==Pre-modern history==

[[File:Bronze printing plate for an advertisement.jpg|thumb|Bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the Liu family needle shop at [[Jinan]], [[Song dynasty]] China. It is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.]]
Egyptians used [[papyrus]] to make sales messages and wall posters. [[Advertising campaign|Commercial messages]] and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] and  [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. [[Lost and found]] advertising on papyrus was common in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian [[rock art]] paintings that date back to 4000 BC.&lt;ref name= Bhatia&gt;Bhatia (2000). ''Advertising in Rural India: Language, Marketing Communication, and Consumerism'', 62+68&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient China, the earliest advertising known was oral, as recorded in the [[Classic of Poetry]] (11th to 7th centuries BC) of bamboo flutes played to sell candy. Advertisement usually takes in the form of calligraphic signboards and inked papers. A copper printing plate dated back to the [[Song dynasty]] used to print posters in the form of a square sheet of paper with a rabbit logo with "[[Jinan]] Liu's Fine Needle Shop" and "We buy high quality steel rods and make fine quality needles, to be ready for use at home in no time" written above and below.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., "Pulling the White Rabbit Out of the Hat: Consuming Brands in Imperial China," ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' [European Conference Proceedings] Vol. 8, 2008; Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., "A Brief History of Branding in China," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 30, No. 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Liu, ''Chinese Business: Landscapes and Strategies'' (2013), p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edo period advertising in Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Edo period]] LEL flyer from 1806 for a traditional medicine called ''Kinseitan'']]

In Europe, as the towns and cities of the [[Middle Ages]] began to grow, and the general populace was unable to read, instead of signs that read "cobbler", "miller", "tailor", or "blacksmith" would use an image associated with their trade such as a boot, a suit, a hat, a clock, a diamond, a horse shoe, a candle or even a bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers ([[town crier]]s) to announce their whereabouts for the convenience of the customers. The first compilation of such advertisements was gathered in ''Les Crieries de Paris'' ([[Street cries]] of Paris), a thirteenth-century poem by Guillaume de la Villeneuve.&lt;ref&gt;Aimeé Boutin, "Sound Memory: Paris Street Cries in Balzac's Pere Goriot," ''French Forum,'' Volume 30, Number 2, Spring 2005, pp. 67–78, DOI:10.1353/frf.2005.0029&lt;/ref&gt; 

Three major forms of advertisement existed during the pre-printing period (before the 15th-century); those forms were trademarks (moon, stars etc.), town criers and [[signage|sign boards]]:

* '''Trademarks''': The practice of attaching seals or marks to products was widespread in antiquity. Around 4,000 years ago, producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity.&lt;ref&gt;Wengrow, D., "Prehistories of Commodity Branding," ''Current Anthropology,''Vol. 49, No. 1, 2008, pp. 7-34&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest use of maker's marks, dating to about 1,300 BCE, have been found in India.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, M. and Mufti, S.U., ''The Hot History &amp; Cold Future of Brands'', ''Journal of Managerial Sciences'', vol. 1, no. 1, 2007, pp 75–87, http://qurtuba.edu.pk/jms/default_files/JMS/1_1/5_saif_ullah.pdf Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; By the medieval period, [[hallmark]]s were applied to high value goods such as precious metals, and assayers were appointed by governments to administer the system and ensure product quality.&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, E.C., ''Byzantine Silver Stamps'', [Dumbarton Oaks Studies] Vol. 7, Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1961, pp 23–35&lt;/ref&gt; 

* '''Town criers''': In ancient towns and cities, where the majority of citizens were illiterate, town-criers were appointed to call out official announcements and general news. Before long, private individuals began to employ public criers to act as an auctioneer.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, S., ''A History of Advertising from the Earliest Times'', Chatto and, Windus, 1875, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, itinerant [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]] developed a system of [[street cries]] to promote their goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, V., "The Streets for the People: London's Street Markets 1850–1939, ''Urban History'', June, 2015, pp. 1–21,&lt;/ref&gt; These street cries provided an essential public service before the advent of mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Garrioch, D., "Sounds of the City: the soundscape of early modern European towns," ''Urban History,'' 2003, Vol. 30, no. 1, pp 5&amp;ndash;25, [http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0963926803001019 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Saracens Head pub sign.jpg|thumb|left|Saracens Head pub sign, Bath, England]]
*'''Sign-boards''':  The use of commercial signage has a very ancient history. Retail signage and promotional signs appear to have developed independently in the East and the West. In antiquity, the ancient Egyptians, Romans and Greeks were known to use signage for shop fronts as well as to announce public events such as market days.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, F.K.,  "The Ancient History of Advertising: Insights and Implications for Practitioners: What Today's Advertisers and Marketers Can Learn from Their Predecessors," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' vol. 57 no. 3, pp 239-244 DOI: 10.2501/JAR-2017-033&lt;/ref&gt; China also exhibited a rich history of early retail signage systems.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, K. and Reid., S., "The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding," ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008. pp. 419–32.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Medieval Britain and France and much of Europe, innkeepers were compelled to erect a sign-board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manton|first=Dafydd|title=Ale and Arty in Sheffield: The Disappearing Art of Pub Signs|year=2008|publisher=Arc Publishing and Print|location=Sheffield, England|isbn=978-1906722005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth.

==16th-18th centuries==

Modern advertising began to take shape with the advent of newspapers and magazines in the 16th and 17th centuries. The very first weekly [[gazette]]s appeared in Venice in the early 16th-century. From there, the concept of a weekly publication spread to Italy, Germany and Holland.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, J., "The 'Avvisi' of Venice: Toward an Archaeology of Media Forms." ''Journalism History'' 14#2, 1987, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, the first weeklies appeared in the 1620s, and its first daily newspaper was the ''[[The Daily Courant]]'' published from 1702 to 1735.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B., ''From Grub Street to Fleet Street: An Illustrated History of English Newspapers to 1899'' (Ashgate, 2004; Hunt, M., "Hawkers, Bawlers, and Mercuries: Women and the London Press in the Early Enlightenment", ''Women &amp; History'', Vol. 3, no. 9, 1984 pp 41-68; Maxted, U., 'Mallet, Elizabeth (fl. 1672–1706)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/66880, accessed 27 May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Almost from the outset, newspapers carried advertising to defray the cost of printing and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Barrès-Baker, M.C., ''An Introduction to the Early History of Newspaper Advertising'', [Brent Museum and Archive Occasional Publications, No. 2], Brent Heritage Services,   2006, &lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commercial advertisements were for books and quack medicines, but by the 1650s, the variety of products being advertised had increased markedly.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, E.E., ''The Shocking History of Advertising'', New York, Ballantine Books, 1980, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in printing allowed retailers and manufacturers to print [[Flyer (pamphlet)|handbills]] and [[trade card]]s. For example, Jonathon Holder, a London haberdasher in the 1670s, gave every customer a printed list of his stock with the prices affixed. At the time, Holder's innovation was seen as a "dangerous practice" and an unnecessary expense for retailers.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, S., ''A History of Advertising from the Earliest Times'', Chatto and, Windus, 1875, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest trade cards were not cards at all, instead they were printed on paper and did not include illustrations. By the 18th century, however, they were printed on the more substantial card and typically bore the tradesmen's name and address, and before street numbering was in common use, often included a long-winded set of directions on how to locate the store or premises. With the advent of commercial engraving and lithography, illustrations became a standard feature of even the most humble trade card. Eventually trade cards evolved into business cards, which are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;"Trade Cards," in ''The Encyclopedia of Ephemera: A Guide to the Fragmentary Documents of Everyday Life for the Collector, Curator, and Historian,'' Maurice Rickards (ed), Psychology Press, 2000, pp 334-335, pp 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
In June 1836, [[Émile de Girardin]] editor of the Paris newspaper ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'' was the first to rely on paid advertising to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its profitability. His formula was soon copied by all titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clyde Thogmartin|title=The National Daily Press of France|year=1998|isbn=978-1-883479-20-6|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the [[printing press]]; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after as modern people rejected traditional cures. However, [[false advertising]] and "[[Quackery]]" became common. British newspapers in the 1850s and 1860s appealed to the increasingly affluent middle-class that sought out a variety of new products. The advertisements announced new health remedies as well as fresh foods and beverages. The latest London fashions were featured in the regional press. The availability of repeated advertising permitted manufacturers to develop nationally known brand names that had a much stronger appeal than generic products.&lt;ref&gt;Beverley Ann Tudor, "Retail Trade Advertising in the 'Leicester Journal' and the 'Leicester Chronicle' 1855-71." ''European Journal of Marketing'' 20#9 (1986) pp: 41-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A leadership position in British advertising was held by [[Cope Bros &amp; Co]] tobacco company, founded in Liverpool in 1848 by Thomas and George Cope. Smoking, of course, had been common for centuries, but the innovations consisted in brand names, heavy advertising, and market segmentation according to class. An innovative appeal was to health consciousness; the ads directed at the middle-class men promised that  "smoke not only checks disease but preserves the lungs."   A rugged heavy taste was pitched to working men, soldiers and sailors,  while "delicately fragrant" was part of the appeal to the upper-class. The packaging was attractive, posters were omnipresent to show that smoking was a normal part of English life;  lobbying was used to undercut the anti-tobacco lobby.&lt;ref&gt;A. V. Seaton,"Cope's and the Promotion of Tobacco in Victorian England." ''European Journal of Marketing''  (1986) 20#9 pp: 5-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Parrywatercolour.jpg|right|thumb|390px|In Britain, outdoor advertising was based on hoardngs (billboards): England 1835, by [[John Orlando Parry]]]]
In London [[Thomas J. Barratt]] was hailed as "the father of modern advertising".&lt;ref&gt;He was first described as such in T F G Coates, 'Mr Thomas J Barratt, "The father of modern advertising"', Modern Business, September 1908, pp. 107–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "mat"&gt;Matt Haig, ''Brand failures: the truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time'', Kogan Page Publishers, 2005, pp. 219, 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "nick"&gt;Nicholas Mirzoeff, ''The visual culture reader'', Routledge, 2002, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; Working for the [[Pears Soap]] company, Barratt created an effective advertising campaign for the company products, which involved the use of targeted slogans, images and phrases. One of his slogans, "Good morning. Have you used Pears' soap?" was famous in its day and into the 20th century.&lt;ref name = "obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/04/27/100310554.pdf |title=Obituary, Thomas J. Barratt Dead: Chairman of the Firm of A. &amp; F. Pears an Advertising Genius|work=New York Times| page= 11 |publisher=New York Times |date=1914-04-27 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "part"&gt;Eric Partridge, Paul Beale, ''A Dictionary of Catch Phrases: British and American, from the Sixteenth Century to the Present Day'', Routledge, 1986, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

An advertising tactic that he used was to associate the Pears brand with high culture and quality. Most famously, he used the painting ''[[Bubbles (painting)|Bubbles]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]] as an advertisement by adding a bar of Pears soap into the foreground. Barratt continued this theme with a series of adverts of well groomed middle-class children, associating Pears with domestic comfort and aspirations of high society.

[[File:Pears Soap 1900.jpg|right|thumb|A 1900 British ad for soap]]

Barratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful advertising and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that "tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different – it hits the present taste."&lt;ref name = "mat"/&gt;

====United States====
In the United States around 1840, Volney B. Palmer set up the first [[advertising agency]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad – the copy, layout, and artwork – was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed in the late 19th century when the advertising agency of [[N.W. Ayer &amp; Son]] was founded in New York. It planned, created, and executed complete advertising campaigns for its customers. It created a number of memorable slogans for firms such as [[De Beers]], [[AT&amp;T]] and the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hower, ''The History of an Advertising Agency: N. W. Ayer &amp; Son 1869-1949'' (1949) p 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J. Walter Thompson Advertisement 1903.JPG|thumb|left|275px|J. Walter Thompson Co. promotes high-powered advertisement, 1903]]

By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.
&lt;ref name="eskilson-pg58"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Graphic Design: A New History |last=Eskilson |first=Stephen J. |year=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, agencies were brokers for advertisement space in newspapers.  [[N. W. Ayer &amp; Son]] was the first full-service agency to assume responsibility for advertising content. N.W. Ayer opened in 1869, and was located in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="eskilson-pg58"/&gt;

The amount of space available in newspapers grew rapidly. The ''Boston Transcript'' published in 19,000 "agate lines" Of advertising in 1860,  87,000 in 1900, and 237,000 in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Starch, ''Advertising Principles'' (1927)  p 485&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, 104 companies spent over $50,000 each on national advertising; most sold patent medicines, which faded away after the federal food and drug legislation of the early 20th century. Seven innovators had emerged in the big time: [[Quaker Oats]], Armour meat, Cudahy meat, American Tobacco Company, P. Lorillard tobacco, Remington Typewriters, and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] soap.  By 1914, two thirds of the top advertisers came from just five industries: 14 food producers, 13 in automobiles and tires,  nine in soap and cosmetics, and four in tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Pope, ''The making of modern advertising'' (1983) pp 42-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agencies were forever breaking up and reforming, especially when one executive would split taking with him a major client and his team of [[copywriter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hower, ''The History of an Advertising Agency '' (1949) pp 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In the late 19th century in France, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] extended the services of his news agency, [[Havas]] to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to organize.

== Since 1900:  Global==
Advertising in the developing world was dominated by agencies in the imperial powers, especially from London and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Ciochetto, ''Globalisation and Advertising in Emerging Economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China'' (2013) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  [[J. Walter Thompson]] became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899.  It expanded across the globe, becoming one of the first American agencies in Egypt, South Africa and Asia.  Much of the pressure to expand came from General Motors, which wanted to export its automobiles worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Spring,  "The Globalization of American Advertising and Brand Management: A Brief History of the J. Walter Thompson Company, Proctor and Gamble, and US Foreign Policy." ''Global Studies Journal'' (2013). 5#4&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford turned to N.W. Ayer, which began its expansion in Europe and Latin America in the 1930s.  The typical policy was to put an American manager in charge, and hire a staff drawn from locals who had a better understanding of the language and the culture.  In 1941-42, however, Ayer closed its foreign offices and decided to concentrate on the American market.&lt;ref&gt;Hower, 'The History of an advertising agency: N.W. Ayer &amp; Son at work, 1869-1949." (1949) pp 140-46, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, spending on advertising reached $143 billion in the United States and $467 billion worldwide.&lt;ref name="WPP Group Forecasts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/2011/dec/05/groupm-forecasts-global-ad-spending-to/ |title=GroupM forecasts 2012 global ad spending to increase 6.4% |publisher=WPP |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising increased dramatically in the United States after 1870 as industrialization expanded the supply of manufactured products to a very large market. In order to profit from this higher rate of production, industry needed to recruit workers as consumers of factory products. It did so through the invention of mass marketing designed to influence the population's economic behavior on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), p. 33. "As Ford's massive assembly line utilized 'extensive single-purpose machinery' to produce automobiles inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods, the costly machinery of advertising that Coolidge had described set out to produce consumers, likewise inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods."&lt;/ref&gt; Total advertising volume in the United States grew from about $200 million in 1880 to nearly $3 billion in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Pope|title=The making of modern advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bElPAAAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Basic Books|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s and 1920s, many ad men believed that human instincts could be targeted and harnessed – "[[sublimation (psychology)|sublimated]]" into the desire to purchase commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Ewen|title=Captains Of Consciousness: Advertising and the Social Roots of the Consumer Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1R5S1DSC9kC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2008|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Bernays]], a nephew of [[Sigmund Freud]], promoted the approach making him [[Tobacco advertising|a pioneer of modern cigarette advertising.]]  Glantz argues, "it was really the tobacco industry, from the beginning, that was at the forefront of the development of modern, innovative, advertising techniques."&lt;ref name="GlantzModernAds"&gt;Stanton Glantz in ''[[Mad Men]] Season 3 Extra – Clearing the Air – The History of Cigarette Advertising'', part 1, min 3:38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, under [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]], the American government promoted advertising. Hoover himself delivered an address to the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World in 1925 called 'Advertising Is a Vital Force in Our National Life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1929, the head of the U.S. [[Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce]], Julius Klein, stated "Advertising is the key to world prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=367|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of the "unparalleled" collaboration between business and government in the 1920s, according to a 1933 European economic journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising was a vehicle for [[cultural assimilation]], encouraging immigrants to exchange their traditional habits and tastes in favor of a modern American lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ewen|title=Captains Of Consciousness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1R5S1DSC9kC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2008|pages=56–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important tool for influencing immigrant workers was the [[American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers]] (AAFLN). The AAFLN was primarily an advertising agency but also gained heavily centralized control over much of the immigrant press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeanne D. Petit|title=The Men and Women We Want: Gender, Race, and the Progressive Era Literacy Test Debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTubHqECr84C&amp;pg=PA66|year=2010|publisher=U of Rochester Press|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian media market===
In 1900, most Canadian newspapers were local affairs, designed primarily to inform local partisans about the provincial and national political scene. The publishers depended on loyal partisan subscribers, as well as  contracts for public printing  controlled by the political parties. With the rise of national advertising agencies after 1900, a major transformation was underway. The advertisers wanted them to reach the maximum possible circulation, regardless of partisanship. The result was a series of consolidations yielding much larger, largely nonpartisan newspapers, which depended more heavily on advertising revenue than on subscriptions from loyal party members. By 1900, three-fourths of the revenue of Toronto newspapers came from advertising. About two thirds of the newspapers' editorial pages loyally supported either the Conservative or the Liberal party, while the remainder were more independent. Across the board, the news pages increasingly featured more objectivity and bipartisanship, and the publishers were mostly focused on advertising revenues that were proportionate to overall circulation. A newspaper that appealed only to one party cut its potential audience in half. Simultaneously, the rapid growth of industry in Ontario and Quebec, coupled with the rapid settlement of the prairies, produced a large more affluent newspaper-reading population. The result was a golden age for Canadian newspapers peaking about 1911.  Many papers failed during the war era. Advertising agencies in 1915 gained a major advantage with the arrival of the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations]], which for the first-time provided reliable data on circulation, as opposed to the partisan boasting and exaggeration that had been the norm. the agencies now had a stronger hand in bargaining for lower advertising rates. The 1920s became a time of consolidation, budget-cutting and dropping of traditional party affiliation. By 1930 only 24% of Canada's dailies were partisan, 17% were "independent" partisan, and the majority, 50%, had become fully independent.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Johnston, "Partisan Politics, Market Research, and Media Buying in Canada, 1920," '' Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly'' (2006) 83#4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex and psychology===
{{main article|Sex in advertising}}
[[File:1916-skin-touch-soap-ad.jpg|thumb|300px|1916 ''Ladies' Home Journal'' version of the famous ad]]

At the turn of the 20th century, there were few career choices for women in business; however, advertising was one of the few. Since women were responsible for most of the purchasing done in their household, advertisers and agencies recognized the value of women's insight during the creative process. [[Helen Lansdowne Resor]]  at J. Walter Thompson Agency, was one of the pioneers.

In 1911, the [[Woodbury Soap Company]] became the first to use images of sexual contact to sell a product. Their ad slogan, created by Helen Lansdowne, claimed that women who used the soap would have "Skin You Love To Touch". Her copy promised the soap would increase the beauty of one's skin; it offered a color print and a week's supply of the soap for 10 cents. The slogan became so popular that Woodbury used it until the 1940s. Albert Lasker said the ad's use of sex appeal made it one of three great landmarks in advertising history. It was ranked 31st on ''Advertising Age's'' list of the top 100 campaigns of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/resor-helen-lansdowne-1886-1964/98850/ "Resor, Helen Lansdowne (1886-1964)" in ''Advertising Age'' Sept 15, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nudity===
In 1936, Woodbury was one of the first companies to use nudity in its advertisements. The ad, known as "The Sun Bath", was photographed by [[Edward Steichen]] and showed a nude woman lying on stairs on her side with her back to the camera. The text advertised that Woodbury Soap was now enriched with "filter sunshine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherrow|first=Victoria |title=For Appearance' Sake: The Historical Encyclopedia of Good Looks, Beauty, and Grooming|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=1-573-56204-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many celebrities appeared in advertisements for Woodbury Soap.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Streitmatter, ''Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In international perspective, a 2008 comparison of nudity in advertising in Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States reveals that China and the United States have the most demure ads, while Germany and Thailand exposed more of the female body. There is little variation in male undress.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle R. Nelson and Hye-Jin Paek, "Nudity of female and male models in primetime TV advertising across seven countries," ''International Journal of Advertising'' (2008) 27#5 pp 715-744&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
In the early 20th century, psychologists Walter D. Scott and [[John B. Watson]] contributed applied psychological theory to the field of advertising. Scott said, "Man has been called the reasoning animal but he could with greater truthfulness be called the creature of suggestion. He is reasonable, but he is to a greater extent suggestible".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L.T., &amp; Baker, D.B. 2004. Industrial-organizational psychology: The new psychology and the business of advertising. ''From Séance to Science: A History of the Profession of Psychology in America''. 118-121. California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated this through his advertising technique of a direct command to the consumer. The former chair at [[Johns Hopkins University]], John B. Watson was a highly recognized psychologist in the 1920s. After leaving the field of academia he turned his attention towards advertising where he implemented the concepts of [[behaviorism]] into advertising. This focused on appealing to the basic emotions of the consumer: love, hate, and fear. This type of advertising proved to be extremely effective as it suited the changing social context which led to heavy influence of future advertising strategy and cemented the place of psychology in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;T. Jackson Lears,  "From salvation to self-realization: Advertising and the therapeutic roots of the consumer culture, 1880-1930."

===Albert Lasker:  Salesmanship in print===
{{main article|Albert Lasker}}
Chicago, along with New York, was the center of the nation's advertising industry. Albert Lasker, known as the "father of modern advertising," made Chicago his base 1898–1942. As head of the [[Draftfcb|Lord and Thomas agency]], Lasker devised a copywriting technique that appealed directly to the psychology of the consumer. Women seldom smoked cigarettes; he told them if they smoked [[Lucky Strikes]] they could stay slender. Lasker's use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for [[Palmolive (soap)|Palmolive]] soap, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste, [[Kotex]] products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur W. Schultz, "Albert Lasker's Advertising Revolution," ''Chicago History,'' Nov 2002, Vol. 31#2 pp. 36–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Lasker had an inquiring mind about what advertising was and how it worked. Lasker believed that advertising consisted of news and information was news, He changed his mind when a colleague Johnny Kennedy told him, "News is a technique of presentation, but advertising is a very simple thing. I can give it to you in three words, it is 'salesmanship in print'".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Cruikshank &amp; Arthur W. Schultz, ''The Man Who Sold America,'' pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;  Lasker and Kennedy used this concept with [[Whirlpool Corporation|the 1900 Washer Co.]] (later Whirlpool). Their campaign was so successful that, within four months of running the first ad, they attracted additional clients and their "advertising spend" went from $15,000 a year to $30,000 a month. Within six months, their firm was one of the three or four largest advertisers in the nation.

In 1908 Lasker recruited [[Claude C. Hopkins]] to the firm, specifically to work on the Van Camp Packaging Company ([[Van Camp's]]) account. The relationship lasted for 17 years. Lasker helped create America's infatuation with orange juice. Lord &amp; Thomas acquired the [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated]] account in 1908, when the citrus industry was in a slump. Lasker created campaigns that not only encouraged consumers to eat oranges, but also to drink orange juice.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunther, ''Taken at the Flood'' (1960) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Lasker's pioneering contributions was the introduction into public schools of classes that explained to young girls about puberty and [[menstruation]] (done to promote [[Kotex]] [[tampons]]). He is also credited as the creator of the [[soap opera]] genre, and using radio and television as media driven by advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heinrich|first1=Thomas|last2=Batchelor|first2=Bob|title=Kotex, Kleenex, Huggies: Kimberly-Clark and the Consumer Revolution in American Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlPNB5HpRDIC&amp;pg=PA83|year=2004|publisher=Ohio State University Press|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cruikshank|first1=Jeffrey L.|last2=Schultz|first2=Arthur|title=The Man Who Sold America: The Amazing (but True!)

Morello, ''Selling the President, 1920: Albert D. Lasker, Advertising, and the Election of Warren G. Harding'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the radio from the 1920s===
{{main article|History of broadcasting}}
[[File:1930.05.06 Advertisement for Radio Broadcast With Lisa Roma.gif|thumb|Advertisement for a live radio broadcast, sponsored by a milk company and published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on May 6, 1930]]

In the early 1920s, the first radio stations were established by radio equipment manufacturers and retailers who offered programs in order to sell more radios to consumers. Madison Avenue early on recognized the importance of radio as a new advertising medium. Advertising provided the major funding for most stations. United States, never had a licensing fee for set users.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Smulyan]], ''Selling radio: The commercialization of American broadcasting, 1920-1934'' (Smithsonian Inst Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  Great Britain Use the mandatory fee on set owners to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], Which to this day operates without commercials or advertising.  However, the government permitted
commercial television in 1954 and commercial radio in 1972.

[[Public service advertising]], [[non-commercial advertising]], public interest advertising, [[cause marketing]], and [[social marketing]] are different terms for (or aspects of) the use of sophisticated advertising and marketing communications techniques (generally associated with commercial enterprise) on behalf of non-commercial, public interest issues and initiatives.

In the United States, the granting of television and radio licenses by the FCC is contingent upon the station broadcasting a certain amount of [[public service ad]]vertising. To meet these requirements, many broadcast stations in America air the bulk of their required public service announcements during the late night or early morning when the smallest percentage of viewers are watching, leaving more day and prime time commercial slots available for high-paying advertisers.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Public service advertising in the United States reached its height during the world wars.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Creel]], ''How we advertised America: The first telling of the amazing story of the Committee on Public Information that carried the gospel of Americanism to every corner of the globe'' (1920).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Hollihan, "Propagandizing in the interest of war: A rhetorical study of the committee on public information." ''Southern Journal of Communication'' 49#3 (1984): 241-257.&lt;/ref&gt; During WWII President Roosevelt commissioned the creation of The War Advertising Council (now known as the [[Ad Council]]) which is the United States' largest developer of PSA campaigns on behalf of government agencies and non-profit organizations, including the longest-running public service campaign, [[Smokey Bear]].&lt;ref&gt;Dannagal Goldthwaite Young, "Sacrifice, consumption, and the [[American way]] of life: Advertising and domestic propaganda during World War II." ''The Communication Review'' 8#1 (2005) pp: 27-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Griffith, "The Selling of America: The Advertising Council and American Politics, 1942–1960." ''Business History Review'' 57#3 (1983): 388-412 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3114050 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s and World War II===
Advertising came under heavy pressure in the 1930s. The [[Great Depression]] forced businesses to drastically cut back on their advertising spending. Layoffs and reductions were common at all agencies. The [[New Deal]] furthermore aggressively promoted [[consumerism]], and minimized the value or need of advertising.  Historian Jackson Lears argues that "By the late 1930s, though, corporate advertisers had begun a successful counterattack against their critics." They rehabilitated the concept of consumer sovereignty by inventing scientific public opinion polls, and making it the centerpiece of their own [[market research]], as well has the key to understanding politics. [[George Gallup]], the vice president of [[Young and Rubicam]], and numerous other advertising experts, led the way.  Moving into the 1940s, the industry played a leading role in the ideological mobilization of the American people for fighting the Nazis and Japanese in World War II. As part of that effort, they redefined the "American Way of Life" in terms of a commitment to free enterprise. "Advertisers," Lears concludes, "played a crucial hegemonic role in creating the consumer culture that dominated post-World War II American society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson Lears|title=Fables Of Abundance: A Cultural History Of Advertising In America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RgoXBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235|year=1995|publisher=Basic Books|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean M. Converse," ''Survey Research in the United States: Roots and Emergence 1960'' (1987) pp: 114-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar era===
In the prosperous postwar era, millions of Americans moved into new housing, especially in the rapidly growing suburbs. They spent heavily on housing, appliances, furniture, clothing and automobiles. The coming of television in the 1950s dramatically enlarged the arena for advertising. With most families having automobiles, and more leisure time, travel holidays became much more common, and the motel and [[tourism]] industries eagerly supported large-scale advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Richard K. Popp, ''The Holiday Makers: Magazines, Advertising and Mass Tourism in Postwar America'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the public service arena, the Ad Council aggressively promoted [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]] as a [[Cold War]] strategy, with campaigns such as the Freedom Train, the Crusade for Freedom, Religion in American Life, Adams for Piece, and Peoples Capitalism.  The new Brand Names Foundation sponsored conferences, local campaigns, and educational programs to promote brand loyalty, as well as free enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Spring, ''Advertising in the Age of Persuasion: Building Brand America, 1941-1961'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Hidden Persuaders'' (1957) popular writer [[Vance Packard]] exposes the use of consumer [[motivational research]] and other psychological techniques, including depth psychology and [[subliminal message|subliminal]] tactics. They had been used to manipulate expectations and induce desire for products since the 1920s, but the popular audience was caught by surprise. He identified eight "compelling needs" that advertisers promise products will fulfill. According to Packard these needs are so strong that people are compelled to buy products to satisfy them. The book questions the [[morality]] of using these techniques.&lt;ref name=DiRenzo&gt;Gordon Di Renzo (1958) ''The American Catholic Sociological Review'', Vol. 19, No. 4 (Dec., 1958) (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial themes====
Before the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, black people were largely missing from mainstream white advertising. Those who did appear typically followed the long-standing "hierarchy of skin color" whereby those with lighter skin tones were seen as being more socially and culturally acceptable than dark-skinned black people.&lt;ref&gt;Julia M. Bristor, Renee Gravois Lee, and Michelle R. Hunt. "Race and ideology: African-American images in television advertising." ''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'' (1995): 48-59. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30000378 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jannette Lake Dates and William Barlow, eds., ''Split image: African Americans in the mass media'' (Howard University Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most national corporations before the 1960s ignored the black market, and paid little attention to working with black merchants or hiring blacks for responsible positions. [[Pepsi|Pepsi-Cola]] was a major exception, as the number two brand fought for parity with [[Coca-Cola]].  The upstart soda brand hired black promoters who penetrated into black markets across the South and the urban North. Journalist Stephanie Capparell interviewed six men who were on the team in the late 1940s: 
:The team members had a grueling schedule, working seven days a week, morning and night, for weeks on end. They visited bottlers, churches, "ladies groups," schools, college campuses, YMCAs, community centers, insurance conventions, teacher and doctor conferences, and various civic organizations. They got famous jazzmen such as Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton to give shout-outs for Pepsi from the stage. No group was too small or too large to target for a promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Capparell, "How Pepsi Opened Door to Diversity." ''CHANGE'' 63 (2007): 1-26 [http://www.comlabgames.com/45-870N/instructor/01_day/How_Pepsi_Opened_Door_to_Diversity.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:New-York tribune., November 07, 1909, Page 20, Image 44 Aunt Jemima.jpg|right|thumb|Quaker Oats 1909 newspaper ad directed at white consumers with stereotypical images and dolls.]]

Pepsi advertisements avoided the stereotypical images common in the major media that depicted  one-dimensional [[Aunt Jemima]]s and [[Uncle Ben's|Uncle Bens]] whose role was to draw a smile from white customers. Instead it portrayed black customers as self-confident [[middle-class]] citizens who showed very good taste in their soft drinks. They were economical too, as Pepsi bottles were twice the size.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Capparell, ''The Real Pepsi Challenge: The Inspirational Story of Breaking the Color Barrier in American Business'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, more than a few token blacks were hired at advertising agencies, and the sensitivity to the problem increased.  The leading black  magazines [[Essence (magazine)|''Essence'']] and [[Jet (magazine)|''Jet'']] routinely deplored racism in mainstream media, especially in the negative depictions of black men and women. However ''Essence'' and ''Jet'' in the 21st century themselves ran about a dozen ads a year, especially for skin lighteners, that were pervaded with "racism and White supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Hazell and Juanne Clarke, "Race and Gender in the Media: A Content Analysis of Advertisements in Two Mainstream Black Magazines" ''Journal of Black Studies'' (2008) 39#1 pp 5-21. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40282545 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tobacco====
By the 1950s, fears of [[cancer]] from tobacco [[smoking]] caused consternation in the [[tobacco industry]], which turned to advertisers for help in avoiding falling consumer [[demand]] and increased regulation. British and American agencies separately arrived at similar solutions.  The Tobacco Industry Research Committee in the United States and the Tobacco Manufacturers' Standing Committee in Britain each assuaged public anxieties and encouraged the misperception that the cigarette makers were resolving the issues through filters and low tar formulations. The public relations approach was successful in the short run, but the accumulation of medical evidence led to a fall in smoking, heavier taxation, and increased regulation. The agencies responded with sophisticated advertising strategies designed to encourage adolescent smokers as well as to recruit new smokers in [[developing countries|less-developed foreign markets]].&lt;ref&gt;David T. Courtwright,  "'Carry on Smoking': Public Relations and Advertising Strategies of American and British Tobacco Companies since 1950," ''Business History'' (2005) 47#3 pp 421-432. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00076790500056044?journalCode=fbsh20 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cable television from the 1980s===
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of cable television and particularly [[MTV]]. Pioneering the concept of the music video, MTV ushered in a new type of advertising: the consumer tunes in ''for'' the advertising message, rather than it being a [[by-product]] or afterthought. As cable and satellite television became increasingly prevalent, [[specialty channel]]s emerged, including channels entirely [[Shopping channel|devoted to advertising]], such as [[QVC]], [[Home Shopping Network]], and [[ShopTV Canada]].

===On the Internet from the 1990s===
{{main article|Online advertising}}
With the advent of the [[ad server]], marketing through the Internet opened new frontiers for advertisers and contributed to the "[[dot-com bubble|dot-com]]" boom of the 1990s. Entire corporations operated solely on advertising revenue, offering everything from [[coupon]]s to free Internet access. At the turn of the 21st century, a number of websites, including the [[Web search engine|search engine]] [[Google]], started a change in [[online advertising]] by emphasizing contextually relevant ads based on an individual's browsing interests. This has led to a plethora of similar efforts and an increasing trend of [[interactive advertising]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The share of advertising spending relative to GDP has changed little across large changes in media. For example, in the US in 1925, the main advertising media were newspapers, magazines, signs on [[Tram|streetcars]], and outdoor [[poster]]s. Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998, television and radio had become major advertising media. Nonetheless, advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lower – about 2.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm |title=Annual U.S. Advertising Expenditure Since 1919 |publisher=Galbithink.org |date=September 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 20, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090401205848/http://galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm| archivedate= April 1, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising business model has also been adapted since the 1990s.  In [[media for equity]], advertising is not sold, but provided to start-up companies in return for [[equity (finance)|equity]]. If the company grows and is sold, the media companies receive cash for their shares.

Chinese advertising is moving heavily to the smartphone, leaving television behind. Companies in China are increasingly more focused on mobile advertisements than on television advertisements. Central roles are played by Chinese-based social networking sites Weixin (also known as WeChat), and Sina Weibo, and the efforts of Western companies, including Coca-Cola, Burberry, and North Face, to market to Chinese consumers through their smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Stevenson and Shanshan Wang. "A Jump to Mobile Ads in China." ''New York Times'', 22 Dec 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restrictions on advertising====
Since the 1950s, the industry itself, or the government, has imposed some restrictions on advertising certain types of products, especially liquor and cigarettes. Tobacco bans exist in many major countries across the world and cover 2.3 billion people.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, ''WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic, 2013: enforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship'' (World Health Organization, 2013) [http://www.who.int/tobacco/global_report/2013/en/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s Quebec banned some advertising directed at children. The restrictions have hindered competition in the breakfast cereal market when compared with the rest of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;C. Robert Clark, "Advertising Restrictions and Competition in the Children's Breakfast Cereal Industry," ''Journal of Law &amp; Economics'' (2007) 50#4 pp 757-780. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/519820 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 1900:  Europe==
[[File:Michelin Poster 1898.jpg|thumb|A poster by "[[Marius Rossillon|O'Galop]]" of [[Bibendum]], the Michelin Man, 1898]]
[[J. Walter Thompson]] became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Ciochetto, ''Globalisation and Advertising in Emerging Economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China'' (Routledge, 2013) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet]] (1906-1996) was the most prominent leader of French advertising in the 20th century. He founded [[Publicis]]. After 1945 his little-known Paris-based advertising agency grew rapidly, becoming the world's fourth largest agency. It was a leader in promoting France's post-war economic boom, especially the expansion of the advertising industry. It was successful because of its close ties with top officials of the French government, its clever use of symbols to promote itself, and its ability to attract clients from widely diverse growing industries.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Lorin, ''5 Giants of Advertising'' (Assouline Pub., 2001). pp 82-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark Hultquist, "Publicis and the French advertising world, 1946--1968" ''Essays in Economic &amp; Business History'' (2009) 27: 61-76&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of whether advertising reflects society or shapes society, can be seen in European models that diverged from the American style.  In France, [[Michelin]] dominated the tire industry and was one of the leading advertisers; to this day [[Michelin Guide|its famous guidebooks]] are very widely used by upscale travelers.  From 1894 to the present its symbol was [[Bibendum]] (the "Michelin Man" made of tires). He was a lord of industry, a master of all he surveyed, and a patriotic expounder of the French spirit. In the 1920s, Bibendum urged Frenchmen to adopt America's superior factory system, but to patriotically avoid using the "inferior" products of those factories.  As automobiles diffused to the middle classes, Michelin advertising likewise shifted downscale, and its restaurant and hotel guides covered a broader range of price categories.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Harp, ''Marketing Michelin. Advertising and Cultural Identity in Twentieth-Century France'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Martin,  "Le marché publicitaire Français et les grands médias 1918-1970." ''Vingtieme siecle. Revue d'histoire'' (1988): 75-90. [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/xxs_0294-1759_1988_num_20_1_2796 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

J Walter Thompson expanded successfully in many countries, but France was not one of them.  French businessmen did not like the American tone, and were fearful of Americanization. The French market was heavily regulated and protected to repel foreign interests, and the American admen in Paris were not good at hiding their condescension and insensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Eric Hultquist,  "Americans in Paris: The J. Walter Thompson Company in France, 1927–1968." ''Enterprise and Society'' 4#03 (2003): 471-501.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
As millions of American soldiers passed through  Britain during the Second World War, there were fearsof an "Americanization" of British commerce and culture. The Marshall Plan explicitly required and upgrading of the marketing and organizational skills of British industry. There were fears among the leaders of the  London advertising world of what the brash, rich Americans would do to them.    Radio and television was off limits to advertising, because BBC relied on fees paid by owners of radio receivers.  The question was whether the heavily funded American methods would prove irresistible. JWT London was an American owned  advertising agency controlled by J. Walter Thompson in New York City.   JWT London avoided being  the bold apostle of the American style. Instead  it is relied on soft persuasion, shedding its Americanness to adapt to the British understated style.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Nixon,  "Apostles of Americanization? J. Walter Thompson Company Ltd, Advertising and Anglo-American Relations 1945-67," ''Contemporary British History'' (2008) 22#4 pp 477-499.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the 1920s, most advertising was handled by manufacturing companies in-house. Numerous small advertising agencies handled purchase of space in the media, but did not design campaigns or the ads themselves. An important role was played by travelling salesmen in promoting products to wholesalers and retailers and providing feedback from the market to the producer.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela E. Swett, ''Selling under the Swastika: Advertising and Commercial Culture in Nazi Germany'' (2014) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Nazi era (1933–45), the advertising industry expelled its Jews, and came under the supervision of the "Ad Council for the German Economy," a department of the propaganda ministry of [[Joseph Goebbels]]. The relationship was friendly, For the industry learned a great deal from the Nazi propaganda techniques. The industry promoted Hitler's favorite products, such as the promised Volkswagen automobile for the people, and the construction of autobahns. It emphasized the availability of trusted brands despite growing shortages after the war began in 1939. It helped support the regime, articulating a vision of consumption that was well aligned with the Nazi spirit. In some environments and social movements, such as with post-WW2 East Germany Stasi's [[zersetzung]], criminology theorists estimated advertisement was used as a means to crime, the nature of the crime was the intentional exploitation of an individual to cause damage to the individual's ability to form social bonds and appropriate perceptions of the world. This is especially true in the case of manipulation, people take advantage of their underdeveloped social skills and exploit them for selfish gain, this was later criticized to be adopted by turpitude agents of modern advertising. Many major brands were off the market by 1944, because of severe shortages. When they returned after the war, they were welcomed as an index of normality and were not associated with Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Swett, ''Selling under the Swastika'' (2014) ch 2-6&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, German advertising agencies were starting to mimic American methods.&lt;ref&gt;Harm G. Schröter, "Die Amerikanisierung der Werbung in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland," ["The Americanization of advertising in West Germany."] ''Jahrbuch für Wirtschaftsgeschichte'' (1997), Issue 1, pp 93-115, dates the Americanization to the 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coca-Cola was advising  "Mach mal Pause" ("Take a Rest!), and conservative Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was running for reelection with the slogan "Keine Experimente!" ("No Experiments!").&lt;ref&gt;Gries, Rainer et al. "Die Ära Adenauer: Zeitgeschichte im Werbeslogan. 'Mach Mal Pause,' 'Keine Experimente!'" ''Journal Geschichte'' (1989)  Issue 3, pp 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The German agencies have always remained small and limited in scope,&lt;ref&gt;"German agencies often overlooked on global scene." ''Marketing News'' (Aug 29, 1986) v. 20 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; even after the unification of East Germany and West Germany in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Cote and Dagmar Mussey, "German advertising growing together: unification of Germany, EC electrify market," ''Advertising Age'' (Feb. 11 1991), V. 62, pp 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; After unification, Germany became the third largest ad market in the world, with $18 billion in total ad spending in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;''Advertising Age'' (March 21, 1994) v. 65 p. I-14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The American influence became strong in Italy after 1945.  The high risk of communist success led the American government to invest heavily in propaganda activities.&lt;ref&gt;Simona Tobia. ''Advertising America: The United States Information Service in Italy (1945–1956)'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several American firms opened offices, including Young &amp; Rubicon and Ogilvy &amp; Mather. Italian graphic designers, most prominently [[Armando Testa]], were inspired by modernist aesthetics and thinking brought in by the American advertising agencies and techniques in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Simona De Iulio,  and Carlo Vinti, "La publicité italienne et le modèle américain: le débat entre les artistes et techniciens, 1948-1960," [Italian advertising and the American model: the debate between artists and technicians, 1948-60] ''Vingtième Siecle'' (2009), Issue 101, pp 61-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  The advertising industry helped transform Italy into a consumer-oriented society.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Arvidsson, "Pubblicita E Consumi Nell'Italia Del Dopoguerra" [Advertising and consumerism in postwar Italy] ''Contemporanea: Rivista di Storia dell '800 e del '900'' (2001) 4#4 pp 649-672.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Oliviero Toscani International Journalism Festival 3.jpg|thumb|200px|Oliviero Toscani]]

A dramatic example of how advertising nudged the Italian middle-class into modern consumer society appears in the heavily advertised automatic washing machine. It appeared on the Italian market in 1958 and by 1965, 23% of families had purchased one, reaching 42% by 1970. Advertisers hailed the  mechanization of domestic tedium as the advent of a new women's "liberation."  Commentary appeared everywhere, from advertisements to the specialized press, to women's reviews. Architects and designers made room for the new marvel, as the promotional language celebrating the device became a chorus of praise for domestic appliances as the secret of  "progress" and "freedom" and "liberation."  On the other hand, husbands still insisted on driving the family automobile; it was off-limits to the liberated female.&lt;ref&gt;Enrica Asquer, "La Signora Candy e la sua lavatrice: storia di un'intesa perfetta nell'Italia degli anni Sessanta." [Mrs. Candy and her washing machine: a perfect love story in 1960s Italy] ''Genesis'' 1 (2006) pp: 1000-1022.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Armando Testa Set up a full-service advertising agency in 1956, specializing in the new medium of television advertising.  He was inspired by Eastern European animation techniques, and often use simple graphics like the blue hippo. His son Marco Testa, trained at Benton &amp; Bowles in New York, and maintained the fast-paced, witty style.&lt;ref&gt;Tungate, ''Adland: A Global History of Advertising'' pp 138-43&lt;/ref&gt; Emmanuelle Pirella, who trained at the Italian offices of Young &amp; Rubicon and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, emerged as a leading copywriter.

[[Benetton Group|Benetton]] gained worldwide attention for its saucy advertising, inspired by its art director [[Oliviero Toscani]]. He started with multicultural themes, tied together under the campaign "United Colors of Benetton" then became increasingly provocative with interracial groupings, and unusual sexual images, such as a nun kissing a priest.&lt;ref&gt;Tungate, ''Adland: A Global History of Advertising'' pp 146-49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Since 1900: Asia and Africa==

===Japan===
[[Dentsu]] is the dominant firm in Japan thanks to its origins as a media representative. It produced Japan's first newspaper advertisements as well as the first television commercials. It was established in 1901 as Japan Advertising Ltd. and Telegraphic Service Co. by Hoshiro Mitsunaga. In 1936, it sold off its news division to Doumei News Agency, to focus on advertising. In 1946, it purchased 16 small companies and set up operational bases in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Kyūshū. Dentsu company now offers a range of services, from traditional and creative marketing to specialty disciplines such as sports marketing, investing in feature film production and acquiring broadcasting rights, PR, digital contents, and a growing range of communications services.&lt;ref&gt;Kotaro Sugiyama and Tim Andree. ''The Dentsu Way: Secrets of Cross Switch Marketing from the World's Most Innovative Advertising Agency'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In the first 20 years of communist control of China (1947 to 1966) Mao Zedong tried to reverse the long-standing advertising practices of Chinese newspapers, considering it a capitalist infringement on the goals of socialism. Consumerism, which had been highly developed in Shanghai, was anathema, to Mao's peasant-based communist perspective. The regime emphasized maximum production rather than optimal consumption. The approach worsened the massive famines that happened when national resources were devoted to a highly inefficient factory production at the cost of basic food output. On the other hand, propaganda was highly developed art in the Communist Party, and so a sort of  compromise was reached. Socialist-oriented advertising emphasized the collective good, rather than the benefits of products for the individual consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Gerth, "Compromising with Consumerism in Socialist China: Transnational Flows and Internal Tensions in 'Socialist Advertising'", ''Past &amp; Present'' (2013 Supplement)  pp 203-232  [http://karl-gerth.pubs-hub.ucsd.edu/mm_uploads/gerth-past-y-present-2013.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, the strength of the private economy, and advertising, has grown dramatically.  By the 1980s much emphasis was placed on the role of advertising in promoting [[Chinese economic reform|the Four Modernizations]] emphasized by [[Deng Xiaoping]].  Lip service is still paid to old Maoist ideals by recycling images of historic places and episodes, but it does not inhibit the growth of consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;Xin Zhao and Russell W. Belk, "Politicizing Consumer Culture: Advertising's Appropriation of Political Ideology in China's Social Transition," ''Journal of Consumer Research'' (2008) 35#2 pp 231-244&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Chinese entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002, its advertising industry has fundamentally changed. It has become the world's fastest-growing advertising market and the country with the largest pool of netizens.  Major changes have come in terms of shifting cultural values, the growing role of brand names,  the attractiveness of English-language titles to the younger generation,  the redefinition of  acceptable/offensive advertising,  the very rapid growth of new media (especially the Internet and smart phones),  the emergence of on-line shopping in a country with an underdeveloped system of department stores in shopping centers, and much more advanced techniques of managing advertising agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Kineta Hung, et al.  "Advertising Research in the Post-WTO Decade in China," ''Journal of Advertising'' (2012) 41#3 pp 121-146&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Many elements of Indian culture and industry have British roots, so that British advertising models usually work well. In 1991, the government dramatically liberalized Indian economy, opening it to international business. The emergence of a moderately affluent middle-class numbering in the hundreds of millions attracts multinational corporations and international advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;William M. O'Barr, "Advertising in India." ''Advertising &amp; Society Review'' 9#.3 (2008) pp: 1-33. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/advertising_and_society_review/v009/9.3.o-barr.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aruna Chandra, David A. Griffith, and John K. Ryans, "Advertising standardisation in India: US multinational experience" ''International Journal of Advertising'' (2002) 21#1 pp47-66&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertising in India operates at two levels. Ads for high-value products appear in English-language papers such as ''The Hindu'' and ''The Madras Mail,'' which targeted Europeans and high-status Indians. By contrast, ads for low-value products are typically placed in vernacular papers and are aimed at a lower middle class with highly restricted spending power. The working class and peasant populations, with very low disposable incomes, are seldom targeted by the advertising agencies. Local merchants might use signs and posters to reach them.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas E. Haynes, "Advertising and the History of South Asia, 1880–1950" p 363&lt;/ref&gt;  Cricket is one sport where the Indians have had an international success, so that cricket stars are prominent endorsers in national advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Sumit Sharma, "Indian cricket players are becoming big winners for many advertisers," ''Asian Wall Street Journal'' (May 11, 1998) p 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtle cultural norms can be easily transgressed. In 2002, widespread protests forced Hindustan Lever Ltd. (the Indian subsidiary of London-based Unilever) to cancel  a television ad campaign for its fairness cream because of its portrayal of women. The campaign was built around the theme of a father lamenting "If only I had a son" while showing his problem: a dark-skinned, unattractive daughter.  Fast-forward.  She uses the Fair &amp; Lovely cream and has become a gorgeous light-skinned beauty.  Clad in a stylish miniskirt, she is a successful airline flight attendant and takes her proud father to dine at a five-star hotel.  The All India Women's Democratic Association ([[AIDWA]]), a far left political organization, lodged a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission in New Delhi. It argued endorsing the traditional preference for sons strengthens gender discrimination, which is a major problem in India. Furthermore, said AIDWA, the ad perpetuated a culture of discrimination in a society where "fair skin" is synonymous with "beautiful."  The government's Ministry of Information and Broadcast sided with AIDWA and directed stations not to air the ads because they violated the Cable and Television Networks Act of 1995 which states that no advertisement shall be permitted which "derides any race, caste, color, creed and nationality" and furthermore states that, "Women must not be portrayed in a manner that emphasizes passive, submissive qualities and encourages them to play a subordinate secondary role in the family and society."  The minister told Parliament that if broadcasters do not regulate ad content the government will be forced to do so. The Mumbai-based Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a body of advertisers and media agencies, insisted that it should do the regulating not the government. ASCI had already told Hindustan Lever that its ad campaign was offensive and it was ended.&lt;ref&gt;Arundhati Parmar, "Objections to Indian ad not taken lightly" ''Marketing News'' (June 9, 2003) 37#12 pp 4-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing world===
During the decolonization era from the late 1940s to the 1970s, British and French firms operating  in Africa and Asia at first largely ignored local, nationalistic aspirations.  However they learned to  adjust to exploit  the new spirit of independence that was shaping consumer attitudes.  The new emergence of a middle class was the target audience.  Their advertising abandoned the traditional  paternalistic attitude toward the natives. Instead there was a portrayal of locals as up-and-coming middle class men  in control of developing their nations. These more positive images assisted business operations  during spells of military dictatorship, economic nationalism, and expropriation of foreign assets.&lt;ref&gt;Sephanie Decker, "Corporate Legitimacy and Advertising: British Companies and the Rhetoric of Development in West Africa, 1950-1970," ''Business History Review'' (2007) 81#1 pp 59-86&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco advertising was especially important. For example, in Egyptian popular culture the cigar was associated with elites, the water pipe with a lower-class and traditional lifestyle, and the cigarette with the new middle class which was striving to make the transition to modernity.  It was the third group that the cigarette industry targeted.&lt;ref&gt;Relli Shechter, "Reading advertisements in a colonial/development context: Cigarette advertising and identity politics in Egypt, c1919-1939." ''Journal of social history'' 39#2 (2005): 483-503. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3790779 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil is the largest country in Latin America, and number five in the world in terms of population. Its economy grew rapidly in the 21st century, until it began to stall in 2010. At that time it was the world's sixth-biggest advertising market, at $US 14.2 billion.  Brazil in 2010 ranks #1 in deodorants, #2 in children's products, #3 in cosmetics, and #4 in automobile sales&lt;ref&gt;Laurel Wentz and Claudia Penteado, "Why so many agencies are storming road to Sao Paulo" ''Advertising Age'' (Dec. 6 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
The start in 1994 of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] had a dramatic impact on the adveritising industry in Mexico, with its 130 full service agencies and 270 smaller operations under the auspisces of the Mexican Association of Advertising Agencies.  The flood of American brand-name products greatly expanded the scope of the advertising industry, and the Mexican agencies faced new competition from branch offices of international firms.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McCurry, "Advertising in transition: agencies change their image to meet market demand" ''Business Mexico'' (Sept. 1992) 2#4, Vol. 2, p4+&lt;/ref&gt;

A key to the new market was that upscale consumers in Mexico typically display [[Malinchism|"malinchismo"]], which is a preference for imported American brands rather than local Mexican brands. As a result, American products are sold mostly to the middle class market, and their advertising agencies generally avoid working class and rural areas. They concentrate their efforts instead on Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, which purchase 70 percent of the American imports.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ueltschy, and John K. Ryans, Jr., "Employing standardized promotion strategies in Mexico: the impact of language and cultural differences," ''International Executive'' (July 1997) 39#4 pp 479+&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertising battles in Mexico, include not only issues of quality, but issues of national authenticity. For example, in Mexico in the 1990s, two American exporters Procter &amp; Gamble and Frito-Lay fought an advertising battle concerning whose potato chips are tastier, more natural, and more Mexican. Procter &amp; Gamble challenged Frito-Lay's Sabritas which controls 80 percent of the $1 billion chip market.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Friedland, "P&amp;G, Frito-Lay in Mexican—ad standoff," ''Wall Street Journal'' (March 19, 1999).

[[Image:Huff 'n'puff equipment.png|right|frame|Huff and Puff Apparatus respiration demonstration]]

The '''huff and puff apparatus''' is used in school [[biology]] labs to demonstrate that [[carbon dioxide]] is a product of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]].  A pupil breathes in and out of the middle tube. The glass tubing is arranged in such a way that one flask bubbles as the pupils breathes in, the other as the pupil breathes out. A suitable carbon dioxide indicator, such as [[limewater]] or [[bicarbonate indicator]] shows the increased presence of carbon dioxide in the outgoing breath.This turns the bicarbonate into milky white substance.

'''''Humanist''''' is an international electronic [[seminar]] on humanities computing and the [[digital humanities]], in the form of a long-running [[electronic mailing list]] and its associated archive. The primary aim of ''Humanist'' is to provide a forum for discussion of intellectual, scholarly, pedagogical, and social issues and for exchange of information among members.

''Humanist'' is also a [[publication]] of the [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO) and the [[Office for Humanities Communication]] (OHC) and an affiliated publication of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (ACLS). In  2008, there were 1650 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Report on ''Humanist'' 2007‐8 |author= Willard McCarty |date= June 15, 2008 |url= http://digitalhumanities.org/humanist/McCarty__Report_on_Humanist_2008-abbreviated.pdf |accessdate= October 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ''Humanist'' list was created in 1987 by [[Willard McCarty]], then at the [[University of Toronto]], as a [[BITNET]] (NetNorth in Canada) [[electronic mail]] newsletter for people who support computing in the humanities for the [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]].  McCarty, later at [[King's College London]], continued to edit it.

Although ''Humanist'' started off as a means of communication for people directly involved in the support of humanities computing, it grew in scope to become an extended conversation about the nature of "humanities computing" (or "digital humanities", or one of a contested range of other names), about what computing looks like viewed from the humanities, and humanities from computing: "''Humanist'' remains the forum within which the technology, informed by the concerns of humane learning, can be viewed from an interdisciplinary common ground." &lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalhumanities.org/humanist/announcement.html What is ''Humanist''?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Institute of International Relations''' (Institut Européen des Relations Internationales IERI) is an independent research center, providing training and debates on major international issues. It was established in 1997. 

IERI's areas of study and research cover different fields of international relations, including economic, political, strategic and security aspects.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieri.be/fr/about |title=Qui sommes-nous ? &amp;#124; IERI |publisher=Ieri.be |date= |accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IERI is a founder of an institution of higher education named ADE (Academia Diplomatica Europaea), organizing conferences and representing  a forum for diplomats, military and senior officials.

== Objectives==

The IERI's initiatives are preserved in the perspective of the emergence of diplomatic, geopolitical and strategic culture according to the provisions related to the European External Action Service.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieri.be/fr/ade/presentation |title=Présentation &amp;#124; IERI |publisher=Ieri.be |date= |accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

At the beginning of 1990, following the German and European reunification, the activation of a political role of the European Community led to a new impetus of European integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/institutional_and_economic_framework/treaties_maastricht_fr.htm |title=Traité de Maastricht sur l'Union européenne |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the year 1992, now named the European Union had in its hands the first tools to assert its existence on the international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touteleurope.eu/fr/actions/relations-exterieures/politique-etrangere-et-de-defense/presentation/la-politique-etrangere-et-de-securite-commune-pesc.html |title=Toute l'Europe: La politique étrangère et de sécurité commune (PESC) |publisher=Touteleurope.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is in this perspective that has placed a University professor, Mr. Irnerio Seminatore in the creation of the European Institute of International Relations.

== Organization ==
* '''Disciplinary Fields'''

The studies of IERI include 3 areas: 

# analysis of political and military strategies with the focus on foreign policy, defence and security policy (CFSP/PCSD), including Euro-Atlantic and Euro-Asiatic relations
# analysis of European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) of the EU, Russia, and central Asian countries
# forms of  integration and regional security institutions : OSCE, SCO, APEC, ASEAN, NAFTA, MECOSUR, UMP, GCC, etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

* '''Publications'''

IERI regularly publishes “working papers” and “IERI news” on topics dealt with the annual courses and conferences of the Academia Diplomatica Europaea (ADE), as well as on current issues. 
Theoretical essays are devoted to international system, doctrinal or epistemological approaches (“Europe between Utopia and Realpolitik”, “Essays on Europe and International system” and “Six studies on International Balance”), to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Institutions of regional integration in the Gulf, Asia and America. IERI also publishes the “Journal of CFSP-ESDP”, the Journal of European Common Foreign Policy, Security and Common Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieri.be/fr/publications |title=Publications &amp;#124; IERI |publisher=Ieri.be |date= |accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Academia Diplomatica Europaea'''

Academia Diplomatica Europaea is an institution of higher education specialized in providing a post-graduate training in diplomacy, security and defence. It includes a set of introductory seminars to the geopolitical and strategic thinking and to the study of globalization and international security. 
ADE is addressed to diplomats officials, experts on foreign and defence policy, international affaires leaders, doctoral students and university researchers. 
ADE issues a diploma. 

Over 300 conferences have been held since the founding of ADE.  They have gathered a faculty composed of European Commissioners, Ministers, Ambassadors, Diplomats, Senior Staff of the EU and of Member States, specialists, academics and other professionals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5559">'''Indigenous Futurisms''' is a movement consisting of art, literature, comics, games, and other forms of media which express Indigenous perspectives of the future, past, and present in the context of science fiction and related sub-genres. Such perspectives may reflect Indigenous ways of knowing, traditional stories, historical or contemporary politics or other cultural realities. 

Like [[Afrofuturism]], Indigenous futurism encapsulates multiple modes of art making from literature to visual arts, fashion and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guzmán|first1=Alicia Inez|title=Indigenous Futurisms|url=https://ivc.lib.rochester.edu/indigenous-futurisms/|website=InVisible Culture: An Electronic Journal for Visual Culture|publisher=University of Rochester|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Grace Dillon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaertner|first1=David|title=“WHAT’S A STORY LIKE YOU DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?”: CYBERSPACE AND INDIGENOUS FUTURISM|url=https://novelalliances.com/2015/03/23/whats-a-story-like-you-doing-in-a-place-like-this-cyberspace-and-indigenous-futurism-in-neal-stephensons-snow-crash/#_ftn1|website=Novel Alliances: Allied Perspectives on Literature, Art and New Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor in the Indigenous Nations Studies Program at Portland State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grace Dillon|url=https://www.pdx.edu/nas/grace-l-dillon-2|website=Portland State University|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous Futurisms critiques the historization of Indigenous people which is used to separate from them the contemporary world while challenging notions of what constitutes advanced technology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thenewinquiry.com/the-space-ndns-star-map/|title=The Space NDN’s Star Map|last=Cornum|first=Lou Catherine|date=January 26, 2015|website=The New Inquiry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Irish Music Hall of Fame''' was a multimedia exhibition in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] which opened in September 1999.  It recognised what it described as the best of Irish musical talent of all types over the decades. 

==Overview==
Musician and singer [[Van Morrison]] was the first person to be inducted into the museum. The museum was a memorabilia-filled display telling the story of Irish music through exclusive and personally donated merchandise from many important Irish musical artists including [[Van Morrison]], [[U2]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Rory Gallagher]], [[The Undertones]] and [[Boyzone]].

The museum has since closed and is currently looking for a new location with an undetermined reopening date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u2tour.de/travelguide/guides/en/Hot_Press_Irish_Music_Hall_Of_Fame_closed.html Infos at U2.tour.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islamic architecture''' encompasses a wide range of both secular and religious styles from the early [[history of Islam]] to the present day for  today it is known as Islamic architecture was influenced by [[Roman architecture|Roman]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]], [[Persian architecture|Persian]] and all other lands which the Muslims conquered in the 7th and 8th centuries.&lt;ref name="Krautheimer"&gt;Krautheimer, Richard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WXwX7fQ2DkUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=byzantine+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V27kUa7mKKbvygG0zoDQCA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=islam&amp;f=false Early Christian and Byzantine Architecture] Yale University Press Pelican History of Art, Penguin Books Ltd., 1965, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Banister [https://books.google.com/books?id=ULcsAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Banister+Fletcher,+A+History+of+Architecture+on+the+Comparative+Method.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4xT7UdqUDoHaqwHnqIDQAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=islam&amp;f=false A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method] 4th Edition, London, p. 476.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further east, it was also influenced by [[Chinese architecture|Chinese]] and [[Indian architecture]] as Islam spread to the [[Southeast Asia]].  It developed distinct characteristics in the form of buildings, and the decoration of surfaces with [[Islamic calligraphy]] and geometric and interlace patterned ornament.  The principal Islamic architectural types for large or public buildings are: the [[Mosque]], the [[Tomb]], the [[Palace]] and the [[Fort]]. From these four types, the vocabulary of Islamic architecture is derived and used for other buildings such as [[public baths]], [[fountains]] and domestic architecture.&lt;ref name="Cop149"&gt;Copplestone, p.149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1158658332974&amp;pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout A Tour of Architecture in Islamic Cities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the buildings which are mentioned in this article are listed as [[World Heritage Site]]s. Some of them, like the [[Citadel of Aleppo]], have suffered significant damage in the ongoing [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref name="unesco 20/6/13"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1038 UNESCO: Syria's Six World Heritage sites placed on List of World Heritage in Danger". 20 June 2013, accessed 1 February 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different approaches are taken to study traditional Islamic architecture, historical and conceptual, Nader Ardalan is one of those to analysed traditional Islamic architecture based on Gnosticism 

== Beginning ==
According to one set of views, Islam started during the lifetime of [[Muhammad]] in the [[7th century]] [[Common Era|CE]],&lt;ref name="Watt2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Watt |first=William Montgomery |authorlink=W. Montgomery Watt |title=Islam and the Integration of Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQUZ6BGyohQC |year=2003 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-17587-6 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AQUZ6BGyohQC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so did architectural components such as the mosque. In this case, either the [[Mosque of the Companions, Massawa|Mosque of the Companions]] in the [[Eritrea]]n city of [[Massawa]],&lt;ref name="Reid2012Massawa"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Richard J. |title=A History of Modern Africa: 1800 to the Present |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |chapter=The Islamic Frontier in Eastern Africa |page=106 |isbn=978-0470658987 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US6RQtYwasUC&amp;pg |date=12 January 2012 |access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Quba Mosque]] in [[Medina]], would be the [[List of the oldest mosques|first mosque]] that was built in the history of Islam.&lt;ref name="Palmer2016"&gt;{{cite book |author=Palmer, A.

According to another set of views, which uses passages of the [[Quran]],&lt;ref name="Cite quran|2|7|e=286|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|2|7|e=286|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|3|96|t=y|s=ns"&gt;{{Cite quran|3|96|t=y|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|22|25|e=37|s=ns"&gt;{{Cite quran|22|25|e=37|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam as a religion preceded Muhammad,&lt;ref name="Esposito1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Esposito |first=John |title=Islam: The Straight Path (3rd ed.) |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-511234-4 |pages=9, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito2002b"&gt;Esposito (2002b), pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peters |first=F.E. |title=Islam: A Guide for Jews and Christians |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-11553-5 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing even previous [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Prophets]] such as [[Abraham]].&lt;ref name="Alli2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Alli |first=Irfan |title=25 Prophets of Islam |publisher=''eBookIt.com'' |isbn=978-1456613075 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nRJK9sLjLsC&amp;dq |date=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham in Islam]] is credited with having built the ''[[Kaaba|Ka‘bah]]'' ({{lang-ar|كَـعْـبَـة}}, '[[Cube]]') in [[Mecca]], and consequently its [[Great Mosque of Mecca|sanctuary]], which is seen as the first mosque&lt;ref name="Palmer2016"/&gt; that ever existed.&lt;ref name="Michigan C 1986"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michigan Consortium for Medieval and Early Modern Studies |editor1=Goss, V.

The most recent building that can be known as a true example modern Islamic architecture is Imam Sadiq University, this building was the winner of Aga Khan fundation as well. This building designed by Nader Ardalan who was Iranian architect teaching at Harvard University. &lt;ref&gt;Hamid Aghaei Rad author. ; Nader Ardalan; Laleh Bakhtiar Second Version., Sydney Built Environment Publishing, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Dome of the Rock]] ({{lang-ar|قُـبَّـة ٱلـصَّـخْـرَة|Qubbat aṣ-Ṣakhrah}}) in [[Jerusalem]] (691) is one of the most important buildings in all of Islamic architecture. It is patterned after the nearby [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]&lt;ref&gt;Avner, Rina [https://books.google.com/books?id=hs1YQ-RO7lwC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Origin+of+the+plan+of+the+Dome+of+the+Rock&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zaboUcTqCej8yAGH_4C4Ag&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Origin%20of%20the%20plan%20of%20the%20Dome%20of%20the%20Rock&amp;f=false "The Dome of the Rock in Light of the development of Concentric Martyria in Jerusalem"] article in "Muqarnas: An annual on the visual cultures of the Islamic World" Vol 27, Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands, 2010, p. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Byzantine]] [[Christian]] artists were employed to create its elaborate [[mosaics]] against a golden background.&lt;ref name="Krautheimer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Martin Biddle. p.68&lt;/ref&gt; The great epigraphic vine [[frieze]] was adapted from the pre-Islamic [[Syrian]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Finbarr Barry [https://books.google.com/books?id=r5f8kxIyykQC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=%22dome+of+the+rock%22+epigraphic+frieze&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IgcLUv_gDqGs2gW-ooCIAQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dome%20of%20the%20rock%22%20epigraphic%20frieze&amp;f=false The Great Mosque of Damascus: Studies on the Makings of an Umayyad Visual Culture] Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands, 2000, p. 67–68. "The vine frieze finds various counterparts in the decoration of pre-Islamic Syrian temples and churches&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dome of the Rock]] featured interior vaulted spaces, a circular dome, and the use of stylized repeating decorative [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] patterns. Desert palaces in [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]] (for example, [[Mshatta facade|Mshatta]], [[Qasr Amra]], and [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]]) served the caliphs as living quarters, reception halls, and baths, and were decorated to promote an image of royal luxury.

The [[horseshoe arch]] became a popular feature in Islamic structures. Some suggest the Muslims acquired this from the [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigoths]] in Spain but they may have obtained it from Syria and Persia where the [[horseshoe arch]] had been in use by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantines]]. In Moorish architecture, the curvature of the horseshoe arch is much more accentuated. Furthermore, alternating colours were added to accentuate the effect of its shape. This can be seen at a large scale in their major work, the [[Great Mosque of Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.green-man-of-cercles.org/articles/the_horseshoe_arch.pdf|title=Green-man-of-cercles.org|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque]] of [[Damascus]] (completed in 715 by caliph Al-Walid I),&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, Robert. Islamic Art and Architecture, Thames &amp; Hudson World of Art series; 1999, London. {{ISBN|978-0-500-20305-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; built on the site of the [[basilica]] of [[John the Baptist]] after the Islamic invasion of [[Damascus]], still bore great resemblance to 6th and 7th century Christian [[basilicas]]. Certain modifications were implemented, including expanding the structure along the transversal axis which better fit with the Islamic style of prayer.

The [[Abbasid dynasty]] (750 [[AD]]&lt;nowiki&gt;-&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1258&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, World of Art&lt;/ref&gt;) witnessed the movement of the capital from [[Damascus]] to [[Baghdad]], and then from Baghdad to [[Samarra]]. The shift to Baghdad influenced politics, culture, and art. The [[Great Mosque of Samarra]], once the largest in the world, was built for the new capital. Other major mosques built in the Abbasid Dynasty include the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] in Cairo, [[Abu Dalaf]] in Iraq, the great mosque in [[Tunis]]. Abbasid architecture in [[Iraq]] as exemplified in the [[Fortress of Al-Ukhaidir]] (c.775-6) demonstrated the "despotic and the pleasure-loving character of the dynasty" in its grand size but cramped living quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (in [[Tunisia]]) is considered the ancestor of all the mosques in the western Islamic world. Its original marble columns and sculptures were of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] workmanship brought in from [[Carthage]] and other elements resemble Roman form.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, Graham [https://books.google.com/books?id=5sYRAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Kairouan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bgEMUs_MIIS72wWHyIHgBQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mosque&amp;f=false Tunis, Kairouan &amp; Carthage: described and illustrated with forty-eight paintings] William Heinemann, London, 1908, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Kleiner, Fred and Helen Gardner [https://books.google.com/books?id=vIGkQy7aGHkC&amp;pg=PT38&amp;dq=Kairouan+mosque&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lwEMUpK6JfD8yAHi_oCQCA&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Kairouan&amp;f=false Gardner's Art through the Ages: Backpack Edition, Volume C, 14th ed., Book 3] Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, Boston, MA, 2005, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the best preserved and most significant examples of early great mosques, founded in 670 AD and dating in its present form largely from the [[Aghlabids|Aghlabid]] period (9th century).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=399&amp;lang=en Great Mosque of Kairouan (Qantara mediterranean heritage)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209081557/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=399&amp;lang=en |date=2015-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Mosque of Kairouan is constituted of a massive square minaret, a large courtyard surrounded by porticos and a huge hypostyle prayer hall covered on its axis by two cupolas. The [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] in [[Iraq]], completed in 847 AD, combined the [[hypostyle]] architecture of rows of columns supporting a flat base above which a huge spiraling [[minaret]] was constructed.

The [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]] also influenced Islamic architecture. When the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s captured the city from the [[Byzantine]]s, they converted the [[basilica]] to a [[mosque]] (now a museum) and incorporated [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine architectural]] elements into their own work (e.g. [[domes]]). The Hagia Sophia also served as a model for many Ottoman mosques such as the Shehzade Mosque, the [[Suleiman Mosque]], and the [[Rüstem Pasha Mosque]].  Domes are a major structural feature of Islamic architecture. The dome first appeared in Islamic architecture in 691 with the construction of the [[Dome of the Rock]], a near replica of the existing [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] and other [[Christian]] domed [[basilica]]s situated nearby. Domes remain in use, being a significant feature of many mosques and of the [[Taj Mahal]] in the 17th century. The distinctive pointed domes of Islamic architecture, also originating with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Sassanian Empire|Persians]],&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Charles Anthony [http://www.sas.upenn.edu/ancient/masons/Stweart-Flying_Buttresses.pdf Flying Buttress and Pointed Arch in Byzantine Cyprus] Accessed August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Karamagara Bridge]] and [[Byzantine architecture]] and [[Taq-i-Kisra]].&lt;/ref&gt; have remained a distinguishing feature of mosques into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, O. (2006) p.87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen (2003), p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing [[Motif (art)|motif]]s of Islamic architecture have always been the [[mathematics and architecture|mathematical themes]] of ordered repetition, radiating structures, and rhythmic, metric patterns. In this respect, [[fractal geometry]] has been a key utility, especially for mosques and palaces. Other significant features employed as motifs include columns, piers and arches, organized and interwoven with alternating sequences of niches and colonnettes.&lt;ref&gt;Tonna (1990), pp.182–197&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

=== Assimilation of earlier traditions ===
From the eighth to the eleventh century, Islamic architectural styles were influenced by two different ancient traditions:

# '''Greco-Roman tradition:''' In particular, the regions of the newly conquered [[Byzantine Empire]] (Southwestern Anatolia, Syria, Egypt and the [[Maghreb]]) supplied architects, masons, mosaicists and other craftsmen to the new Islamic rulers. These artisans were trained in [[Byzantine architecture]] and decorative arts, and continued building and decorating in Byzantine style, which had developed out of [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] and [[Ancient Roman architecture|ancient Roman]] architecture.
# '''Eastern tradition:''' [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Persia]], despite adopting elements of Hellenistic and Roman representative style, retained their independent architectural traditions, which derived from [[Sasanian architecture]] and its predecessors.&lt;ref name="Hoag_p7_9"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoag|first1=John D.|title=Islamic architecture|date=2004|publisher=Electaarchitecture|location=Milan|isbn=978-1-904313-29-8|pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition process between late Antiquity, or post-classical, and Islamic architecture is exemplified by archaeologic findings in North Syria and Palestine, the [[Bilad al-Sham]] of the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties. In this region, late antique, or Christian, architectural traditions merged with the pre-Islamic Arabian heritage of the conquerors. Recent research on the history of [[Islamic art]] and architecture has revised a number of [[colonialism|colonialistic]] ideas. Specifically, the following questions are currently subject to renewed discussions in the light of recent findings and new concepts of cultural history:
# The existence of a linear development within the Islamic architecture;
# the existence of an inter- and intracultural hierarchy of styles;
# questions of cultural authenticity and its delineation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Karin Bartl, Abd al-Razzaq Moaz (Eds.)| title=Residences, castles, settlements. Transformation processes from late antiquity to early Islam in Bilad al-Sham| year=2009| publisher=Marie Leidorf GmbH| location=Rahden/Germany| isbn=978-3-89646-654-9| page=XV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to earlier research, the assimilation and transformation of pre-existing architectural traditions is investigated under the aspect of mutual intra- and intercultural exchange of ideas, technologies and styles as well as artists, architects, and materials. In the area of art and architecture, the [[Rise of Islam]] is seen as a continuous transformation process leading from late Antiquity to the Islamic period. Early research into the area regarded the early Islamic architecture merely as a break with the past, from which apparently rose a distorted and less expressive form of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bourgoin| first=Jules| title=Les arts Arabes| year=1867| publisher=A. Morel| location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a degenerate imitation of the post-classical architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Giovanni Theresia Rivoira, Gordon M.

The Umayyads played a crucial role in this process of transforming and thereby enriching the existing architectural traditions, or, in a more general sense, of the visual culture of the nascent Islamic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Flood| first=Finbarr B.| title=The great mosque of Damascus.

=== Paradise garden ===
[[File:Afif abad.jpg|thumb|[[Afif-Abad Garden]], [[Shiraz]]]]
{{Main|Paradise garden}}

Gardens and water have for many centuries played an essential role in Islamic culture, and are often compared to the garden of [[Paradise]]. The comparison originates from the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. In his dialogue "[[Oeconomicus]]", [[Xenophon]] has [[Socrates]] relate the story of the Spartan general [[Lysander]]'s visit to the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] prince [[Cyrus the Younger]], who shows the Greek his "Paradise at Sardis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Xenephon |title=Oeconomicus |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1173/1173-h/1173-h.htm |website=Gutenberg Press |accessdate=11 June 2015|date=January 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical form of the Persian [[Paradise garden]], or the ''[[Charbagh]]'', comprises a rectangular irrigated space with elevated pathways, which divide the garden into four sections of equal size:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the hallmarks of Persian gardens is the four-part garden laid out with axial paths that intersect at the garden's centre. This highly structured geometrical scheme, called the chahar bagh, became a powerful metaphor for the organization and domestication of the landscape, itself a symbol of political territory.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. Fairchild Ruggles]], ''Islamic Gardens and Landscapes'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A charbagh from Achaemenid time has been identified in the archaeological excavations at [[Pasargadae]]. The gardens of [[Chehel Sotoun]]  ([[Isfahan]]), [[Fin Garden]] ([[Kashan]]), [[Eram Garden]] ([[Shiraz]]), [[Shazdeh Garden]] ([[Mahan, Iran|Mahan]]), [[Dowlatabad Garden]] ([[Yazd]]), [[Abbasabad Garden]] ([[Abbasabad, Mazandaran|Abbasabad]]), [[Akbarieh Garden]] ([[South Khorasan Province]]), [[Pahlevanpour Garden]], all in [[Iran]], form part of the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1372|title=The Persian Garden|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=Whc.unesco.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large Paradise gardens are also found at the [[Taj Mahal]] ([[Agra]]), and at [[Humayun's Tomb]] ([[New Delhi]]), in India; the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] ([[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]) or at the [[Alhambra]] and [[Generalife]] in [[Granada]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="Hoag_p7_9" /&gt;

=== Courtyard (Sehan) ===
[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan Panorama - Grande Mosquée de Kairouan Panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], with a large courtyard (''sehan'') surrounded by [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s, [[Kairouan]], Tunisia.]]
The traditional Islamic [[courtyard]], a ''sehan'' ({{lang-ar| صحن}}), is found in secular and religious structures.
#When within a residence or other secular building is a private courtyard and walled garden. It is used for: the aesthetics of plants, water, architectural elements, and natural light; for cooler space with fountains and shade, and source of breezes into the structure, during summer heat; and a protected and proscribed place where the women of the house need not be covered in the [[hijab]] clothing traditionally necessary in public.
#A ''sehan''—courtyard is in within almost every mosque in Islamic architecture. The courtyards are open to the sky and surrounded on all sides by structures with halls and rooms, and often a shaded semi-open arcade. Sehans usually feature a centrally positioned ritual cleansing pool under an open domed pavilion called a '''''[[howz]]'''''. A mosque courtyard is used for performing ablutions, and a 'patio' for rest or gathering.

=== Hypostyle hall ===
A [[Hypostyle]], i.e., an open hall supported by columns combined with a reception hall set at right angle to the main hall, is considered to be derived from architectural traditions of [[Achaemenids|Achaemenid period]] Persian assembly halls (''"[[apadana]]"''). This type of building originated from the [[Roman architecture|Roman]]-style [[basilica]] with an adjacent courtyard surrounded by [[colonnade]]s, like [[Trajan's Forum]] in Rome. The Roman type of building has developed out of the [[Greek architecture|Greek]] [[agora]]. In Islamic architecture, the hypostyle hall is the main feature of the hypostyle mosque. One of the earliest hypostyle mosques is the [[Tarikhaneh Temple|Tarikhaneh Mosque]] in Iran, dating back to the 8th century.&lt;ref name="Hoag_p7_9" /&gt;

=== Vaulting ===
In Islamic buildings, [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] follows two distinct architectural styles: Whilst [[Umayyad architecture]] continues Syrian traditions of the 6th and 7th century, Eastern Islamic architecture was mainly influenced by [[Sasanian architecture|Sasanian]] styles and forms.

==== Umayyad diaphragm arches and barrel vaults ====
[[File:Qasr Amra 21.jpg|thumb|Qusair 'Amra]]

In their vaulting structures, Umayyad period buildings show a mixture of ancient Roman and Persian architectural traditions. [[Diaphragm arch]]es with lintelled ceilings made of wood or stone beams, or, alternatively, with barrel vaults, were known in the [[Levant]] since the classical and [[Nabataeans|Nabatean]] period. They were mainly used to cover houses and cisterns. The architectural form of covering diaphragm arches with barrel vaults, however, was likely newly introduced from [[Iranian architecture]], as similar vaulting was not known in [[Bilad al-Sham]] before the arrival of the Umayyads. However, this form was well known in [[Iran]] from early [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] times, as exemplified in the Parthian buildings of [[Assur|Aššur]]. The earliest known example for barrel vaults resting on diaphragm arches from [[Umayyad architecture]] is known from Qasr Harane in Syria. During the early period, the diaphragm arches are built from coarsely cut limestone slabs, without using supporting [[falsework]], which were connected by [[gypsum]] [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Later-period vaults were erected using pre-formed lateral ribs modelled from gypsum, which served as a temporal formwork to guide and center the vault. These ribs, which were left in the structure afterwards, do not carry any load. The ribs were cast in advance on strips of cloth, the impression of which can still be seen in the ribs today. Similar structures are known from [[Sasanian architecture]], for example from the palace of [[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]]. Umayyad-period vaults of this type were found in [[Amman Citadel]] and in [[Qasr Amra]].&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Arce (2006): ''Umayyad arches, vaults &amp; domes: Merging and re-creation. Contributions to early Islamic construction history.'' In: Proceedings of the second international congress on construction history Vol. I. Queen's College, Cambridge University 29.03.–02.04.2006, S. 195–220 [http://www.arct.cam.ac.uk/Downloads/ichs/vol-1-195-220-arce.pdf PDF], accessed 1 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iberian Peninsula ====
The double-arched system of [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] of the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba]] is generally considered to be derived from [[Roman Architecture|Roman]] [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]] like the nearby [[Acueducto de los Milagros|aqueduct of Los Milagros]]. Columns are connected by [[horseshoe arch]]es, and support pillars of [[brickwork]], which are in turn interconnected by semicircular arches supporting the flat timberwork ceiling.

&lt;center&gt;

File:Aljaferia - Portique nord.JPG|Arcades of the [[Aljafería]] of Zaragoza
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In later-period additions to the Mosque of Córdoba, the basic architectural design was changed: Horseshoe arches were now used for the upper row of arcades, which is now supported by five-pass arches. In sections which now supported [[dome]]s, additional supporting structures were needed to bear the [[thrust]] of the cupolas. The architects solved this problem by the construction of intersecting three- or five-pass arches. The three domes spanning the vaults above the [[mihrab]] wall are constructed as ribbed vaults. Rather than meeting in the center of the dome, the ribs intersect one another off-center, forming an eight-pointed star in the center which is superseded by a [[pendentive]] dome.&lt;ref name=Giese-Vogeli&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giese-Vögeli|first1=Francine|title=Das islamische Rippengewölbe : Ursprung, Form, Verbreitung = Islamic rib vaults: Origins, form, spread|date=2007|publisher=Gebr. Mann|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-7861-2550-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ribbed vaults of the mosque-cathedral of Córdoba served as models for later mosque buildings in the Islamic West of [[al-Andaluz]] and the [[Maghreb]]. At around 1000 AD, the ''Mezquita de Bab al Mardum'' (today: [[Mosque of Cristo de la Luz]]) in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] was constructed with a similar, eight-ribbed dome. Similar domes are also seen in the mosque building of the [[Aljafería]] of [[Zaragoza]]. The architectural form of the ribbed dome was further developed in the Maghreb: The central dome of the Great Mosque of [[Tlemcen]], a masterpiece of the [[Almoravids]] built in 1082, has twelve slender ribs, the shell between the ribs is filled with filigree stucco work.&lt;ref name="Giese-Vogeli" /&gt;

==== Iran (Persia) ====
Because of its long history of building and re-building, spanning the time from the [[Abbasids]] to the [[Qajar dynasty]], and its excellent state of conservation, the [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan]] provides an overview over the experiments Islamic architects conducted with complicated vaulting structures.&lt;ref name="Giese-Vogeli_P66_88"&gt;{{citation/core |Surname1=Francine Giese-Vögeli |Authorlink1= |EditorSurname1= |Periodical= |Title=Das islamische Rippengewölbe: Ursprung – Form – Verbreitung |Edition= |Volume= |Issue= |Publisher=Gebr.

The system of [[squinch]]es, which is a construction filling in the upper angles of a square room so as to form a base to receive an [[octagon]]al or [[sphere|spherical]] [[dome]], was already known in [[Sasanian architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Schippmann| first1=Klaus| title=Die iranischen Feuerheiligtümer = Iranian Fire temples| date=1971| publisher=Walter de Gruyter| location=Berlin| isbn=978-3-11-001879-0| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWwiAAAAQBAJ| accessdate=23 January 2016| language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spherical trigonometry|spherical triangles]] of the squinches were split up into further subdivisions or systems of niches, resulting in a complex interplay of supporting structures forming an ornamental spatial pattern which hides the weight of the structure.

The "non-radial rib vault", an architectural form of ribbed vaults with a superimposed spherical dome, is the characteristic architectural vault form of the Islamic East. From its beginnings in the Jameh Mosque of Isfahan, this form of vault was used in a sequence of important buildings up to the period of [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] architecture. Its main characteristics are:&lt;ref name="Giese-Vogeli_P66_88" /&gt;
# Four intersecting ribs, at times redoubled and intersected to form an eight-pointed star;
# the omission of a transition zone between the vault and the supporting structure;
# a central dome or [[roof lantern]] on top of the ribbed vault.

While intersecting pairs of ribs from the main decorative feature of [[Seljuk architecture]], the ribs were hidden behind additional architectural elements in later periods, as exemplified in the dome of the [[Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar]] in [[Merv]], until they finally disappeared completely behind the double shell of a stucco dome, as seen in the dome of [[Ālī Qāpū]] in Isfahan.&lt;ref name="Giese-Vogeli_P66_88" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==== Domes ====
Based on the model of pre-existing [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[dome]]s, the [[Ottoman Architecture]] developed a specific form of monumental, representative building: Wide central domes with huge diameters were erected on top of a centre-plan building. Despite their enormous weight, the domes appear virtually weightless. Some of the most elaborate domed buildings have been constructed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architect [[Mimar Sinan]].

When the Ottomans had conquered [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], they found a variety of Byzantine Christian churches, the largest and most prominent amongst them was the [[Hagia Sophia]]. The brickwork-and-mortar ribs and the spherical shell of the central dome of the Hagia Sophia were built simultaneously, as a self-supporting structure without any wooden [[centring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Auguste Choisy| title=L'art de bâtir chez les Byzantins| year=1883| publisher=Librairie de la société anonyme| location=Paris| pages=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Byzantine church of [[Hagia Irene]], the ribs of the dome vault are fully integrated into the shell, similar to Western [[Roman architecture|Roman]] domes, and thus are not visible from within the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean Ebersoll |author2=Adolphe Thiers | title=Les églises de Constantinople| date=1913| publisher=Ernest Leroux| location=Paris| page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the dome of the Hagia Sophia, the ribs and shell of the dome unite in a central medallion at the apex of the dome, the upper ends of the ribs being integrated into the shell: Shell and ribs form one single structural entity. In later Byzantine buildings, like the [[Kalenderhane Mosque]], the [[Eski Imaret Mosque]] (formerly the Monastery of Christ Pantepoptes) or the Pantokrator Monastery (today: [[Zeyrek Mosque]]), the central medallion of the apex and the ribs of the dome became separate structural elements: The ribs are more pronounced and connect to the central medallion, which also stands out more pronouncedly, so that the entire construction gives the impression as if ribs and medallion are separate from, and underpin, the proper shell of the dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean Ebersoll |author2=Adolphe Thiers | title=Les églises de Constantinople| date=1913| publisher=Ernest Leroux| location=Paris| pages=100–117; 178–188; 192–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mimar Sinan solved the structural issues of the Hagia Sophia dome by constructing a system of centrally symmetric pillars with flanking semi-domes, as exemplified by the design of the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] (four pillars with two flanking shield walls and two semi-domes, 1550–1557), the [[Rüstem Pasha Mosque]] (eight pillars with four diagonal semi-domes, 1561–1563), and the [[Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]] (eight pillars with four diagonal semi-domes, 1567/8–1574/5). In the history of architecture, the structure of the Selimiye Mosque has no precedent. All elements of the building subordinate to its great dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Art and Architecture of Islam 1250–1800 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mhIgewDtNkC&amp;pg=PA226 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-300-06465-0 |first=Sheila |last=Blair |first2=Jonathan M. |last2=Bloom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/3588/doc/dpt0810.pdf Doğan Kuban: ''The Style of Sinan's Domed Structures.'' in: Muqarnas IV: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture.

=== Muqarnas ===
{{Main|Muqarnas}}
The architectural element of muqarnas developed in northeastern Iran and the Maghreb around the middle of the 10th century. The ornament is created by the geometric subdivision of a vaulting structure into miniature, superimposed pointed-arch substructures, also known as "honeycomb", or "stalactite" vaults. Made from different materials like stone, brick, wood or stucco, its use in architecture spread over the entire Islamic world. In the Islamic West, muqarnas are also used to adorn the outside of a dome, cupola, or similar structure, whilst in the East is more limited to the interior face of a vault.

=== Ornaments ===
{{Main|Islamic interlace patterns|Islamic geometric patterns|Arabesque}}

As a common feature, Islamic architecture makes use of specific ornamental forms, including mathematically complicated, elaborate [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]] and [[Islamic interlace patterns|interlace patterns]], floral motifs like the [[arabesque]], and elaborate [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphic]] inscriptions, which serve to decorate a building, specify the intention of the building by the selection of the textual program of the inscriptions. For example, the calligraphic inscriptions adorning the [[Dome of the Rock]] include quotations from the Quran (e.g., Quran 19:33–35) which reference the miracle of Jesus and his human nature.

The geometric or floral, interlaced forms, taken together, constitute an infinitely repeated pattern that extends beyond the visible material world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tA9Uuy2cSIcC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=%22the+arabesque+is%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=_2t2TI_dO4X54gbv5cjbBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20arabesque%20is%22&amp;f=false Sheila R. Canby, ''Islamic art in detail'', page 26. Harvard University Press, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; To many in the Islamic world, they symbolize the concept of infinite proves of existence of one eternal God. The repetitiveness, simplicity contrasted with complexity and percision suggests that our complex universe is only one of the many manifestations of the infinitely obvious and present Allah, the one God. Furthermore, the Islamic artist conveys a definite spirituality without the [[icon]]ography of [[Christian art]]. Non-figural ornaments are used in mosques and buildings around the Muslim world, and it is a way of decorating using beautiful, embellishing and repetitive Islamic art [[Aniconism in Islam|instead of using pictures of humans and animals]] (which some Muslims believe is forbidden (''[[Haram]]'') in Islam).

Instead of recalling something related to the reality of the [[spoken word]], calligraphy for the Muslim is a visible expression of spiritual concepts. Calligraphy has arguably become the most venerated form of Islamic art because it provides a link between the languages of the Muslims with the religion of Islam. The [[holy book]] of Islam, al-[[Qur'ān]], has played a vital role in the development of the Arabic language, and by extension, calligraphy in the [[Arabic alphabet]]. [[Proverb]]s and complete passages from the Qur'an are still active sources for Islamic calligraphy. Contemporary artists in the Islamic world draw on the heritage of calligraphy to use calligraphic inscriptions or abstractions in their work.

=== Architectural forms ===
Many forms of Islamic architecture have evolved in different regions of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]]. Notable Islamic architectural types include the early [[Abbasid]] buildings, T-Type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of [[Anatolia]]. The [[Petroleum|oil]]-wealth of the 20th century drove a great deal of mosque construction using designs from leading modern architects.

''Arab-plan'' or ''hypostyle'' mosques are the earliest type of mosques, pioneered under the [[Umayyad Dynasty]]. These mosques are square or rectangular in plan with an enclosed courtyard and a covered prayer hall. Historically, because of the warm Mediterranean and Middle Eastern climates, the courtyard served to accommodate the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques have flat roofs on top of prayer halls, necessitating the use of numerous [[column]]s and [[Support (structure)|support]]s.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]] |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Masdjid. I. In the central Islamic lands | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | issn = 1573-3912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the [[Mezquita]] in [[Córdoba, Spain]], as the building is supported by over 850 columns.&lt;ref name="mit-handout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/4.614/www/handout02.html |accessdate=2006-04-09 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |title=Religious Architecture and Islamic Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s so that visitors can enjoy some shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and [[Abbasid]] dynasties; subsequently, however, the simplicity of the Arab plan limited the opportunities for further development, and as a result, these mosques gradually fell out of popularity.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1"/&gt;

[[Ottoman Dynasty|The Ottomans]] introduced ''central dome mosques'' in the 15th century and have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having one large dome at the center, there are often smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, where prayer is not performed.&lt;ref name="mit-vocab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |accessdate=2006-04-09 |title=Vocabulary of Islamic Architecture |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051124083425/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2005-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style was heavily influenced by the [[Byzantine]] religious architecture with its use of large central domes.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1"/&gt;

=== Specific architectural elements ===
[[File:Ayyubid wall cyark.jpg|thumb|Plan view of Bab al-Barqiyya along [[Ayyubid]] Wall. Located close to one of Cairo's main modern traffic arteries, al-Azhar Street, the Fatimid-era Bab al-Barqiyya fortified gate was constructed with interlocking volumes that surrounded the entrant in such a way as to provide greater security and control than typical city wall gates. Laser scan data from an [[Aga Khan Foundation]]/[[CyArk]] research partnership.]]
Islamic architecture may be identified with the following design elements, which were inherited from the first mosque buildings (originally a feature of the [[Masjid al-Nabawi]]).

* [[Minaret]]s or towers (these were originally used as torch-lit watchtowers, as seen in the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]]; hence the derivation of the word from the Arabic ''nur'', meaning "light"). The minaret of the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in [[Tunisia]] is considered as the oldest surviving minaret in the world.&lt;ref name="minaret"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=kairouan+oldest+minaret&amp;lr=&amp;cd=22#v=onepage&amp;q=kairouan%20oldest%20minaret&amp;f=false Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam, Language and Meaning: Commemorative Edition'']. World Wisdom. 2009. p.128&lt;/ref&gt; It has the shape of a square massive tower of three superimposed sections.&lt;ref name="minaret"/&gt;
* A four-[[iwan]] plan, with three subordinate halls and one principal one that faces toward Mecca
* [[Mihrab]] or [[niche (architecture)|prayer niche]] on an inside wall indicating the direction to [[Mecca]].
* [[Dome]]s and [[Cupola]]s.  In South East Asia ([[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]), these are very recent additions.
* Pishtaq is the formal gateway to the [[iwan]], usually the main prayer hall of a mosque, a vaulted hall or space, walled on three sides, with one end entirely open; a [[Persian language|Persian]] term for a portal projecting from the facade of a building, usually decorated with calligraphy bands, glazed tilework, and geometric designs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[https://archnet.org/library/dictionary/entry.jsp?entry_id=DIA0502 Dictionary of Islamic architecture: Pishtaq] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629172823/https://archnet.org/library/dictionary/entry.jsp?entry_id=DIA0502 |date=2011-06-29 }}  archnet.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pishtaq"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/461774/pishtaq Pishtaq] ''[[Britannica.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Iwans to intermediate between different pavilions.

=== Qibla ===
The ''[[Qibla]]h'' ({{lang-ar|قِـبْـلَـة}}) is the direction in which [[Mecca]] is from any given location, and within Islamic architecture it is a major component of both the features and the orientation of the building itself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=David|date=Aug 1, 1995|title=The Orientation of Medieval Islamic Religious Architecture and Cities|url=|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=26| issue = 3|pages=253–274|via=ProQuest|bibcode=1995JHA....26..253K|doi=10.1177/002182869502600305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Islamic cities and the ''[[Mihrab]]'' in mosques were meant to be built facing in this direction, yet when actually observing the layout of such areas they do not all point to the same place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is due to discrepancies in the calculations of the Islamic scientists in the past who determined where Mecca was from their individual locations. Scholars note that these differences come about for a multitude of reasons, such as some misunderstanding the meaning of Qibla itself, the fact that the geographic coordinates of the past do not line up with the coordinates of today, and that the determination of this direction was more an astronomical calculation, rather than a mathematical one. Early mosques were constructed according to either the calculations of what direction Qibla was approximately, or with the Mihrab facing south, as that was the direction that the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] was facing when he prayed in [[Medina]], which is a city directly north of Mecca&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Towns and cities ==

=== Urban and nomadic life according to Ibn Khaldun ===
During its history, the society of the pre-modern Islamic world was dominated by two important social contexts, [[Nomads|nomadic life]] and [[Urbanism]]. The historian and politician [[Ibn Khaldun]] thoroughly discusses both concepts in his book [[Muqaddimah]]. According to him, the way of life and culture of the rural [[bedouin]] nomads and the townspeople are opposed in a central [[Conflict (process)|social conflict]]. Ibn Khaldun explains the rise and fall of civilizations by his concept of [[Asabiyyah]] ("bond of cohesion", or "family loyalty"), as exemplified by the rule of the [[caliph]]s. Bedouins, being the nomadic inhabitants of the steppe and the desert, are interconnected by strong bonds of asabiyyah and firm religious beliefs. These bonds tend to slacken in urban communities over some generations. In parallel, by losing their asabiyyah, the townspeople also lose the power to defend themselves, and fall victims to more aggressive tribes which may destroy the city and set up a new ruling dynasty, which over time is subject to the same weakening of power again.&lt;ref&gt;''The Muqaddimah'', translated by F. Rosenthal (III, pp.&amp;nbsp;311–15, 271-4 [Arabic]; [[Richard Nelson Frye]] (p.&amp;nbsp;91) [https://asadullahali.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ibn_khaldun-al_muqaddimah.pdf online], accessed 26 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiments with the hellenistic Ideal city ===
The antique concept of the architecture of a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[polis]] or [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[civitas]] is based on a structure of main and smaller roads running through the entire city, and dividing it into quarters. The streets are oriented towards public buildings like a palace, temple, or a public square. Two main roads, ([[cardo]] and [[decumanus Maximus|decumanus]]) cross each other at right angles in the center of the city. A few cities were founded during the early Islamic [[Umayyad Caliphate]], the outlines of which were based on the Ancient Roman concept of the [[Ideal city]]. An example of a city planned according to Hellenistic concepts was excavated at [[Anjar, Lebanon|Anjar]] in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Finster| first=Barbara| title=Anjar: spätantik oder frühislamisch? = Anjar: Late antique or early Islamic?

=== Transformation of conquered towns ===
More often than founding new cities, the new Islamic rulers took over existing towns, and transformed them according to the needs of the new Islamic society. This process of transformation proved to be decisive for the development of the traditional Islamic city, or [[Medina quarter|Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Kennedy (1985): ''From Polis to Madina: Urban Change in Late Antique and Early Islamic Syria.'' Past &amp; Present '''106''' (Feb. 1985), p. 3–27 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/650637 JSTOR], accessed 28 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of arranging buildings is known as "horizontal spread". Residencies and public buildings as well as private housing tend to be laid out separately, and are not directly related to each other architectonically. Archaeological excavations at the city of [[Jerash]], the Gerasa of Antiquity, have revealed how the Umayyads have transformed the city plan.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Simpson: ''Market building at Jarash. Commercial transformation at the Tetrakionion in the 6th to 9th centuries C.E.'' In: Bartl &amp; Moaz, 2009, p. 115–124&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban morphology of the Medina ===
The architecture of the "[[Orientalism|oriental]]"-Islamic [[town]] is based on cultural and sociological concepts which differ from those of European cities. In both cultures, a distinction is made between the areas used by the rulers and their government and administration, public places of everyday common life, and the areas of private life. Whilst the structures and concepts of European towns originated from a sociological struggle to gain basic rights of freedom – or [[town privileges]] – from political or religious authorities during the [[Middle Ages]], an Islamic town or city is fundamentally influenced by the preservation of the unity of secular and religious life throughout time.&lt;ref name="Wirth"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wirth|first1=Eugen|title=Die orientalische Stadt im islamischen Vorderasien und Nordafrika: Städtische Bausubstanz und räumliche Ordnung, Wirtschaftsleben und soziale Organisation. = The Oriental town in the Islamic Near East and North Africa. Urban building and spatial order, economic life and social structure|date=2001|publisher=Von Zabern|location=Mainz|isbn=978-3-8053-2709-1|edition= 2nd|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental principle of the Islamic society is the ''[[ummah]]'', or ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ummat al-Islamiyah}}'' ({{lang-ar|الأمة الإسلامية}}), the community of Muslims of whom each individual is equally submitted to [[Allah]] under the common law of [[sharia]], which also subjected the respective ruler, at least nominally. In [[Abbasid dynasty|Abbasid]] times, some cities like the [[Round city of Baghdad]] were constructed from scratch, set up to a plan which focused on the caliph's residence, located in the very centre of the city, with main roads leading radially from the city gates to the central palace, dividing individual tribal sections with no interconnection, and separated from each other by radial walls. However, these efforts were of short duration only, and the original plan soon disappeared and gave way to succeeding buildings and architectural structures.

In a medina, palaces and residences as well as public places like [[mosque]]-[[madrasa]]-[[Dar al-Shifa|hospital]] complexes and private living spaces rather coexist alongside each other. The buildings tend to be more inwardly oriented, and are separated from the surrounding "outside" either by walls or by the hierarchical ordering of the streets, or both. Streets tend to lead from public main roads to cul-de-sac byroads and onwards into more private plots, and then end there. There are no, or very few, internal connections between different quarters of the city. In order to move from one quarter to the next, one has to go back to the main road again.&lt;ref name="Wirth" /&gt;

Within a city quarter, byroads lead towards individual building complexes or clusters of houses. The individual house is frequently also oriented towards an inner [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], and enclosed by walls, which mostly are unadorned, unlike European outward-oriented, representative [[facade]]s. Thus, the spatial structure of a medina essentially reflects the ancient nomadic tradition of living in a family group or tribe, held together by asabiyya, strictly separated from the "outside". In general, the morphology of an Islamic medina is granting – or denying – access according to the basic concept of hierarchical degrees of privacy. The inhabitants move from public space to the living quarters of their tribe, and onwards to their family home. Within a family house, there are again to be found common and separate spaces, the latter, and most private, usually reserved for women and children. In the end, only the family heads have free and unlimited access to all rooms and areas of ther private home, as opposed to the more European concept of interconnecting different spaces for free and easy access. The hierarchy of privacy thus guides and structurizes the entire social life in a medina, from the caliph down to his most humble subject, from the town to the house.&lt;ref name="Bianca"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bianca| first=Stefano| title=Die Stadt als Haus.

=== Frontier fortresses and towns ===
[[File:Qasr Al-Hallabat mosque.jpg|thumb|Mosque in Qasr al-Hallabat]]
[[File:Qasr Al-Hallabat, entrance courtyard.jpg|thumb|Entrance courtyard of Qasr al-Hallabat]]

==== Misr, Ribat ====
In the frontier area of the [[Spread of Islam|Arabic expansion]], military forts ('''[[Amsar|Misr]]''', Pl. {{lang-ar|أَمْـصَـار}}, amṣār), or '''[[Ribat|Ribāṭ]]''' ({{lang-ar|رِبَـاط}}, fortress) were founded. The structure and function of a misr is similar to an ancient Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|Colonia]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Hillenbrand: ''Anjar and early Islamic urbanism.'' In: G. P. Brogiolo and Bryan Ward-Perkins (Eds.): ''The idea and ideal of the town between Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages''. Leiden, Brill, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;59–98&lt;/ref&gt; Like a frontier colony, the fortress served as a base for further conquests. Arabian military forts of this type were frequently built in the vicinity of an older town from Antiquity or from Byzantine times. They frequently were of square format.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand 1999, S.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than maintaining their original purpose to serve as a military base, many ''amṣār'' developed into urbane and administrative centers. In particular, this happened in the case of the [[Iraq]]i cities of [[Kufa]] and [[Basra]], which became known as ''"al-miṣrān"'' ("the [two] forts"), but also with [[Fustat]] and [[Kairouan]] in North Africa.

==== Qaṣr ====
''Qaṣr'' ({{lang-ar|قَ،صْـر}}'; Pl. {{lang-ar|قصور|}}, ''quṣūr'')  means palace, castle or (frontier) fort. Fortresses from Late Antiquity often continued to be in use, whilst their function changed during time. Some ''quṣūr'' were already used as [[Castra]] during Roman times, and were part of the fortifications of the North African [[Limes]]. Already during the Ancient Roman times, castra did not only serve as fortifications, but also as markets and meeting points for the tribes living beyond the border.

Smaller ''quṣūr'' are found in modern [[Jordan]], and include [[Qasr Al-Hallabat]] (located {{convert|50|km|mile|abbr=on}} east of [[Amman]]), Qasr Bushir ({{convert|15|km|mile|abbr=on}} north of [[Lajjun]]), the castle of Daganiya ({{convert|45|km|mile|abbr=on}} north of [[Ma'an]]) and Odruh ({{convert|22|km|mile|abbr=on}} east of [[Petra|Wadi Musa]]). After the [[Limes Arabicus]] was abandoned by the Roman Empire, many of the castra continued to be in use.&lt;ref name="Konrad 2009"&gt;Michaela Konrad: ''Roman military fortifications along the Eastern desert frontier. Settlement continuities and change in North Syria 4th–8th centuries A.D.'' In: Bart and Motz 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;433–453&lt;/ref&gt; This continuity was subject to archaeological investigations in the fort of Qasr al-Hallabat, which at different times served as a Roman castrum, Christian [[Cenobitic monasticism|cenobitic monastery]], and finally as an Umayyad Qasr.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Arche (2009): ''Hallabat: Castellum, coenobium, praetorium, qaṣr. The construction of a palatine architecture under the Umayyads I.'' In: Bartl and Moaz, 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;153–182&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qasr Al-Kharanah]] is one of the earliest known [[Desert castles]], its architectural form clearly demonstrates the influence of [[Sasanian architecture]].

According to a hypothesis developed by [[Jean Sauvaget]], the umayyad ''quṣūr'' played a role in the systematic agricultural colonisation of the uninhabited frontier areas, and, as such, continue the colonisation strategy of earlier Christian monks and the [[Ghassanids]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Sauvaget]] (1939): ''Remarques sur les monuments omeyyades. Chateaux de Syrie. I.'' Journal Asiatique, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–59&lt;/ref&gt; The Umayyads, however, increasingly oriented their political strategy towards a model of [[Client politics]], of mutual interdependence and support.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Whitcomb (1995): ''Islam and the socio-cultural transition of Palestine - Early Islamic period (638–1099 C.E.)'' In: T. E. Levy (Ed.): ''The archeology of society in the Holy Land.'' London, Leicester University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;488–501&lt;/ref&gt; After the Umayyad conquest, the ''quṣūr'' lost their original function and were either abandoned or continued to serve as local market places and meeting points until the tenth century.&lt;ref name="Konrad 2009" /&gt; Another type of Islamic fortress is the [[Qalat (fortress)|Qalat]].

There are few buildings dating from the era of Prophet Muhammad, but one example is the [[Jawatha Mosque]] in [[Saudi Arabia]]. The [[Rashidun Caliphate]] (632–661) was the first state to use Islamic Architecture.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] (661–750) combined elements of [[Byzantine architecture]] and [[Sassanid architecture]], but [[Umayyad architecture]] introduced new combinations of these western and eastern styles.{{sfn|Petersen|2002|p=295}}
The horseshoe arch appears for the first time in Umayyad architecture, later to evolve to its most advanced form in [[al-Andalus]].{{sfn|Ali|1999|p=35}} Umayyad architecture is distinguished by the extent and variety of decoration, including mosaics, wall painting, sculpture and carved reliefs with Islamic motifs.{{sfn|Petersen|2002|p=296}} The Umayyads introduced a [[transept]] that divided the prayer room along its shorter axis.{{sfn|Ettinghausen|Grabar|Jenkins|2001|p=24}} They also added the [[mihrab]] to mosque design.{{sfn|Ettinghausen|Grabar|Jenkins|2001|p=24}}
The mosque in [[Medina]] built by [[al-Walid I]] had the first ''[[mihrab]]'', a niche on the qibla wall, which seems to have represented the place where the Prophet stood when leading prayer. This almost immediately became a standard feature of all mosques.{{sfn|Ettinghausen|Grabar|Jenkins|2001|p=24}}

The [[Abbasid architecture]] of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (750–1513) was strongly influenced by [[Sassanid architecture]], and later by Central Asian styles. The Abbasid mosques all followed the courtyard plan. The earliest was the mosque that al-Mansur built in Baghdad. since destroyed. The [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] built by al-Mutawakkil was {{convert|256|by|139|m}}. A flat wooden roof was supported by columns. The mosque was decorated with marble panels and glass mosaics.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=80}} The prayer hall of the Abu Dulaf mosque at Samarra had arcades on rectangular brick piers running at right angles to the [[qibla]] wall. Both of the Samarra mosques have spiral minarets, the only examples in Iraq.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=80}} A mosque at [[Balkh]] in what is now Afghanistan was about {{convert|20|by|20|m}} square, with three rows of three square bays, supporting nine vaulted domes.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=82}}

Construction of the [[Mezquita de Córdoba|Great Mosque at Córdoba]] (now a cathedral known as the Mezquita) beginning in 785 CE marks the beginning of [[Moorish architecture]] in the [[Iberian peninsula]] and North Africa (see [[Moors]]). The mosque is noted for its striking interior [[arch]]es. Moorish architecture reached its peak with the construction of the [[Alhambra]], the magnificent palace/fortress of [[Granada]], with its open and breezy interior spaces adorned in red, blue, and gold. The walls are decorated with stylized [[foliage]] motifs, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] inscriptions, and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] design work, with walls covered in glazed [[tile]]. Their other, smaller, survivals such as the Bab Mardum in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], or the caliphal city of [[Medina Azahara]]. Moorish architecture has its roots deeply established in the [[Arab]] tradition of architecture and design established during the era of the first Caliphate of the [[Umayyads]] in the [[Levant]] circa 660AD with its capital [[Damascus]] having very well preserved examples of fine [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] design and geometrics, including the carmen, which is the typical Damascene house, opening on the inside with a fountain as the house's centre piece.

[[Fatimid architecture]] in Egypt followed [[Tulunid]] techniques and used similar materials, but also developed those of their own. In [[Cairo]], their first congregational mosque was [[al-Azhar mosque]] ("the splendid") founded along with the city (969–973), which, together with its adjacent institution of higher learning ([[al-Azhar University]]), became the spiritual center for [[Ismaili|Ismaili Shia]]. The Mosque of al-Hakim (r. 996–1013), an important example of Fatimid architecture and architectural decoration, played a critical role in [[Fatimid]] ceremonial and procession, which emphasized the religious and political role of the [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]]. Besides elaborate funerary monuments, other surviving Fatimid structures include the [[Aqmar Mosque]] (1125)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=INsmT6zjAl8C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=aqmar+mosque+1125&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zbfpTvpbkbSEB8z0gbYI&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=aqmar%20mosque%201125&amp;f=false Doris Behrens-Abouseif (1992), ''Islamic Architecture in Cairo: An Introduction'', BRILL, p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Al-Hakim Mosque]], as well as the monumental gates for Cairo's [[Defensive wall|city walls]] commissioned by the powerful [[Fatimid]] [[emir]] and [[vizier]] [[Badr al-Jamali]] (r. 1073–1094).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XshAEMLqzmAC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false David Nicolle (2009), ''Saracen Strongholds 1100–1500: The Central and Eastern Islamic Lands''. Osprey Publishing, p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reign of the [[Mamluk]]s (1250–1517 AD) in Egypt marked a breathtaking flowering of Islamic art which is most visible in old Cairo. [[Zealotry|Religious zeal]] made them generous patrons of [[Mamluk architecture|architecture]] and art. Trade and agriculture flourished under Mamluk rule, and Cairo, their capital, became one of the wealthiest cities in the [[Near East]] and the center of artistic and intellectual activity. This made Cairo, in the words of [[Ibn Khaldun]], "the center of the universe and the garden of the world", with majestic domes, courtyards, and soaring minarets spread across the city.

[[File:Damghan7.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tarikhaneh Temple]], a pre-Islamic monument built in [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid Persia]] which was later turned into a mosque, showing elements of [[Iranian architecture]] before the spread of Islam]]
The [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] in the 7th century availed the Muslims with the vast wealth of architectural innovation developed over the centuries, from the [[Roman road|great roads]], [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]]s and [[arch]]es of the [[Roman Empire]], to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[basilica]]s and [[Sassanid empire|Persian]] [[Horseshoe arch|horseshoe]] and [[pointed arch]]es, and the Sassanian and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[mosaic]]s. The Islamic architects first utilized these native architects to build mosques, and eventually developed their own adaptations. Islamic architecture thus is directly related to [[Persian architecture|Persian]] and [[Byzantine architecture]].

In Persia and Central Asia, the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]], [[Samanid]]s, [[Ghaznavids]], and [[Ghurids]] struggled for power in the 10th century, and art was a vital element of this competition. Great cities were built, such as [[Neyshabur|Nishapur]] and [[Ghazni]] ([[Afghanistan]]), and the construction of the Great Mosque of [[Isfahan]] (which would continue, in fits and starts, over several centuries) was initiated. Funerary architecture was also cultivated.

Under the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]]s the "Iranian plan" of mosque construction appears for the first time. Lodging places called ''khans'', or [[caravanserai]], for travellers and their animals, or caravansarais, generally displayed utilitarian rather than ornamental architecture, with rubble masonry, strong fortifications, and minimal comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p.109&lt;/ref&gt; Seljuq architecture synthesized various styles, both Iranian and Syrian, sometimes rendering precise attributions difficult. Another important architectural trend to arise in the Seljuk era is the development of mausolea including the tomb tower such as the [[Gunbad-i-qabus]] (circa 1006-7) (showcasing a Zoroastrian motif) and the domed square, an example of which is the [[tomb of the Samanids]] in the city of [[Bukhara]] (circa 943).&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Isfahan_Royal_Mosque_general.JPG|left|thumb|[[Shah Mosque]] in [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]], [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]]]]

The [[Ilkhanate|Il-Khanate period]] provided several innovations to dome-building that eventually enabled the Persians to construct much taller structures. These changes later paved the way for Safavid architecture. The pinnacle of Il-Khanate architecture was reached with the construction of the [[Soltaniyeh|Soltaniyeh Dome]] (1302–1312) in [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjan]], Iran, which measures 50&amp;nbsp;m in height and 25&amp;nbsp;m in diameter, making it [[List of largest domes in the world#Masonry|the 3rd largest]] and the tallest masonry dome ever erected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranreview.org/content/view/2280/51/]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The thin, double-shelled dome was reinforced by arches between the layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/domes|title=DOMES – Encyclopaedia Iranicam|website=Iranicaonline.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb of [[Öljeitü]] in [[Soltaniyeh]] is one of the greatest and most impressive monuments in Iran, despite many later depredations.

Iranian architecture and city planning also reached an apogee under the [[Timurids]], in particular with the monuments of [[Samarkand]], marked by extensive use of exterior ceramic tiles and [[muqarnas]] vaulting within.

The renaissance in Persian mosque and dome building came during the [[Safavid dynasty]], when [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]], in 1598 initiated the reconstruction of [[Isfahan]], with the [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]] as the centerpiece of his new capital.&lt;ref&gt;Savory, Roger; Iran under the Safavids, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The distinct feature of Persian domes, which separates them from those domes created in the Christian world or the Ottoman and Mughal empires, was the colorful tiles, with which they covered the ''exterior'' of their domes, as they would on the interior. These domes soon numbered dozens in Isfahan, and the distinct, blue- colored shape would dominate the skyline of the city. Reflecting the light of the sun, these domes appeared like glittering [[turquoise|turquoise gem]] and could be seen from miles away by travelers following the [[Silk road]] through Persia. This very distinct style of architecture was inherited to them from the [[Seljuq dynasty]], who for centuries had used it in their mosque building, but it was perfected during the Safavids when they invented the ''haft- rangi'', or seven- colour style of tile burning, a process that enabled them to apply more colours to each tile, creating richer patterns, sweeter to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Stephen P.; Half the World, The Social Architecture of Safavid Isfahan, 1590–1722, p. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; The colours that the Persians favoured were golden, white and turquoise patterns on a dark- blue background.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Sheila R.; Shah Abbas, The Remaking of Iran, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive inscription bands of calligraphy and arabesque on most of the major buildings where carefully planned and executed by [[Reza Abbasi|Ali Reza Abbasi]], who was appointed head of the royal library and Master calligrapher at the Shah's court in 1598,&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Sheila R.; Shah Abbas, The Remaking of Iran, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Shaykh Bahai]] oversaw the construction projects. Reaching 53 meters in height, the dome of Masjed-e Shah (Shah Mosque) would become the tallest in the city when it was finished in 1629. It was built as a double- shelled dome, with 14&amp;nbsp;m spanning between the two layers, and resting on an octagonal dome chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Hattstein M., Delius P.; Islam, Art and Architecture; p. 513–514&lt;/ref&gt;

Persian-style mosques are also characterized by their tapered brick pillars, large [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] and arches each supported by several pillars. In South Asia, such art was also used as was a technique throughout the region.&lt;ref name="B-I"&gt;"Islam", ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] in the 7th century also helped Islamic architecture to flourish in [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isesco.org.ma/english/publications/Islamtoday/14/P6.php Journal Islam Today N° 14-1417H/1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127034538/http://www.isesco.org.ma/english/publications/islamtoday/14/P6.php |date=2011-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerbaijan.com/azeri/azerbaijan4.htm|title=Virtual Azerbaijan Presents - Azerbaijan's History|first=Adil T.|last=Baguirov|website=Zerbaijan.com|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country became home of Nakchivan and Shirvan-Absheron architecture schools. An example of the first direction in the Azerbaijani Islamic architecture is the mausoleum of Yusuf, built in 1162.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The Shirvan-Absheron school unlike Nakchivan style used stones instead of the bricks in the construction. At the same characteristics of this trend were the asymmetry and stone carving, which includes famous landmarks like [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]]

=== Ottoman ===
{{Main|Ottoman architecture}}
[[File:Sultan Ahmed Mosque Istanbul Turkey retouched.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]], built in 1616, [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]]]

The standard plan of Ottoman architecture was inspired in part by the example of [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]]/[[Istanbul]], [[Ilkhanid]] works like [[Oljeitu]] Tomb and earlier [[Seljuks of Rum|Seljuk]] and Anatolian Beylik monumental buildings and their own original innovations. The most famous of Ottoman architects was (and remains) [[Mimar Sinan]], who lived for approximately one hundred years and designed several hundreds of buildings, of which two of the most important are [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] in Istanbul and [[Selimiye Mosque (Edirne)|Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]]. Apprentices of Sinan later built the famous [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Blue Mosque]] in Istanbul.

The most numerous and largest of mosques exist in [[Turkey]], which obtained influence from Byzantine, [[Iranian architecture|Persian]] and [[Syria]]n-[[Arab]] designs. Turkish architects implemented their own style of [[cupola]] domes.&lt;ref name="B-I"/&gt; For almost 500 years [[Byzantine architecture]] such as the church of Hagia Sophia served as models for many of the Ottoman mosques such as the Shehzade Mosque, the Suleiman Mosque, and the Rüstem Pasha Mosque.

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s mastered the technique of building vast inner spaces confined by seemingly weightless yet massive domes, and achieving perfect harmony between inner and outer spaces, as well as light and shadow. Islamic religious architecture which until then consisted of simple buildings with extensive decorations, was transformed by the Ottomans through a dynamic architectural vocabulary of [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], domes, semidomes and columns. The mosque was transformed from being a cramped and dark chamber with arabesque-covered walls into a sanctuary of esthetic and technical balance, refined elegance and a hint of heavenly transcendence.

[[File:RegistanSquare Samarkand.jpg|thumb|The [[Registan]] is the ensemble of three [[madrasa]]s, in [[Samarkand]], modern day [[Uzbekistan]]]]
{{anchor|Timurid architecture}}

Timurid architecture is the pinnacle of [[Islamic art]] in [[Central Asia]]. Spectacular and stately edifices erected by [[Timur]] and [[Timurid Dynasty|his successors]] in [[Samarkand]] and [[Herat]] helped to disseminate the influence of the [[Ilkhanid]] [[Art school|school of art]] in India, thus giving rise to the celebrated [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] school of architecture. Timurid architecture started with the [[Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasavi|sanctuary of Ahmed Yasawi]] in present-day [[Kazakhstan]] and culminated in Timur's mausoleum [[Gur-e Amir]] in [[Samarkand]]. The style is largely derived from [[Persian architecture]]. [[Axial symmetry]] is a characteristic of all major Timurid structures, notably the [[Shah-i-Zinda]] in [[Samarkand]] and the mosque of [[Gowhar Shad]] in [[Mashhad]]. Double [[dome]]s of various shapes abound, and the outsides are perfused with brilliant colors.

[[File:Meknes-Medina.jpg|thumb|left|[[El Hedim Square]] in [[Meknes]], [[Morocco]] with the "[[Bab Mansour]] Gate" in the [[Old city of Meknes]]]]

Moroccan architecture dates from 110 BCE with the Berber's massive pisé ([[mud brick]]) buildings. The architecture has been influenced by Islamization during the [[Idrisid dynasty]], [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] exiles from Spain, and also by France who [[French protectorate in Morocco|occupied Morocco]] in 1912. [[Morocco]] is in [[Maghreb|Northwest Africa]] bordering the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Atlantic]]. The country's diverse geography and the land's long history marked by successive waves of settlers and military encroachments are all reflected in Morocco's architecture. [[Moroccan Islamic architecture]] is also present outside the country. For example, [[Sheikha Salama Mosque]] in the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] city of [[Al Ain]] has two [[minaret]]s which partly look Moroccan.&lt;ref name="RoughGuides2016B"&gt;{{cite book |work=[[Rough Guides]] UK |title=The Rough Guide to Dubai |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |chapter= |page=266 |isbn=978-0-2412-9865-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3awnDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT266&amp;dq=sheikha+salama+mosque#v=onepage&amp;q=sheikha%20salama%20mosque&amp;f=false |date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian -Islamic architecture is a feature of the architecture of the [[Tatars]], formed under the influence of a sedentary and nomadic way of life in ancient times, developing in the epochs of the Golden Horde, the Tatar khanates and under the rule of the [[Russian Empire]]. The architecture was formed in the modern form for many centuries and depended on the culture, aesthetics and religion of the population, therefore combines a unique combination of Eastern, Russian, Bulgarian, Golden Horde architecture, European styles dominating in Russia at one time or another, especially this Is clearly reflected in the Tatar mosques.

[[File:Humayun Tomb in Delhi-Front view.JPG|thumb|[[Humayun's Tomb]], [[Delhi]], the first fully developed Mughal imperial tomb, 1569-70 CE]] 

The most known Indo-Islamic style is [[Mughal architecture]]. Its most prominent examples are the series of imperial [[Mausoleum|mausolea]], which started with the pivotal [[Tomb of Humayun]], but is best known for the [[Taj Mahal]], completed in 1648 by emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]] who died while giving birth to their 14th child. The Taj Mahal is completely symmetrical except for Shah Jahan's [[sarcophagus]], which is placed off center in the crypt room below the main floor. This symmetry extended to the building of an entire mirror mosque in black marble to complement the Mecca-facing mosque place to the west of the main structure. A famous example of the [[charbagh]] style of Mughal garden is the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] in [[Lahore]], where the domeless [[Tomb of Jahangir]] is also located. [[Bibi Ka Maqbara]] in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] which was commissioned by sixth [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]] in memory of his wife.  The [[Red Fort]] in [[Delhi]] and [[Agra Fort]] are huge castle-like fortified palaces, and the abandoned city of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], 26 miles (42&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Agra]], was built for [[Akbar]] in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&amp;pg=PA29 [[John F. Richards]] (1996), ''The Mughal Empire'', Cambridge University Press, p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Deccan sultanates]] in the Southern regions of the Indian subcontinent developed the Indo-Islamic Deccani architectural styles like [[Charminar]] and [[Gol Gumbaz]].&lt;ref name="michell_77"&gt;Michell, George &amp; Mark Zebrowski.

Within the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Bengal]]i region developed a distinct regional style under the independent Bengal Sultanate. It incorporated influences from Persia, Byzantium and North India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Architecture|title=Architecture - Banglapedia|website=En.banglapedia.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were with blended indigenous Bengali elements, such as curved roofs, corner towers and complex [[terracotta]] ornamentation.

[[File:Chinese-style minaret of the Great Mosque.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The Great Mosque of Xi'an, China]]

The first Chinese mosque was established in the 7th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] in [[Xi'an]]. The [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]], whose current buildings date from the [[Ming Dynasty]], does not replicate many of the features often associated with traditional mosques. Instead, it follows traditional [[Chinese architecture]]. Some Chinese mosques in parts of western China were more likely to incorporate minarets and domes while eastern Chinese mosques were more likely to look like [[pagoda]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198504/muslims.in.china-the.mosques.htm|accessdate=2006-04-08|last=Cowen|first=Jill S.|date=July–August 1985|pages=30–35|publisher=Saudi Aramco World|title=Muslims in China: The Mosque|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322154300/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198504/muslims.in.china-the.mosques.htm|archive-date=2006-03-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important lathan feature in Chinese architecture is its emphasis on [[symmetry]], which connotes a sense of grandeur; this applies to everything from [[palace]]s to [[mosque]]s. One notable exception is in the design of gardens, which tends to be as asymmetrical as possible. Like Chinese scroll paintings, the principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow; to let the patron wander and enjoy the garden without prescription, as in nature herself.

Chinese buildings may be built with either red or grey bricks, but wooden structures are the most common; these are more capable of withstanding earthquakes, but are vulnerable to fire. The roof of a typical Chinese building is curved; there are strict classifications of gable types, comparable with the [[classical order]]s of European columns.

Most mosques have certain aspects in common with each other however as with other regions Chinese Islamic architecture reflects the local architecture in its style. China is renowned for its beautiful mosques, which resemble temples. However, in western China the mosques resemble those of the [[Arab World]], with tall, slender minarets, curvy arches and dome shaped roofs. In northwest China where the Chinese [[Hui people|Hui]] have built their mosques, there is a combination of eastern and western styles. The mosques have flared Buddhist style roofs set in walled courtyards entered through archways with miniature domes and [[minaret]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Aramco World, July/August 1985, page 3035&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Southeast Asia]] was slow to adopt Middle Eastern architectural styles. Islam entered Indonesia in the 15th-century via [[Java]] island, during which period the dominant religion in Southeast Asia included a variety of pagan groups. Introduction of Islam was peaceful. Existing architectural features in Indonesia such as the [[candi bentar]] gate, [[paduraksa]] (normally marks entrance to the most sacred precincts), and the sacred pyramidal roof was used for Islamic architecture. For centuries, Indonesian mosques lacked domes or minarets, both considered a Middle Eastern origin. Indonesian original mosques feature multi-layered pyramidal roofs and no minaret. Prayer are called by striking a prayer's drum known as [[beduk]]. The minaret of the [[Menara Kudus Mosque]] is a great example of Indonesian architecture. Indonesian mosque architecture also features strong influence from the Middle Eastern architecture styles.&lt;ref name="heritage 88"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gunawan Tjahjono |authorlink= |title=Indonesian Heritage-Architecture |year=1998 |publisher=Archipelago Press |location=Singapore |isbn=978-981-3018-30-3 |pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of Javanese Indonesian mosques had a strong influence on the design of other mosques in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], and the [[Philippines]].

Today, with increasing Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, Indonesian-Malaysian mosques are developing a more standard, international style, with a dome and minaret.

In [[West Africa]], Muslim merchants played a vital role in the Western [[Sahel]] region since the [[Kingdom of Ghana]]. At [[Kumbi Saleh]], locals lived in domed-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques (as described by [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri|al-bakri]]), one centered on [[Friday prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Historical Society of Ghana. Transactions of the Historical Society of Ghana, The Society, 1957, pp81&lt;/ref&gt; The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was sixty-six feet long, forty-two feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase; with the walls and chambers filled with sculpture and painting.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Basil.

[[File:Ancient-Almnara.jpg|thumb|left|''Almnara Tower'' [[Somalia]]]]
[[File:Fakr Ud Din Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|The 13th century [[Fakr ad-Din Mosque]] in [[Mogadishu]]]]

The spread of Islam in the early medieval era of [[History of Somalia|Somalia's history]] brought Islamic architectural influences from [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]], which stimulated a shift from [[drystone]] and other related materials in construction to [[Masonry|coral stone]], [[mud-brick|sundried bricks]], and the widespread use of [[limestone]] in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs such as [[mosques]] were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and customs of Somalia – Mohammed Abdullahi Diriye pg 102&lt;/ref&gt; Concordant with the ancient presence of Islam in the [[Horn of Africa]] region, mosques in Somalia are some of the oldest on the entire continent. One architectural feature that made Somali mosques distinct from other mosques in Africa were [[minaret]]s.

For centuries, Arba Rukun (1269), the Friday mosque of [[Merca]] (1609) and [[Fakr ad-Din]] (1269) were, in fact, the only mosques in [[East Africa]] to have minarets.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Islamic history and civilization By David Ayalon pg 370&lt;/ref&gt; Fakr ad-Din, which dates back to the [[Mogadishu|Mogadishan]] [[Golden Age]], was built with [[marble]] and [[coral]] [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and included a compact rectangular plan with a domed [[mihrab]] axis. Glazed tiles were also used in the decoration of the mihrab, one of which bears a dated inscription. The 13th century ''Al Gami University'' consisted of a rectangular base with a large cylindrical tower architecturally unique in the [[Islamic world]].

[[Shrine]]s to honor [[Somali people|Somali]] [[patriarchs]] and [[matriarchy|matriarchs]] evolved from ancient Somali burial customs. In Southern Somalia the preferred medieval shrine architecture was the [[Pillar tomb]] style while the North predominantly built structures consisting of [[domes]] and square plans.

=== Interpretation ===
[[File:Sebilj, Sarajevo.jpg|thumb|The [[Sebilj]] is a [[Ottoman Empire|pseudo-Ottoman]] style wooden [[fountain]] in the centre of [[Baščaršija]] square in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia]]]]

Common interpretations of Islamic architecture include the following: The concept of [[God in Islam|God]] or [[Allah]]'s infinite power is evoked by designs with repeating themes which suggest infinity. Human and animal forms are rarely depicted in [[decorative art]] as God's work is considered to be matchless. Foliage is a frequent motif but typically stylized or simplified for the same reason.
[[Arabic Calligraphy]] is used to enhance the interior of a building by providing quotations from the [[Qur'an]]. Islamic architecture has been called the "architecture of the veil" because the beauty lies in the inner spaces (courtyards and rooms) which are not visible from the outside (street view). Furthermore, the use of grandiose forms such as large domes, towering minarets, and large courtyards are intended to convey power.

== In modern times ==
In modern times, the architecture of Islamic buildings, not just religious ones, has gone through some changes. The new architectural style doesn't stick with the same fundamental aspects that were seen in the past, but mosques for the most part still feature the same parts - the ''Miḥrāb'' ({{lang-ar|مِـحْـرَاب}}), the minarets, four-iwan plan, and the ''pishtaq''. A difference to note is the appearance of mosques without domes, as in the past mosques for the most part all had them, but these new dome-less mosques seem to follow a function over form design, and are created by those not of the Islamic faith, in most cases. The influence of Islam still pervades the style of creation itself, and provides a 'conceptual framework',&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OMER|first=SPAHIC|date=2008|title=Towards Understanding Islamic Architecture|journal=Islamic Studies|volume=47|issue=4|pages=483–510|jstor=20839141}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the making of a building that exemplifies the styles and beliefs of Islam. It has also been influenced by the now meeting of many different cultures, such as European styles meeting Islamic styles, leading to Islamic architects incorporating features of other architectural and cultural styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abdelmonem|first=Mohamed|date=2003-10-22|title=Contemporary Islamic Architecture in the Arab World|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320556990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban Design and Islam ===
Urban design and the tradition of Islamic styled architecture have begun to combine to form a new 'neo-Islamic' style, where the efficiency of the urban style meshes with the spirituality and aesthetic characteristics of Islamic styles.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ELARABY|first=KADRI M.G.|date=1996|title=Neo-Islamic Architecture and Urban Design in the Middle East: From Threshold to Adaptive Design|journal=Built Environment (1978-)|volume=22|issue=2|pages=138–150|jstor=23288987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic Architecture in itself is a style that showcases the values, and the culture of Islam, but in modern times sticking to tradition is falling out of practice, so a combination style formed. Examples showing this are places such as the [[Marrakesh Menara Airport]], the Islamic Cultural Center and Museum of Tolerance, ''Masjid Permata Qolbu'', the concept for The Vanishing Mosque, and the ''[[Mazar-e-Quaid]].'' All of these buildings show the influence of Islam over them, but also the movements of things like minimalism which are rising to popularity in the architectural field. Designers that use the aspects of both modern styles and the Islamic styles found a way to have the Western-inspired modernism&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; with the classical cultural aspects of Islamic architecture. This concept though brings up the controversy of the identity of the Islamic community, of the traditional Islamic community, within a space that doesn't follow the way they knew it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ALSAYYAD|first=NEZAR|date=1996|title=Islamic Architecture and Urbanism: Middle Eastern Perspectives|journal=Built Environment (1978-)|volume=22|issue=2|pages=88–90|jstor=23288982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy on Status as a Style of Architecture ===
There are some who also debate whether Islamic Architecture can truly be called a style, as the religious aspect is seen as separate and having no bearing on the architectural style,&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; while on the other side people also argue that the newfound trend and divergence from the style of old Islamic Architecture is what is causing the style to lose it status. There are scholars that also believe that the distinguishing features of the Islamic Architecture style were not necessarily found within the architecture, but were rather environmental markers, such as the sounds of prayer, the city around it, the events that occurred there.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Jasmi|first=Abdullah|last2=Mitias|first2=Michael H.|date=2004|title=Does an Islamic Architecture Exist?|journal=Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia|volume=60|issue=1|pages=197–214|jstor=40338415}}&lt;/ref&gt; The example given is that we know that a building is a mosque based on what happens there, rather than any visual cues.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specific features that are notably related to Islamic Architecture - the Mihrab, the Minaret, and the Gate&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; - are seen in multiple locations and do not always serve the same use, and symbolism for being Islamic in nature is seen to be demonstrated more culturally than it is architecturally. Islamic Architecture is also sometimes referred to as a 'hidden architecture', one that doesn't necessarily show the physical traits of the style, rather it is something that is experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Nawawi, N. (2009). ''ISLAMIC INFLUENCE ON THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE MALAY WORLD''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connections &amp; deeper meanings ==
Islamic architecture displays intricate patterns, colors, and details embodying the Islamic culture. Such widespread religious displays typically have deeper meanings and connections. Islamic architecture is unique in this case because interior designs often lack or have unknown religious connections. This is caused by the Muslim ideology [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]], stating that an attempt to depict any earthly beings as holy is sinful. [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]] is unlike Western cultural ideals, often consisting of a large amount of religious symbolism in earthly beings. Due to this, symbolism in Islamic architecture is not as easily accessible compared to that of Western religious architecture.

=== Difficulty forming connections ===
Islamic architecture is a neglected subject within historical studies. Many scholars that study historical architecture often gloss over, if not completely ignore Islamic structures. This is caused by multiple elements, one being that there is little historic literary works that express an Islamic architect's motives with their structures.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic architecture : form, function, and meaning|last=Robert.|first=Hillenbrand|date=1994|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231101325|edition= Casebound |location=New York|oclc=30319450}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghasemzadeh|first=Behnam|date=|title=SYMBOLS AND SIGNS IN ISLAMIC ARCHITECTURE|url=http://www.eras.utad.pt/docs/SET%202013%20visuais.pdf|journal=European Review of Artistic Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the massively spanning Islamic religion, there is a large variation between thousands of existing mosques with little consistency between them. Lastly, since it is against Islamic faith to idolize earthly beings, any depictions of earthly beings lack religious connection. These characteristics combine to make it difficult for historians to form symbolic connections from architecture in Islamic places of worship.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Religious &amp; societal connections ===
Islamic architecture is unique compared to other vast religions that encompass much of the West. Unlike Christianity, Islam does not sensationalize living beings because they view it as a conflict with the Qur'an. Anything created by Allah is under his order and thus should not be idolized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This leaves typical religious Western symbols out of the picture, and replaces them with an emphasis on complex geometrical shapes and patterns.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are several aspects of Islamic architecture that to modern knowledge lack a symbolic religious meaning, but there are connections that do exist. A repeated and significant motif in mosques is calligraphy. Calligraphy plays a huge role in delivering religious connections through artistic design.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Calligraphy, in a mosque setting, is specifically used to reference holy excerpts from both the Qur’an and Muhammad's teachings. These references are one of the few religious connections architects include within their work.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Status &amp; hierarchy ====
Islamic architecture varies vastly across the scope of the world. Specifically, some mosques have different goals and intentions than others. These intentions often highlighted religious and social hierarchies within the mosque. Mosques are designed to have the least significant portions of the layout closest to the entrance, as people move deeper into the building more significant religious areas are revealed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hierarchy is also present because certain Islamic architects are tasked to design specifically for the presence of royalty. Designated locations had been carefully chosen in the mosque to highlight an individual’s position in society. This emphasis could be made through being within view to all attendees,  placed in the focal point of artistry, and a [[maqsurah]]'''.''' &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/architecture/4-614-religious-architecture-and-islamic-cultures-fall-2002/lecture-notes/glossary/|title=Glossary of Terms {{!}} Lecture Notes {{!}} Religious Architecture and Islamic Cultures {{!}} Architecture {{!}} MIT OpenCourseWare|last=Nasser|first=Rabbat|website=ocw.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining a sociological hierarchy within a mosque would typically represent a recognition by a higher being aware of a delegation of power.  This hierarchy does exist but not with any sort of religious message as Hillenbrand points out, “in neither case is this hierarchy employed for especially portentous ends.” &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Hierarchy exist in the church in different forms, but is meant for purely functional purposes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Structural intentions ===
Deeper meanings in Islamic architecture often can take form as functional purposes. For example mosques are built around the ideal that it should not just be a place of mesmerizing aesthetics, but a place where the aesthetics’ fluidity guide the person into proper worship.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A key feature of the mosque is the [[Mihrab]], a universal part of any Islamic place of worship.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The [[Mihrab]] is easily identifiable through a receding wall and a gable over head often consisting of intricate patterns. Upon entering, the most crucial religious function the architecture of the mosque serves to deliver is the [[Qibla]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The [[Qibla]] is necessary for proper Islamic worship, and is revealed through architectural means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/philosophy-islamic-laws-nasir-makarim-shirazi-jafar-subhani/question-7-why-face-qibla-prayers|title=Question 7: Why To Face The Qibla In Prayers?|website=Al-Islam.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2004, the Black Hills Bible Institute was founded by members of South Canyon Baptist Church in Rapid City, South Dakota. Its chief instigator was Dr. [[C. Richard Wells]], a member of the founding faculty of [[Beeson Divinity School]], former President of [[Criswell College]], and the Pastor of South Canyon Baptist Church from 2004–2009. The purpose of the Institute was to offer affordable, academic theological training in the Black Hills to students, including those transferred from other conforming Christian colleges.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.johnwitherspooncollege.org/page/academicpolicies.aspx Academic Policies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409102625/http://www.johnwitherspooncollege.org/page/academicpolicies.aspx |date=2015-04-09 }}" ''John Witherspoon College''. Quote: "John Witherspoon will accept students from a Bible college accredited by The Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE), or from colleges accredited by the Transnational Association of Colleges and Schools (TRACS)"&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Dr. Wells accepted an offer to be the Dean of Chapel at [[Union University]] in [[Jackson, Tennessee]] and in 2011 returned to Rapid City to restructure the Black Hills Bible Institute into John Witherspoon College, where he is currently President.&lt;ref name=Keloland&gt;{{cite news|title=New College To Open In Rapid City Next Fall|url=http://www.keloland.com/newsdetail.cfm/new-college-to-open-in-rapid-city-next-fall/?id=121048|accessdate=30 April 2015|agency=AP|publisher=Keloland.com, South Dakota News and Weather|date=20 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615195727/http://www.keloland.com/newsdetail.cfm/new-college-to-open-in-rapid-city-next-fall/?id=121048|archive-date=2015-06-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UnionNews&gt;{{cite news|title=Union installs 3, welcomes 18 new faculty|url=http://www.uu.edu/news/release.cfm?ID=2012|accessdate=3 May 2015|publisher=Union University News|date=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the official website, the college's purpose is "to glorify God as the beginning and end of all knowledge" and mission is "to build a community of Christ-centered, classics-based education for service to the church and the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vision of John Witherspoon College|url=http://www.johnwitherspooncollege.org/page/vision.aspx|publisher=''John Witherspoon College''|accessdate=9 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710211850/http://www.johnwitherspooncollege.org/page/vision.aspx|archivedate=10 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 21, 2012, John Witherspoon College began its first classes. The Inaugural Convocation took place on the campus on September 6 with city Mayor [[Sam Kooiker]] as the keynote speaker. US Senator [[John Thune]] was the keynote speaker of the annual ScholarShare Banquet the following Spring.&lt;ref name=Thune&gt;{{cite web|title=Thune featured speaker at local Christian school|url=http://www.johnthune.com/news/post/thune-featured-speaker-at-local-christian-school/|website=johnthune.com|publisher=John thune: Unitesd States Senator|accessdate=3 May 2015}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5706">'''Keith Muckelroy''' (1951-1980) was a pioneer of [[maritime archaeology]]. Instead of the traditional particularist or historiographic approach used by maritime archaeologists, Muckelroy's ideas were new to the field, influenced by the prehistoric and analytical archaeology he learned under [[Grahame Clark]] and [[David L. Clarke|David Clarke]] at Cambridge, the tenets of [[processual archaeology]] gaining traction in the U.S., and his own experiences on shipwreck sites in British waters, notably the 1664 Dutch East Indiaman Kennemerland, several [[Spanish Armada]] wrecks, and the [[Mary Rose]].

==Research, theories, and publications==
In 1976 he published a paper&lt;ref&gt;Muckleroy, K., 1976.  The integration of historical and archaeological data concerning an historic wreck site: The 'Kennemerland'.  World Archaeology 7.3 pp 280-289.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proposed a theory for the formation of shipwreck sites.  He later expanded this and other theories in his seminal publication, a book titled ''Maritime Archaeology''.&lt;ref&gt;Muckleroy, K., 1978.  Maritime Archaeology.  Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0521220793}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his discussion on shipwreck formation processes, he introduced terms such as "extracting filters" and "scrambling devices" into the lexicon, and used statistical models to clarify large bodies of data in order to discern patterns in the wrecking process, ideas that had never been proposed before.&lt;ref&gt;Muckleroy, K., 1978.  Maritime Archaeology.  Cambridge University Press, pp 157-214 {{ISBN|0521220793}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas coincided nicely with [[processual archaeology]]’s call for a more scientific, analytic methodology. Muckelroy's shipwreck formation theory became a classic model for interpretation of wreck sites and even today, either his original paper or his later book are referenced regularly in studies on the [[archaeology of shipwrecks]].  

Muckelroy's other prominent contribution was a three-part interpretive framework for better understanding the ship in its original social context. The three aspects he proposed were 1. The ship as a machine designed for harnessing a source of power in order to serve as a means of transport; 2. The ship as an element in a military or economic system, providing its basic raison d'être; and 3. The ship as a closed community, with its own hierarchy, customs, and conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Muckleroy, K., 1978.  Maritime Archaeology.  Cambridge University Press, p. 216 {{ISBN|0521220793}}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic model has proven useful to many maritime archaeologists seeking to understand the role of ships as part of a greater cultural system. 

Muckelroy also edited an atlas of underwater archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;Muckleroy, K. 1980, Archaeology under water: an atlas of the world's submerged sites.  McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0070439516}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His research covered the Kennemerland,&lt;ref&gt;Muckelroy, Keith, 1977: A Possible Seventeenth-Century Dutch Backstaff.

His career was cut short on 8 September 1980 when he drowned in a diving accident in [[Loch Tay]].

'''''Les Nabis''''' ({{IPA-fr|le nabi}}) were a group of [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] [[avant-garde]] artists who set the pace for [[fine arts]] and [[graphic arts]] in [[France]] in the 1890s. Initially a group of friends interested in contemporary art and literature, most of them studied at the private art school of [[Rodolphe Julian]] (the [[Académie Julian]]) in [[Paris]] in the late 1880s.

In 1890, they began to participate successfully in public exhibitions, while most of their artistic output remained in private hands or in the possession of the artists themselves. By 1896, the unity of the group had already begun to break: ''[[Homage to Cézanne]]'', painted by [[Maurice Denis]] in 1900, recollects memories of a time already gone, even before the term ''Nabis'' had been revealed to the public. Meanwhile, most members of the group, including [[Maurice Denis]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], and [[Édouard Vuillard]], could stand on their own artistically. Only [[Paul Sérusier]] had problems to overcome—though it was his ''Talisman'', painted at the advice of [[Paul Gauguin]], that had revealed to them the way to go.

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Maurice Denis Homage to Cezanne 1900.jpg|thumbnail|right|''[[Homage to Cézanne]]'', Maurice Denis, 1900. [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris.]]
''Nabi'' means ''[[prophet]]'' in both Hebrew and Arabic.{{efn|The French term ''nabi'' (also used in English), referring to a person inspired to speak the word of God, is clearly related to the Hebrew term for ''prophet''{{snd}}{{lang|he|נביא}} (''navi''){{snd}}and the similar Arabic word {{lang|ar|نَبِيّ}} (''nabiyy''). The word appears in many languages, including Indonesian.}}

''Les Nabis'' originated as a rebellious group of young student artists who banded together at the Académie Julian. Paul Sérusier galvanized ''Les Nabis'' and provided the name; he also disseminated among them the example of [[Paul Gauguin]]. [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], and [[Maurice Denis]] became the best known of the group, but at the time they were somewhat peripheral to the core group.

The term was coined by the linguist Auguste Cazalis, who drew a parallel between the way these painters aimed to revitalize painting (as ''prophets of [[modern art]]'') and the way the ancient prophets had rejuvenated Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, headword ''nabi''&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly, the nickname arose because "most of them wore beards, some were Jews and all were desperately earnest".&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, L. &amp; Hanson, E., ''Post-Impressionists'' xi. p.{{nbsp}}277&lt;/ref&gt;

''Les Nabis'' regarded themselves as initiates, and used a private vocabulary. They called a studio an ''ergasterium'' and ended their letters with the initials ''E.T.P.M.V. et M.P.'', meaning "En ta paume, mon verbe et ma pensée" (In your palm, my word and my thoughts.)

==Influence==
Meeting at [[Académie Julian]], and then at the apartment of [[Paul Ranson]], they preached that a work of art is the end product and the visual expression of an artist's synthesis of nature in personal aesthetic metaphors and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbols]]. Paving the way for the early 20th-century development of [[abstract art|abstract]] and nonrepresentational art, they had in common with most progressive artists of the time the goal of integrating art and daily life.

==Style==
[[File:Les Parisiennes cph.3g10009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pierre Bonnard]], ''Les Parisiennes'' 1893, [[lithograph]]]]
''Les Nabis'' artists worked in a variety of media, using oils on both canvas and cardboard, and [[distemper (paint)|distemper]] on canvas and wall decoration, and they also produced posters, prints, book illustrations, textiles and furniture. Considered to be on the cutting edge of modern art during their early period, their subject matter was representational (though often [[Symbolist]] in inspiration), but was design-oriented along the lines of the Japanese prints they so admired, and [[Art Nouveau]]. Unlike those types{{clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Unlike those types of what? Judging from what follows, the comparison is between one type of artist and another type of artist, but no artist types have been mentioned before this.--&gt;, however, the artists of this circle were highly influenced by the paintings of the [[Impressionists]], and thus while sharing the flatness, page layout, and negative space of art nouveau and other decorative modes, much of ''Les{{nbsp}}Nabis'' art has a painterly, non-realistic look, with color palettes reminiscent of [[Cézanne]] and Gauguin. Bonnard's posters and lithographs are more firmly in the Art Nouveau, or [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] manner. After the turn of the century, as modern art moved towards [[Abstract art|Abstraction]], [[Expressionism]], and [[Cubism]], ''Les{{nbsp}}Nabis'' were viewed as conservatives and, indeed, were among the last group of artists to stick to the roots and artistic ambitions of the Impressionists, pursuing these ends almost into the middle of the 20th{{nbsp}} century. In their later years, these painters also largely abandoned their earlier interests in decorative and applied arts.

==Members and associates==
[[File:Ranson serusier.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Ranson]], [[Paul Sérusier]], and Marie-France Ranson in Paul Ranson's studio, c. 1900]]
[[File:Ker-Xavier Roussel, Édouard Vuillard, Romain Coolus, Felix Vallotton 1899.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ker-Xavier Roussel]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Romain Coolus]], [[Félix Vallotton]], 1899]]
Among the artists who considered themselves Nabis was Maurice Denis, whose journalism put the aims of the group in the eye of a progressive audience, and whose definition of a painting{{snd}}"a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order"{{cite quote|date=May 2017}}{{snd}}expressed the Nabis approach. His ''Théories'' (1920; 1922) summed up the Nabis' aims long after they had been superseded by the [[Fauvism|fauve]] painters and by cubism.

Other Nabis were Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard, [[Ker-Xavier Roussel]], Paul Ranson, and [[Félix Vallotton]]. The sculptor [[Aristide Maillol]] was associated for a time with the group. The Scot James Pitcairn-Knowles and the Hungarian Jozsef Rippl-Ronai lived together in Paris during the first decade of the 20th{{nbsp}}century and also turned to glass-blowing and woodcarving. The [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] styles they embraced skirted some aspects of contemporary art nouveau and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. The influence of the English [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] set them to work in media that involved crafts beyond painting: printmaking, book illustration and poster design, textiles, and set design.

The '''Monteleone chariot''' is an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[chariot]] dated to c. 530 BC, considered one of the world's great archaeological finds.

==Description==
[[File:Etruscan chariot wheel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Close up on the wheel of the chariot.]]
The Monteleone chariot was part of a [[chariot burial]], containing the remains of two human corpses, along with two drinking cups. Measuring 131&amp;nbsp;cm in height and designed to be drawn by two horses, the chariot itself is constructed of wood covered with hammered bronze plates and carved ivory decoration. The bronze plates are decorated with Homeric iconography; the main panel depicts [[Achilles]] being handed his armor by his mother, [[Thetis]]. The chariot's frame and plating is additionally adorned with animals and mythological creatures, rendered in detail. The chariot's decorations would also have included inlaid amber and other exotic materials, but only the bronze and ivory decorations have survived. The chariot's wheels have nine [[spoke]]s (rather than the classical Greek four, the Egyptian six, or the Assyrian and Persian eight; excavated chariots from Celtic burials have up to twelve spokes).

Contemporary curators at the Museum had long suspected that the chariot's original 1903 reconstruction was not historically accurate. In 1989, under the direction of Italian archaeologist [[Adriana Emiliozzi]], the Metropolitan Museum began a five-year reexamination and restoration of the chariot. During the restoration, it was discovered that the chariot had in fact been originally assembled incorrectly; additionally, evidence was uncovered indicating that the chariot, previously thought to have seen little actual use, had in fact been involved in a serious accident at some point during its life.&lt;ref name=nytimes1&gt;{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Carol|title=A More Precise Version of Your Chariot Awaits|publisher=The New York Times|date=2007-03-29|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/arts/design/29char.html?ex=1332820800&amp;en=accf307e2331452e&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly restored chariot's reinstallation was scheduled as part of the major renovations of the Metropolitan Museum's Greek and Roman galleries, opening to the public on April 20, 2007.

==History==
[[File:Bronze chariot inlaid with ivory MET DP137936.jpg|thumb|250px|Monteleone chariot]]
[[File:Bronze chariot inlaid with ivory MET DP137946.jpg|thumb|250px|]]
It was found in 1902 in [[Monteleone di Spoleto]], near [[Spoleto]] in the [[Provinces_of_Italy#Kingdom_of_Italy|province]] of [[Umbria]], by a farmer named Isidoro Vannozzi who inadvertently unearthed it while digging a wine cellar or basement barn. Its history from that time is the subject of controversy. According to some accounts, Vannozzi hid the chariot in his barn, concerned that the authorities might confiscate it, and later sold it to two Frenchmen in exchange for two cows. Another account, related by Vannozzi's son Giuseppe, holds that the chariot was immediately sold as scrap metal, and the proceeds from the sale used to buy roof tiles.&lt;ref name=nytimes2&gt;{{cite news|last=Povoledo|first=Elisabetta|title=Umbrian Umbrage: Send Back That Etruscan Chariot|publisher=The New York Times|date=2007-04-05|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/arts/design/05char.html?ex=1333425600&amp;en=2b186de026816a09&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing hands several times after its initial sale, the chariot was eventually purchased in Paris by [[J. P. Morgan]], who sent it to the Metropolitan Museum in 1903, where its first restoration took place.

Because the museum's acquisition of the chariot in 1903 predates by six years Italy's first laws restricting export of items that carry "cultural and artistic values," the chariot's sale was legal at the time of purchase, though debated by the contemporary press.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patrimoniosos1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Galli|first=Paola|title=Cultural assets for sale. A comment on the Italian Code for the cultural assets and landscape|date=2005-05-03|url=http://www.patrimoniosos.it/rsol.php?op=getintervento&amp;id=52|accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, the [[comune]] of Monteleone began a campaign aimed at recuperating the chariot from the Met; their efforts, however, did not receive the backing of the Italian government. The Metropolitan Museum has responded that the chariot was "purchased in good faith".&lt;ref name="nytimes2" /&gt;  A full-size copy was made in the mid-20th century, which is on display in Monteleone.

The '''NAMM Oral History Program''' was created and is funded by [[NAMM]], the International Association of Music Products. The program was approved by the NAMM board of directors in the years before the association, which is known for its yearly trade shows, was ready to celebrate the 100 anniversary of the organization. The first NAMM Oral History was conducted in April 2000 with former [[Gibson Guitar]] president [[Ted McCarty]]. McCarty signed [[Les Paul]] on to Gibson in the 1950s to lend his name to the now famous [[Gibson Les Paul]] Guitar. Paul was interviewed as part of the NAMM Oral History program back in 2008.

== History ==

Over the years the collection sought to capture, archive and share the stories of those who have inspired people to make music!  As a result, instrument creators such as [[Hartley Peavey]] and [[Remo]] Belli have been included as well as music retailers, music publishers and those who can fill in the history of the companies, products and people who shaped the industry such as musicians, composers, method book authors, factory workers and salesman of musical products.

Music industry pioneers that have been interviewed for the NAMM Oral History program include [[Bob Moog]], [[Don Buchla]], Henry Z. [[Steinway]], [[Bob Taylor (luthier)]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]].

The collection also includes music retailers and the history of such store chains as [[Sam Ash]] and [[Guitar Center]] as well as independent music stores around the world such as West Music and Newton Piano.

Among the musicians linked to the music industry and thus interviewed for this collection are those who designed an instrument, endorsed a product or wrote a method book that has inspired others to make music.  These include [[B. B. King]], [[Roy Clark]], [[Joe Morello]] and [[Herbie Hancock]].

The first interview to be donated to the collection was conducted in 1996 with jazzman [[Jonah Jones]].  Jones spoke of his relationship with [[King Musical Instruments]] as a product tester and endorser.  He later played an [[F. E. Olds]] trumpet, which was featured on many recordings during his long career.

In the Spring of 2011 NAMM announced the completion of its 1,500th interview.  Later that year Mr. and Mrs. Tom Lee of [[Tom Lee Music]] in Hong Kong were interviewed together, which was an important addition to the collection.  During the NAMM Summer Show in Nashville in July 2011, music store owner George Gruhn was awarded the first NAMM Oral History Service Award for support that included arranging interviews and providing historic background.  The second NAMM Oral History Service Award was presented to Hal Leonard Publishing CEO Keith Mardak for his decade long support to the program.  With Mardak's help, interviews were completed with music publishers, songwriters, composers and music method book authors.

'''One World Archaeology''' is a book series focussing on archaeology and education about the past. 

==About the Series==
One World Archaeology is one of five book series associated with the [[World Archaeological Congress]] (WAC). Editors and contributors to these series waive any royalties, allowing all royalties to be used to further the work of the WAC. "Publications in the One World Archaeology series contain selections of the papers presented at the WAC Congresses, held every four years. This series developed as an outcome of the inaugural World Archaeological Congress held in Southampton, England in 1986. The subject matter of this series is wide-ranging, reflecting the diverse interests of WAC. WAC gives place to considerations of power and politics in framing archaeological questions and results. WAC also gives place and privilege to minorities who have often been silenced or regarded as beyond capable of making main line contributions to the field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldarch.org/publications/|title=Publications|date=23 May 2015|website=worldarch.org|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other four series are Worlds of Archaeology, Indigenous Archaeologies, Global Cultural Heritage Manual Series, and Research Handbooks in Archaeology

'''Parataxonomy''' is the use of less qualified assistance to, or replacement of, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] in the practice and science of classification. 

Parataxonomy may be used to improve taxonomic efficiency by enabling more expert taxonomists to restrict their activity to the tasks that require their specialist knowledge and skills, typically by undertaking basic sorting of collected specimens.

Generally parataxonomists work in the field, sorting collected samples into recognizable taxonomic units (RTUs) based on easily recognised features. The process can be used alone for rapid assessment of biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5027">[[File:Laser Interference.JPG|thumb|200px|Physical optics is used to explain effects such as [[diffraction]]]]
In [[physics]], '''physical optics''', or '''wave optics''', is the branch of [[optics]] that studies [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]], [[diffraction]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], and other phenomena for which the ray approximation of [[geometric optics]] is not valid. This usage tends not to include effects such as [[quantum noise]] in [[optical communication]], which is studied in the sub-branch of [[coherence theory (optics)|coherence theory]].

== The physical optics approximation ==
''Physical optics'' is also the name of an [[approximation]] commonly used in optics, [[electrical engineering]] and [[applied physics]]. In this context, it is an intermediate method between [[geometric optics]], which ignores [[wave]] effects, and full wave [[electromagnetism]], which is a precise [[theory]]. The word "physical" means that it is more physical than [[geometric]] or [[ray (optics)|ray]] optics and not that it is an exact physical theory.&lt;ref name="Ufimtsev2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pyotr Ya. Ufimtsev|title=Fundamentals of the Physical Theory of Diffraction|date=9 February 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-10900-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11–13}}

This approximation consists of using ray optics to estimate the field on a surface and then [[integral|integrating]] that field over the surface to calculate the transmitted or scattered field. This resembles the [[Born approximation]], in that the details of the problem are treated as a [[perturbation theory|perturbation]].

In optics, it is a standard way of estimating diffraction effects. In [[radio]], this approximation is used to estimate some effects that resemble optical effects. It models several interference, diffraction and polarization effects but not the dependence of diffraction on polarization. Since it is a high-frequency approximation, it is often more accurate in optics than for radio.

In optics, it typically consists of integrating ray-estimated field over a lens, mirror or aperture to calculate the transmitted or scattered field.

In [[radar]] [[scattering]] it usually means taking the [[current (electricity)|current]] that would be found on a [[tangent]] [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] of similar material as the current at each point on the front, i. e. the geometrically illuminated part, of a [[scattering|scatterer]]. Current on the shadowed parts is taken as zero. The approximate scattered field is then obtained by an integral over these approximate currents. This is useful for bodies with large smooth [[wikt:convex|convex]] shapes and for lossy (low-reflection) surfaces.

The ray-optics field or current is generally not accurate near edges or shadow boundaries, unless supplemented by diffraction and [[creeping wave]] calculations.

The standard theory of physical optics has some defects in the evaluation of scattered fields, leading to decreased accuracy away from the specular direction.&lt;ref name=Umul&gt;{{cite journal |title=Modified theory of physical optics |first=Y. Z. |last=Umul |journal=Optics Express |date=October 2004 |volume=12 |issue=20 |pages=4959–4972 |doi=10.1364/OPEX.12.004959 |pmid=19484050|bibcode = 2004OExpr..12.4959U }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shijo |first1=T. |last2=Rodriguez |first2=L. |last3=Ando |first3=M. |title=The modified surface-normal vectors in the physical optics |journal=IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation |volume=56 |issue=12 |pages=3714–3722 |date=Dec 2008 |doi=10.1109/TAP.2008.2007276|bibcode = 2008ITAP...56.3714S }}&lt;/ref&gt; An improved theory introduced in 2004 gives exact solutions to problems involving wave diffraction by conducting scatterers.&lt;ref name=Umul/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30021">'''Physician supply''' refers to the number of trained [[physician]]s working in a [[health care system]] or active in the [[labour market]].&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;Dal Poz MR et al. [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241547703_eng.pdf ''Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health.''] Geneva, World Health Organization, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The supply depends primarily on the number of graduates of [[medical school]]s in a country or jurisdiction, but also on the number who continue to practice [[medicine]] as a [[career]] path and who remain in their country of origin. The number of physicians needed in a given context depends on several different factors, including the [[demographics]] and [[epidemiology]] of the local population, the numbers and types of other [[health care provider#Practitioners and professionals|health care practitioners]] working in the system, as well as the [[health policy|policies]] and goals in place of the health care system.&lt;ref name="Models"&gt;World Health Organization. [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241599016_eng.pdf ''Models and tools for health workforce planning and projections.''] Geneva, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; If more physicians are trained than needed, then supply exceeds demand; if too few physicians are trained and retained, then some people may have difficulty accessing [[health care]] services.  A '''physician shortage''' is a situation in which there are not enough [[physicians]] to treat all [[patient]]s in need of medical care. This can be observed at the level of a given [[health care provider|health care facility]], a province/state, a country, or worldwide.

Globally, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates a shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses and other [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] worldwide,&lt;ref name="WHR2006"&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/whr/2006 ''The world health report 2006: working together for health.''] Geneva, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in many [[developing countries]]. Developing nations often have physician shortages due to limited numbers and capacity of medical schools and because of international migration: physicians can usually earn much more money and enjoy better working conditions in other countries.  Many developed countries also report doctor shortages, especially in rural and other underserved areas.

Several causes of the current and anticipated shortages have been suggested; however, not everyone agrees that there is a true physician shortage, at least not in the United States. On the [[Kevin Pho|KevinMD]] medical news blog, for example, it has been argued that inefficiencies introduced into the healthcare system, often driven by government initiatives, have reduced the number of patients physicians can see; by forcing physicians to spend much of their time on data entry and public health issues, these initiatives have limited the physicians' time available for direct patient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A debate on what we need our doctors to do | publisher = KevinMD | date = 2014-05-15 | url = http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/05/debate-doctors.html | accessdate = 2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determinants==

===Economic Theory and Trends===
[[Image:Merlin Darfur.jpg|thumb|Patients queue to see a doctor in South Sudan]]
Anything that changes the number of available physicians or the demand for their services affects the [[supply and demand]] balance. If the number of physicians is decreased, or the demand for their services increases, then an ''under''-supply or shortage can result. If the number of physicians increases, or demand for their services decreases, then an ''over''-supply can result.

Substitution factors can significantly affect the production of physician services and the availability of physicians to see more patients. For example, an [[accountant]] can replace some of the financial responsibilities for a physician who owns his or her own practice, allowing for more time to treat patients. Disposable supplies can substitute for labor and capital (the time and equipment needed to sterilize instruments). Sound record keeping by physicians can substitute for legal services by avoiding malpractice suits. However, the extent of substitution of physician production is limited by technical and legal factors. Technology cannot replace all skills possessed by physicians, such as surgical skill sets. Legal factors can include only allowing licensed physicians to perform surgeries, but nurses or doctors administering other surgical care.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Phelps, Health Economics (4th edition), (Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand of physicians is also dependent on a country's economic status. Especially in developing nations, health care spending is closely related to growth of their [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP). Theoretically, as GDP increases, the health care labor force expands and in turn, physician supply also increases.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/21/1/140.full#R10&lt;/ref&gt; However, developing countries face additional challenges in retaining competent physicians to higher-income countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mullan|first1=Fitzhugh|title=The metrics of the physician brain drain.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=27 October 2005|volume=353|issue=17|pages=1810-8|doi=10.1056/NEJMsa050004|pmid=16251537}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emigration of physicians from lower-income and developing countries contribute to [[Brain drain]], creating issues on maintaining sufficient physician supply. However, higher-income countries can also experience an outflow of physicians who decide to return to their naturalized countries after receiving extensive education and training, without ever benefiting from their gained medical knowledge and skill set.

===Number of physicians trained===
Increasing the number of students enrolled in existing [[medical school]]s is one way to address physician shortage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Burk | first = Jennifer  | title = Medical Schools Look to Grow as Doctor Shortage Looms | publisher = Wisconsin Healthcare Workforce Development | date = 2007-05-14 | url = http://www.dwd.state.wi.us/healthcare/Archive2007/medical_schools_grow_dr_shortage_looms.htm | accessdate = 2009-08-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; or increasing the number of schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Beene  | first = Ryan  | title = Medical schools multiplying, but may not solve doctor shortage | pages =  | publisher = Bridging 96 | date = 2009-03-18 | url = http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20090318/BRIDGING96/903169989/1123 | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other factors may also play a role.

Becoming a physician requires several years of training beyond [[undergraduate education]]. Consequently, physician supply is affected by the number of students eligible for medical training. Students that do not finish earlier levels of education, including [[high school dropout]]s and those that leave university without an [[undergraduate degree]] or [[associates degree]], do not qualify for entrance to [[medical school]]. The more people that fail to complete the prerequisites, the fewer people that are eligible for training as physicians.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Murphy | first = Mike | author2 = Tim Anderson | title = Dropout rates draw attention | publisher = The Midwestern Office of The Council of State Governments | date = October 2008 | url = http://www.csgmidwest.org/memberservices/Publications/SLMW/2008/October/p1.pdf | accessdate = 2009-08-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091008044231/http://www.csgmidwest.org/MemberServices/Publications/SLMW/2008/October/p1.pdf | archive-date = 2009-10-08 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, the number of placements for students in medical schools and [[Internship (medicine)|clinical internships]] is limited, typically according to the number of teachers and other resources, including the amount of funding provided by governments.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; In many countries that do not charge [[tuition payments]] to prospective physicians, public funding is the only significant limitation on the number of physicians trained. In the United States, the [[American Medical Association]] says that federal funding is the most important limitation in the supply of physicians. The high cost of tuition combined with the cost of supporting oneself during medical school discourages some people from enrolling to become a physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Lee | first = Frank  | title = Experts foresee doctor shortage | publisher = sctimes.com | date = 2009-07-26 | url = http://www.sctimes.com/article/20090726/NEWS01/107260024/1009/Experts-foresee-doctor-shortage | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Limited [[scholarship]]s and financial aid to medical students may exacerbate this problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Rogers | first = Christina  | title = Doctor shortage worsens as student debt rises | publisher = AllBusiness.com | date = 2008-06-18 | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/curricula-medical-education/12131282-1.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120716234245/http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/curricula-medical-education/12131282-1.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-07-16 | accessdate = 2009-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while low expected pay for practicing physicians in some countries may convince some that the cost is not appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Financiar | first = Ziarul  | title = Doctors can earn over Euro 20,000 per month in private clinics | publisher = Honorary Consulate of Romania | date = 2008-01-24 | url = http://www.roconsulboston.com/Pages/InfoPages/Businesspages/DoctorPrivate08.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that politics and social conditions can sometimes motivate medical student placements. For example, [[racial quota]]s have been cited in some places as preventing some people from enrolling in medical school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Shortage of young (white) male doctors  | publisher = Sunday Star Times | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/news/179274 | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racial discrimination]] and [[gender discrimination]], either overt or disguised, have also been cited as resulting in people being denied the opportunity to train as a physician on the basis of their race or gender.&lt;ref name="pmid18617633"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of physicians working===
Once trained, the current supply of physicians can be affected by the number of those who continue to practice this profession. The number of working physicians can be affected by:

*The number of medical school graduates who choose to practice as a physician for their [[career]] - for example, some might choose instead to work in [[medical research]], [[public policy]] or other areas where medical expertise is required; or they may choose a job where no medical knowledge is required.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;
*The number of medical school graduates who fail to obtain (or fail to re-qualify for) their license or other [[healthcare provider requisites|professional requirements]] for legal practice.
*The number of medical school graduates who are unable to find work of their choice - for example, studies in Mexico have found high levels of unemployment among trained physicians in urban areas, even while large rural populations remain medically underserved.&lt;ref name="Nigenda"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nigenda G ''et al.'' | title = Educational and labor wastage of doctors in Mexico: towards the construction of a common methodology | url = http://www.human-resources-health.com/content/3/1/3 | journal = Human Resources for Health | year = 2005 | volume = 3| page = 3 | doi=10.1186/1478-4491-3-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The number of physicians who emigrate abroad for better economic and social conditions, also referred to as "[[Brain drain]]".
*Changes in the specialty balance - for example, in many countries, the balance is shifting away from medical students becoming [[general practitioners]] (GP) because of more attractive pay for [[medical specialist]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Another Hurdle to Health Care Reform: Too Few General Practice Doctors | publisher = Knowledge@Wharton | date = 2009-07-22 | url = http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2297 | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to shortages of physicians for [[primary care]].
*Changes in the practice environment - for example, changing legal conditions have been cited in the US, Canada and elsewhere as inciting physician attrition, notably the adoption of laws that require doctors to refer for certain procedures (such as abortion or sex change) with which the doctors disagreed on moral or religious grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Lea Singh. [http://www.mercatornet.com/articles/view/new_look_inquisitions_could_be_calling_doctors_in_for_a_little_chat/ New-look Inquisitions want to call doctors in for a little chat.] Posted Wednesday, 1 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The number of physicians who retire.
*The number of physicians who work part-time - in particular, while the number working only part-time does not affect the overall number of physicians, it does affect the supply of physician services (e.g. in terms of [[full-time equivalent]]s). Many physicians may retain their professional license while working part-time or after retiring; consequently, the reported number of active physicians is probably overstated in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|title= Patterns: Number of Doctors Was Overstated, Study Finds 
|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/health/research/27patt.html?ref=health
|work=[[The New York Times]]
|date=21 October 2009
|author=Rabin, Roni Caryn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demand for physician services===
The demand for physician services is influenced by the local job market (e.g. the number of [[Job (role)|job openings]] in local health care facilities), the demographics and epidemiology of the population being served, the nature of the [[health policy|health policies]] in place for health care delivery and financing in a jurisdiction, and also the international job market (e.g. increasing demand in other countries puts pressure on local competition). As of 2010, the WHO proposes a ratio of at least one primary care physician per 1000 people to sufficiently attend the basic needs of the population in a developed country.&lt;ref name="Models"/&gt;

For example, [[population ageing]] has been attributed with increased demand for physician services in many countries, as more previously young and healthy people become older with increased likelihood of a variety of [[non-communicable diseases|chronic medical conditions]] associated with ageing, such as [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]], [[osteoporosis]], and some types of [[cancer]]s and [[neurodegenerative]] diseases.

====Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (U.S.)====
In the United States, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] has expanded health insurance coverage and access to an estimated 32 million United States citizens, increasing the demand of physicians, especially [[primary care physicians]], across the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Expanded coverage is predicted to increase the number of annual primary care visits between 15.07 million and 24.26 million by 2019. Assuming stable levels of physicians’ productivity, between 4,307 and 6,940 additional primary care physicians would be needed to accommodate this increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2011.00620.x | volume=89 | issue=1 | title=Expansion of Coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Primary Care Utilization | journal=Milbank Quarterly | pages=69–89 | author=Hofer Adam N. | pmc=3160595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PPACA may have also affected the supply of [[Medicaid]] physicians. Incentives and higher reimbursement rates may have increased the number of physicians accepting Medicaid patients leading up to 2014. With the expansion of Medicaid and a decrease in incentives and reimbursement rates in 2014, the supply of physicians in Medicaid may drop substantially, fluctuating the supply of Medicaid physicians. A study examining variation between states in 2005 showed that average time for Medicaid reimbursements was directly correlated with Medicaid participation, and physicians in states with faster reimbursement times had a higher probability of accepting new Medicaid patients.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/1/w17.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of physician shortage==
[[Image:SOWM2010 critical shortage.svg|thumb|Nations identified with critical shortages of physicians and other health care workers]]
Physician shortages have been linked to a number of effects, including:
*Lower quantity of medical care for [[patient]]s, thereby limiting the ability of health systems to meet [[primary health care]] goals, such as the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="WHR2006"/&gt;
*Lower quality of medical care for patients, due to shorter doctor visits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parents.com/family-life/fitness/mom-health/shrinking-doctors-appointment/ {{link dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increased workload and too many patients per doctor resulting in overworked and sleep-deprived doctors, thereby compromising [[patient safety]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/shortage-pushes-doctors-to-limit/2007/04/19/1176697005237.html?page=fullpage ''Shortage pushes doctors to limit''.] Posted by Jill Stark, April 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070520130105.htm ''Approved Medical Resident Hours Still Resulting In Sleepy Doctors''.] Posted by ''ScienceDaily'' (May 21, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1546317/Sleepy-doctors-admit-to-mistakes.html ''"Sleepy" doctors admit to mistakes''.] Posted by Celia Hall, ''The Telegraph'', 22 Mar 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Higher prices for practicing physicians due to less competition, by the rules of [[supply and demand]] in market-driven [[Health economics|health care economies]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=2671 ''America's reliance on foreign doctors''.] Posted by the National Center for Policy Analysis, December 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lower medical costs to consumers. Unlike other industries, as market share grows and competition declines, physicians are less inclined to gross up the frequency or intensity of medical services to maximize reimbursement per limited patient encounter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mgma.com ''Offshoring Physician Labor''] Posted by Layton Lang, December 12, 2011.{{full citation needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed solutions==
A number of solutions, including short-term fixes and long-term solutions, have been proposed to address physician shortages. Some have been tested and applied in national [[Health Human Resources#Health workforce policy and planning|health workforce policies and plans]], while others remain subject to ongoing debate.

*Increase the number of medical graduates through increased recruitment of minority students domestically, as well as intensified recruitment of foreign-trained graduates (also known as [[International medical graduate|International Medical Graduates]] or IMGs).&lt;ref name="pmid19416533"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lakhan SE, Laird C |title=Addressing the primary care physician shortage in an evolving medical workforce |journal=International Archives of Medicine |volume=2 |issue=14 |year=2009 |pmid=19416533 |doi=10.1186/1755-7682-2-14 |pmc=2686687 |pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increase the number of medical schools and classroom sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2009/04/doctors_from_afar_meeting_rura.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Doctors from afar meeting rural Oregon's needs | date=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*To address physician shortages in rural areas, develop, organize, and locate medical schools to increase the propensity of physicians entering rural practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenblatt|first1=RA|last2=Whitcomb|first2=ME|last3=Cullen|first3=TJ|last4=Lishner|first4=DM|last5=Hart|first5=LG|title=Which medical schools produce rural physicians?|journal=JAMA|date=September 23, 1992|volume=268|issue=12|pages=1559-65|doi=10.1001/jama.1992.03490120073031|pmid=1308662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting medical school applicants from rural areas can also increase the proportion of rural physicians. 
*Higher medical school enrollment limits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sctimes.com/article/20090726/NEWS01/107260024/1009/Experts-foresee-doctor-shortage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/04/business/fi-doctors4 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Lisa | last=Girion | title=Needs of Patients Outpace Doctors | date=2006-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Loosen the requirements for entry to medical school, such as eliminating the need for a pre-med bachelor's degree as required in some juridisctions, thereby making the education path more attractive for potential students.&lt;ref&gt;http://volokh.com/posts/1240839465.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduce the costs for students to attend medical school, such as through subsidies for (free or reduced) school tuition and more financial aid.&lt;ref&gt;https://vancouversun.com/story_print.html?id=1295859&amp;sponsor=&lt;/ref&gt;
*Legislate Tuition-Increase Caps for Medical Schools&lt;ref&gt;http://policymatters.net/?p=776&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increase the role of the [[National Health Service Corps]], which help provide debt-relief opportunities for primary care physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bodenheimer|first1=Thomas|last2=Grumbach|first2=Kevin|last3=Berenson|first3=Robert A.|title=A Lifeline for Primary Care|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=25 June 2009|volume=360|issue=26|pages=2693–2696|doi=10.1056/NEJMp0902909}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Improve the political, social and economic conditions in developing countries to prevent brain drain, including fewer wars and conflicts.
*Make better use of other categories of health care professionals, including more [[Osteopathic Physician]]s (DOs), [[nurse practitioner]]s, [[physician assistant]]s, [[clinical officer]]s, [[community health worker]]s, and others.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.

*Improve physicians' perspectives of their future career path, such as though reduced use of temporary [[employment contract]]s&lt;ref name="Nigenda"/&gt;
*Provide better incentives for physicians to practice in rural and medically underserved areas - for example, in the U.S., this could include expanding the [[National Health Service Corps]] for rural areas.&lt;ref name="kevinmd.com"/&gt;
*Ensure better practice conditions for physicians - for example, medical liability reforms have been cited as an important factor in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;http://sev.prnewswire.com/health-care-hospitals/20081112/CLW00412112008-1.html{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increase the use of e-mail and telephone consultations, which allow physicians to treat patients seeking more traditional forms of care.&lt;ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"&gt;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/29/5/799.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the United States, to better accommodate the elderly and their demand for healthcare services, increase medical and nursing training in [[geriatrics]] and [[gerontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Steven A.|title=A review of demographic and infrastructural factors and potential solutions to the physician and nursing shortage predicted to impact the growing US elderly population|journal=Journal of Public Health Management and Practice|date=2009|volume=15|issue=4|pages=352-62|doi=10.1097/PHH.0b013e31819d817d|pmid=19525780}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increase use of health care or medical teams (i.e. nurse practitioners and physician assistants) to shift physician workload and allow for increased physician times with patients.&lt;ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"/&gt;

==Global View==
In the US alone, the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] (AAMC) estimates a shortage of 91,500 physicians by 2020 and up to 130,600 by the year 2025.  However, a bias would clearly exist in their estimates as expanding medical education serves the direct financial needs of the AAMC.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/keyissues/physician_workforce/&lt;/ref&gt; As previously mentioned, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates a shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses and other health workers worldwide.&lt;ref name="WHR2006"/&gt;  The WHO produced a list of countries with a “Human Resources for Health crisis”. In these countries, there are only 1.13 doctors for every 1,000 people. In the United States, there are approximately 2.5 doctors for every 1,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/doctors-table-2014-1-en/index.html;jsessionid=1l4pia740p1ww.x-oecd-live-01?contentType=%2fns%2fStatisticalPublication%2c%2fns%2fKeyTableEdition%2c%2fns%2fTable&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2ftable%2fdoctors-table-2014-1-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2ftable%2f20758480-table4&amp;accessItemIds=%2fcontent%2ftablecollection%2f20758480|title = Health:Key Tables from OECD|date = 2011|accessdate = Feb 4, 2015|website = OECD iLibrary|publisher = OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; One quarter of physicians practicing in the United States are from foreign countries. Thousands of foreign doctors come to practice in the United States each year&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/06/11/countries_without_doctors&lt;/ref&gt; while only a few hundred doctors from the United States leave to practice in foreign countries even short-term.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amednews.com/article/20090720/business/307209994/4/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various organizations that assist United States physicians and others in serving internationally. These organizations may be filling temporary or permanent positions. Two temporary agencies are Global Medical Staffing and VISTA staffing. A [[locum]] doctor will serve in the temporary absence of another physician. These positions are typically 1-year placements but can vary by location, specialty, and other factors. Agencies that attempt to provide international aid in various ways often have a strong medical component. Some of these organizations helping to provide medical care internationally include Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW), Doctors Without Borders ([[Médecins Sans Frontières]]), [[Mercy Ships]], the US [[Peace Corps]], and [[International Medical Corps]].

Additionally, smaller non-profits that work regionally around the world have also implemented task-shifting strategies in order to increase impact. Non profits, such as [[the MINDS Foundation]] educated community health workers or teachers to perform simple medicinal tasks, thereby freeing up health professionals to focus on more pressing concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Model: Capacity Building|url=http://www.mindsfoundation.org/our-model/|website=The MINDS Foundation|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postmodern art''' is a body of art movements that sought to contradict some aspects of [[modernism]] or some aspects that emerged or developed in its aftermath. In general, movements such as [[intermedia]], [[installation art]], [[conceptual art]] and [[multimedia]], particularly involving video are described as [[Postmodernism|postmodern]].

There are several characteristics which lend art to being postmodern; these include [[bricolage]], the use of text prominently as the central artistic element, [[collage]], [[abstract art|simplification]], [[appropriation art|appropriation]], [[performance art]], the recycling of past styles and themes in a modern-day context, as well as the break-up of the barrier between [[fine arts|fine]] and [[high culture|high arts]] and [[low culture|low art]] and [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas About Art'', Desmond, Kathleen K. [https://books.google.com/books?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;dq=ideas+about+art&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International postmodernism: theory and literary practice'', Bertens, Hans [https://books.google.com/books?id=n_Eqx2Gr1vUC&amp;dq=international+postmodernism:+theory+and+literary+practice&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], Routledge, 1997, p.236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the term==
The predominant term for art produced since the 1950s is "[[contemporary art]]". Not all art labeled as contemporary art is postmodern, and the broader term encompasses both artists who continue to work in modernist and [[Late modernity|late modernist]] traditions, as well as artists who reject postmodernism for other reasons. [[Arthur Danto]] argues "contemporary" is the broader term, and postmodern objects represent a "subsector" of the contemporary movement.&lt;ref&gt;''After the End of Art: Contemporary Art and the Pale of History'' [[Arthur C. Danto]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some postmodern artists have made more distinctive breaks from the ideas of modern art and there is no consensus as to what is "late-modern" and what is "post-modern." Ideas rejected by the modern aesthetic have been re-established. In painting, postmodernism reintroduced representation.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Steiner, ''Venus in Exile: The Rejection of Beauty in 20th-Century Art'', New York: The Free Press, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-684-85781-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics argue much of the current "postmodern" art, the latest avant-gardism, should still classify as modern art.&lt;ref&gt;''Post-Modernism: The New Classicism in Art and Architecture'' [[Charles Jencks]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as describing certain tendencies of contemporary art, postmodern has also been used to denote a phase of [[modern art]]. Defenders of modernism, such as [[Clement Greenberg]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], 1979. Retrieved June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as radical opponents of modernism, such as [[Félix Guattari]], who calls it modernism's "last gasp,&lt;ref name="Guattari109"&gt;Félix Guattari, ''the Postmodern Impasse'' in ''The Guattari Reader'', Blackwell Publishing, 1996, pp109-113. {{ISBN|978-0-631-19708-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;" have adopted this position. The neo-conservative [[Hilton Kramer]] describes postmodernism as "a creation of modernism at the end of its tether."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Oliver Bennett, ''Cultural Pessimism: Narratives of Decline in the Postmodern World'', Edinburgh University Press, 2001, p131. {{ISBN|978-0-7486-0936-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]], in [[Fredric Jameson]]'s analysis, does not hold there is a postmodern stage radically different from the period of [[high modernism]]; instead, postmodern discontent with this or that high modernist style is part of the experimentation of high modernism, giving birth to new modernisms.&lt;ref&gt;Fredric Jameson, ''Foreword'' to Jean-François Lyotard, ''The Postmodern Condition'', Manchester University Press, 1997, pxvi. {{ISBN|978-0-7190-1450-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[aesthetics]] and [[art]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] is a major philosopher of postmodernism.

Many critics hold postmodern art emerges from modern art. Suggested dates for the shift from modern to postmodern include 1914 in Europe,&lt;ref name=McEvilly27/&gt; and 1962&lt;ref name=McEvilly29/&gt; or 1968&lt;ref name=Krauss287/&gt; in America. [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], commenting on discussions about the exact date of the transition from modernism to postmodernism, compares it to the discussion in the 1960s about the exact span of [[Mannerism]] and whether it should begin directly after the [[High Renaissance]] or later in the century. He makes the point these debates go on all the time with respect to art movements and periods, which is not to say they are not important.&lt;ref name="Elkins16"&gt;James Elkins, ''Stories of Art'', Routledge, 2002, p16. {{ISBN|978-0-415-93942-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The close of the period of postmodern art has been dated to the end of the 1980s, when the word postmodernism lost much of its critical resonance, and art practices began to address the impact of [[globalization]] and [[new media]].&lt;ref&gt;Zoya Kocur and Simon Leung, ''Theory in Contemporary Art Since 1985'', Blackwell Publishing, 2005, pp2-3. {{ISBN|978-0-631-22867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Marxist philosopher [[Fredric Jameson]] argues the condition of life and production will be reflected in all activity, including the making of art.

[[Jean Baudrillard]] has had a significant influence on postmodern-inspired art and emphasised the possibilities of new forms of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Zurbrugg, Jean Baudrillard, ''Jean Baudrillard: Art and Artefact'', Sage Publications, 1997, p150. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-5580-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist [[Peter Halley]] describes his day-glo colours as "hyperrealization of real color", and acknowledges Baudrillard as an influence.&lt;ref name="Genosko154"&gt;Gary Genosko, ''Baudrillard and Signs: Signification Ablaze'', Routledge, 1994, p154. {{ISBN|978-0-415-11256-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard himself, since 1984, was fairly consistent in his view contemporary art, and postmodern art in particular, was inferior to the modernist art of the post World War II period,&lt;ref name=Genosko154/&gt; while Jean-François Lyotard praised Contemporary painting and remarked on its evolution from Modern art.&lt;ref&gt;Grebowicz, Margaret, ''Gender After Lyotard'', State University of New York Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-6956-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major [[Women artists]] in the Twentieth Century are associated with postmodern art since much theoretical articulation of their work emerged from French psychoanalysis and [[Feminist Theory]] that is strongly related to post modern philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;de Zegher, Catherine (ed.) ''Inside the Visible", MIT Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Carol and de Zegher, Catherine, ''Women Artists at the Millennium'', October Books / The MIT Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-262-01226-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all uses of the term postmodern there are critics of its application. [[Kirk Varnedoe]], for instance, stated that there is no such thing as postmodernism, and that the possibilities of modernism have not yet been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-century Thought'', University of Chicago Press, 1997, p4. {{ISBN|978-0-226-22480-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the usage of the term as a kind of shorthand to designate the work of certain Post-war "schools" employing relatively specific material and generic techniques has become conventional since the mid-1980s, the theoretical underpinnings of Postmodernism as an epochal or epistemic division are still very much in controversy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Citadel of Modernism Falls to Deconstructionists,'' – 1992 critical essay, The Triumph of Modernism, 2006, [[Hilton Kramer]], pp218-221.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining postmodern art==
{{double image|right|MOMA chairs 2.jpg|250|Gau1878.jpg|239|The juxtaposition of old and new, especially with regards to taking styles from past periods and re-fitting them into modern art outside of their original context, is a common characteristic of postmodern art.}}
Postmodernism describes movements which both arise from, and react against or reject, trends in [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths,'' pp.8–171&lt;/ref&gt; General citations for specific trends of modernism are formal purity, [[medium specificity]], [[art for art's sake]], [[Authenticity (art)|authenticity]], [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]], [[originality]] and revolutionary or reactionary tendency, i.e. the [[avant-garde]]. However, paradox is probably the most important modernist idea against which postmodernism reacts. Paradox was central to the modernist enterprise, which [[Manet]] introduced. Manet's various violations of representational art brought to prominence the supposed mutual exclusiveness of reality and representation, design and representation, abstraction and reality, and so on. The incorporation of paradox was highly stimulating from Manet to the conceptualists.

The status of the avant-garde is controversial: many institutions argue being visionary, forward-looking, cutting-edge, and progressive are crucial to the mission of art in the present, and therefore postmodern art contradicts the value of "art of our times". Postmodernism rejects the notion of advancement or progress in art per se, and thus aims to overturn the "myth of the [[avant-garde]]". [[Rosalind Krauss]] was one of the important enunciators of the view that avant-gardism was over, and the new artistic era is post-liberal and post-progress.&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths,'' pp.8–171, Part II, ''Toward Post-modernism,'' pp. 196–291.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]] studied and confronted the avant-garde and modern art in a series of groundbreaking books, reviewing modern art at the same time as redefining postmodern art.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Orton and Griselda Pollock, ''Avant-Gardes and Partisans reviewed''. Manchester University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-7190-4399-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London &amp; N.Y., 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-415-06700-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Generations and Geographies in the Visual Arts''. Routledge, London, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-415-14128-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One characteristic of postmodern art is its conflation of high and low culture through the use of industrial materials and pop culture imagery. The use of low forms of art were a part of modernist experimentation as well, as documented in [[Kirk Varnedoe]] and [[Adam Gopnik]]'s 1990–91 show ''High and Low: Popular Culture and Modern Art'' at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]],&lt;ref&gt;Maria DiBattista and Lucy McDiarmid, ''High and Low Moderns: literature and culture, 1889–1939'', Oxford University Press, 1996, pp6-7. {{ISBN|978-0-19-508266-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exhibition that was universally panned at the time as the only event that could bring [[Douglas Crimp]] and [[Hilton Kramer]] together in a chorus of scorn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_10_91/ai_109667921 ''Kirk Varnedoe, 1946–2003'' – Front Page – Obituary – ''Art in America'', Oct, 2003 by Marcia E. Vetrocq]&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern art is noted for the way in which it blurs the distinctions between what is perceived as fine or high art and what is generally seen as low or kitsch art.&lt;ref name="purdue1"&gt;[http://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/postmodernism/modules/introduction.html General Introduction to Postmodernism]. Cla.purdue.edu. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst this concept of 'blurring' or 'fusing' high art with low art had been experimented during modernism, it only ever became fully endorsed after the advent of the postmodern era.&lt;ref name="purdue1"/&gt; Postmodernism introduced elements of commercialism, kitsch and a general [[camp (style)|camp]] aesthetic within its artistic context; postmodernism takes styles from past periods, such as [[Gothic art|Gothicism]], the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Baroque]],&lt;ref name="purdue1"/&gt; and mixes them so as to ignore their original use in their corresponding artistic movement. Such elements are common characteristics of what defines postmodern art.

[[Fredric Jameson]] suggests postmodern works abjure any claim to spontaneity and directness of expression, making use instead of pastiche and discontinuity. Against this definition, Art and Language's Charles Harrison and Paul Wood maintained pastiche and discontinuity are endemic to modernist art, and are deployed effectively by modern artists such as Manet and [[Picasso]].&lt;ref name="Harrison1014"&gt;Charles Harrison and Paul Wood, ''Art in Theory, 1900–2000: An Anthology of Changing Ideas'', Blackwell Publishing, 1992, p1014. {{ISBN|978-0-631-22708-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One compact definition is postmodernism rejects modernism's [[metanarrative|grand narratives]] of artistic direction, eradicating the boundaries between high and low forms of art, and disrupting genre's conventions with collision, collage, and fragmentation. Postmodern art holds all stances are unstable and insincere, and therefore [[irony]], [[parody]], and [[humor]] are the only positions [[Art criticism|critique]] or [[Historical revisionism|revision]] cannot overturn. "Pluralism and diversity" are other defining features.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Woods: Art of the Western World, Summit Books, 1989, p323. {{ISBN|978-0-671-67007-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avant-garde precursors==
Radical movements and trends regarded as influential and potentially as precursors to postmodernism emerged around [[World War I]] and particularly in its aftermath. With the introduction of the use of industrial artifacts in art and techniques such as [[collage]], [[avant-garde]] movements such as [[Cubism]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] questioned the nature and value of art. New artforms, such as cinema and the rise of [[reproduction]], influenced these movements as a means of creating artworks. The ignition point for the definition of modernism, [[Clement Greenberg]]'s essay, ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]'', first published in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1939, defends the avant-garde in the face of popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/kitsch.html Avant-Garde and Kitsch]''&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Peter Bürger would make a distinction between the historical avant-garde and modernism, and critics such as Krauss, Huyssen, and Douglas Crimp, following Bürger, identified the historical avant-garde as a precursor to postmodernism. Krauss, for example, describes [[Pablo Picasso]]'s use of collage as an avant-garde practice anticipating postmodern art with its emphasis on language at the expense of autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind E. Krauss, ''In the Name of Picasso'' in ''The Originality of the Avant-Garde and other Modernist Myths'', MIT Press, 1985, p39. {{ISBN|978-0-262-61046-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another point of view is avant-garde and modernist artists used similar strategies and postmodernism repudiates both.&lt;ref&gt;John P. McGowan, ''Postmodernism and its Critics'', Cornell University Press, 1991, p10. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-2494-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada===
{{Main article|Dada}}
[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]],'' 1917. Photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]
In the early 20th century [[Marcel Duchamp]] exhibited a urinal as a sculpture. His point was to have people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art just because he said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymades]]". The ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was a urinal signed with the pseudonym R. Mutt, which shocked the art world in 1917. This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as [[Dada]]. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to [[conceptual art]]. Some critics question calling Duchamp—whose obsession with [[paradox]] is well known—postmodernist on the grounds he eschews any specific medium, since paradox is not medium-specific, although it arose first in Manet's paintings.

[[Dadaism]] can be viewed as part of the modernist propensity to challenge established styles and forms, along with [[Surrealism]], [[Futurism]] and Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'', Routledge, 2005. p17. {{ISBN|978-0-415-28064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a chronological point of view, Dada is located solidly within modernism, however a number of critics hold it anticipates postmodernism, while others, such as [[Ihab Hassan]] and [[Steven Connor]], consider it a possible changeover point between modernism and postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Pegrum, ''Challenging Modernity: Dada Between Modern and Postmodern'', Berghahn Books, 2000, pp2-3. {{ISBN|978-1-57181-130-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to McEvilly, postmodernism begins with realizing one no longer believes in the myth of progress, and Duchamp sensed this in 1914 when he changed from a modernist practice to a postmodernist one, "abjuring aesthetic delectation, transcendent ambition, and tour de force demonstrations of formal agility in favor of aesthetic indifference, acknowledgement of the ordinary world, and the found object or readymade."&lt;ref name="McEvilly27"&gt;Thomas McEvilly in Richard Roth, Jean Dubuffet, Susan King, ''Beauty Is Nowhere: Ethical Issues in Art and Design'', Routledge, 1998. p27. {{ISBN|978-90-5701-311-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radical movements in modern art==
In general, [[Pop Art]] and [[Minimalism]] began as modernist movements: a [[paradigm shift]] and philosophical split between [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] and anti-formalism in the early 1970s caused those movements to be viewed by some as precursors or transitional postmodern art. Other modern movements cited as influential to postmodern art are [[conceptual art]] and the use of techniques such as [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], [[Photomontage|montage]], [[bricolage]], and [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]].

===Jackson Pollock and abstract expressionism===
{{Main article|Jackson Pollock|Abstract expressionism|Western painting}}
During the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]]'s radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[Contemporary art]] following him. Pollock realized the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined artmaking during the mid-century. Pollock's move from easel painting and conventionality liberated his contemporaneous artists and following artists. They realized Pollock's process&amp;nbsp;— working on the floor, unstretched raw canvas, from all four sides, using artist materials, industrial materials, imagery, non-imagery, throwing linear skeins of paint, dripping, drawing, staining, brushing&amp;nbsp;- blasted artmaking beyond prior boundaries. [[Abstract expressionism]] expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities artists had available for the creation of new works of art. In a sense, the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and others, opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of following artworks.

===After abstract expressionism===
{{Main article|Post-painterly abstraction|Color Field painting|Lyrical Abstraction|Arte Povera|Process Art|Western painting}}
In [[Abstract art|abstract painting]] during the 1950s and 1960s several new directions like [[Hard-edge painting]] and other forms of [[Geometric abstraction]] like the work of [[Frank Stella]] popped up, as a reaction against the subjectivism of Abstract expressionism began to appear in artist studios and in radical [[avant-garde]] circles. [[Clement Greenberg]] became the voice of ''Post-painterly abstraction;'' by curating an influential exhibition of new painting touring important art museums throughout the [[United States]] in 1964. [[Color field painting]], [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp.104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged as radical new directions.

By the late 1960s, [[Postminimalism]], [[Process Art]] and [[Arte Povera]]&lt;ref name="douglas2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; also emerged as revolutionary concepts and movements encompassing painting and sculpture, via [[Lyrical Abstraction]] and the [[Postminimalist]] movement, and in early [[Conceptual Art]].&lt;ref name="douglas2007"/&gt; Process art as inspired by Pollock enabled artists to experiment with and make use of a diverse encyclopedia of style, content, material, placement, sense of time, and plastic and real space. [[Nancy Graves]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Howard Hodgkin]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Alan Saret]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Peter Reginato]], [[Lee Lozano]], were some of the younger artists emerging during the era of [[Late Modernism|late modernism]] spawning the heyday of the art of the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. The New Art: It's Way, Way Out, Newsweek 29 July 1968: pp.3,55–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance art and happenings===
{{Main article|Performance art|Happenings}}
[[File:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|200px|left|[[Carolee Schneemann]] performing her piece ''[[Interior Scroll]] 1975.'' [[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html Interior Scroll, 1975]. Carolee Schneemann. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the late 1950s and 1960s, artists with a wide range of interests began pushing the boundaries of [[Contemporary art]]. [[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art. Groups like The [[Living Theater]] with [[Julian Beck]] and [[Judith Malina]] collaborated with sculptors and painters creating environments; radically changing the relationship between audience and performer especially in their piece ''Paradise Now''. The [[Judson Dance Theater]] located at the [[Judson Memorial Church]], [[New York City|New York]], and the Judson dancers, notably [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Trisha Brown]], [[Elaine Summers]], [[Sally Gross (choreographer)|Sally Gross]], Simonne Forti, [[Deborah Hay]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Steve Paxton]] and others collaborated with artists [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Robert Whitman]], [[John Cage]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and engineers like [[Billy Klüver]]. These performances were often designed to be the creation of a new art form, combining sculpture, dance, and music or sound, often with audience participation. The reductive philosophies of [[minimalism]], spontaneous improvisation, and expressivity of [[Abstract expressionism]] characterized the works.

During the same period&amp;nbsp;— the late 1950s through the mid-1960s&amp;nbsp;- various [[avant-garde]] artists created [[Happenings]]. Happenings were mysterious and often spontaneous and unscripted gatherings of artists and their friends and relatives in varied specified locations. Often incorporating exercises in absurdity, physical exercise, costumes, spontaneous [[nudity]], and various random and seemingly disconnected acts. [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Red Grooms]], and [[Robert Whitman]] among others were notable creators of Happenings.

===Assemblage art===
{{Main article|Assemblage art}}
Related to [[Abstract expressionism]] was the emergence of combined manufactured items&amp;nbsp;— with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture. The work of [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and [[commercial photography]], exemplified this art trend.

[[Leo Steinberg]] uses the term postmodernism in 1969 to describe Rauschenberg's "flatbed" picture plane, containing a range of cultural images and artifacts that had not been compatible with the pictorial field of premodernist and modernist painting.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp in Hal Foster (ed), ''Postmodern Culture'', Pluto Press, 1985 (first published as ''The Anti-Aesthetic'', 1983). p44. {{ISBN|978-0-7453-0003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] goes further, identifying the significance of Rauschenberg's work not as a representation of, in Steinberg's view, "the shift from nature to culture", but as a demonstration of the impossibility of accepting their opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), pp74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]] identify Rauschenberg and [[Jasper Johns]] as part of the transitional phase, influenced by [[Marcel Duchamp]], between modernism and postmodernism. These artists used images of ordinary objects, or the objects themselves, in their work, while retaining the abstraction and painterly gestures of high modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best, Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997, p174. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-221-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anselm Kiefer]] also uses elements of assemblage in his works, and on one occasion, featured the bow of a fishing boat in a painting.

===Pop art===
{{Main article|Pop art|Western painting}}
[[Lawrence Alloway]] used the term "Pop art" to describe paintings celebrating [[consumerism]] of the post [[World War II]] era. This movement rejected [[Abstract expressionism]] and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated, material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age. The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] were considered seminal examples in the movement. While later American examples include the bulk of the careers of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and his use of [[Benday dots]], a technique used in commercial reproduction. There is a clear connection between the radical works of [[Duchamp]], the rebellious [[Dada]]ist&amp;nbsp;— with a sense of humor; and [[Pop Art]]ists like [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and the others.

Thomas McEvilly, agreeing with [[Dave Hickey]], says U.S postmodernism in the visual arts began with the first exhibitions of Pop art in 1962, "though it took about twenty years before postmodernism became a dominant attitude in the visual arts."&lt;ref name="McEvilly29"&gt;Thomas McEvilly in Richard Roth, Jean Dubuffet, Susan King, ''Beauty Is Nowhere: Ethical Issues in Art and Design'', Routledge, 1998. p29. {{ISBN|978-90-5701-311-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fredric Jameson]], too, considers pop art to be postmodern.&lt;ref&gt;Fredric Jameson in Hal Foster, ''Postmodern Culture'', Pluto Press, 1985 (first published as ''The Anti-Aesthetic'', 1983). p111. {{ISBN|978-0-7453-0003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way Pop art is postmodern is it breaks down what [[Andreas Huyssen]] calls the "Great Divide" between high art and popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'', Routledge, 2005. p20. {{ISBN|978-0-415-28064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernism emerges from a "generational refusal of the categorical certainties of high modernism."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Sim, ''The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism'', Routledge, 2001. p148. {{ISBN|978-0-415-24307-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluxus===
{{Main article|Fluxus}}
[[File:BrechtViolinSolo.jpg|thumb|200px|''Solo For Violin • Polishing'' as performed by [[George Brecht]], New York, 1964. Photo by G Maciunas]]
Fluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by [[George Maciunas]] (1931–78), a Lithuanian-born American artist. Fluxus traces its beginnings to [[John Cage]]'s 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music. Cage's students included Fluxus founding members [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[Al Hansen]], [[George Brecht]] and [[Dick Higgins]].
In 1962 in Germany Fluxus started with the: FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik in [[Wiesbaden]] with, [[George Maciunas]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Nam June Paik]] and others. And in 1963 with the: Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in [[Düsseldorf]] with [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Ben Patterson]], [[Emmett Williams]] and others.

Fluxus encouraged a do it yourself aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues.

Fluxus can be viewed as part of the first phase of postmodernism, along with Rauschenberg, Johns, Warhol and the [[Situationist International]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sheppard, ''Modernism-Dada-Postmodernism'', Northwestern University
Press, 2000. p359. {{ISBN|978-0-8101-1492-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andreas Huyssen]] criticises attempts to claim Fluxus for postmodernism as, "either the master-code of postmodernism or the ultimately unrepresentable art movement&amp;nbsp;– as it were, postmodernism's sublime." Instead he sees Fluxus as a major [[Neo-Dada]]ist phenomena within the avant-garde tradition. It did not represent a major advance in the development of artistic strategies, though it did express a rebellion against, "the administered culture of the 1950s, in which a moderate, domesticated modernism served as ideological prop to the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Huyssen, ''Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a Culture of Amnesia'', Routledge, 1995. p192, p196. {{ISBN|978-0-415-90934-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalism===
{{Main article|Minimalism}}
[[File:Tonysmith freeride sculpture.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], ''Free Ride,'' 1962, 6'8 x 6'8 x 6'8 (the height of a standard US door opening), [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]
By the early 1960s [[Minimalism]] emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in [[geometric abstraction]] via [[Malevich]], the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]) which rejected the idea of relational, and subjective painting, the complexity of [[Abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional zeitgeist and polemics present in the arena of [[Action painting]]. [[Minimalism]] argued extreme simplicity could capture the sublime representation art requires. Associated with painters such as [[Frank Stella]], minimalism in painting, as opposed to other areas, is a modernist movement and depending on the context can be construed as a precursor to the postmodern movement.

[[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]], in his essay ''The Crux of Minimalism'', examines the extent to which [[Donald Judd]] and [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] both acknowledge and exceed Greenbergian modernism in their published definitions of minimalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, pp44-53. {{ISBN|978-0-262-56107-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues minimalism is not a "dead end" of modernism, but a "paradigm shift toward postmodern practices that continue to be elaborated today."&lt;ref name=Foster36/&gt;

===Postminimalism===
{{Main article|Postminimalism}}
[[File:Spiral-jetty-from-rozel-point.png|thumb|200px|left|[[Robert Smithson]], "[[Spiral Jetty]]" in mid-April 2005. It was created in 1970.]]
[[Robert Pincus-Witten]] coined the term [[Post-minimalism]] in 1977 to describe minimalist derived art which had content and contextual overtones minimalism rejected. His use of the term covered the period 1966 – 1976 and applied to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], and Barry Le Va, and others.&lt;ref name="douglas2007"/&gt; [[Process art]] and anti-form art are other terms describing this work, which the space it occupies and the process by which it is made determines.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Doss, ''Twentieth-Century American Art'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p174. {{ISBN|978-0-19-284239-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosalind Krauss]] argues by 1968 artists such as Morris, LeWitt, Smithson and Serra had "entered a situation the logical conditions of which can no longer be described as modernist."&lt;ref name="Krauss287"&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Sculpture in the Expanded Field'' pp.287&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the category of sculpture to include [[land art]] and [[architecture]], "brought about the shift into postmodernism."&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Sculpture in the Expanded Field'' (1979). pp.290&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimalists like [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce their late [[modernist]] paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.

==Movements in postmodern art==

===Conceptual art===
{{Main article|Conceptual Art}}
[[File:WeinerText.JPG|thumb|[[Lawrence Weiner]], ''Bits &amp; Pieces Put Together to Present a Semblance of a Whole,'' The Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, 2005.]]
Conceptual art is sometimes labelled as postmodern because it is expressly involved in [[deconstruction]] of what makes a work of art, "art". Conceptual art, because it is often designed to confront, [[wikt:offend|offend]] or attack notions held by many of the people who view it, is regarded with particular controversy.

Precursors to conceptual art include the work of Duchamp, [[John Cage]]'s [[4' 33"]], in which the music is said to be "the sounds of the environment that the listeners' hear while it is performed," and Rauschenberg's ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]''. Many conceptual works take the position that art is created by the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not from the intrinsic qualities of the work itself. Thus, because ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was exhibited, it was a sculpture.

===Installation art===
{{Main article|Installation art}}
[[File:feknerestatewheels.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[John Fekner]] © 1979–1990 ''Wheels Over Indian Trails'', Long Island City, NY. Pulaski Bridge overpass at the Queens Midtown Tunnel]]
An important series of movements in art which have consistently been described as postmodern involved [[installation art]] and creation of artifacts that are conceptual in nature. One example being the signs of [[Jenny Holzer]] which use the devices of art to convey specific messages, such as "Protect Me From What I Want". Installation Art has been important in determining the spaces selected for museums of contemporary art in order to be able to hold the large works which are composed of vast collages of manufactured and found objects. These installations and [[collage]]s are often electrified, with moving parts and lights.

They are often designed to create environmental effects, as [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]'s ''Iron Curtain, Wall of 240 Oil Barrels, Blocking Rue Visconti, Paris, June 1962'' which was a poetic response to the Berlin Wall built in 1961.

===Lowbrow art===
{{Main article|Lowbrow (art movement)}}
Lowbrow is a widespread populist art movement with origins in the underground comix world, punk music, hot-rod street culture, and other California subcultures. It is also often known by the name pop surrealism. Lowbrow art highlights a central theme in postmodernism in that the distinction between "high" and "low" art are no longer recognized.

===Performance art===
{{Main article|Performance art|List of performance artists}}

===Digital art===
{{Main article|Digital art}}
[[File:BOtv2002.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Joseph Nechvatal]] ''birth Of the viractual'' 2001 computer-robotic assisted acrylic on canvas]]
Digital art is a general term for a range of artistic works and practices that use digital technology as an essential part of the creative and/or presentation process. The impact of digital technology has transformed  activities such as [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[sculpture]] and music/[[sound art]], while new forms, such as [[net art]], digital [[installation art]], and [[virtual reality]], have become recognized artistic practices.

Leading art theorists and historians in this field include [[Christiane Paul]], [[Frank Popper]], [[Christine Buci-Glucksmann]], [[Dominique Moulon]], [[Robert C. Morgan]], [[Roy Ascott]], [[Catherine Perret]], [[Margot Lovejoy]], [[Edmond Couchot]], [[Fred Forest]] and [[Edward A. Shanken]].

===Intermedia and multi-media===
{{Main article|Intermedia}}
[[File:Transmediale-2010-Ryoji Ikeda-Data-Tron-1.jpg|thumb|200px|Data.Tron [8K Enhanced Version] by [[Ryoji Ikeda]] on show in [[transmediale]] 10.]]
Another trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together. [[Intermedia]], a term coined by [[Dick Higgins]] and meant to convey new artforms along the lines of [[Fluxus]], [[Concrete Poetry]], [[Found objects]], [[Performance art]], and [[Computer art]]. Higgins was the publisher of the [[Something Else Press]], a [[Concrete poet]], married to artist [[Alison Knowles]] and an admirer of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. [[Ihab Hassan]] includes, "Intermedia, the fusion of forms, the confusion of realms," in his list of the characteristics of postmodern art.&lt;ref&gt;Ihab Hassan in Lawrence E. Cahoone, ''From Modernism to Postmodernism: An Anthology'', Blackwell Publishing, 2003. p13. {{ISBN|978-0-631-23213-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common forms of "multi-media art" is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, termed [[Video art]]. While the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old, and has been revived periodically, the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with [[performance art]], where the dramatic subtext is removed, and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action.
Higgin's conception of Intermedia is connected to the growth of [[multimedia]] digital practice such as [[immersive virtual reality]], [[digital art]] and [[computer art]].

===Telematic Art===
{{Main article|Telematic art}}
Telematic art is a descriptive of art projects using computer mediated telecommunications networks as their medium. Telematic art challenges the traditional relationship between active viewing subjects and passive art objects by creating interactive, behavioural contexts for remote aesthetic encounters. [[Roy Ascott]] sees the telematic art form as the transformation of the viewer into an active participator of creating the artwork which remains in process throughout its duration. Ascott has been at the forefront of the theory and practice of telematic art since 1978 when he went online for the first time, organizing different collaborative online projects.

===Appropriation art and neo-conceptual art===
{{Main article|Appropriation art|Neo-conceptual art}}
[[File:Taaffe - We Are Not Afraid.jpg|thumb|200px|''Philip Taaffe, We Are Not Afraid'', 1985]]
In his 1980 essay ''The Allegorical Impulse: Toward a Theory of Postmodernism,'' [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] identifies the re-emergence of an [[allegorical]] impulse as characteristic of postmodern art. This impulse can be seen in the [[appropriation art]] of artists such as [[Sherrie Levine]] and [[Robert Longo]] because, "Allegorical imagery is appropriated imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), p54&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriation art debunks modernist notions of artistic genius and originality and is more ambivalent and contradictory than modern art, simultaneously installing and subverting ideologies, "being both critical and complicit."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best and Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997. p186. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-221-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-expressionism and painting===
{{Main article|Neo-expressionism}}
The return to the traditional art forms of sculpture and [[painting]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s seen in the work of [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-expressionist]] artists such as [[Georg Baselitz]] and [[Julian Schnabel]] has been described as a postmodern tendency,&lt;ref&gt;Tim Woods, ''Beginning Postmodernism'', Manchester University Press, 1999. p125. {{ISBN|978-0-7190-5211-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the first coherent movements to emerge in the postmodern era.&lt;ref&gt;Fred S. Kleiner, Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective'', Thomson Wadsworth, 2006, p842. {{ISBN|978-0-495-00480-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its strong links with the commercial art market has raised questions, however, both about its status as a postmodern movement and the definition of postmodernism itself. Hal Foster states that neo-expressionism was complicit with the conservative cultural politics of the Reagan-Bush era in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Foster36"&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, p36. {{ISBN|978-0-262-56107-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Félix Guattari]] disregards the "large promotional operations dubbed 'neo-expressionism' in Germany," (an example of a "fad that maintains itself by means of publicity") as a too easy way for him "to demonstrate that postmodernism is nothing but the last gasp of modernism."&lt;ref name=Guattari109/&gt; These critiques of neo-expressionism reveal that money and public relations really sustained contemporary art world credibility in America during the same period that conceptual artists, and practices of [[women artists]] including painters and feminist theorists like [[Griselda Pollock]],&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock &amp; Penny Florence, ''Looking Back to the Future: Essays by Griselda Pollock from the 1990s''. New York: G&amp;B New Arts Press, 2001. {{ISBN|978-90-5701-132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Generations and Geographies in the Visual Arts'', Routledge, London, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-415-14128-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; were systematically reevaluating modern art.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Doss, ''Twentieth-Century American Art'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p210. {{ISBN|978-0-19-284239-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-François (1993), ''Scriptures: Diffracted Traces'', reprinted in: ''Theory, Culture and Society, Volume 21 Number 1'', 2004.

Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Massumi]] claims that [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] open the horizon of new definitions of [[Beauty]] in postmodern art.&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, Brian (ed.), ''A Shock to Thought: Expression after Deleuze and Guattari''. London: Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-415-23804-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Jean-François Lyotard, it was painting of the artists [[Valerio Adami]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], and [[Barnett Newman]] that, after the avant-garde's time and the painting of [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]], was the vehicle for new ideas of the [[wikt:sublime|sublime]] in contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;Buci-Glucksmann, Christine, "Le differend de l'art". In: ''Jean-François Lyotard: L'exercise du differend''. Paris: PUF, 2001. {{ISBN|978-2-13-051056-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-François, "L'anamnese".

The '''preorbital gland''' is a paired [[exocrine gland]] found in many species of [[even-toed ungulate|hoofed animals]], which is [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the [[lacrimal gland]] found in humans. These glands are trenchlike slits of dark blue to black, nearly bare skin extending from the medial [[canthus]] of each eye. They are lined by a combination of [[Sebaceous gland|sebaceous]] and [[Sweat gland|sudoriferous]] [[gland]]s, and they produce [[secretion]]s which contain [[pheromone]]s and other [[semiochemical]] compounds.&lt;ref name=Rue2004/&gt; Ungulates frequently deposit these secretions on twigs and grass as a [[Animal communication|means of communication]] with other animals.&lt;ref name=Albone1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schulz2005/&gt;

The preorbital gland serves different roles in different species. Pheromone-containing secretions from the preorbital gland may serve to establish an animal's [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] (especially in preparation for [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|breeding]]),&lt;ref name=Kile1977/&gt; mark its [[Territory (animal)|territory]], or simply to produce a pleasurable sensation to the animal.&lt;ref name=deerglands/&gt; Because of its critical role in scent marking, the preorbital gland is usually considered as a type of [[scent gland]]. A further function of these glands may be to produce [[antimicrobial]] compounds to fight against skin [[pathogen]]s. Antimicrobial compounds found in these glands may be [[Biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] by the animal itself, or by [[microorganism]]s that live in these glands.&lt;ref name=Wood2010/&gt;

==In cervids==
[[File:Red deer stag 2009 denmark.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of a male [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus''), taken during the [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|mating season]]. Note the prominent preorbital gland, which is [[Hypertrophy|enlarged]] and dilated.]]

[[Deer]] have seven major external [[scent gland]]s, distributed throughout their bodies. These glands are the [[forehead gland]]s (located on the forehead), the preorbital glands (located below the eyes), the [[nasal glands]] (located inside the nostrils), the [[interdigital gland]]s (located between the toes), the [[preputial gland]] (located inside the foreskin of the [[deer's penis]]), the [[metatarsal gland]]s (located outside of the hind legs), and the [[tarsal gland (ungulate)|tarsal glands]] (located inside of the hind legs).&lt;ref name=Nickens2009/&gt; Though it is not their primary function, the [[salivary gland]]s also function as scent glands. Deer rely heavily on these scent glands to communicate with other members of their species, and possibly even with members of other species. A deer may rub its preorbital gland (e.g., on a branch) purely for pleasure.&lt;ref name=deerglands/&gt;

===North American deer===
The two major species of deer found in [[North America]] are the [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus'') and the [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus''). The most important [[sense]] in these animals is [[olfaction]] (the sense of smell)—so much so that they have an [[Olfaction#Accessory olfactory system|accessory olfaction system]].
The [[vomeronasal organ]], located at the base of the [[nasal cavity]], is the sensory organ for this system. Besides locating food and water, deer rely on their two separate olfactory systems to detect the presence of predators, as well as to supply them with information about the identity, sex, dominance status and reproductive status of other deer.&lt;ref name=Miller1990/&gt;

The preorbital gland of ''O. virginianus'' is about {{convert|22|mm|in|sp=us}} in length, while that of ''O. hemionus'' is roughly {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us}} in length. In [[black-tailed deer]] (''O. h. columbianus''), a subspecies of ''O. hemionus'', the preorbital gland measures about {{convert|32|mm|in|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=Rue2004/&gt; In all of these animals, the preorbital glands are surrounded by muscle which is under voluntary control, at least to some extent.&lt;ref name=Miller1990/&gt;

It is not entirely clear whether the preorbital gland secretions of North American deer emit an odor that is significant in terms of chemical communication. Most of the time, the glands remain in the closed position, but they are capable of opening them in certain circumstances. For example, a [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] male may dilate its preorbital glands in order to signal aggression to another nearby male. Female deer often open their glands while caring for their young.&lt;ref name=Miller1990/&gt;

===Other deer===
[[File:Elaphurus davidianus 02.JPG|thumb|A male [[Père David's Deer|Père David's deer]] (''Elaphurus davidianus''). Note the large preorbital gland extending from just below the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]].]]
[[File:Sambhar deer.jpg|thumb|A male [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]] (''Rusa unicolor'') in [[Pench National Park]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], India. These animals are often referred to as "four-eyed deer", due to their large preorbital glands.&lt;ref name=Leslie2011/&gt;]]

In juvenile [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus''), the preorbital gland appears to play a role in the response to stress. The preorbital gland is closed in a relaxed calf, whereas it is opened in a stressed calf.&lt;ref name=Bartosova2007/&gt; One example of this is the signalling of hunger and satiety. Fawns open their preorbital glands as a signal that they are hungry, and close the gland after feeding, when they are no longer hungry.&lt;ref name=Bartos2005/&gt;

Other than during the rut (mating season) and for the first six months after giving birth, the adult [[Indian muntjac]] (''Muntiacus muntjac'') is a solitary animal. Adult males in particular are well spaced and marking grass and bushes with secretions from their preorbital glands appears to be involved in the acquisition and maintenance of territory.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg1974/&gt;

==In bovids==
[[File:Hirola2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hirola]] (''Beatragus hunteri'') are often referred to as the "four-eyed antelope", due to their large preorbital glands&lt;ref name=Frommer2010/&gt;]]

The [[bovid]]s ([[family (biology)|family]] Bovidae) comprise some 140 species of [[ruminant]]s in which at least the males bear unbranched, hollow [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] covered in a permanent sheath of [[keratin]]. Most species of bovids have means of spacing themselves across their habitat; territorial behavior is the most consistent type of spacing behavior.&lt;ref name=Bergerud1974/&gt;

[[Goat-antelope|Caprids]] (dwarf antelope, such as the [[sheep]], [[Capra (genus)|goats]], [[muskox]], [[serow]]s, [[goral]]s, and several similar species) use their preorbital glands to establish [[Dominance hierarchy|social rank]]. For example, when competition arises between two grazing sheep (''Ovis aries''), they have been observed to nuzzle each other's preorbital glands. By sending and receiving olfactory cues, this behavior appears to be a means of establishing dominance and of avoiding a fight, which would otherwise involve potentially injurious butting or clashing with the forehead.&lt;ref name=Baskin1974/&gt;

The [[Antilopinae|antilopine]] bovids (dwarf antelope, such as the [[springbok]], [[blackbuck]], [[gazelle]]s, [[dik-dik]]s, [[oribi]], and several similar species) have well-developed preorbital glands.&lt;ref name=Schulz2005/&gt;

Among the [[Duiker|cephalophines]], members of the ''Philantomba'' and ''Sylvicapra'' genera are all solitary animals which display territorial behavior and have well developed preorbital glands. [[Maxwell's duiker]] (''Philantomba maxwellii'') is a solitary animal which utilizes preorbital gland secretions to mark its territory. This behavior is observed most in adult males, less frequently in females, and less still in subadults of this species.&lt;ref name=Bigalke1974/&gt; Secretions from the preorbital gland of the common duiker contain at least 33 different [[chemical compound]]s. Two [[thiazole]] compounds and an [[epoxy]] [[ketone]] are present in significantly higher concentrations in male than in female secretions, suggesting that they could serve as sex recognition cues.&lt;ref name=Burger1990/&gt;

The [[Alcelaphinae|alcephine]] bovids ([[wildebeest]]s, [[hartebeest]]s, [[hirola]], [[bontebok]], [[blesbok]], and several similar species) have preorbital glands which secrete complex mixtures of chemical compounds.&lt;ref name=Schulz2005/&gt; The preorbital glands of the [[bontebok]] (''Damaliscus pygargus pygarus'') are larger in males than in females. Their secretions contain at least forty different chemical compounds, and are deposited on grass and twigs at the borders of their territory. They then appear to transfer the secretions from the grass to their horns and forehead by waving the head from side to side across the stalk bearing the secretion. Marking of plant stalks with preorbital gland secretions is seen in both sexes.&lt;ref name=Damaliscus/&gt; In contrast to the duikers and raphicerids, the [[klipspringer]] (''Oreotragus oreotragus'') is a semi-[[Herd|gregarious]] species, while the [[hirola]] (''Beatragus hunteri'') is fully gregarious. Nevertheless, these animals display territorial scent marking of grasses with secretions from their preorbital glands.&lt;ref name=Bigalke1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beatragus/&gt;

Differences in the social structure and marking behavior among different species may lead to a different size and position of the preorbital glands on the animal's face. For example, [[Günther's dik-dik]] (''Madoqua guentheri'') is a [[monogamy|monogamous]] species of [[antelope]] that lives in a permanent territory, the boundaries of which the animals mark several times a day by actively pressing the preorbital glands to grasses and low-lying plants and applying the secretions. In this territorial animal, the preorbital glands remain of considerable size throughout the year. The glands are located in large [[Antorbital fenestra|preorbital pits]] in the [[lacrimal bone]], and are surrounded by specialized facial muscles that compress them to express the secretions more effectively. In contrast, the [[Saiga Antelope|saiga antelope]] (''Saiga tatarica'') is a [[polygamy|polygamous]] and somewhat nomadic species which does not occupy any permanent territory at any time during the year. For most of the year the preorbital glands remain small, only growing to substantial size during the rut. At that time of year, secretions ooze more or less continuously from the glands. In this nonterritorial animal, the preorbital glands are not as well-developed, lack well-developed surrounding facial muscles, and are positioned in an inconspicuous and shallow depression of the lacrimal bone.&lt;ref name=Frey1997/&gt;

==Research directions==
The recent identification of several antimicrobial compounds from the secretions of animal [[Dermis|dermal]] scent glands may be the beginning of a promising new area of [[drug development]]. Assuming [[Functional analog (chemistry)|functional analog]]s of these [[lead compound]]s can be [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] and [[Structure–activity relationship|found to be effective]] ''in vivo'', the potential exists for producing new antimicrobial agents against pathogenic skin microorganisms.&lt;ref name=Wood2010/&gt;

[[File:Radialgeschwindigkeit.gif|thumb|A plane flying past a radar station: the plane's velocity vector (red) is the sum of the radial velocity (green) and the tangential velocity (blue).]]
The '''radial velocity''' of an object with respect to a given point is the rate of change of the distance between the object and the point. That is, the radial velocity is the component of the object's [[velocity]] that points in the direction of the radius connecting the object and the point. In astronomy, the point is usually taken to be the observer on Earth, so the radial velocity then denotes the speed with which the object moves away from or approaches the Earth.

In astronomy, radial velocity is often measured to the first order of approximation by [[Doppler spectroscopy]]. The quantity obtained by this method may be called the ''barycentric radial-velocity measure'' or spectroscopic radial velocity.&lt;ref name="IAUInfBull91_c1"&gt;''Resolution C1 on the Definition of a Spectroscopic "Barycentric Radial-Velocity Measure"''.

==Spectroscopic radial velocity==

Light from an object with a substantial relative radial velocity at emission will be subject to the [[Doppler effect]], so the frequency of the light decreases for objects that were receding ([[redshift]]) and increases for objects that were approaching ([[blueshift]]).

The radial velocity of a [[star]] or other luminous distant objects can be measured accurately by taking a high-resolution [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] and comparing the measured [[wavelength]]s of known [[spectral line]]s to wavelengths from laboratory measurements. A positive radial velocity indicates the distance between the objects is or was increasing; a negative radial velocity indicates the distance between the source and observer is or was decreasing.

[[File:Planet reflex 200.gif|thumb|Diagram showing how an exoplanet's orbit changes the position and velocity of a star as they orbit a common center of mass.]]

In many [[binary star]]s, the [[orbit]]al motion usually causes radial velocity variations of several kilometers per second (km/s). As the spectra of these stars vary due to the Doppler effect, they are called [[spectroscopic binary|spectroscopic binaries]]. Radial velocity can be used to estimate the ratio of the masses of the stars, and some [[orbital element]]s, such as [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] and [[semimajor axis]]. The same method has also been used to detect [[planet]]s around stars, in the way that the movement's measurement determines the planet's orbital period, while the resulting radial-velocity [[amplitude]] allows the calculation of the lower bound on a planet's [[mass]] using the [[binary mass function]]. Radial velocity methods alone may only reveal a lower bound, since a large planet orbiting at a very high angle to the line of sight will perturb its star radially as much as a much smaller planet with an orbital plane on the line of sight. It has been suggested that planets with high eccentricities calculated by this method may in fact be two-planet systems of circular or near-circular resonant orbit.&lt;ref name="Anglada-Escude"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Guillem |last1 = Anglada-Escude |first2=Mercedes |last2=Lopez-Morales|first3= John E.|last3=Chambers | title = How eccentric orbital solutions can hide planetary systems in 2:1 resonant orbits | journal = The Astrophysical Journal Letters | arxiv = 0809.1275  | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/709/1/168 | volume=709 | issue=1 | pages=168–78 | bibcode = 2010ApJ...709..168A|year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KursterAA2015"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Martin |last1=Kürster| first2=Trifon |last2=Trifonov |first3=Sabine |last3=Reffert| first4=Nadiia M. | last4=Kostogryz |first5=Florian |last5=Roder | journal=Astron.

==Detection of exoplanets==
{{Main|Doppler spectroscopy}}
[[File:ESO - The Radial Velocity Method (by).jpg|thumb|The radial velocity method to detect exoplanets]]
The radial velocity method to detect [[exoplanet]]s is based on the detection of variations in the velocity of the central star, due to the changing direction of the gravitational pull from an (unseen) exoplanet as it orbits the star. When the star moves towards us, its spectrum is blueshifted, while it is redshifted when it moves away from us. By regularly looking at the spectrum of a star—and so, measuring its velocity—it can be determined if it moves periodically due to the influence of an exoplanet companion.

==Data reduction==

From the instrumental perspective, velocities are measured relative to the telescope's motion. So an important first step of the [[data reduction]] is to remove the contributions of
*the [[Earth's orbit|Earth's elliptic motion]] around the sun at approximately ± 30&amp;nbsp;km/s,

'''Radio occultation''' (RO) is a [[remote sensing]] technique used for measuring the physical properties of a planetary [[atmosphere]] or [[Ring system (astronomy)|ring system]].

==Atmospheric radio occultation==
Atmospheric radio occultation relies on the detection of a change in a radio signal as it passes through a planet's atmosphere, i.e. as it is [[occulted]] by the atmosphere. When [[electromagnetic radiation]] (light) passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted (or bent). The magnitude of the [[refraction]] depends on the gradient of refractivity normal to the path, which in turn depends on the density gradient. The effect is most pronounced when the radiation traverses a long atmospheric limb path. At radio frequencies the amount of bending cannot be measured directly; instead the bending can be calculated using the [[Doppler shift]] of the signal given the geometry of the emitter and receiver. The amount of bending can be related to the refractive index by using an [[Abel transform]] on the formula relating bending angle to refractivity. In the case of the neutral atmosphere (below the ionosphere) information on the atmosphere's [[temperature]], [[pressure]] and water vapour content can be derived giving radio occultation data applications in [[meteorology]].

==GNSS radio occultation==
'''GNSS''' or '''GPS radio occultation''' (GNSS-RO, GPS-RO, GPSRO) is a type of radio occultation that relies on radio transmissions from GPS ([[Global Positioning System]]), or more generally from GNSS ([[Global Navigation Satellite System]]), satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne et al. 1994.  ''The application of spacebourne GPS to atmospheric limb sounding and global change monitoring.''  Publication 94-18, Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kursinski et al. 1997.  ''Observing the Earth's atmosphere with radio occultation measurements using the Global Positioning System.''  J. Geophys. Res. '''102:'''23.429-23.465.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a relatively new technique (first applied in 1995) for performing atmospheric measurements. It is used as a [[weather forecasting]] tool, and could also be harnessed in monitoring [[climate change]]. The technique involves a [[low-Earth orbit]] satellite receiving a signal from a [[GPS]] satellite. The signal has to pass through the atmosphere and gets [[refracted]] along the way. The magnitude of the refraction depends on the temperature and water vapor concentration in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="GPS Thermometer"&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS 'thermometer' could flag up climate change|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/tech/dn13329-gps-thermometer-could-flag-up-climate-change.html|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GPS Radio occultation amounts to an almost instantaneous depiction of the atmospheric state. The relative position between the [[GPS]] satellite and the [[low-Earth orbit]] satellite changes over time, allowing for a vertical scanning of successive layers of the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="GPS Space-Based &amp; Radio occultation"&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS Space-Based &amp; GPS Radio occultation|url=http://geodaf.mt.asi.it/html_old/GPSAtmo/space.html|accessdate=2008-02-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515121521/http://geodaf.mt.asi.it/html_old/GPSAtmo/space.html|archivedate=2009-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5002">'''Surface engineering''' is the sub-discipline of [[materials science]] which deals with the [[interface (matter)|surface]] of solid matter.  It has applications to [[chemistry]], [[mechanical engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]] (particularly in relation to [[semiconductor manufacturing]]).

[[Solids]] are composed of a bulk material covered by a surface. The surface which bounds the bulk material is called the [[Surface phase]]. It acts as an interface to the surrounding environment. The bulk material in a solid is called the [[Bulk phase]]. 

The surface phase of a solid interacts with the surrounding environment. This interaction can degrade the surface phase over time. [[Environmental degradation]] of the surface phase over time can be caused by [[wear]], [[corrosion]], [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]. 

Surface engineering involves altering the properties of the Surface Phase in order to reduce the degradation over time. This is accomplished by making the surface robust to the environment in which it will be used.it provides a cost effective material for robust design. A spectrum of topics that represent the diverse nature of the field of surface engineering includes Plating technologies, Nano and emerging technologies and Surface engineering, characterization and testing.

==Applications ==

Surface engineering techniques are being used in the automotive, aerospace, missile, power, electronic, biomedical, textile, petroleum, petrochemical, chemical, steel, cement, machine tools and construction industries including [[road surface|road surfacing]]. Surface engineering techniques can be used to develop a wide range of functional properties, including physical, chemical, electrical, electronic, magnetic, mechanical, wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant properties at the required substrate surfaces.  Almost all types of materials, including metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites can be coated on similar or dissimilar materials.  It  is also possible to form coatings of newer materials (e.g., met glass. beta-C3N4), graded deposits, multi-component deposits etc. 

In 1995, surface engineering was a ₤10 billion market in the United Kingdom. Coatings, to make surface life robust from wear and corrosion, was approximately half the market. 

In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in surface engineering from age-old electroplating to processes such as vapor phase deposition, diffusion, thermal spray &amp; welding using {{clarify|text=advanced heat sources|date=January 2016}} like plasma, laser, ion, electron, microwave, solar beams, pulsed arc, pulsed combustion, spark, friction and induction.

It's estimated that loss due to wear and corrosion in the US is approximately $500 billion. In the US, there are around 9524 establishments (including automotive, aircraft, power and construction industries) who depend on engineered surfaces with support from 23,466 industries.

There are around 65 academic institutions world-wide engaged in surface engineering research and education.

==Surface Cleaning Techniques==

Surface cleaning, synonymously referred to as dry cleaning, is a mechanical
cleaning technique used to reduce superficial soil, dust, grime, insect droppings,
accretions, or other surface deposits. (Dry cleaning, as the term is used in paper
conservation, does not employ the use of organic solvents.) Surface cleaning
may be used as an independent cleaning technique, as one step (usually the
first) in a more comprehensive treatment, or as a prelude to further treatments
(e.g., aqueous immersion) which may cause dirt to set irreversibly in paper
fibers.

==Purpose==
The purpose of surface cleaning is to reduce the potential for damage to paper
artifacts by removing foreign material which can be abrasive, acidic,
hygroscopic, or degradative. The decision to remove surface dirt is also for
aesthetic reasons when it interferes with the visibility of the imagery or
information. A decision must be made balancing the probable care of each
object against the possible problems related to surface cleaning.

A '''suspension bridge''' is a type of [[bridge]] in which the deck (the load-bearing portion) is hung below suspension [[Wire rope|cables]] on vertical suspenders. The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf Chakzampa Thangtong Gyalpo – Architect, Philosopher and Iron Chain Bridge Builder] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140525105817/http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf |date=25 May 2014 }} by Manfred Gerner. Thimphu: Center for Bhutan Studies 2007. {{ISBN|99936-14-39-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lhasaanditsmyst00waddgoog#page/n476/mode/2up Lhasa and Its Mysteries] by Lawrence Austine Waddell, 1905, p.313&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simple suspension bridge]]s, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world.

This type of bridge has cables suspended between [[tower]]s, plus vertical ''suspender cables'' that carry the weight of the deck below, upon which traffic crosses. This arrangement allows the deck to be level or to arc upward for additional clearance. Like other [[suspension bridge types]], this type often is constructed without [[falsework]].

The suspension cables must be anchored at each end of the bridge, since any load applied to the bridge is transformed into a tension in these main cables. The main cables continue beyond the pillars to deck-level supports, and further continue to connections with anchors in the ground. The roadway is supported by vertical suspender cables or rods, called hangers. In some circumstances, the towers may sit on a bluff or [[canyon]] edge where the road may proceed directly to the main span, otherwise the bridge will usually have two smaller spans, running between either pair of pillars and the highway, which may be supported by suspender cables or may use a truss bridge to make this connection. In the latter case there will be very little arc in the outboard main cables.

==History==
 [[File:Manhattan_Bridge_2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Manhattan Bridge]], connecting [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]] in New York City, opened in 1909 and is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges; its design served as the model for many of the long-span suspension bridges around the world.]]
{{For|bridges where the deck follows the suspenders|simple suspension bridge}}
The earliest suspension bridges were ropes slung across a chasm, with a deck possibly at the same level or hung below the ropes such that the rope had a [[catenary arch|catenary]] shape.

===Precursor===
The [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] saint and bridge-builder [[Thangtong Gyalpo]] originated the use of [[wrought iron|iron]] chains in his version of [[simple suspension bridge]]s. In 1433, Gyalpo built eight bridges in eastern [[Bhutan]]. The last surviving chain-linked bridge of Gyalpo's was the Thangtong Gyalpo Bridge in [[Duksum]] en route to [[Trashi Yangtse]], which was finally washed away in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhutan|publisher=Lonely Planet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-L8NUlW_QgC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Thangtong+Gyalpo+suspension+bridge#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1-74059-529-2|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gyalpo's iron chain bridges did not include a [[suspended deck bridge]] which is the standard on  all modern suspension bridges today. Instead, both the railing and the walking layer of Gyalpo's bridges used wires. The [[stress (mechanics)|stress points]] that carried the screed were reinforced by the iron chains. Before the use of iron chains it is thought that Gyalpo used ropes from twisted willows or yak skins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chakzampa Thangtong Gyalpo|publisher=Centre for Bhutan Studies|page=61|url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140525105817/http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf|archivedate=25 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may have also used tightly bound cloth.

===Chain bridges===
The first iron chain suspension bridge in the [[Western world]] was the [[Jacob's Creek Bridge]] (1801) in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], designed by inventor [[James Finley (engineer)|James Finley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Wire of the Wheeling Suspension Bridge|publisher=Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute|url=http://www.si.edu/mci/english/research/past_projects/iron_wire_bridge.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430064802/http://www.si.edu/mci/english/research/past_projects/iron_wire_bridge.html|archivedate=30 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finley's bridge was the first to incorporate all of the necessary components of a modern suspension bridge, including a suspended deck which hung by trusses. Finley patented his design in 1808, and published it in the Philadelphia journal, [[The Port Folio]], in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bridges: Three Thousand Years of Defying Nature|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ARwZhPVA6ZYC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=suspended+deck+bridge+by+James+Finley#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-7603-1234-6|date=12 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A plan &amp; view of a chain bridge - erecting over the menai at Bangor Ferry 1820.jpeg|thumb|200px|An early plan for the [[Menai Suspension Bridge|chain bridge]] over the [[Menai Strait]] near [[Bangor, Wales]], completed in 1826]]
Early British chain bridges included the [[Dryburgh Abbey Bridge]] (1817) and 137 m [[Union Bridge (Tweed)|Union Bridge]] (1820), with spans rapidly increasing to 176 m with the [[Menai Suspension Bridge|Menai Bridge]] (1826), "the first important modern suspension bridge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/374642/Menai-Bridge|title=Menai Bridge - bridge, Wales, United Kingdom|author=|date=|website=britannica.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413220655/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/374642/Menai-Bridge|archivedate=13 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first chain bridge on the European continent was the [[Chain Bridge (Nuremberg)|Chain Bridge]] in [[Nuremberg]], Germany.
The [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]] (designed in 1831, completed in 1864  with a 214 m central span) is one of the longest of the parabolic arc chain type. The current [[Marlow Bridge|Marlow suspension bridge]] was designed by [[William Tierney Clark]] and was built between 1829 and 1832, replacing a wooden bridge further downstream which collapsed in 1828.  It is the only suspension bridge across the non-tidal Thames. The [[Széchenyi Chain Bridge]], spanning the River Danube in Budapest, was also designed by William Clark and it is a larger scale version of Marlow bridge.&lt;ref&gt;"Marlow Suspension Bridge".

An interesting variation is [[Thornewill and Warham]]'s [[Ferry Bridge, Burton|Ferry Bridge]] in [[Burton-on-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]] (1889), where the chains are not attached to abutments as is usual, but instead are attached to the main girders, which are thus in compression.  Here, the chains are made from flat wrought iron plates, eight inches (203 mm) wide by an inch and a half (38 mm) thick, rivetted together.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ice.org.uk/disciplines-and-resources/ice-library-and-digital-resources/historical-engineering-works/details?hewID=2746#details {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025235610/https://www.ice.org.uk/disciplines-and-resources/ice-library-and-digital-resources/historical-engineering-works/details?hewID=2746 |date=25 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wire-cable===
The first wire-cable suspension bridge was the [[Spider Bridge at Falls of Schuylkill]] (1816), a modest and temporary footbridge built following the collapse of James Finley's nearby [[Chain Bridge at Falls of Schuylkill]] (1808). The footbridge's span was 124 m, although its deck was only 0.45 m wide.

Development of wire-cable suspension bridges dates to the temporary simple suspension bridge at [[Annonay]] built by [[Marc Seguin]] and his brothers in 1822. It spanned only 18 m.&lt;ref name="Peters"/&gt; The first permanent wire cable suspension bridge was [[Guillaume Henri Dufour]]'s Saint Antoine Bridge in [[Geneva]] of 1823, with two 40 m spans.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first with cables assembled in mid-air in the modern method was [[Joseph Chaley]]'s Grand Pont Suspendu in [[Fribourg]], in 1834.&lt;ref name="Peters"/&gt;

In the United States, the first major wire-cable suspension bridge was the [[Spring Garden Street Bridge#2nd bridge: Wire Bridge at Fairmount|Wire Bridge at Fairmount]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Designed by [[Charles Ellet, Jr.]] and completed in 1842, it had a span of 109 m. Ellet's [[Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge]] (1847–48) was abandoned before completion. It was used as [[scaffolding]] for [[John A. Roebling]]'s [[Bridge#Double-decker bridge|double decker]] railroad and carriage bridge (1855).

The [[Otto Beit Bridge]] (1938–39) was the first modern suspension bridge outside the United States built with parallel wire cables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clevelandbridge.com/Gallery%20Historic.htm Cleveland Bridge Company (UK)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720172523/http://www.clevelandbridge.com/Gallery%20Historic.htm |date=20 July 2008 }} Web site Retrieved 21 February 2007, includes image of the bridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural analysis=== &lt;!-- Please see the article discussion if you think terms parabola and catenary should be swapped  --&gt;
The main [[force (physics)|force]]s in a suspension bridge of any type are [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] in the cables and [[compression (physical)|compression]] in the pillars. Since almost all the force on the pillars is vertically downwards and they are also stabilized by the main cables, the [[Column|pillars]] can be made quite slender, as on the [[Severn Bridge]], on the Wales-England border.

{{wide image|Severn bridge-panoramic.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|The slender lines of the [[Severn Bridge]]}}

In a suspended deck bridge, cables suspended via towers hold up the road deck. The weight is transferred by the cables to the towers, which in turn transfer the weight to the ground.

{{hidden top|title=More details}}
The catenary represents the profile of a simple suspension bridge, or the cable of a suspended-deck suspension bridge on which its deck and hangers have negligible mass compared to its cable. The parabola represents the profile of the cable of a suspended-deck suspension bridge on which its cable and hangers have negligible mass compared to its deck. The profile of the cable of a real suspension bridge with the same span and sag lies between the two curves.

]]

Assuming a negligible weight as compared to the weight of the deck and vehicles being supported, the main cables of a suspension bridge will form a [[parabola]] (very similar to a [[catenary]], the form the unloaded cables take before the deck is added). One can see the shape from the constant increase of the gradient of the cable with linear (deck) distance, this increase in gradient at each connection with the deck providing a net upward support force. Combined with the relatively simple constraints placed upon the actual deck, this makes the suspension bridge much simpler to design and analyze than a [[cable-stayed bridge]], where the deck is in compression.

===Advantages===
[[File:Suspension bridge.jpg|thumb|left|A suspension bridge can be made out of simple materials such as wood and common wire rope.]]

*Longer main spans are achievable than with any other type of bridge
*Less material may be required than other bridge types, even at spans they can achieve, leading to a reduced construction cost
*Except for installation of the initial temporary cables, little or no access from below is required during construction, for example allowing a waterway to remain open while the bridge is built above
*May be better able to withstand earthquake movements than heavier and more rigid bridges
*Bridge decks can have deck sections replaced in order to widen traffic lanes for larger vehicles or add additions width for separated cycling/pedestrian paths.

===Disadvantages===
*Considerable stiffness or aerodynamic profiling may be required to prevent the bridge deck vibrating under high winds
*The relatively low deck stiffness compared to other (non-suspension) types of bridges makes it more difficult to carry [[Passenger rail terminology#Heavy rail|heavy rail]] traffic where high concentrated [[Structural load#Types of loads|live loads]] occur
*Some access below may be required during construction, to lift the initial cables or to lift deck units. This access can often be avoided in [[cable-stayed bridge]] construction

==Variations==
===Underspanned===

In an underspanned suspension bridge, the main cables hang entirely below the bridge deck, but are still anchored into the ground in a similar way to the conventional type. Very few bridges of this nature have been built, as the deck is inherently less stable than when suspended below the cables. Examples include the Pont des Bergues of 1834 designed by [[Guillaume Henri Dufour]];&lt;ref name="Peters"/&gt; James Smith's Micklewood Bridge;&lt;ref name="Drewry"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Memoir of Suspension Bridges: Comprising The History Of Their Origin And Progress |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR1 |last=Drewry |first=Charles Stewart |year=1832 |publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green &amp; Longman |location=London |accessdate=13 June 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616213647/http://books.google.com/books?id=Hw8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR1 |archivedate=16 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a proposal by [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]] for a bridge over the River Almond near [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="Drewry"/&gt;

[[Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct]] (begun 1847) consists of three sections supported by cables.
The timber structure essentially hides the cables; and from a quick view, it is not immediately apparent that it is even a suspension bridge.

===Suspension cable types===
The main suspension cables in older bridges were often made from chain or linked bars, but modern bridge cables are made from multiple strands of wire. This not only adds strength but improves reliability (often called redundancy in engineering terms) because the failure of a few flawed strands in the hundreds used pose very little threat of failure, whereas a single bad link or [[eyebar]] can cause failure of an entire bridge. (The failure of a single eyebar was found to be the cause of the collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]] over the [[Ohio River]].) Another reason is that as spans increased, engineers were unable to lift larger chains into position, whereas wire strand cables can be formulated one by one in mid-air from a temporary walkway.

===Deck structure types===
Most suspension bridges have open truss structures to support the roadbed, particularly owing to the unfavorable effects of using plate girders, discovered from the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)]] bridge collapse. In the 1960s, developments in bridge aerodynamics allowed the re-introduction of plate structures as shallow [[box girders]], first seen on the [[Severn bridge]] built 1961-6. In the picture of the [[Yichang Bridge]], note the very sharp entry edge and sloping undergirders in the suspension bridge shown. This enables this type of construction to be used without the danger of vortex shedding and consequent aeroelastic effects, such as those that destroyed the original Tacoma Narrows bridge.

== Forces ==
Three kinds of forces operate on any bridge: the dead load, the live load, and the dynamic load. Dead load refers to the weight of the bridge itself. Like any other structure, a bridge has a tendency to collapse simply because of the gravitational forces acting on the materials of which the bridge is made. Live load refers to traffic that moves across the bridge as well as normal environmental factors such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and winds. Dynamic load refers to environmental factors that go beyond normal weather conditions, factors such as sudden gusts of wind and earthquakes. All three factors must be taken into consideration when building a bridge.

===Use other than road and rail===
[[File:Cable-suspended footbridge at DFW terminal D.JPG|left|thumb|Cable-suspended footbridge at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas Fort Worth Airport]] Terminal D]]
The principles of suspension used on the large scale may also appear in contexts less dramatic than road or rail bridges. Light cable suspension may prove less expensive and seem more elegant for a cycle or footbridge than strong girder supports. An example of this is the [[Nescio Bridge]] in the Netherlands.

Where such a bridge spans a gap between two buildings, there is no need to construct special towers, as the buildings can anchor the cables. Cable suspension may also be augmented by the inherent stiffness of a structure that has much in common with a [[tubular bridge]].

==Construction sequence (wire strand cable type)==

Typical suspension bridges are constructed using a sequence generally described as follows. Depending on length and size, construction may take anywhere between a year and a half (construction on the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge took only 19 months) up to as long as a decade (the Akashi-Kaikyō Bridge's construction began in May 1986 and was opened in May 1998 – a total of twelve years).
#Where the towers are founded on underwater piers, [[Caisson (engineering)|''caissons'']] are sunk and any soft bottom is excavated for a foundation. If the [[bedrock]] is too deep to be exposed by excavation or the sinking of a caisson, pilings are driven to the bedrock or into overlying hard soil, or a large concrete pad to distribute the weight over less resistant soil may be constructed, first preparing the surface with a bed of compacted gravel. (Such a pad footing can also accommodate the movements of an [[active fault]], and this has been implemented on the foundations of the [[cable-stayed bridge|cable-stayed]] [[Rio-Antirio bridge]].) The piers are then extended above water level, where they are capped with pedestal bases for the towers.
#Where the towers are founded on dry land, deep foundation excavation or pilings are used.
#From the tower foundation, towers of single or multiple columns are erected using high-strength reinforced concrete, stonework, or steel. Concrete is used most frequently in modern suspension bridge construction due to the high cost of steel.
#Large devices called ''saddles'', which will carry the main suspension cables, are positioned atop the towers. Typically of cast steel, they can also be manufactured using riveted forms, and are equipped with rollers to allow the main cables to shift under construction and normal loads.
#''Anchorages'' are constructed, usually in tandem with the towers, to resist the tension of the cables and form as the main anchor system for the entire structure. These are usually anchored in good quality rock, but may consist of massive reinforced concrete deadweights within an excavation. The anchorage structure will have multiple protruding open ''eyebolts'' enclosed within a secure space.
#Temporary suspended walkways, called ''catwalks'', are then erected using a set of guide wires hoisted into place via winches positioned atop the towers. These catwalks follow the curve set by bridge designers for the main cables, in a path mathematically described as a [[catenary]] arc. Typical catwalks are usually between eight and ten feet wide, and are constructed using wire grate and wood slats.
#Gantries are placed upon the catwalks, which will support the main cable spinning reels. Then,  cables attached to winches are installed, and in turn, the main cable spinning devices are installed.
#High strength wire (typically 4 or 6 gauge galvanized steel wire), is pulled in a loop by pulleys on the traveler, with one end affixed at an anchorage. When the traveler reaches the opposite anchorage the loop is placed over an open anchor [[eyebar]]. Along the catwalk, workers also pull the cable wires to their desired tension. This continues until a bundle, called a "cable strand" is completed, and temporarily bundled using stainless steel wire. This process is repeated until the final cable strand is completed. Workers then remove the individual wraps on the cable strands (during the spinning process, the shape of the main cable closely resembles a hexagon), and then the entire cable is then compressed by a traveling hydraulic press into a closely packed cylinder and tightly wrapped with additional wire to form the final circular cross section. The wire used in suspension bridge construction is a galvanized steel wire that has been coated with corrosion inhibitors.
#At specific points along the main cable (each being the exact distance horizontally in relation to the next) devices called "cable bands" are installed to carry steel wire ropes called ''Suspender cables.'' Each suspender cable is engineered and cut to precise lengths, and are looped over the cable bands. In some bridges, where the towers are close to or on the shore, the suspender cables may be applied only to the central span. Early suspender cables were fitted with zinc jewels and a set of steel washers, which formed the support for the deck. Modern suspender cables carry a shackle-type fitting.
#Special lifting hoists attached to the suspenders or from the main cables are used to lift prefabricated sections of bridge deck to the proper level, provided that the local conditions allow the sections to be carried below the bridge by barge or other means.  Otherwise, a traveling [[cantilever]] derrick may be used to extend the deck one section at a time starting from the towers and working outward. If the addition of the deck structure extends from the towers the finished portions of the deck will pitch upward rather sharply, as there is no downward force in the center of the span. Upon completion of the deck the added load will pull the main cables into an arc mathematically described as a [[parabola]], while the arc of the deck will be as the designer intended – usually a gentle upward arc for added clearance if over a shipping channel, or flat in other cases such as a span over a canyon. Arched suspension spans also give the structure more rigidity and strength.
#With completion of the primary structure various details such as lighting, handrails, finish painting and paving are installed or completed.

It "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for [[sustainable development]], provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations official website on SDGs: https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16&lt;/ref&gt; The Goal has 12 targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress towards targets will be measured by 23 indicators. [[File:Sustainable Development Goal 16.png|thumb|SDG 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions]]

== Background ==

=== The Sustainable Development Goals ===
{{See also|Sustainable Development Goals}}
The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 global goals set by the [[United Nations]]. The broad goals are interrelated though each has its own targets to achieve. The total number of targets is 169. The SDGs cover a broad range of social and economic development issues. These include [[poverty]], [[hunger]], [[health]], [[education]], [[climate change]], [[gender equality]], [[Water supply|water,]] [[sanitation]], [[energy]], [[urbanization]], [[Environmental protection|environment]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDGs replace the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), which started a global effort in 2002 to end poverty, achieve universal [[education]], [[Women's empowerment|empower women]], reduce [[child mortality]], improve [[maternal health]], combat diseases such as [[HIV]], ensure environment sustainability, and develop a global partnership for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Outcome Document of the UN Summit on the 2030 Agenda, ‘Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, includes an emphasis on the importance of achieving progress on peaceful and inclusive societies, access to justice and rule of law, and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual report is prepared by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] evaluating the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;See the 2017 report: http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2017/66&amp;Lang=E&lt;/ref&gt; SDG 16 is going to be reviewed at the High-Level Political Forum in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/hlpf|title=High-level Political Forum .:.

== Links with other SDGs ==
The Sustainable Development Goals are not taken as being completely independent one from the other, but rather as being closely linked. In this way, [[media development]] enhances freedom of speech, peace, but also contributes to [[sustainability]], poverty eradication and [[human rights]].&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/fostering-freedom-expression|title=Fostering Freedom of Expression|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fostering peace and inclusive societies can help reduce inequalities (SDG10) and help economies prosper (SDG8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/background.html|title=Background of the Sustainable Development Goals|website=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 outcome document of the United Nations Summit on the 2030 Agenda considers that sustainable development can not be achieved without building peaceful, just and inclusive societies and addressing issues of corruption, poor governance, insecurity and injustice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some SDGs can be considered as cross-cutting as a whole. It is the case for [[gender equality]] and [[Africa]], which are considered a global priority for UNESCO and a "critical factor for the achievement of all internationally agreed development goals".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/africa/

== Achievements ==

=== UNDP ===
The [[United Nations Development Programme]] is the United Nations [[International development|global development]] network who is also concerned with SDG 16 as the Programme focuses on [[Democracy|democratic governance]] and peace building.&lt;ref&gt;See official website: http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/democratic-governance-and-peacebuilding.html&lt;/ref&gt; The UNDP also works on conflict prevention by supporting empowering women and youth, and supporting regulatory frameworks and mechanisms and by acting as mediators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/democratic-governance-and-peacebuilding/conflict-prevention.html|title=Conflict prevention - UNDP|website=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNDP has provided electoral assistance in over 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ec-undp-electoralassistance.org/|title=EC-UNDP Joint Task Force - Partnership on Electoral Assistance|website=www.ec-undp-electoralassistance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO ===
UNESCO’s work on freedom of expression and the [[Safety of Journalists|safety of journalists]] contributes to Goal 16. UNESCO’s approach to media development tries to be knowledge-driven and context-sensitive. The Organization also wants to take into account the new challenges and opportunities of the media environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sdgs/ci|title=Sustainable Development Goals for Communication and Information|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO's communication and information sector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/|title=Communication and Information - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for targets 16.3 (access to justice), 16.5 (anti-corruption and transparent and accountable institutions). It aims to: "foster intercultural dialogue, culture of peace and non-violence, and prevent [[violent extremism]] through global citizenship education; support free, independent and pluralistic media, ensure the safety of journalists; protect cultural and natural heritage, strengthen [[Multi-stakeholder governance|governance]] systems for culture and enhance fundamental freedoms."&lt;ref name="unesco.org1"&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002477/247785e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Preventing violent extremism ====
Preventing [[violent extremism]] is a way to promote, in official wording, a "culture of peace and non-violence" for UNESCO. The Organization aims to prevent violent extremism by using education as a tool to strengthen [[global citizenship]], by mobilizing youth, women and other stakeholders - such as [[policy]]-makers, researchers and media actors -  to take actions, online and offline, to prevent and respond to violent extremism and [[radicalization]] on the Internet&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002603/260382e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and to promote cultural diversity to foster more fair, inclusive and peaceful societies, through the #Unite4Heritage campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unite4heritage.org/|title=#Unite4Heritage – Celebrating &amp; Safeguarding Cultural Heritage - u4h|website=www.unite4heritage.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Educational Programmes on Heritage and Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity|title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unesco.org1"/&gt;

==== Freedom of expression ====
{{Main|Freedom of speech}}
Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the [[freedom]] of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, [[censorship]], or sanction.&lt;ref name="Mill 1859 1-5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1859 |chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/130/1.html |chapter=Introductory |url=http://www.bartleby.com/130/ |title=On Liberty |edition=4th |location=London |publisher=Longman, Roberts &amp; Green |publication-date=1869 |at=para. 5 |quote=Society can and does execute its own mandates ... it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself.

==== Freedom of information laws ====
UNESCO advocates for the creation of national legislation on [[freedom of information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2017/66&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Safety of journalists ====
{{Main|Safety of Journalists}}
Safety of journalists is the ability for [[journalist]]s and media professionals to get, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats. UNESCO's Freedom of Expression Section&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; and [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] (IPDC) develop projects to address issues of safety of journalism and impunity in the field.  [[UNESCO]] also celebrates [[World Press Freedom Day]] every year on May 3 during which the Guillermo Cano Prize&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/prizes/guillermo-cano|title=UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; is attributed to honor the work of an individual or an organization defending or promoting freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/worldpressfreedomday|title=World Press Freedom Day|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== IPDC's follow-up on SDG 16 =====
The [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] is responsible for the follow-up of the SDG 16 through indicators 16.10.1 and 16.10.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/|title=SDG Indicators — SDG Indicators|first=United Nations Statistics|last=Division|website=unstats.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every two years, a report containing information from the Member States on the status of judicial inquiries on each of the killings condemned by UNESCO is submitted to the IPDC Council by UNESCO's Director-General.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002460/246014E.pdf

https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/initiatives&lt;/ref&gt; The journalists safety indicators are a tool developed by UNESCO which, according to UNESCO's website, aims on mapping the key features that can help assess safety of journalists, and help determine whether adequate follow-up is given to crimes committed against them.&lt;ref&gt;For international-level indicators see: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002608/260892E.pdf For national-level indicators see: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002608/260893E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The IPDC Talks also allow the Programme to raise awareness on the importance of [[access to information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/powering-sustainable-development-access-information/about-ipdctalks|title=About the IPDCtalks|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPDC is also the programme that monitors and reports on access to information laws around the world through the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] global report on follow-up to SDGs.

'''''The Art of Biblical Narrative''''' is a 1981 book by [[Robert Alter]]. In it, Alter outlines a literary approach to the [[Hebrew Bible]]. He proposes that "the Bible in its final form constitutes an artistic document with a full texture of interconnected unity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trible|first1=Phyllis|author-link=Phyllis Trible|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Context, Method, and the Book of Jonah|date=1994|publisher=[[Fortress Press]]|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIp0zV_tqaAC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Art of Biblical Narrative'' has been very influential: it "revolutionized the way that scholars read the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiss|first1=Anthony|title=An Alter-ed Perspective on the Bible|url=http://forward.com/articles/146729/an-alter-ed-perspective-on-the-bible/|accessdate=4 September 2016|work=[[The Forward]]|date=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Weitzman suggests that "By the most conventional measures—number of books sold, favorable reviews, frequency of citation—it is hard to imagine a more successful academic book than Alter's ''The Art of Biblical Narrative''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2979/pft.2007.27.2.191| issn = 0272-9601| volume = 27| issue = 2| pages = 191–210| last = Weitzman| first = Steven| title = Before and After The Art of Biblical Narrative| journal = Prooftexts |date = 2007| jstor = 10.2979/pft.2007.27.2.191}} Quotation on p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14364">'''The Interpersonal Gap''' is a model of communication developed by John L. Wallen (March 24, 1918 — July 31, 2001), an educator and a pioneer in the fields of emotional intelligence and interpersonal communication. As Chinmaya &amp; Vargo state in their 1979 paper on Wallen “Many people who conduct interpersonal relations laboratories have been influenced by the ideas of John Wallen, a social psychologist from Portland, Oregon. He has written a number of papers which identify the sources of difficulty in communication. In these writings, Wallen focuses on the process of communication, not the underlying motives, drives, traits, attitudes, or personality characteristics of the individual. Wallen's ideas are easily understandable to laymen and professional alike.”&lt;ref&gt;Chinmaya, A. &amp; Vargo, J.W. (1979). Improving Communication: The Ideas of John Wallen. John Abbott College and the University of Alberta.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from Harvard College in 1940, he earned advance degrees in psychology at Ohio State University, Harvard University and the University of Oregon. Dr. Wallen taught at the University of Maryland and Black Mountain College in North Carolina before moving to Oregon in 1948. In Oregon, he had been director of research at the Boys and Girls Society of Oregon, associate professor at Portland State College, director of the Human Relations and Development Group at Tektronix, and staff member of the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory. He had also been president of the Oregon Psychological Association and fellow of the [[National Training Laboratories]] (NTL) Institute for Applied Behavioral Science in Washington, D.C. It was during his time in Oregon that he developed ''The Interpersonal Gap.''

According to Chinmaya &amp; Vargo, “Wallen…integrated the work of many scholars including Allport (1949), Hayakawa (1964), Heider (1958), Korzybski (1958), [[Lewin]] (1926, 1948, 1951), and Rank (1941, 1968) into a systematic theory of communication.”&lt;ref&gt;Chinmaya, A. &amp; Vargo, J.W. (1979). Improving Communication: The Ideas of John Wallen. John Abbott College and the University of Alberta.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, Wallen’s only known published work was the co-authored book, "Counseling with Returned Servicemen," with [[Carl Rogers]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, C. &amp;  Wallen, J.L. (1946) Counseling with Returned Servicemen. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; He authored numerous unpublished papers, including ''"The Interpersonal Gap"'' in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (1967). The Interpersonal Gap. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallen primarily taught his theories in academic settings (he was training educators). He did so prior to the age of computers. At the time he was of the opinion that "if his ideas are useful, they will spread through personalized channels of communication.”&lt;ref&gt;Chinmaya, A. &amp; Vargo, J.W. (1979). Improving Communication: The Ideas of John Wallen. John Abbott College and the University of Alberta.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he wanted educators to feel free to mimeograph his work and distribute copies. With this in mind, he avoided publishing or copyrighting his work. While this unorthodox approach allowed educators to freely distribute his mimeographed works, it also hampered the spread of his theories outside of the circle of his immediate colleagues in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.

Beginning in the Pacific Northwest, but spreading elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;(Authors not cited) (1977). Leadership: A Process-Not a Position. Washington, DC: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory/National Education Association/National Association of School Counselors.&lt;/ref&gt;
Wallen’s theories were applied extensively to training teachers and faculty in school systems through the publications of the Portland-based Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory. NWREL was directed at the time by Charles Jung. Jung was a student of Ronald Lippitt’s, who in turn was student of [[Kurt Lewin]], the creator of the [[T-group (social psychology)|T-group]] and regarded by many as the father of [[Social Psychology]] and  [[Organization Development]]. Lewin was a major influence on Wallen. Wallen's work was also spread through the extensive publications of another Lippitt student, Richard Schmuck, of the Center for the Advanced Study of Educational Administration at the University of Oregon.

''The Interpersonal Gap'' also became a core theory in the [[T-group (social psychology)|T-group]] and [[Organization Development]] methods of Robert P. Crosby, who worked closely with Dr. Wallen from 1968 to 1975. The two co-led several [[National Training Laboratories]] T-groups during that time. When Mr. Crosby founded the Leadership Institute of Seattle (LIOS) Applied Behavioral Science Graduate Program he made Wallen’s material a core requirement of the curriculum,&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. The Interpersonal Gap: LIOS Models - Readings in Communication Skills. Seattle, WA: The Leadership Institute of Seattle.&lt;/ref&gt; and he did the same when founding and leading the ALCOA Corporate leadership program from 1990 to 2005. During Mr. Crosby’s Organization Development career he used the ''Interpersonal Gap'' model in numerous culture change and performance improvement initiatives, most famously during the PECO Nuclear turnaround following the shutdown [[Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station]] for human performance issues by the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, G. (2015). Fight, Flight, Freeze: Taming Your Reptilian Brain and other Practical Approaches to Self-Improvement. Second Edition. Seattle, WA: CrosbyOD Publishing. Chapters 3 and 4 are dedicated to The Interpersonal Gap and Wallen’s behavioral skills, Chapter 11 to the PECO Nuclear turnaround.&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby and his associates lead Wallen based [[T-groups]], known as "Tough Stuff [[Emotional Intelligence]] in the Workplace" workshops, to this day: http://www.crosbyod.com/events/.

Chinmaya &amp; Vargo conclude their paper thusly: “One of the leaders in the study of the nature and process of communication is John Wallen. John Wallen's ideas have influenced a number of human relations practitioners. The communication skills are especially valuable in that they are easily demonstrated and readily learned by almost anyone. The effects of using the skills are quickly apparent. For these reasons, the concepts presented here can be of great value to teachers, counsellors, parents, spouses, and friends.”&lt;ref&gt;Chinmaya, A. &amp; Vargo, J.W. (1979). Improving Communication: The Ideas of John Wallen. John Abbott College and the University of Alberta.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Theory==

''The Interpersonal Gap'' highlights several core Emotional Intelligence (EQ) skills. For example, Wallen emphasized the role of the receiver when communicating rather than just the sender, counter to most models of communication. As part of the model Wallen identified four key skills (Behavioral Specifics, Feeling Description, Perception Check and Paraphrase)&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (Undated material). Summary of Basic Communication Skills for Improving Interview Performance and Interpersonal Relationships. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; that became the cornerstone of the [[T-group (social psychology)|T-group]] based experiential training developed by Wallen colleague Robert P. Crosby.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, R.P. (1992). Walking the Empowerment Tightrope: Balancing Management Authority &amp; Employee Influence. King of Prussia, PA: Organization Design and Development, Inc. The Interpersonal Gap is included as Appendix O.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to Wallen’s ''Interpersonal Gap'' paper,&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (1967). The Interpersonal Gap. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; “The most basic and recurring problems in social life stem from what you intend and the actual effect of your actions on others.” As described in the self-improvement book Fight, Flight, Freeze, “Wallen’s theory is that each of us has intentions in every interaction (we intend a certain impact), we translate (or encode) our intentions into words and actions, the people we are interacting with translate (decode) our words and actions, and the decoding determines the initial emotional impact on them,”&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, G. (2015). Fight, Flight, Freeze: Taming Your Reptilian Brain and other Practical Approaches to Self-Improvement. Second Edition. Seattle, WA: CrosbyOD Publishing. Chapters 3 and 4 are dedicated to The Interpersonal Gap and Wallen’s behavioral skills, Chapter 11 to the PECO Nuclear turnaround.&lt;/ref&gt; as illustrated in the following graph: [[File:Interpersonal Gap Large.png|thumb|The Interpersonal Gap by John L. Wallen]]

*Note: Dr. Wallen did not use the word “filter” (rather he spoke of each person’s unique method of encoding and decoding) nor did he use the behaviors outlined in [[Albert Mehrabian]]’s famous study (words, tone of voice, body language). Both additions come from the work of Robert P. Crosby and his associates. This graphic is reprinted from Fight, Flight, Freeze with the author’s permission.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, G. (2015). Fight, Flight, Freeze: Taming Your Reptilian Brain and other Practical Approaches to Self-Improvement. Second Edition. Seattle, WA: CrosbyOD Publishing. Chapters 3 and 4 are dedicated to The Interpersonal Gap and Wallen’s behavioral skills.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wallen’s model there is ample potential for misunderstanding at any step in the process, beginning with understanding yourself - that is, with having clarity about what impact you really want in any given interaction. Such misunderstandings are what Wallen refers to as a “gap.” As he puts it, “Interpersonal gap refers to the degree of congruence between one person’s intentions and the effect produced in the other. If the effect is what is intended, the gap has been bridged. If the effect is the opposite of what was intended, the gap has become greater.”&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (1967). The Interpersonal Gap. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallen goes on to say, “We see our own actions in the light of our own intentions, but we see the other’s actions not in the light of the other person’s intentions but in the effect on us.”&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (1967). The Interpersonal Gap. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ''The Interpersonal Gap'' indicates that we each know ourselves by our own intentions (for example, when we have been misunderstood, we know what we meant). We know others by our interpretations. Wallen’s perspective contrasts with the dominant cultural paradigm that says “I know you by your actions.” If that were true, then the problem is "your actions" (i.e., the other person must change). ''The Interpersonal Gap'' in contrast points inward: if my interpretation is potentially the problem (i.e., I may have taken the other’s action differently than intended) if I change my interpretation or at least consider other possible intentions behind the same actions, I change my own reaction. To learn what the other person intended Wallen advocates using specific behavioral skills&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (Undated material). Summary of Basic Communication Skills for Improving Interview Performance and Interpersonal Relationships. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; combined with a ''genuine'' intent of understanding the other(the importance of being genuine in one's intention to close gaps is one reflection of the influence of [[Carl Rogers]] on Wallen's work).&lt;ref&gt;Wallen, J.L. (1967). The Interpersonal Gap. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sum, Wallen’s model postulates that we create our own reactions/emotional responses through our interpretations of others. He held that misunderstandings were the cause of most conflict, and that such conflict can be prevented or resolved through understanding the process of communication, and through situational application of specific skills.

'''Wallen identified four behavioral skills with which to close interpersonal gaps. G. Crosby described them this way:&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, G. (2015). Fight, Flight, Freeze: Taming Your Reptilian Brain and other Practical Approaches to Self-Improvement. Second Edition. Seattle, WA: CrosbyOD Publishing. Chapters 3 and 4 are dedicated to The Interpersonal Gap and Wallen’s behavioral skills.&lt;/ref&gt;'''

[[File:TheTwoCultures.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Oxford University Press|OUP]])]]
'''''The Two Cultures''''' is the first part of an influential 1959 [[Rede Lecture]] by [[United Kingdom|British]] scientist and novelist [[C. P. Snow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Snow| first= Charles Percy | title = The Two Cultures |year=2001 | origyear = 1959 |publisher=Cambridge University Press| location= London | isbn = 978-0-521-45730-9 | page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = TLS /&gt; Its thesis was that "the intellectual life of the whole of western society" was split into the titular two cultures – namely the [[science]]s and the [[humanities]] – and that this was a major hindrance to solving the world's problems.

'''''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''''' (1959) was a published version of the lectures in book form. 

==The lecture==
The talk was delivered 7 May 1959 in the [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]], Cambridge, and subsequently published as ''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''. The lecture and book expanded upon an article by Snow published in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' of 6 October 1956, also entitled ''The Two Cultures''.{{Sfn | Snow | 2013}}  Published in book form, Snow's lecture was widely read and discussed on both sides of the Atlantic, leading him to write a 1963 follow-up, ''The Two Cultures: And a Second Look: An Expanded Version of The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Two Cultures: And a Second Look: An Expanded Version of The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution |last=Snow |first=Charles Percy |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow's position can be summed up by an often-repeated part of the essay:
{{Quote |A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of: ''Have you read a work of [[Shakespeare]]'s?''&lt;ref name= Nature&gt;{{cite journal |title=Across the Great Divide |journal=Nature Physics |year=2009 |volume=5 |issue=5 |page=309 |url = http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n5/full/nphys1258.html |doi= 10.1038/nphys1258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I now believe that if I had asked an even simpler question – such as, What do you mean by [[mass]], or [[acceleration]], which is the scientific equivalent of saying, ''Can you read?'' – not more than one in ten of the highly educated would have felt that I was speaking the same language. So the great edifice of modern [[physics]] goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the [[western world]] have about as much insight into it as their [[neolithic]] ancestors would have had.&lt;ref name=Nature /&gt;}}

In 2008, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' included ''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution'' in its list of the 100 books that most influenced Western public discourse since the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name = TLS&gt;{{cite news| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5418361.ece | location = London | work= The Times | title= The hundred most influential books since the war | date=30 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow's Rede Lecture condemned the [[British education]]al system as having, since the [[Victorian era]], over-rewarded the humanities (especially [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) at the expense of scientific and [[engineering]] education, despite such achievements having been so decisive in winning the [[Second World War]] for the Allies.&lt;ref name=Jardine&gt;{{cite journal | title = CP Snow's Two Cultures Revisited | last = Jardine | first = Lisa | authorlink = Lisa Jardine | journal = Christ's College Magazine | year = 2010 | pages = 48–57 | format = PDF | url = http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/cms_misc/media/Publications_Christs_Magazine_2010_web.pdf | accessdate = 2012-02-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120417151018/http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/cms_misc/media/Publications_Christs_Magazine_2010_web.pdf | archivedate = 17 April 2012 | df = dmy-all }} Jardine's 2009 C. P. Snow Lecture honored the 50th anniversary of Snow's Rede Lecture. She places Snow's lecture into its historical context, and emphasizes the expansion of certain elements of the Rede Lecture in Snow's Godkin Lectures at Harvard University in 1960. These were ultimately published as {{cite book |title = Science and Government |publisher=New American Library |year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in practice deprived British [[elite]]s (in politics, administration, and industry) of adequate preparation to manage the modern scientific world. By contrast, Snow said, [[German education|German]] and [[American schools]] sought to prepare their citizens equally in the sciences and humanities, and better scientific teaching enabled these countries' rulers to compete more effectively in a scientific age. Later discussion of ''The Two Cultures'' tended to obscure Snow's initial focus on differences between British systems (of both schooling and [[social class]]) and those of competing countries.&lt;ref name=Jardine /&gt;

== Implications and influence ==
The literary critic [[F. R. Leavis]] called Snow a "public relations man" for the scientific establishment in his essay ''Two Cultures?: The Significance of C. P. Snow'', published in ''[[The Spectator]]''.  The article attracted a great deal of negative correspondence in the magazine's letters pages.&lt;ref name=kimball&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kimball |first=Roger |url = http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-The-Two-Cultures--today-4882 |title=The Two Cultures' today: On the C. P. Snow–F. R. Leavis controversy | journal=[[The New Criterion]] |date=12 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1963 book Snow appeared to revise his thinking and was more optimistic about the potential of a mediating third culture.  This concept was later picked up in {{Citation | year = 1995 | title = The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution | author-link = John Brockman (literary agent)| first = John | last = Brockman| title-link = The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution }}. Introducing the reprinted {{Citation | title = The Two Cultures | year = 1993}}, [[Stefan Collini]]{{Sfn | Collini | 1993 | p = lv}} has argued that the passage of time has done much to reduce the cultural divide Snow noticed, but has not removed it entirely.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s ''[[The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox]]'' provides a different perspective. Assuming the [[dialectical]] interpretation, it argues that Snow's concept of "two cultures" is not only off the mark, it is a damaging and short-sighted viewpoint, and that it has perhaps led to decades of unnecessary fence-building.

[[Simon Critchley]], in ''Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction'' suggests:{{Sfn | Critchley | 2001 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=syhsLJ1eMOEC&amp;pg=PA49  49]}}
{{Quote |[Snow] diagnosed the loss of a common culture and the emergence of two distinct cultures: those represented by scientists on the one hand and those Snow termed 'literary intellectuals' on the other. If the former are in favour of social reform and progress through science, technology and industry, then intellectuals are what Snow terms 'natural [[Luddites]]' in their understanding of and sympathy for advanced industrial society. In [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]]'s terms, the division is between [[Jeremy Bentham|Benthamites]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridgeans]].|Simon Critchley}}

That is, Critchley argues that what Snow said represents a resurfacing of a discussion current in the mid-nineteenth century. Critchley describes the Leavis contribution to the making of a controversy as "a vicious ''ad hominem'' attack"; going on to describe the debate as "a familiar clash in English cultural history" citing also [[T. H. Huxley]] and [[Matthew Arnold]].{{Sfn | Critchley | 2001 | p = 51}}{{Sfn | Collini | 1993 | p = xxxv}}

In his opening address at the [[Munich Security Conference]] in January 2014, the Estonian president [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] said that the current problems related to security and freedom in cyberspace are the culmination of absence of dialogue between "the two cultures": "Today, bereft of understanding of fundamental issues and writings in the development of liberal democracy, computer geeks devise ever better ways to track people... simply because they can and it's cool. Humanists on the other hand do not understand the underlying technology and are convinced, for example, that tracking meta-data means the government reads their emails."&lt;ref&gt;Ilves, Toomas Hendrik: "[http://www.president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/9796-qrebooting-trust-freedom-vs-security-in-cyberspaceq/index.html Rebooting Trust? Freedom vs Security in Cyberspace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223112412/http://www.president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/9796-qrebooting-trust-freedom-vs-security-in-cyberspaceq/index.html |date=23 February 2014 }}" Opening address at Munich Security Conference Cyber 31 January 2014. 31.01.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antecedents==
Contrasting scientific and humanistic knowledge is a repetition of the ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' of 1890 German universities.&lt;ref name="Brint2002p212"&gt;{{Citation | last = Brint | first = Steven G | year = 2002 | title = The Future of the City of Intellect: The Changing American University | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDfrzER0obYC&amp;pg=PA212 | pages = 212–3 | quote = positivism-versus-interpretation language [...] these fractal distinctions are generally quite old. Most of them have been around at least since the celebrated ''Methodenstreit'' of the German universities in the late nineteenth century. CP Snow's "two cultures" argument captures a later instantiation of them. [...] In negotiating the complexities of social scientific and humanistic knowledge, it is extremely helpful to have a dichotomy like positivism versus interpretation, because it saves our having to remember the exact degree of positivism of any scholarly group. [...] Every single social science discipline has internal debates about positivism/interpretation, narrative/analysis, and so on. The narrative/analytic debate may look very different in economics, anthropology, and English. But underneath all the surface differences it is quite similar.| isbn = 9780804745314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A quarrel in 1911 between [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Giovanni Gentile]] on the one hand and [[Federigo Enriques]] on the other one [https://books.google.it/books?id=oXjMYIonXTYC&amp;pg=PA422&amp;lpg=PA422&amp;dq=1911+croce+gentile+enriques+fight&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y-I3OzBiJi&amp;sig=KYsoohR9-x53CW8pBXJbYflTqGU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjzrcu80JDeAhWKk4sKHUdaCgEQ6AEwD3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false is believed] to have had enduring effects in the separation of the two cultures in Italy and to the predominance of the views of (objective) idealism over those of (logical) positivism. In the social sciences it is also commonly proposed as the quarrel of [[positivism]] versus [[Antipositivism|interpretivism]].&lt;ref name="Brint2002p212" /&gt;

'''Tonic''' in physiology refers to a physiological response which is slow and may be graded.  This term is typically used in opposition to a fast response.  For instance, tonic muscles are contrasted by the more typical and much faster twitch muscles, while tonic sensory nerve endings are contrasted to the much faster [[Sensory neuron#Rate of adaptation|phasic]] sensory nerve endings.

==Tonic muscles==
Tonic muscles are much slower than twitch fibers in terms of time from stimulus to full activation, time to full relaxation upon cessation of stimuli, and maximal shortening velocity.&lt;ref name="Kardong"&gt;Kardong, K. 2008. Vertebrates: Comparative Anatomy, Function, Evolution. 5th edition. McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math. {{ISBN|978-0-07-304058-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These muscles are rarely found in mammals (only in the muscles moving the eye and in the middle ear), but are common in reptiles and amphibians.&lt;ref name="Kardong"/&gt;

==Tonic sensory receptors==
Tonic sensory input adapts slowly to a stimulus&lt;ref name = caspar&gt;http://caspar.bgsu.edu/~courses/Glossary.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to produce [[action potential]]s over the duration of the stimulus.&lt;ref name="mentor"&gt;Dawson, M., Schell, A., &amp; Filion, D. (2007). The Electrodermal System. In J. Cacioppo, L. Tassinary, &amp; G. Berntson (Eds.), ''Handbook of Psychophysiology'' (pp. 159-181). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way it conveys information about the duration of the stimulus.  In contrast, phasic receptors adapt rapidly to a stimulus. The response of the cell diminishes very quickly and then stops.&lt;ref name = caspar /&gt; It does not provide information on the duration of the stimulus;&lt;ref name = mentor /&gt; instead some of them convey information on rapid changes in stimulus intensity and rate.&lt;ref name=frank&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frank.mtsu.edu/~jshardo/bly2010/nervous/receptor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803215836/http://frank.mtsu.edu/~jshardo/bly2010/nervous/receptor.html |archivedate=2008-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a tonic receptor is the [[Ruffini corpuscle]].

A tonic receptor is a sensory receptor that adapts slowly to a stimulus and continues to produce action potentials over the duration of the stimulus. In this way it conveys information about the duration of the stimulus. Some tonic receptors are permanently active and indicate a background level. Examples of such tonic receptors are pain receptors, joint capsule, and muscle spindle.&lt;ref name="mentor" /&gt;

'''Torque density''' is a measure of the torque-carrying capability of a mechanical component. It is the ratio of torque capability to volume and is expressed in units of torque per volume.  Torque density is a system [[property]] since it depends on the design of each element of the component being examined and their interconnection.  

Torque density is useful during the [[concept]] evaluation stage of mechanical [[design]]s, especially in [[power train]] design problems. Typically, it will be one of many factors used to assign potential success measures to each concept. For example, in the upgrade of a drive train for a set of rolls in a [[rolling mill]], space is often dictated by the configuration of current components.  There may be several types of devices that can perform the function of an existing component that must be replaced. The relative torque densities of the devices may be an important determinant for which design is ultimately selected, although it will often compete with other factors such as cost, ease of maintenance, time to install, operating costs and potential failure modes.

==Units==
In [[SI|SI units]], torque density is expressed in [[joule]]s per [[cubic metre]] or equivalently [[newton (unit)|newton]]-[[metre]]s per [[cubic metre]] (though dimensionally equivalent to the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]], that is usually not used for this purpose). Small amounts can be expressed in newton-[[millimetre]]s per cubic millimetre. 

In [[U.S. customary units]], torque density is expressed in [[foot-pound force|foot-pounds force]] per cubic foot, or [[inch]]-pounds force per cubic inch or [[pound-force|ounce-force]] inches per cubic inch.

The '''triquetrum''' (derived from the Latin ''tri-'' ["three"] and ''quetrum'' ["cornered"]) was the medieval name for an ancient [[astronomical]] instrument first described by [[Ptolemy]]  (''c.'' 90–''c.'' 168) in the ''[[Almagest]]'' (V. 12). Also known as ''Parallactic Rulers'', it was used for determining altitudes of heavenly bodies. Ptolemy  calls it a "''parallactic instrument''" and seems to have used it to determine the [[zenith distance]] and [[parallax]] of the [[Moon]].&lt;ref name="kelley1"&gt;Kelley, D., Milone, E., (2005), ''Exploring Ancient Skies: An Encyclopedic Survey of Archaeoastronomy'', pages 77-79.

Xulon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published-inline|date=April 2012}}

==Design==
The triquetrum performed the same function as the [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and was devised to overcome the difficulty of graduating arcs and circles. It consisted of a vertical post with a graduated scale and two pivoted arms hinged at the top and bottom, the upper arm carrying sights. The two arms were joined so that their ends could slide. As a person sighted along the upper arm, the lower one changed its angle. By reading the position of the lower rod, in combination with the vertical length, the [[zenith distance]] (or, alternatively, the [[altitude]]) of a [[celestial object]] could be calculated.&lt;ref name="kelley1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, R., (2004), ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance'', page 225. Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
The triquetrum was one of the most popular astronomical instruments until the invention of the telescope, it could measure angles with a better precision than the [[astrolabe]].&lt;ref name="gassendi1"/&gt; [[Copernicus]] describes its use in the fourth book of the ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (1543) under the heading "''Instrumenti parallactici constructio''."&lt;ref name="gassendi1"/&gt; The instrument was also used by [[Tycho Brahe]]&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, J., (2000), ''On Tycho's Island: Tycho Brahe and His Assistants, 1570-1601'', pages 73-75. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in the same century.

'''Vitalism''' is the belief that "living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things".&lt;ref name=Bechtel&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm |author=Bechtel, William; Williamson, Robert C. |year=1998 |title=Vitalism |editor=E.

In the 18th and 19th centuries vitalism was [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|discussed among biologists]], between those who felt that the known mechanics of physics would eventually explain the difference between life and non-life and vitalists who argued that the processes of life could not be reduced to a mechanistic process. Some vitalist biologists proposed [[Falsifiability|testable hypotheses]] meant to show inadequacies with mechanistic explanations, but these experiments failed to provide support for vitalism. Biologists now consider vitalism in this sense to have been refuted by [[Scientific evidence|empirical evidence]], and hence regard it as a [[Superseded scientific theories|superseded scientific theory]].&lt;ref name="Williams2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Elizabeth Ann |title=A Cultural History of Medical Vitalism in Enlightenment Montpellier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AvqYl4sdwaYC&amp;pg=PA4 |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=978-0-7546-0881-3 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitalism has a long history in [[medical]] philosophies: many [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces.

== History ==

===Ancient times===
The notion that bodily functions are due to a vitalistic principle existing in all living creatures has roots going back at least to ancient [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jidenu, Paulin (1996) ''African Philosophy, 2nd Ed.'' Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-21096-8}}, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek philosophy]], the [[Milesian school]] proposed natural explanations [[deductive argument|deduced]] from [[materialism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]. However, by the time of [[Lucretius]], this account was supplemented, (for example, by the unpredictable ''[[clinamen]]'' of [[Epicurus]]), and in [[Stoic physics]], the ''[[pneuma]]'' assumed the role of ''[[logos]]''. [[Galen]] believed the lungs draw pneuma from the air, which the blood communicates throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;Birch, Charles; Cobb, John B. ''The Liberation of Life: From the Cell to the Community'', 1985, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
In Europe, medieval physics was influenced by the idea of pneuma, helping to shape later [[aether theories]].

===Early modern===
Vitalists included English anatomist [[Francis Glisson]] (1597–1677) and the Italian doctor [[Marcello Malpighi]] (1628–1694).&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76"&gt;Birch, Charles; Cobb, John B. ''The Liberation of Life: From the Cell to the Community'', 1985, pp. 76–78&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caspar Friedrich Wolff]] (1733–1794) is considered to be the father of [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]] in [[embryology]], that is, he marks the point when embryonic development began to be described in terms of the proliferation of cells rather than the incarnation of a preformed soul. However, this degree of empirical observation was not matched by a mechanistic philosophy: in his ''[[Theoria Generationis]]'' (1759), he tried to explain the emergence of the organism by the actions of a ''vis essentialis'' (an organizing, formative force), stating "All believers in epigenesis are vitalists." [[Carl Reichenbach]] (1788–1869) later developed the theory of [[Odic force]], a form of life-energy that permeates living things.

In the 17th century, modern science responded to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[action at a distance]] and the mechanism of [[Cartesian dualism]] with vitalist theories: that whereas the chemical transformations undergone by non-living substances are reversible, so-called "organic" matter is permanently altered by chemical transformations (such as cooking).&lt;ref name=Ede/&gt;

[[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] was influential in establishing epigenesis in the life sciences in 1781 with his publication of ''Über den Bildungstrieb und das Zeugungsgeschäfte''. Blumenbach cut up freshwater ''[[Hydra (zoology)|Hydra]]'' and established that the removed parts would regenerate. He inferred the presence of a "formative drive" (''Bildungstrieb'') in living matter. But he pointed out that this name, "like names applied to every other kind of vital power, of itself, explains nothing: it serves merely to designate a peculiar power formed by the combination of the mechanical principle with that which is susceptible of modification". In the early 18th century, the physicians [[Marie François Xavier Bichat]] and [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] recognized a "living principle" in addition to mechanics.&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76" /&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis Pasteur]] argued that only life could catalyse [[fermentation]]. Painting by [[Albert Edelfelt]], 1885]]
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

[[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], one of the early 19th century fathers of modern [[chemistry]], argued that a regulative force must exist within living matter to maintain its functions.&lt;ref name=Ede&gt;Ede, Andrew. (2007) ''The Rise and Decline of Colloid Science in North America, 1900–1935: The Neglected Dimension'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Vitalist chemists predicted that organic materials could not be synthesized from inorganic components, but [[Friedrich Wöhler]] synthesised [[urea]] from inorganic components in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&amp;ProduktNr=223979&amp;Ausgabe=225203&amp;ArtikelNr=13463&amp;filename=13463.pdf Vitalism and Synthesis of Urea]&lt;/ref&gt; However, contemporary accounts do not support the common belief that vitalism died when Wöhler made urea. This ''Wöhler Myth'', as historian Peter Ramberg called it, originated from a popular history of chemistry published in 1931, which, "ignoring all pretense of historical accuracy, turned Wöhler into a crusader who made attempt after attempt to synthesize a natural product that would refute vitalism and lift the veil of ignorance, until 'one afternoon the miracle happened'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioethicsjournal.com/past/cheng.html ''The Real Death of Vitalism: Implications of the Wöhler Myth'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schummer, J. http://www.joachimschummer.net/papers/2003_NatureChemistry_SHPS.pdf, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1845, [[Adolph Kolbe]] succeeded in making acetic acid from inorganic compounds, and in the 1850s, [[Marcellin Berthelot]] repeated this feat for numerous organic compounds. In retrospect, Wöhler's work was the beginning of the end of Berzelius's vitalist hypothesis, but only in retrospect, as Ramberg had shown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1833 and 1844, [[Johannes Peter Müller]] wrote a book on [[physiology]] called ''Handbuch der Physiologie'', which became the leading textbook in the field for much of the nineteenth century. The book showed Müller's commitments to vitalism; he questioned why organic matter differs from inorganic, then proceeded to chemical analyses of the blood and lymph. He describes in detail the circulatory, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, endocrine, nervous, and sensory systems in a wide variety of animals but explains that the presence of a [[soul]] makes each organism an indivisible whole. He also claimed the behavior of light and sound waves showed that living organisms possessed a life-energy for which physical laws could never fully account.&lt;ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2015}} http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/pdfgen/essays/enc22.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) after his famous rebuttal of [[spontaneous generation]], performed several experiments that he felt supported vitalism. According to Bechtel, Pasteur "fitted fermentation into a more general programme describing special reactions that only occur in living organisms. These are irreducibly vital phenomena." Rejecting the claims of Berzelius, [[Liebig]], [[Moritz Traube|Traube]] and others that fermentation resulted from chemical agents or catalysts within cells, Pasteur concluded that fermentation was a "vital action".&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt;

===20th century===

[[Hans Driesch]] (1867–1941) interpreted his experiments as showing that life is not run by physicochemical laws.&lt;ref name="DevBio"&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2015}}[http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=10&amp;id=110 Developmental Biology 8e Online: A Selective History of Induction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031180529/http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=10&amp;id=110 |date=2006-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main argument was that when one cuts up an embryo after its first division or two, each part grows into a complete adult. Driesch's reputation as an experimental biologist deteriorated as a result of his vitalistic theories, which scientists have seen since his time as pseudoscience.&lt;ref name="DevBio" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ps&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sebastian Normandin |author2=Charles T.

{{quote|It would be ahistorical to ridicule vitalists. When one reads the writings of one of the leading vitalists like Driesch one is forced to agree with him that many of the basic problems of biology simply cannot be solved by a philosophy as that of Descartes, in which the organism is simply considered a machine... The logic of the critique of the vitalists was impeccable.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr E (2002) ''The Walter Arndt Lecture: The Autonomy of Biology'', adapted for the internet, on {{cite web |url=http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01_2/autonomy.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926210457/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01_2/autonomy.htm |archivedate=2006-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|Vitalism has become so disreputable a belief in the last fifty years that no biologist alive today would want to be classified as a vitalist.

Other vitalists included [[Johannes Reinke]] and [[Oscar Hertwig]]. Reinke used the word ''neovitalism'' to describe his work, claiming that it would eventually be verified through experimentation, and that it was an improvement over the other vitalistic theories. The work of Reinke influenced [[Carl Jung]].&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Richard. "Jung's Concept of Die Dominanten (The Dominants)". https://www.academia.edu/6789277/Jungs_concept_of_die_Dominanten_the_Dominants_1997_&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Scott Haldane]] adopted an anti-mechanist approach to biology and an [[idealist]] philosophy early on in his career. Haldane saw his work as a vindication of his belief that [[teleology]] was an essential concept in biology. His views became widely known with his first book ''Mechanism, life and personality'' in 1913.&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168"&gt;Bowler, Peter J. Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Haldane borrowed arguments from the vitalists to use against mechanism; however, he was not a vitalist. Haldane treated the organism as fundamental to biology: "we perceive the organism as a self-regulating entity", "every effort to analyze it into components that can be reduced to a mechanical explanation violates this central experience".&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168" /&gt; The work of Haldane was an influence on [[organicism]].

Haldane also stated that a purely mechanist interpretation can not account for the characteristics of life. Haldane wrote a number of books in which he attempted to show the invalidity of both vitalism and mechanist approaches to science. Haldane explained:

{{quote|We must find a different theoretical basis of biology, based on the observation that all the phenomena concerned tend towards being so coordinated that they express what is normal for an adult organism.|&lt;ref name="Mark A. Bedau 2010, p. 95" /&gt;}}

By 1931, biologists had "almost unanimously abandoned vitalism as an acknowledged belief."&lt;ref name="Mark A. Bedau 2010, p. 95"&gt;Bedau, Mark A.; Cleland, Carol E. ''The Nature of Life: Classical and Contemporary Perspectives from Philosophy and Science'', 2010, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergentism ==
{{main|Emergentism}}

Some aspects of contemporary science make reference to [[emergence|emergent processes]]; those in which the properties of a system cannot be fully described in terms of the properties of the constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schultz | first1=S.G. | title=A century of (epithelial) transport physiology: from vitalism to molecular cloning | journal=The American Journal of Physiology | volume=274 | issue=1 Pt 1 | pages=C13–23 | year=1998 | pmid=9458708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gilbert | first1=S.F. | last2=Sarkar | first2=S. | title=Embracing complexity: organicism for the 21st century | journal=Developmental Dynamics | volume=219 | issue=1 | pages=1–9 | year=2000 | pmid=10974666 | doi=10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999&lt;::AID-DVDY1036&gt;3.0.CO;2-A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because the properties of the constituents are not fully understood, or because the interactions between the individual constituents are also important for the behavior of the system.

Whether emergence should be grouped with traditional vitalist concepts is a matter of semantic controversy.&lt;ref&gt;see "Emergent Properties" in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. online at [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/ Stanford University] for explicit discussion; briefly, some philosophers see emergentism as midway between traditional spiritual vitalism and mechanistic reductionism; others argue that, structurally, emergentism is equivalent to vitalism. See also Emmeche C (2001) Does a robot have an Umwelt? ''Semiotica'' 134: 653–693 [http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/2001d.robumwelt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emmeche ''et al.'' (1997):

{{quote|On the one hand, many scientists and philosophers regard emergence as having only a pseudo-scientific status. On the other hand, new developments in physics, biology, psychology, and cross-disciplinary fields such as cognitive science, artificial life, and the study of non-linear dynamical systems have focused strongly on the high level 'collective behaviour' of complex systems, which is often said to be truly emergent, and the term is increasingly used to characterize such systems.|&lt;ref name="Emmeche 1997"&gt;Emmeche C (1997) Explaining Emergence: towards an ontology of levels. ''Journal for General Philosophy of Science'' [http://alf.nbi.dk/~emmeche/coPubl/97e.EKS/emerg.html available online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006171903/http://alf.nbi.dk/~emmeche/coPubl/97e.EKS/emerg.html |date=2006-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Emmeche ''et al.'' (1998) state that "there is a very important difference between the vitalists and the emergentists: the vitalist's creative forces were relevant only in organic substances, not in inorganic matter. Emergence hence is creation of new properties regardless of the substance involved." "The assumption of an extra-physical vitalis (vital force, [[entelechy]], [[élan vital]], etc.), as formulated in most forms (old or new) of vitalism, is usually without any genuine explanatory power. It has served altogether too often as an intellectual tranquilizer or verbal sedative—stifling scientific inquiry rather than encouraging it to proceed in new directions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 Dictionary of the History of Ideas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511191629/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 |date=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mesmerism ==
{{main|Animal magnetism}}
[[File:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Mesmer]] proposed the vitalist force of ''[[animal magnetism|magnétisme animal]]'' in animals with breath.]]

A popular vitalist theory of the 18th century was "[[animal magnetism]]", in the theories of [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734–1815). However, the use of the (conventional) English term ''animal magnetism'' to translate Mesmer's '''magnétisme animal''' can be misleading for three reasons:
* Mesmer chose his term to clearly distinguish his variant of ''magnetic'' force from those referred to, at that time, as ''mineral magnetism'', ''cosmic magnetism'' and ''planetary magnetism''.
* Mesmer felt that this particular force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.
* Mesmer chose the word "''animal''," for its root meaning (from Latin ''animus''="breath") specifically to identify his force as a quality that belonged to all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans '''and''' animals.

Mesmer's ideas became so influential that King [[Louis XVI]] of France appointed two commissions to investigate [[mesmerism]]; one was led by [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], the other, led by [[Benjamin Franklin]], included [[Jean Sylvain Bailly|Bailly]] and [[Lavoisier]]. The commissioners learned about Mesmeric theory, and saw its patients fall into fits and [[trance]]s. In Franklin's garden, a patient was led to each of five trees, one of which had been "mesmerized"; he hugged each in turn to receive the "vital fluid," but fainted at the foot of a 'wrong' one. At Lavoisier's house, four normal cups of water were held before a "sensitive" woman; the fourth produced convulsions, but she calmly swallowed the mesmerized contents of a fifth, believing it to be plain water. The commissioners concluded that "the fluid without imagination is powerless, whereas imagination without the fluid can produce the effects of the fluid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Best | first1=M. | last2=Neuhauser | first2=D. | last3=Slavin | first3=L. | title=Evaluating Mesmerism, Paris, 1784: the controversy over the blinded placebo controlled trials has not stopped | url=http://qhc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/12/3/232 | journal=Quality &amp; safety in health care | volume=12 | issue=3 | pages=232–3 | year=2003 | pmid=12792017 | pmc=1743715 | doi=10.1136/qhc.12.3.232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical philosophies ==

Vitalism has a long history in [[medical]] philosophies: many [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces. In the Western tradition founded by [[Hippocrates]], these vital forces were associated with the [[four temperaments]] and [[The four humours|humours]]; Eastern traditions posited an imbalance or blocking of [[qi]] or [[prana]]. One example of a similar notion in Africa is the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] concept of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. Today forms of vitalism continue to exist as philosophical positions or as tenets in some religious traditions.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[Complementary and alternative medicine]] therapies include [[energy therapy|energy therapies]],&lt;ref name="titleComplementary and Alternative Medicine – U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/subjects24.html |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine – U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual |accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with vitalism, especially biofield therapies such as [[therapeutic touch]], [[Reiki]], external [[qi]], [[chakra]] healing and SHEN therapy.&lt;ref name="Rubik"&gt;Rubik, ''Bioenergetic Medicines'', American Medical Student Association Foundation, viewed 28 November 2006, {{cite web |url=http://www.amsa.org/ICAM/C6.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214125248/https://www.amsa.org/ICAM/C6.doc |archivedate=2006-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these therapies, the "[[subtle energy]]" field of a patient is manipulated by a  practitioner. The subtle energy is held to exist beyond the electromagnetic energy produced by the heart and brain. Beverly Rubik describes the biofield as a "complex, dynamic, extremely weak EM field within and around the human body...."&lt;ref name="Rubik" /&gt;

The founder of [[homeopathy]], [[Samuel Hahnemann]], promoted an immaterial, vitalistic view of disease: "...they are solely spirit-like (dynamic) derangements of the spirit-like power (the vital principle) that animates the human body." The view of disease as a dynamic disturbance of the immaterial and dynamic vital force is taught in many homeopathic colleges and constitutes a fundamental principle for many contemporary practising homeopaths.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Criticism ==
[[File:Pierre Mignard - Portrait de Jean-Baptiste Poquelin dit Molière (1622-1673) - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|The 17th century French playwright [[Molière]] mocked vitalism in his 1673 play ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]''.]]

Vitalism has sometimes been criticized as begging the question by inventing a name. [[Molière]] had famously parodied this fallacy in ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'', where a quack "answers" the question of "Why does [[opium]] cause sleep?" with "Because of its '''dormitive virtue''' (i.e., [[soporific]] power)."&lt;ref name="fr.wikisource.org"&gt;'' Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire.'' [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Malade_imaginaire_-_3%C3%A8me_interm%C3%A8de Le Malade imaginaire, (French Wikisource)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] compared vitalism to stating that water is the way it is because of its "aquosity".&lt;ref name="The Physical Basis of Life"&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/comm/PMG/PBofL.html The Physical Basis of Life], ''Pall Mall Gazette'', 1869&lt;/ref&gt; His grandson [[Julian Huxley]] in 1926 compared "vital force" or ''élan vital'' to explaining a railroad locomotive's operation by its ''élan locomotif'' ("locomotive force").

Another criticism is that vitalists have failed to rule out mechanistic explanations. This is rather obvious in retrospect for [[organic chemistry]] and [[developmental biology]], but the criticism goes back at least a century. In 1912, [[Jacques Loeb]] published ''The Mechanistic Conception of Life'', in which he described experiments on how a sea urchin could have a pin for its father, as [[Bertrand Russell]] put it (''Religion and Science''). He offered this challenge:

: "... we must either succeed in producing living matter artificially, or we must find the reasons why this is impossible." (pp.&amp;nbsp;5–6)

Loeb addressed vitalism more explicitly:

: "It is, therefore, unwarranted to continue the statement that in addition to the acceleration of oxidations the beginning of individual life is determined by the entrance of a metaphysical "life principle" into the egg; and that death is determined, aside from the cessation of oxidations, by the departure of this "principle" from the body. In the case of the evaporation of water we are satisfied with the explanation given by the kinetic theory of gases and do not demand that to repeat a well-known jest of Huxley the disappearance of the "aquosity" be also taken into consideration." (pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15)

Bechtel states that vitalism "is often viewed as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]], and therefore a pernicious metaphysical doctrine."&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt; For many scientists, "vitalist" theories were unsatisfactory "holding positions" on the pathway to mechanistic understanding. In 1967, [[Francis Crick]], the co-discoverer of the structure of [[DNA]], stated "And so to those of you who may be vitalists I would make this prophecy: what everyone believed yesterday, and you believe today, only [[Crank (person)|cranks]] will believe tomorrow."&lt;ref name="Crick"&gt;Crick, Francis (1967) ''Of Molecules and Men''; Great Minds Series Prometheus Books 2004, reviewed [http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/reviews/crickandkurtz.htm here]. Crick's remark is cited and discussed in: Hein H (2004) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/m821384707h6h254/fulltext.pdf Molecular biology vs. organicism: The enduring dispute between mechanism and vitalism.] ''Synthese'' 20:238–253, who describes Crick's remark as "raising spectral red herrings".&lt;/ref&gt;

While many vitalistic theories have in fact been falsified, notably Mesmerism, the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] retention of untested and untestable theories continues to this day. [[Alan Sokal]] published an analysis of the wide acceptance among professional nurses of "scientific theories" of spiritual healing. (Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers?).&lt;ref name="Sokal"&gt;[http://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/pseudoscience_rev.pdf Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers?]&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a technique called [[therapeutic touch]] was especially reviewed by Sokal, who concluded, "nearly all the pseudoscientific systems to be examined in this essay are based philosophically on vitalism" and added that "Mainstream science has rejected vitalism since at least the 1930s, for a plethora of good reasons that have only become stronger with time."&lt;ref name="Sokal" /&gt;

Joseph C. Keating, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncmic.com/pages/ce/seminars/speakers/keating.htm Joseph C. Keating, Jr., PhD: Biographical sketch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525203939/http://www.ncmic.com/pages/ce/seminars/speakers/keating.htm |date=2006-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses vitalism's past and present roles in [[chiropractic]] and calls vitalism "a form of [[bio-theology]]." He further explains that:

: "Vitalism is that rejected tradition in biology which proposes that life is sustained and explained by an unmeasurable, intelligent force or energy. The supposed effects of vitalism are the manifestations of life itself, which in turn are the basis for inferring the concept in the first place. This circular reasoning offers pseudo-explanation, and may deceive us into believing we have explained some aspect of biology when in fact we have only labeled our ignorance. 'Explaining an unknown (life) with an unknowable (Innate),' suggests chiropractor Joseph Donahue, 'is absurd'."&lt;ref name="keating_innate"&gt;{{citation |title=The Meanings of Innate |author=Keating, Joseph C.  |volume=46 |issue=1 |pmc=2505097 |journal=The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association |year=2002 |pages=4–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keating views vitalism as incompatible with scientific thinking:

: "Chiropractors are not unique in recognizing a tendency and capacity for self-repair and auto-regulation of human physiology. But we surely stick out like a sore thumb among professions which claim to be scientifically based by our unrelenting commitment to vitalism. So long as we propound the 'One cause, one cure' rhetoric of Innate, we should expect to be met by ridicule from the wider health science community. Chiropractors can't have it both ways. Our theories cannot be both dogmatically held vitalistic constructs and be scientific at the same time. The purposiveness, consciousness and rigidity of the Palmers' Innate should be rejected."&lt;ref name="keating_innate" /&gt;

Keating also mentions Skinner's viewpoint:

: "Vitalism has many faces and has sprung up in many areas of scientific inquiry. Psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]], for example, pointed out the irrationality of attributing behavior to mental states and traits. Such 'mental way stations,' he argued, amount to excess theoretical baggage which fails to advance cause-and-effect explanations by substituting an unfathomable psychology of 'mind'."&lt;ref name="keating_innate" /&gt;

According to Williams,&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, W. (2000) ''The [[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]]. From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy''. Facts on File. Conway, D. and L. Dalton, R. Dolby, R. Duval, H. Farrell, J. Frazier, J. McMillan, J. Melton, T. O'Niell, R. Shepherd, S. Utley, W. Williams. {{ISBN|0-8160-3351-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; "today, vitalism is one of the ideas that form the basis for many pseudoscientific health systems that claim that illnesses are caused by a disturbance or imbalance of the body's vital force." "Vitalists claim to be scientific, but in fact they reject the scientific method with its basic postulates of cause and effect and of provability. They often regard subjective experience to be more valid than objective material reality."

[[Victor J. Stenger|Victor Stenger]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html Victor J. Stenger's site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202347/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the term "bioenergetics" "is applied in biochemistry to refer to the readily measurable [[Biological thermodynamics|exchanges of energy]] within organisms, and between organisms and the environment, which occur by normal physical and chemical processes. This is not, however, what the new vitalists have in mind. They imagine the [[Energy (esotericism)|bioenergetic]] field as a holistic living force that goes beyond reductionist physics and chemistry."&lt;ref name=Stenger&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |title=The Physics of 'Alternative Medicine': Bioenergetic Fields |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine |date=Spring–Summer 1999 |volume=3 |issue=1 |url=http://www.sram.org/0301/bioenergetic-fields.html |authorlink=Victor_J_Stenger |access-date=2006-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218144228/http://www.sram.org/0301/bioenergetic-fields.html |archive-date=2006-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a field is sometimes explained as electromagnetic, though some advocates also make confused appeals to quantum physics.&lt;ref name="Rubik" /&gt; Joanne Stefanatos states that "The principles of energy medicine originate in quantum physics."&lt;ref name="Stefanatos"&gt;Stefanatos, J. 1997, ''Introduction to Bioenergetic Medicine'', Shoen, A.M. and S.G. Wynn, ''Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine: Principles and Practices'', Mosby-Yearbook, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Stenger&lt;ref name="Stenger" /&gt; offers several explanations as to why this line of reasoning may be misplaced. He explains that energy exists in discrete packets called quanta. Energy fields are composed of their component parts and so only exist when quanta are present. Therefore, energy fields are not holistic, but are rather a system of discrete parts that must obey the laws of physics. This also means that energy fields are not instantaneous. These facts of quantum physics place limitations on the infinite, continuous field that is used by some theorists to describe so-called "human energy fields".&lt;ref name="Biley"&gt;Biley, Francis C. 2005, ''Unitary Health Care: Martha Rogers' Science of Unitary Human Beings'', University of Wales College of Medicine, viewed 30 November 2006, {{cite web |url=http://medweb.uwcm.ac.uk/martha/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205024515/http://medweb.uwcm.ac.uk/martha/ |archivedate=2006-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stenger continues, explaining that the effects of EM forces have been measured by physicists as accurately as one part in a billion and there is yet to be any evidence that living organisms emit a unique field.&lt;ref name="Stenger" /&gt;

Vitalistic thinking has also been identified in the naive biological theories of children: "Recent experimental results show that a majority of preschoolers tend to choose vitalistic explanations as most plausible. Vitalism, together with other forms of intermediate causality, constitute unique causal devices for naive biology as a core domain of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.06.004 | last1=Inagaki | first1=K. | last2=Hatano | first2=G. | year=2004 | title='Vitalistic causality in young children's naive biology.' | url=| journal=Trends Cogn Sci | volume=8 | issue=8| pages=356–62 | pmid=15335462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{note|reference_name_A|a}} [[Stéphane Leduc]] and [[D'Arcy Thompson]] (''[[On Growth and Form]]'') published a series of works that in Evelyn Fox Keller's view took on the task of uprooting the remaining vestiges of vitalism, essentially by showing that the principles of physics and chemistry were enough, by themselves, to account for the growth and development of biological form.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Fox Keller, ''Making Sense of Life Explaining Biological Development with Models, Metaphors, and Machines''.
