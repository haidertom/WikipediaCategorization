The '''American Bar Foundation''' ('''ABF''') is an independent, [[nonprofit]] national [[research institute]] established in 1952 and located in [[Chicago]]. It conducts objective [[empirical]] research on [[law]] and legal institutions. This program of sociolegal research is conducted by an interdisciplinary staff of Research Faculty trained in such diverse fields as [[law]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], [[history]], and [[anthropology]].  

The ABF was initially located in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] on the [[University of Chicago]] campus. It subsequently moved to the American Bar Association building in [[downtown Chicago]], and remained there after the ABA departed, now sharing the building with part of the [[Northwestern University]] downtown professional schools.  The most recent directors (beginning in the 1970s) of the ABF were Spencer L. Kimball (also a professor of law at the [[University of Chicago]] and a former dean of the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]]), John P. Heinz (professor at [[Northwestern University School of Law]]), [[Bill Felstiner|William "Bill" Felstiner]], Bryant Garth (now dean of [[Southwestern Law School]]),  Robert Nelson (also a professor in the Department of Sociology, Northwestern University and MacCrate Research Chair in the Legal Professions at the ABF), and current director Ajay Mehrotra (also a professor of law at Northwestern University School of Law).

The American Bar Foundation Research Faculty produces ''[[Law and Social Inquiry]]'' (LSI), a peer-reviewed academic journal that publishes empirical research about law, legal institutions, and legal processes.  LSI currently is published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]].

The American Bar Foundation is a resource for [[lawyers]], [[scholars]], and policy makers who seek analyses of the theory and functioning of law, legal institutions, and the legal profession. The Foundation's work is supported by the American Bar Endowment, by The Fellows of the American Bar Foundation, and by grants for particular research projects from private foundations and government agencies.

'''Arthur Good''' (16&lt;ref name="Geneanet"/&gt; or 26&lt;ref name="BNF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalogue Général|url=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb12058496c|website=BnF (nouvelle fenêtre)|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; August 1853 – 30 March 1928) was a French engineer,&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt; science educator, author and caricaturist who used the pen name '''Tom Tit'''.  He wrote a series of weekly articles, ''La Science Amusante'', or ''Amusing Science'', that were collected in book form and have been translated and republished in more than 130 editions in several languages.  The illustrations for his do-it-yourself scientific apparatuses have been described as [[surrealist]] [[collages]], and were an inspiration for surrealist artists such as [[Max Ernst]] and [[Joseph Cornell]].

== Personal life ==
Arthur Good was born in [[Montivilliers]], [[Seine-Maritime]], [[France]] on 16&lt;ref name="Geneanet"/&gt; or 26&lt;ref name="BNF"/&gt; August 1853. He was the son of Protestant pastor Gustave Frédéric Good (1823–1896) and Louise Stéphanie Monod (1827–1909).&lt;ref name="Geneanet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Good|url=http://gw.geneanet.org/bourelly?lang=fr&amp;p=arthur&amp;n=good|website=Geneanet|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good graduated from the [[École Centrale Paris|École centrale des arts et manufacture]] in [[Paris]], where he studied engineering.&lt;ref name="Chemineau" /&gt;

He married Jeanne Valon (1857–1910) in Paris on 6 April 1881. They had four children.&lt;ref name="Geneanet" /&gt;

Under the pen name Tom Tit, Arthur Good wrote a series of weekly articles, ''La Science Amusante'', or ''Amusing Science'', for the French magazine ''L’Illustration''.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; Good presented a range of physical experiments, from "simple games meant to amuse the family" to experiments "of a truly scientific character". They introduce a range of physical and scientific principles&lt;ref name="Lachapelle"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lachapelle|first1=Sofie|title=Conjuring Science: A History of Scientific Entertainment and Stage Magic in Modern France|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-49768-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HB7eCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[magnetism]] and [[surface tension]].&lt;ref name="Elder"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elder|first1=R. Bruce|title=Dada, surrealism, and the cinematic effect|date=2013|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|location=Waterloo, Ont.|isbn=978-1-55458-625-7|pages=494–495|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhXaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA494|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Good's articles include geometrical demonstrations, craft projects, and physics experiments which can be carried out with everyday household materials.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; In books such as ''La Récréation En Famille'' he emphasized that scientific education could be a common activity and amusement for the entire family. He dedicated ''La Science Amusante'' to one of his children, saying "In dedicating this volume today, I would like it to be a souvenir for you of the happy moments we have spent together trying the experiments and constructing the apparatuses".&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt;

Good created improvised scientific apparatuses like his ''Soap-bubble Chandelier'' using common items such as bottles, eggs, corks, candles, and soap.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt;  His constructions have an imaginative charm that has led to them being compared to surrealistic collages.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt;  Nonetheless, his drawings were seriously and carefully rendered by scientific engraver [[Louis Poyet]] (1846–1913) and his assistants.&lt;ref name="Edelman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edelman|first1=Eric|title=The Collaged World of Tom Tit|url=http://blog.retrocollage.com/collaged-world-tom-tit/|website=RetroCollage|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poyet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le graveur du dimanche * Louis Poyet|url=http://gonefishing.over-blog.com/article-le-graveur-du-dimanche-louis-poyet-48802161.html|website=Gone Fishing|date=18 April 2010|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original columns from ''La Science Amusante'' were collected and published in a three-volume series in France. Each volume contained 100 amusements. Beginning in 1889,&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt; they have been reprinted in over 130 editions.&lt;ref name="Elder" /&gt; Collections of amusements were translated and published in English, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; In the United States they appeared as ''Magical Experiments, or Science in Play'', and in England as ''Scientific Amusements''. A selection has also been republished as ''100 Amazing Magic Tricks''.&lt;ref name="Elder" /&gt;  Good's books are considered to have laid the foundations for  modern approaches to science education in their introduction of "kitchen science" and hands-on experiments for children.&lt;ref name="Buxton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buxton |first1=Cory A. |last2=Provenzo, Jr. |first2=Eugene F. |title=Teaching Science in Elementary and Middle School: A Cognitive and Cultural Approach |publisher=Sage |year=2007 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aqDhzUdLS4C&amp;pg=PA44 |oclc=72353389 |isbn=978-1-4129-2497-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his science education publications, Good published a set of ''Caricatures'' of famous Britons in London in 1913.&lt;ref name="Caricatures"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Good|first1=Arthur|title=Caricatures|date=1913|publisher=The New Age Press, Limited|location=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/caricaturesbytom00gooduoft#page/n15/mode/2up|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received a medal of honor from the National Society for the Development of Good (''Société nationale d'encouragement au bien'').&lt;ref name="Gallica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Livre La science amusante (première série) : 100 expériences|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2029874/texteBrut|website=Gallica|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Semiotics}}
'''Biosemiotics''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] βίος ''bios'', "life" and σημειωτικός ''sēmeiōtikos'', "observant of signs") is a field of [[semiotics]] and [[biology]] that studies the prelinguistic meaning-making, or production and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and [[Code (semiotics)|code]]s&lt;ref&gt;Marcello Barbieri, 2008. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00114-008-0368-x#/ ''Biosemiotics: a new understanding of life''], ''Naturwissenschaften'', Vol. 95, Iss. 7, pp. 577–599&lt;/ref&gt; in the biological realm. Biosemiotics attempts to integrate the findings of biology and semiotics and proposes a [[paradigm shift|paradigmatic shift]] in the scientific view of [[life]], demonstrating that  [[semiosis]] (sign process, including [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and interpretation) is one of its immanent and intrinsic features. The term ''biosemiotic'' was first used by [[Friedrich S. Rothschild]] in 1962, but [[Thomas Sebeok]] and [[Thure von Uexküll]] have implemented the term and field.&lt;ref&gt;Kull, Kalevi 1999. Biosemiotics in the twentieth century: A view from biology. ''Semiotica'' 127(1/4): 385–414.&lt;/ref&gt; The field, which challenges normative views of biology, is generally divided between theoretical and applied biosemiotics.

==Definition==
Biosemiotics is ''biology interpreted as a sign systems study'', or, to elaborate, a study of 
* [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]], [[communication]] and [[habituation|habit]] formation of [[life|living]] processes 
* [[semiosis]] (changing sign relations) in living nature
* the biological basis of all signs and sign interpretation

==Main branches==
According to the basic types of semiosis under study, biosemiotics can be divided into 
*vegetative semiotics (also '''endosemiotics''', or [[phytosemiotics]]), the study of semiosis at the cellular and molecular level (including the translation processes related to genome and the organic form or phenotype);&lt;ref&gt;Kull, Kalevi 2000. [https://www.academia.edu/3520416/An_introduction_to_phytosemiotics_Semiotic_botany_and_vegetative_sign_systems An introduction to phytosemiotics: Semiotic botany and vegetative sign systems.] ''Sign Systems Studies'' 28: 326–350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witzany, Guenther 2008. The biosemiotics of plant communication. ''American Journal for Semiotic Studies'' 24: 39–56.&lt;/ref&gt; vegetative semiosis occurs in all organisms at their cellular and tissue level; vegetative semiotics includes prokaryote semiotics, sign-mediated interactions in bacteria communities such as [[quorum sensing]] and quorum quenching.
*[[zoosemiotics]] or animal semiotics,&lt;ref&gt;[[Timo Maran|Maran, Timo]]; [[Dario Martinelli|Martinelli, Dario]]; [[Aleksei Turovski|Turovski, Aleksei]] (eds.), 2011. ''Readings in Zoosemiotics.'' ([[Semiotics, Communication and Cognition]] 8.). Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; or the study of animal forms of knowing;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]] 2014. Zoosemiotics is the study of animal forms of knowing. ''Semiotica'' 198: 47–60.[https://www.academia.edu/6116777/Zoosemiotics_is_the_study_of_animal_forms_of_knowing]&lt;/ref&gt; animal semiosis occurs in the organisms with [[neuromuscular]] system, also includes [[anthroposemiotics]], the study of semiotic behavior in humans.

According to the dominant aspect of semiosis under study, the following labels have been used: biopragmatics, biosemantics, and biosyntactics.

==History==
Apart from [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) and [[Charles W. Morris]] (1903–1979), early pioneers of biosemiotics were [[Jakob von Uexküll]] (1864–1944), [[Heini Hediger]] (1908–1992), [[Giorgio Prodi]] (1928–1987), [[Marcel Florkin]] (1900–1979) and [[Friedrich S. Rothschild]] (1899–1995); the founding fathers of the contemporary interdiscipline were [[Thomas Sebeok]] (1920–2001) and [[Thure von Uexküll]] (1908–2004).&lt;ref&gt;Favareau, D. (ed.) (2010). [https://www.springer.com/life+sciences/book/978-1-4020-9649-5 Essential Readings in Biosemiotics: Anthology and Commentary.] Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s a circle of mathematicians active in Theoretical Biology, [[René Thom]] ([[Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques]]), Yannick Kergosien ([[Dalhousie University]] and [[Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques]]), and [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] ([[Dalhousie University]], also a former member of the Buffalo group with [[Howard H.

In 2001, an annual international conference for biosemiotic research known as the '''Gatherings in Biosemiotics'''&lt;ref&gt;Rattasepp, Silver; Bennett, Tyler (eds.) 2012. [https://www.academia.edu/19524232/Tartu_Semiotics_Library_11_Gatherings_in_Biosemiotics ''Gatherings in Biosemiotics'']. (Tartu Semiotics Library 11.) Tartu: University of Tartu Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was inaugurated, and has taken place every year since.

In 2004, a group of biosemioticians – [[Marcello Barbieri]], [[Claus Emmeche]], [[Jesper Hoffmeyer]], [[Kalevi Kull]], and Anton Markos – decided to establish an international journal of biosemiotics. Under their editorship, the ''Journal of Biosemiotics'' was launched by [[Nova Science Publishers]] in 2005 (two issues published), and with the same five editors ''Biosemiotics'' was launched by [[Springer Science|Springer]] in 2008. The book series ''Biosemiotics'' (Springer, since 2007) is edited by [[Jesper Hoffmeyer]], [[Kalevi Kull]], and Alexei Sharov.

The [[International Society for Biosemiotic Studies]] was established in 2005 by Donald Favareau and the five editors listed above.&lt;ref&gt;Favareau, Donald 2005.

'''Bird vocalization''' includes both '''bird calls''' and '''bird songs'''. In non-technical use, [[bird]] songs are the bird sounds that are melodious to the human ear. In [[ornithology]] and [[birding]], songs (relatively complex vocalizations) are distinguished by function from calls (relatively simple vocalizations).

==Definition==
[[File:PipraWing.jpg|thumb|Wing feathers of a male [[club-winged manakin]], with the modifications noted by P. L. Sclater in 1860&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= List of Birds collected by Mr. Fraser in Ecuador, at Nanegal, Calacali, Perucho, and Puellaro, with notes and descriptions of new species|journal=Proc. Zool. Soc. London|author=Sclater, PL|year=1860|pages=83–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed by Charles Darwin in 1871&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Darwin, Charles|year=1871|url=https://archive.org/stream/descentofmansele02darw#page/65/mode/1up/|pages=65–66|title=The descent of man and selection in relation to sex. volume 2|publisher=John Murray, London|isbn=978-1-108-00510-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The distinction between songs and calls is based upon complexity, length, and context. Songs are longer and more complex and are associated with [[Bird#Breeding|courtship and mating]], while calls tend to serve such functions as alarms or keeping members of a [[herd|flock]] in contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ehrlich, Paul R. |author2=David S. Dobkin |author3=Darryl Wheye |last-author-amp=yes |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/SUFRAME.html|title="Bird Voices" and "Vocal Development" from Birds of Stanford essays|accessdate=9 Sep 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authorities such as Howell and Webb (1995) make the distinction based on function, so that short vocalizations, such as those of pigeons, and even non-vocal sounds, such as the drumming of [[woodpecker]]s and the "[[Drumming (snipe)|winnowing]]" of [[snipe]]s' wings in display flight, are considered songs.&lt;ref name=howell&gt;{{cite book |author1=Howell, Steve N. G. |author2=Sophie Webb |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A Guide to the Birds of Mexico and Northern Central America |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-19-854012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others require song to have syllabic diversity and temporal regularity akin to the repetitive and transformative patterns that define [[music]]. It is generally agreed upon in birding and ornithology which sounds are songs and which are calls, and a good field guide will differentiate between the two.

Bird song is best developed in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[passerine|Passeriformes]]. Some groups are nearly voiceless, producing only [[percussive]] and [[rhythm]]ic sounds, such as the [[stork]]s, which clatter their bills. In some manakins ([[Pipridae]]), the males have evolved several mechanisms for mechanical sound production, including mechanisms for [[stridulation]] not unlike those found in some insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bostwick, Kimberly S. |author2=Richard O. Prum |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005|title=Courting Bird Sings with Stridulating Wing Feathers |journal=Science|volume=309|issue=5735|page=736|doi=10.1126/science.1111701 |pmid=16051789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Contopus-virens-001.ogg|left|thumb|eastern wood pewee:  note the simple repetitive pattern of ascending and descending tones from a grounding note.]]
Song is usually delivered from prominent perches, although some species may sing when flying. The production of sounds by mechanical means as opposed to the use of the [[Syrinx (biology)|syrinx]] has been termed variously ''instrumental music'' by [[Charles Darwin]], ''mechanical sounds''&lt;ref&gt;Manson-Barr, P. and Pye, J. D. (1985). Mechanical sounds. In A Dictionary of Birds (ed. B. Campbell and E. Lack), pp. 342-344. Staffordshire: Poyser.&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently ''[[sonation]]''.&lt;ref name="bostwick"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bostwick, Kimberly S. |author2=Richard O. Prum |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003|title=High-speed video analysis of wing-snapping in two manakin clades (Pipridae: Aves)|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|volume= 206|pages=3693–3706|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/206/20/3693|doi=10.1242/jeb.00598|pmid=12966061|issue=Pt 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''sonate'' has been defined as the act of producing non-vocal sounds that are intentionally modulated communicative signals, produced using non-syringeal structures such as the bill, wings, tail, feet and body feathers.&lt;ref name="bostwick"/&gt;


In extratropical [[Eurasia]] and [[the Americas]] almost all song is produced by male birds; however in the tropics and to a greater extent the [[desert]] belts of [[Australia]] and [[Africa]] it is more typical for females to sing as much as males. These differences have been known for a long time&lt;ref name="biological"&gt;Robinson, Angus; [http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/MU948291.htm "The Biological Significance of Bird Song in Australia"] in ''[[Emu (journal)|Emu]]''; 48(4), pp. 291-315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartshorne, Charles; "Some Biological Principles Applicable to Song Behavior" in ''The Wilson Bulletin'' Vol. 70, No. 1 (Mar., 1958), pp. 41-56&lt;/ref&gt; and are generally attributed to the much less regular and seasonal climate of Australian and African arid zones requiring that birds breed at any time when conditions are favourable, although they cannot breed in many years because food supply never increases above a minimal level.&lt;ref name="biological"/&gt; With aseasonal irregular breeding, both sexes must be brought into breeding condition and vocalisation, especially duetting, serves this purpose. The high frequency of female vocalisations in the tropics, Australia and Southern Africa may also relate to very low mortality rates producing much stronger pair-bonding and territoriality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Slater Peter J. B., Mann Nigel I. | year = 2004 | title = Why do the females of many bird species sing in the tropics? | url = | journal = Journal of Avian Biology | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 289–294 | doi=10.1111/j.0908-8857.2004.03392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy and physiology==
The avian vocal organ is called the [[Syrinx (biology)|syrinx]];&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough, D. 1998. ''The Life of Birds''. BBC publication.0563-38792-0&lt;/ref&gt; it is a bony structure at the bottom of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] (unlike the [[larynx]] at the top of the [[mammal]]ian trachea). The syrinx and sometimes a surrounding air sac resonate to sound waves that are made by membranes past which the bird forces air. The bird controls the pitch by changing the tension on the membranes and controls both pitch and volume by changing the force of exhalation. It can control the two sides of the trachea independently, which is how some species can produce two notes at once.

Scientists hypothesize that bird song has evolved through [[sexual selection]], and experiments suggest that the quality of bird song may be a good indicator of fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Read, A.

Communication through bird calls can be between individuals of the same species or even across species. Birds communicate alarm through vocalizations and movements that are specific to the threat, and bird alarms can be understood by other animal species, including other birds, in order to identify and protect against the specific threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2008 |title=A Bird's World: Speaking in a Bird's Language |publisher=Museum of Science, Boston |url=http://www.mos.org/educators/field_trip_resources/field_trip_activities/exhibits&amp;d=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mobbing behaviour|Mobbing]] calls are used to recruit individuals in an area where an owl or other predator may be present. These calls are characterized by wide-frequency spectra, sharp onset and termination, and repetitiveness that are common across species and are believed to be helpful to other potential "mobbers" by being easy to locate. The alarm calls of most species, on the other hand, are characteristically high-pitched, making the caller difficult to locate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marler, P. |year=1955 |title=Characteristics of some animal calls |journal=Nature |volume=176 |issue=4470 |pages=6–8 |doi=10.1038/176006a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual birds may be sensitive enough to identify each other through their calls. Many birds that nest in colonies can locate their chicks using their calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last-author-amp=yes |author1=Lengagne, T. |author2=J. Lauga |author3=T.

Sometimes, songs vocalized in post-breeding season act as a cue to [[conspecificity|conspecific]] eavesdroppers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Betts |first=M.G. |author2=Hadley, A.S. |author3=Rodenhouse, N. |author4= Nocera, J.J. |title=Social Information Trumps Vegetation Structure in Breeding-Site Selection by a Migrant Songbird |journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences |year=2008 |volume=275 |issue=1648 |series=1648 |pages=2257–2263 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0217|pmc=2603235 |pmid=18559326}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[black-throated blue warbler]]s, males that have bred and reproduced successfully sing to their offspring to influence their vocal development, while males that have failed to reproduce usually abandon the nests and stay silent. The post-breeding song therefore inadvertently informs the unsuccessful males of particular habitats that have a higher likelihood of reproductive success. The [[animal communication|social communication]] by vocalization provides a shortcut to locating high quality habitats and saves the trouble of directly assessing various vegetation structures.

The range of frequencies at which birds call in an environment varies with the quality of habitat and the ambient sounds. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis predicts that narrow bandwidths, low frequencies, and long elements and inter-element intervals should be found in habitats with complex vegetation structures (which would absorb and muffle sounds), while high frequencies, broad bandwidth, high-frequency modulations (trills), and short elements and inter-elements may be expected in open habitats, without obstructive vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Derryberry|first=Elizabeth|title=Ecology Shapes Birdsong Evolution: Variation in Morphology and Habitat Explains Variation in White-Crowned Sparrow Song|journal=The American Naturalist|date=July 2009|volume=174|issue=1|pages=24–33|doi=10.1086/599298|pmid=19441960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boncoraglio, G. |author2=Nicola Saino |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title=Habitat structure and the evolution of bird song: a meta-analysis of the evidence for the acoustic adaptation hypothesis|journal= Functional Ecology|volume=21|pages=134–142|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2006.01207.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morton, E.S. |year=1975|title= Ecological sources of selection on avian sounds|journal=American Naturalist|volume=109|pages=17–34|doi=10.1086/282971|issue=965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The songs of different species of birds vary and are generally typical of the species. Species vary greatly in the complexity of their songs and in the number of distinct kinds of song they sing (up to 3000 in the [[brown thrasher]]); individuals within some species vary in the same way. In a few species, such as [[lyrebird]]s and [[mockingbird]]s, songs imbed arbitrary elements learned in the individual's lifetime, a form of mimicry (though maybe better called "appropriation" [Ehrlich et al.], as the bird does not pass for another species). As early as 1773, it was established that birds learned calls, and [[cross-fostering]] experiments succeeded in making linnet ''[[Acanthis cannabina]]'' learn the song of a skylark, ''Alauda arvensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barrington, D. |year=1773 |title=Experiments and observations on the singing of birds |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=63 |pages=249–291 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1773.0031}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many species, it appears that although the basic song is the same for all members of the species, young birds learn some details of their songs from their fathers, and these variations build up over generations to form [[dialects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marler, P. |author2=M.

Song learning in juvenile birds occurs in two stages: sensory learning, which involves the juvenile listening to the father or other conspecific bird and memorizing the spectral and temporal qualities of the song (song template), and sensorimotor learning, which involves the juvenile bird producing its own vocalizations and practicing its song until it accurately matches the memorized song template.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Konishi, M.|year=2010|title=From central pattern generator to sensory template in the evolution of birdsong|journal=Brain &amp; Language|volume=115|issue=1|pages=18–20|pmid= 20955898|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2010.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the sensorimotor learning phase, song production begins with highly variable sub-vocalizations called "sub-song", which is akin to [[babbling]] in human infants.Soon after, the juvenile song shows certain recognizable characteristics of the imitated adult song, but still lacks the stereotypy of the crystallized song – this is called "plastic song".&lt;ref name = "Nottebohm 2005" &gt;{{cite journal |author=Nottebohm, F. |year=2005 |title=The Neural Basis of Birdsong|journal=PLoS Biol|pmid=15884976|volume=3 |issue=5 |pmc=1110917|page=163 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030164}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After two or three months of song learning and rehearsal (depending on species), the juvenile produces a crystallized song, characterized by spectral and temporal stereotypy (very low variability in syllable production and syllable order).&lt;ref name="Leonardo1999"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Leonardo, A. |author2= Konishi, M. |year=1999|title=Decrystallization of adult birdsong by perturbation of auditory feedback|journal=Nature |volume= 399|pages=466–470|doi=10.1038/20933 |pmid=10365958|issue=6735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some birds, such as [[zebra finch]]es, which are the most popular species for birdsong research, have overlapping sensory and sensorimotor learning stages.&lt;ref name="Brainard 2002 351-358"/&gt;

Research has indicated that birds' acquisition of song is a form of [[motor learning]] that involves regions of the [[basal ganglia]]. Further, the PDP (see ''Neuroanatomy'' below) has been considered [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to a mammalian motor pathway originating in the [[cerebral cortex]] and descending through the [[brain stem]], while the AFP has been considered homologous to the mammalian cortical pathway through the basal ganglia and thalamus.&lt;ref name = "Nottebohm 2005" /&gt; Models of bird-song [[motor learning]] can be useful in developing models for how humans learn [[speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Teramitsu I |author2=Kudo LC |author3=London SE |author4=Geschwind DH |author5=White SA |last-author-amp=yes |year=2004|title=Parallel FoxP1 and FoxP2 expression in songbird and human brain predicts functional interaction|journal=J.

==Neuroanatomy==
[[Image:Birdbrain.svg |thumb|Song-learning pathway in birds&lt;ref name="Nottebohm 2005" /&gt;]]

The acquisition and learning of bird song involves a group of distinct brain areas that are aligned in two connecting pathways:&lt;ref name="Nottebohm 2005" /&gt;
* Anterior forebrain pathway ([[vocal learning]]): composed of Area X, which is a homologue to mammalian basal ganglia; the lateral part of the [[magnocellular cell|magnocellular]] nucleus of anterior nidopallium (LMAN), also considered a part of the avian basal ganglia; and the dorso-lateral division of the medial thalamus (DLM).
* Posterior descending pathway (vocal production): composed of HVC (proper name, although sometimes referred to as the [[high vocal center]]); the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA); and the tracheosyringeal part of the [[hypoglossal nucleus]] (nXIIts).&lt;ref name = "Brainard 2000 31-40" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brainard, M. S. |author2=Doupe, A. J.
 |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2000 |title=Auditory feedback in learning and maintenance of vocal behavior |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |pmid=11252766 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=31–40 |doi=10.1038/35036205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carew&gt;{{cite book |author=Carew, Thomas J. |title=Behavioral Neurobiology: The Cellular Organization of Natural Behavior |publisher=Sinauer Associates |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-87893-092-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The posterior descending pathway (PDP) is required throughout a bird's life for normal song production, while the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) is necessary for song learning in juvenilles and plasticity/maintenance in adults, but not for adult song production.&lt;ref name="Kao2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kao, M.H. |author2=Doupe, A.J. |author3= Brainard, M.S. |year=2005|title=Contributions of an avian basal ganglia-forebrain circuit to real=time modulation of song|journal=Nature |volume=433 |issue=7026 |pages=638–642 |doi=10.1038/nature03127 |pmid=15703748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both neural pathways in the song system begin at the level of [[high vocal center|HVC]], which projects information both to the RA (premotor nucleus) and to Area X of the anterior forebrain. Information in the posterior descending pathway (also referred to as the vocal production or motor pathway) descends from [[high vocal center|HVC]] to RA, and then from RA to the tracheosyringeal part of the [[hypoglossal nerve]] (nXIIts), which then controls muscular contractions of the syrinx.&lt;ref name = "Nottebohm 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Suthers, R. |year=2004 |chapter=How birds sing and why it matters|editor=Marler, P. |editor2=Slabbekoorn, H. |title=Nature's music:The science of birdsong |publisher=Academic Press |pages=272–295|isbn= 978-0-12-473070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information in the anterior forebrain pathway is projected from [[high vocal center|HVC]] to Area X (basal ganglia), then from Area X to the DLM (thalamus), and from DLM to LMAN, which then links the [[vocal learning]] and vocal production pathways through connections back to the RA. Some investigators have posited a model in which the connection between LMAN and RA carries an instructive signal based on evaluation of auditory feedback (comparing the bird's own song to the memorized song template), which adaptively alters the motor program for song output.&lt;ref name = "Kao2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brainard_2000b"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brainard, M.

Models regarding the real-time error-correction interactions between the AFP and PDP will be considered in the future. Other current research has begun to explore the cellular mechanisms underlying [[high vocal center|HVC]] control of temporal patterns of song structure and RA control of syllable production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Long, M.A. |author2=Jin, D.Z. |author3= Fee, M.S. |year=2010 |title=Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation |journal=Nature| volume=468 |issue=7322 |pages=394–399| doi=10.1038/nature09514 |pmid=20972420 |pmc=2998755}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brain structures involved in both pathways show [[sexual dimorphism]] in many bird species, usually causing males and females to sing differently. Some of the known types of dimorphisms in the brain include the size of nuclei, the number of neurons present, and the number of neurons connecting one nucleus to another.&lt;ref name="BalthazartAdkinsRegan2002"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Balthazart, J. |author2=Adkins-Regan |year=2002 |title=Sexual differentiation of brain and behavior in birds |journal=Hormones, Brain and Behavior |volume=4 |pages=223–301 |doi=10.1016/b978-012532104-4/50068-8|isbn=9780125321044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the extremely dimorphic zebra finches (''Taeniopygia guttata''), a species in which only males typically sing, the size of the HVC and RA are approximately three to six times larger in males than in females, and Area X does not appear to be recognizable in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nottebohm, F. |author2=Arnold, A.P. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1976 |title=Sexual dimorphism in vocal control areas of the songbird brain |journal=Science |volume=194 |issue=4261 |pages=211–213|doi=10.1126/science.959852 |pmid=959852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that exposure to sex steroids during early development is partially responsible for these differences in the brain. Female zebra finches treated with estradiol after hatching followed by testosterone or [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) treatment in adulthood will develop an RA and HVC similar in size to males and will also display male-like singing behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gurney, M.E. |author2=Konishi, M. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Hormone-induced sexual differentiation of brain and behavior in zebra finches |journal=Science  |year=1980 |volume=208 |issue=4450 |pages=1380–1383 |doi=10.1126/science.208.4450.1380 |pmid=17775725}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hormone treatment alone does not seem to produce female finches with brain structures or behavior exactly like males. Furthermore, other research has shown results that contradict what would be expected based on our current knowledge of mammalian sexual differentiation. For example, male zebra finches castrated or given sex steroid inhibitors as hatchlings still develop normal masculine singing behavior.&lt;ref name="BalthazartAdkinsRegan2002"/&gt; This suggests that other factors, such as the activation of genes on the z chromosome, might also play a role in normal male song development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tomaszycki, M.L. |author2=Peabody, C. |author3=Replogle, K. |author4=Clayton, D.F |author5=Tempelman, R.J. |author6=Wade, J. |year= 2009|title=Sexual differentiation of the zebra finch song system: potential roles for sex chromosome genes |journal=BMC Neuroscience |volume=10 |doi=10.1186/1471-2202-10-24 |pmid=19309515 |pmc=2664819 |pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hormones also have activational effects on singing and the song nuclei in adult birds. In canaries (''Serinus canaria''), females normally sing less often and with less complexity than males. However, when adult females are given androgen injections, their singing will increase to an almost male-like frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leonard|first1=S.

==Auditory feedback in birdsong learning==
Early experiments by Thorpe in 1954 showed the importance of a bird being able to hear a tutor's song. When birds are raised in isolation, away from the influence of conspecific males, they still sing. While the song they produce, called "isolate song", resembles the song of a wild bird, it shows distinctly different characteristics from the wild song and lacks its complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thorpe, W.|year=1954|title=The process of song-learning in the chaffinch as studied by means of the sound spectrograph|journal= Nature|volume=173 |pages=465–469|doi=10.1038/173465a0|issue=4402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Metzmacher, M. |year=2016 |title= Alauda: Chaffinch song learning : Thorpe conclusions revisited |journal=Alauda |volume=84 |pages=465–469|hdl=2268/204189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the bird being able to hear itself sing in the sensorimotor period was later discovered by Konishi. Birds deafened before the song-crystallization period went on to produce songs that were distinctly different from the wild type and isolate song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Konishi, M.|year=1965|title=The role of auditory feedback on the control of vocalization in the white-crowned sparrow|journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie|volume= 22|pages=770–783|pmid=5874921|issue=7|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1965.tb01688.x|doi-broken-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Marler, P.|year=1970|title=A comparative approach to vocal learning: Song development in the white-crowned sparrows|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiological Psychology|volume=71|issue=2, Pt.2|pages=1–25|doi=10.1037/h0029144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the emergence of these findings, investigators have been searching for the neural pathways that facilitate sensory/sensorimotor learning and mediating the matching of the bird's own song with the memorized song template.

Several studies over recent decades have looked at the neural mechanisms underlying birdsong learning by performing lesions to relevant brain structures involved in the production or maintenance of song or by deafening birds before and/or after song crystallization. Another recent experimental approach was recording the bird's song and then playing it back while the bird is singing, causing perturbed auditory feedback (the bird hears the superposition of its own song and a fragmented portion of a previous song syllable).&lt;ref name = "Leonardo1999" /&gt; After Nordeen &amp; Nordeen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nordeen, K.W. |author2= Nordeen, E.J. |year=1994|title=Auditory feedback is necessary for the maintenance of stereotyped song in adult zebra finches|journal=Behavioral and Neural Biology|volume=71|issue=1|doi=10.1016/0163-1047(92)90757-U|pages=58–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; made a landmark discovery as they demonstrated that auditory feedback was necessary for the maintenance of song in adult birds with crystallized song, Leonardo &amp; Konishi (1999) designed an auditory feedback perturbation protocol in order to explore the role of auditory feedback in adult song maintenance further, to investigate how adult songs deteriorate after extended exposure to perturbed auditory feedback, and to examine the degree to which adult birds could recover crystallized song over time after being removed from perturbed feedback exposure. This study offered further support for role of auditory feedback in maintaining adult song stability and demonstrated how adult maintenance of crystallized birdsong is dynamic rather than static.

Brainard &amp; Doupe (2000) posit a model in which LMAN (of the anterior forebrain) plays a primary role in error correction, as it detects differences between the song produced by the bird and its memorized song template and then sends an instructive error signal to structures in the vocal production pathway in order to correct or modify the motor program for song production. In their study, Brainard &amp; Doupe (2000) showed that while deafening adult birds led to the loss of song stereotypy due to altered auditory feedback and non-adaptive modification of the motor program, lesioning LMAN in the anterior forebrain pathway of adult birds that had been deafened led to the stabilization of song (LMAN lesions in deafened birds prevented any further deterioration in syllable production and song structure).

Currently, there are two competing models that elucidate the role of LMAN in generating an instructive error signal and projecting it to the motor production pathway:

*''Bird's own song (BOS)-tuned error correction model''

: During singing, the activation of LMAN neurons will depend on the match between auditory feedback from the song produced by the bird and the stored song template. If this is true, then the firing rates of LMAN neurons will be sensitive to changes in auditory feedback.

*''Efference copy model of error correction''

: An [[efference copy]] of the motor command for song production is the basis of the real-time error-correction signal. During singing, activation of LMAN neurons will depend on the motor signal used to generate the song, and the learned prediction of expected auditory feedback based on that motor command. Error correction would occur more rapidly in this model.

Leonardo &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leonardo, A.|year=2004|title=Experimental test of error-correction birdsong model|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=101|issue=48|pages=16935–16940|doi=10.1073/pnas.0407870101|pmid=15557558|pmc=534752}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested these models directly by recording spike rates in single LMAN neurons of adult zebra finches during singing in conditions with normal and perturbed auditory feedback. His results did not support the BOS-tuned error correction model, as the firing rates of LMAN neurons were unaffected by changes in auditory feedback and therefore, the error signal generated by LMAN appeared unrelated to auditory feedback. Moreover, the results from this study supported the predictions of the efference copy model, in which LMAN neurons are activated during singing by the efference copy of the motor signal (and its predictions of expected auditory feedback), allowing the neurons to be more precisely time-locked to changes in auditory feedback.

===Mirror neurons and vocal learning===

A [[mirror neuron]] is a [[neuron]] that discharges both when an individual performs an action and when he/she perceives that same action being performed by another.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti, G. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rizzolatti G. |author2=Craighero L. | year = 2004 | title = The mirror-neuron system | url = | journal = Annu. Rev. Neurosci. | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 169–192 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230 | pmid = 15217330}}&lt;/ref&gt; These neurons were first discovered in [[macaque]] monkeys, but recent research suggests that mirror neuron systems may be present in other animals including humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Oberman L. M. |author2=Pineda J. A. |author3=Ramachandran V. S. |year=2007 |title=The human mirror neuron system: A link between action observation and social skills |url= |journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=62–66 |pmid=18985120 |doi=10.1093/scan/nsl022 |pmc=2555434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Song selective HVCx neurons.svg|thumb|300px|'''Song selectivity in HVCx neurons:''' neuron activity in response to calls heard (green) and calls produced (red). '''a.''' Neurons fire when the primary song type is either heard or sung. '''b, c.''' Neurons do not fire in response to the other song type, regardless of whether it is heard or sung.&lt;ref name=Prather2008/&gt;]]

Mirror neurons have the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti, G. 2004"/&gt;
* They are located in the [[premotor cortex]].
* They exhibit both sensory and motor properties.
* They are action-specific – mirror neurons are only active when an individual is performing or observing a certain type of action (e.g., grasping an object).

Because mirror neurons exhibit both [[sensory neuron|sensory]] and [[motor neuron|motor]] activity, some researchers have suggested that mirror neurons may serve to map sensory experience onto motor structures.&lt;ref name="Dinstein, I. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dinstein I. |author2=Thomas C. |author3=Behrmann M. |author4=Heeger D.J. | year = 2008 | title = A mirror up to nature | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = R13–18 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.11.004 | pmid=18177704 | pmc=2517574}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has implications for birdsong learning– many birds rely on auditory feedback to acquire and maintain their songs. Mirror neurons may be mediating this comparison of what the bird hears, how it compares to a memorized song template, and what he produces.

In search of these auditory-motor neurons, Jonathan Prather and other researchers at Duke University recorded the activity of single neurons in the [[High vocal center|HVCs]] of [[swamp sparrow]]s.&lt;ref name=Prather2008&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Prather J. F. |author2=Peters S. |author3=Nowicki S. |author4=Mooney R. | year = 2008 | title = Precise auditory-vocal mirroring in neurons for learned vocal communication | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7176| pages = 305–310 | doi = 10.1038/nature06492 | pmid = 18202651}}&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that the neurons that project from the HVC to Area X (HVC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; neurons) are highly responsive when the bird is hearing a playback of his own song. These neurons also fire in similar patterns when the bird is singing that same song. Swamp sparrows employ 3-5 different song types, and the neural activity differs depending on which song is heard or sung. The HVC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; neurons only fire in response to the presentation (or singing) of one of the songs, the primary song type. They are also temporally selective, firing at a precise phase in the song syllable.

Prather, et al. found that during the short period of time before and after the bird sings, his HVC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; neurons become insensitive to [[Sound|auditory]] input. In other words, the bird becomes "deaf" to his own song. This suggests that these neurons are producing a [[corollary discharge]], which would allow for direct comparison of motor output and auditory input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tchernichovski O. |author2=Wallman J. | year = 2008 | title = Behavioral neuroscience: Neurons of imitation | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7176| pages = 249–250 | doi = 10.1038/451249a | pmid = 18202627}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be the mechanism underlying learning via auditory feedback. These findings are also in line with Leonardo's (2004) efference copy model of error correction in birdsong learning and production.

Overall, the HVC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; auditory motor neurons in swamp sparrows are very similar to the visual motor mirror neurons discovered in [[primates]]. Like mirror neurons, the HVC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; neurons:

* Are located in a [[premotor]] brain area
* Exhibit both sensory and motor properties
* Are action-specific – a response is only triggered by the "primary song type"

The function of the mirror neuron system is still unclear. Some scientists speculate that mirror neurons may play a role in understanding the actions of others, [[imitation]], [[theory of mind]] and [[language acquisition]], though there is currently insufficient [[neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] evidence in support of these theories.&lt;ref name="Dinstein, I. 2008"/&gt; Specifically regarding birds, it is possible that the mirror neuron system serves as a general mechanism underlying [[vocal learning]], but further research is needed. In addition to the implications for song learning, the mirror neuron system could also play a role in [[territorial behavior]]s such as song-type matching and countersinging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Miller G | year = 2008 | title = Mirror neurons may help songbirds stay in tune | url = | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5861| page = 269| doi=10.1126/science.319.5861.269a |pmid=18202262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m.rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1644/20130179.full.pdf | title=Auditory–vocal mirroring in songbirds | publisher=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences Online | date=5 June 2014 | accessdate=December 16, 2015 | author=Richard Mooney }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specificity of bird calls has been used extensively for species identification. The calls of birds have been described using words or nonsense syllables or line diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Aretas A (1951) Guide to Bird Songs. Doubleday and Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000M4}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Common terms in English include words such as ''quack'', ''chirp'' and ''chirrup''. These are subject to imagination and vary greatly; a well-known example is the [[white-throated sparrow]]'s song, given in [[Canada]] as ''O sweet Canada Canada Canada'' and in [[New England]] as ''Old Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody'' (also ''Where are you Frederick Frederick Frederick?''). In addition to nonsense words, grammatically correct phrases have been constructed as likenesses of the vocalizations of birds. For example, the [[barred owl]] produces a motif which some bird guides describe as ''Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all?'' with the emphasis placed on ''you''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sibley, David|title=The Sibley Guide to Birds |publisher=Knopf |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-679-45122-8 |authorlink=David Allen Sibley|title-link=The Sibley Guide to Birds }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bird language==



The [[language of the birds]] has long been a topic for anecdote and speculation. That calls have meanings that are interpreted by their listeners has been well demonstrated. Domestic [[chicken]]s have distinctive alarm calls for aerial and ground predators, and they respond to these alarm calls appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Collias, N. E.|year= 1987|title=The vocal repertoire of the Red Junglefowl: A spectrographic classification and the code of communication|journal=The Condor|volume= 89|issue=3|pages=510–524|doi=10.2307/1368641|jstor=1368641}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Evans, C.

However, a [[language]] has, in addition to words, [[grammar]] (that is, structures and rules). Studies to demonstrate the existence of language have been difficult due to the range of possible interpretations. For instance, some have argued that in order for a communication system to count as a language it must be "combinatorial",&lt;ref name="Ficken1986" /&gt; having an open ended set of grammar-compliant sentences made from a finite vocabulary. 

Research on [[parrot]]s by [[Irene Pepperberg]] is claimed to demonstrate the innate ability for grammatical structures, including the existence of concepts such as nouns, adjectives and verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pepperberg, I.M.|year=2000|title= The Alex Studies: Cognitive and Communicative Abilities of Grey Parrots|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wild, [[Black-capped Chickadee]]s innate vocalizations have been rigorously shown&lt;ref name="Ficken1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hailman|first1=Jack|last2=Ficken|first2=Millicent|title=Combinatorial animal communication with computable syntax: Chick-a-dee calling qualifies as "language" by structural linguistics.|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1986|volume=34|issue=6|page=1899–1901|doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(86)80279-2|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347286802792?via%3Dihub|accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have combinatorial language.

[[Birds in music|In music]], [[birdsong]] has influenced composers and musicians in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Beethoven]] did, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, as [[Ottorino Respighi]] first did; or like [[Beatrice Harrison]] and [[David Rothenberg]], they can duet with birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matthew Head |title=Birdsong and the Origins of Music |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |volume=122 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.1093/jrma/122.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clark, Suzannah |year=2001 |title=Music Theory and Natural Order from the Renaissance to the Early Twentieth Century |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-77191-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ledger&gt;{{cite news |last=Reich |first=Ronni |title=NJIT professor finds nothing cuckoo in serenading our feathered friends |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2010/10/njit_professor_finds_nothing_c.html |accessdate=19 June 2011 |newspaper=Star Ledger |date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Hollis |date=2011-03-21 |title=Composers' Appropriation of Pied Butcherbird Song: Henry Tate's "undersong of Australia" Comes of Age |url=http://www.jmro.org.au/index.php/mca2/article/view/43 |journal=Journal of Music Research Online |volume=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors including Rothenberg have claimed that birds sing on traditional scales as used in human music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rothenberg |first1=David |title=Why Birds Sing |date=2005 |publisher=Allen Lane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Motion |first1=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Motion |title=In full flight |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview5|accessdate=24 April 2016 |agency=[[The Guardian]] |date=10 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Birds Sing|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qn8p |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC Four) |accessdate=24 April 2016 |date=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at least one songbird does not choose notes in this way.&lt;ref name=Underwood&gt;{{cite web |last1=Underwood |first1=Emily |title=Birdsong Not Music, After All |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/08/birdsong-not-music-after-all |publisher=Science |accessdate=24 April 2016 |date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bird song is a popular subject in [[poetry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11350">The '''Chicago Psychoanalytic Institute''' (formerly Institute for Psychoanalysis until it was renamed in May 2018) is a center for [[psychoanalytic]] research, training, and education that is located on [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] in [[downtown Chicago]].  The institute provides professional training in the theory and practice of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychotherapy]].  It was founded in 1932 by [[Franz Alexander]], a pioneer in psychosomatic medicine at the [[Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute]], who  moved to Chicago at the invitation of [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]], then president of the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Grinker, R.R., Sr (1995). "The History of Psychoanalysis in Chicago, 1911–1975". ''Ann. Psychoanal.'', 23:155-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable [[psychoanalyst]]s that have been associated with the institute include [[Karl Menninger]], [[Karen Horney]], [[Thomas Szasz]], [[Therese Benedek]], [[Hedda Bolgar]], [[Roy R. Grinker, Sr.|Roy Grinker]], Maxwell Gitelson, Louis Shapiro, [[Heinz Kohut]], [[Arnold Goldberg]], [[Jerome Kavka]], Frank Summers, and Michael Franz Basch.

== History==

The Chicago Institute is the second oldest in the United States, preceded by New York five months earlier, and followed by Boston and Washington.  It was incorporated on February 25, 1932, with Franz Alexander as the first Director.  Alexander’s first associate was [[Karen Horney]], who had been another student at the Berlin Institute. Alexander and Horney appointed three more to form the first staff. They were: Thomas French as Lecturer and Clinical Associate, Helen McLean and Catherine Bacon as Clinical Associates. There were also two visiting lecturers: Karl Menninger and Lionel Blitzstein.

From the beginning, the Chicago Institute has nurtured innovative, and occasionally revolutionary, approaches to the psychoanalytic theory and practice originally formulated by [[Sigmund Freud]] in Vienna. Alexander wanted to experiment with frequency of sessions, length of treatment and how the analyst should optimally conduct himself. He published his ideas in several books, and became an outspoken advocate for such experimentation.  Alexander left Chicago for California in 1955. He was succeeded by Gerhard Piers  as the Director of the Institute. The group of analysts who became the dominant voices at the Institute had been greatly influenced by Lionel Blitzstein, who had analyzed them all. Though Blitzsten had been on the early faculty of the Institute, he and Alexander were at odds. With his ascendance the Institute reinstated practices that were considered more in line with the dominant American view of depth and intensity of psychoanalytic treatment. The intellectual leader of this group was Maxwell Gitelson. Joan Fleming became Dean of Education, and the curriculum emphasized a more thorough historical approach to teaching psychoanalysis.  

The 1960s witnessed one of the most vibrant creative periods in the Institute's history. Two important theoretical developments occurred. One was  a collective research project that concerned parent loss. Fleming's research group observed that there seemed to be an arrest of the personality at the age of the child when the parent died, associated with an absence of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;(1966) ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]''. XLIV, 1963: Activation of Mourning and Growth by Psychoanalysis. Joan Fleming and Sol Altschul. Pp. 419-431. ''Psychoanal Q.'', 35:308&lt;/ref&gt; From these findings, the group reasoned that intervention at the time of the loss (i.e., in childhood) would effectively prevent later psychological problems. Ten years later, in 1976, the Barr-Harris Children’s grief center opened its doors.    

The second major development was the groundbreaking work of Heinz Kohut, who developed his very own ideas about the central role of empathy as defining the field of psychoanalysis - a position he staked out in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Kohut, H. (1959). "Introspection, empathy and psychoanalysis: An examination of the relationship between modes of observation and theory". ''[[Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association]]'', 7:459-483&lt;/ref&gt;  Kohut  had observed the intense reactions that would occur when patients were engaged with others who had not functioned as a needed part of themselves and hence caused injury to that most vital part of their being. But it was this being-part-of that had deep implications for the understanding of both development and treatment. Paradoxically, the understanding of the essential role of the "other" became a psychology of the "self".&lt;ref&gt;Terman, D. (1980). "Object Love and the Psychology of the Self".  In A. Goldberg (Ed.), ''Advances in Self Psychology'', 349-365. New York: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt; All of this offered another, additional way of looking at what the classical theory had charted in its terms. [[Self psychology]] has had  (and continues too have) an enormous impact on psychoanalytic thought and practice throughout the world.

In the midst of all this groundbreaking intellectual work, the Institute also launched a number of innovative programs.  In 1962 it began the Child Therapy Program, the first of its kind in the country.  Graduates  of the Child Therapy Program have staffed and trained legions of agencies and treatment facilities of all kinds and have been the source of quality child psychotherapy over the last 45 years.   A few years later, in 1965, Kay Field began the Teacher Education Program that educated teachers and school personnel about the nature of emotional development and helped them recognize and deal with problems in that development. The program reached hundreds of school personnel.  In 1973, under the direction of then-director George H. Pollock, the Institute began the yearly publication of the Annual of Psychoanalysis. It remains the only Institute in the country - and the world - to sponsor, edit and produce an important academic journal.   The 70’s also saw the inauguration of the most complete catalogue of psychoanalytic literature assembled to that point, The Chicago Psychoanalytic Index. Begun in 1970 and continued until 1989, this was the standard reference work for most American psychoanalysts until the recent advent of centralized computer cataloguing. The psychoanalytic library out of which this work arose began with the founding of the Institute and grew to be one of the three most complete psychoanalytic collections in the world.

In 2013, [[Erika Schmidt]] became the first female director of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;http://internationalpsychoanalysis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ErikaSchmidtRelease.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education programs==

The Chicago Institute offers a variety of pathways to facilitate psychoanalytic learning. The fellowship program is open to advanced trainees and recent graduates in [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], and [[social work]] who are interested in psychoanalysis as a framework with which to understand and carry out clinical work.   Participants meet for a monthly seminar.  Fellows also meet monthly with a mentor to discuss readings, cases and other relevant topics. The Adult [[Psychotherapy]] Program is a two year curriculum that is equally divided between clinical and didactic courses.  Students learn to do diagnostic evaluations from a dynamic point of view, including dynamic formulations.  They also have supervision with an analyst once a week to help with patients they currently have in treatment. The Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy Program is a 4 year program to train mental health workers who treat children and adolescents. Students complete a variety of diagnostic evaluations of children and their families with a dynamic perspective, in addition to several long-term psycho-analytically-oriented supervised cases. The core Psychanalytic Education Program provides training in the practice of psychoanalysis. This is a 5 year curriculum, but completion of the program frequently requires additional years to finish the clinical work required for graduation. Students must undergo a personal analysis that begins before matriculation into courses. Students treat at least three people in analysis under supervision of an analyst.

In collaboration with [[Rush University]], the Institute also offers the CORST program to Ph.D.s from a variety of non-clinical academic field, who wish to become psychoanalysts. It is designed to provide such students experience in general psychiatry and psychotherapy as preparation for psychoanalytic training.  CORST is a 17 month program in which the student shares many of the courses given to residents in Psychiatry at [[Rush Medical College]]. Concurrently, they see several patients in psychotherapy under the supervision of analysts on the faculty of the Institute.

==Clinical services==

The Clinics of the Institute for Psychoanalysis provide psychoanalytically informed services to adults, adolescents, and children in the Chicago area at a greatly reduced fee. All therapists and analysts are highly experienced clinicians trained in psychiatry, psychology, social work, or [[counseling]]. Many have advanced training in psychoanalysis or psychotherapy.
Psychoanalytic treatments are based on the belief that emotional difficulties are often the result of thoughts and feelings outside of a person's awareness. By exploring and working through these issues in the safety of a trusting relationship with a therapist, one can experience lasting changes. Present stresses and crises are also contributors to one's sense of well-being and can be an important focus for therapeutic intervention.

In 1976, the Institute for Psychoanalysis established the Barr-Harris Children's Grief Center to meet the needs of children who have lost a parent or significant loved one through death, divorce, or abandonment. The Center's mission is to provide therapeutic services to bereaved children and their families; to make intervention more accessible; to heighten awareness of the potentially harmful short- and long-term effects of loss; and to provide training and consultation for teachers, clergy, mental health workers, and other involved community members.

In addition to its main location at the Institute for Psychoanalysis in downtown Chicago, the Center has established programs at four Chicago area locations: [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]] Hospital serving the north suburbs, Little Company of Mary Hospital serving the south suburbs, La Rabida Children's Hospital serving the city's south side, and Swedish Covenant Hospital serving the city's north side. More recently, the Center has opened a sixth location at the Riverdale Community Resource Center in Riverdale, IL.

The '''conservation and restoration of archaeological sites''' is the process of professionally protecting an archaeological site from further damage and restore it to a previous state. 
Archaeological sites require an extra level of care in regards to their conservation and restoration. Archaeology, even with through documentation, is a destructive force. This is because once a site has been even partially excavated, it cannot be put back the way it was, so in order to continue getting information from the site, it must be conserved to the current best standards.

==Life of a site==
According to Ashurst and Shalom, archaeological sites have several phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashurst|first1=John|last2=Shalom|first2=Asi|title=Reading 38: Short Story: The Demise, Discovery, Destruction and Salvation of a Ruin (2007) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|page=353-364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Creation of the Site:''' During this phase, the site is in use and has been established.
#'''Deterioration:''' After the site has been abandoned, natural forces take hold of the area and begin to weaken any structures that have been built. Animals also will burrow through the remnants, destroying floors, walls, and moving objects around. As walls and structures fall, they settle in different patterns and wind and water fill in the openings with dirt and dust.
#'''Identification:''' The site might be identified by archaeologists, or it might be identified by locals or other non-professionals. 
#'''Excavation:''' There are many ways that an excavation can take place. One is that locals or other interested people decide that they want to investigate themselves. Whether this is simply for pot hunting (illegal digging and collecting of artifacts) or as more of an actual attempt at amateur excavation, it can easily damage the site and regularly makes interpretation more difficult. Even when excavated by professionals, sometimes improper techniques or documentation can actually lead to further damage. If done properly, archaeological excavations will reveal many aspects, while still protecting others and detailed documentation takes place to allow the site to be virtually reconstructed as best as possible.
#'''Further Deterioration:''' If the site is then left open, there is a renewal of deterioration since areas are now re-exposed to the weather. 
#'''Ignorant Repair:''' There are many instances where people, with good intentions, attempt to conserve and repair a site. However, it results in more damage than assistance. Some ways that this happens is the use of inappropriate materials, inappropriate uses, as well as the lack of understanding of the original condition of the site (example: construction techniques, last used layout, et cetera). 
#'''Correct Conservation:''' In this instance, correct conservation materials and techniques are used in order to preserve the condition the site was found in, and in rare cases rebuild where things have fallen over. The basic goal, however, is simply to preserve how it was found.
#'''Reburial:''' In the case that the site cannot be properly preserved while in the open (due to funding or other reasons), one of the better conservation techniques is simply to rebury the site in order to protect it from further deterioration.&lt;ref name="Reburial"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demas|first1=Martha|title="Site unseen": The Case for Reburial of Archaeological Sites|journal=Conservation and Management of Archaeological Sites|volume=6|issue=3-4|pages=137-154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these phases can be repeated and happen in a variety of orders.

==Dangers==
===Weathering===
The source of most damage is weather. Erosion through wind, rain, freeze-thaw, and evaporation are extremely common and other than covering the site entirely cannot be prevented. However, more dramatic factors are natural disasters: floods, fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meier|first1=Hans-Rudolf|last2=Petzet|first2=Michael|last3=Will|first3=Thomas|title=Cultural Heritage and Natural Disasters| date=2008|publisher=TUDpress|location=Germany|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/2007/natural_disasters/HR_Special_2007_Disasters_ebook_20091116.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to protect archaeological sites from these larger events is to formulate a [[risk management]] plan. The basics of this are to first identify what threatens the site the most and then determine its susceptibility to it. This plan will be much like that for any structure or area, the only difference is that there are no codes that must be upheld.

An example of how some locations are dealing with this is in Florida, where they have faced many floods as well as soil erosion. A technique they have been putting into effect is easements in order to protect the archaeological sites from this risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation Easements|url=http://dos.myflorida.com/historical/archaeology/cultural-resource-protection/conservation-easements/|website=Florida Division of Historical Resources|publisher=Florida Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Phoenix-Pueblo Grande Ruin-Hohokam Village-2.JPG|thumb|Pueblo Grande Ruin-Hohokam Village. Note the buildings in the background; this is in downtown Phoenix, Arizona.]]
An unfortunate risk to archaeological sites is development itself. As the world continues to develop and build new buildings and roadways, many times archaeological sites are damaged. An example of this is in Arizona. There was an Ancient Puebloan site that dates to A.D. 900-1350 was damaged by construction activities while putting in a new road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeMar|first1=David|title=The Result of a Damage Assessment and Limited Data Recovery Conducted at Site AZ-P-43-22 Located Near Pine Springs Wide Ruins Chapter, Fort Defiance Agency, Apache County, Arizona|date=May 15, 1996|publisher=San Juan County Museum Association|location=Farmington, NM}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the damage was assessed, it was determined that the site is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. However, this determination was made because there is not enough remaining for it to be of any "information important in prehistory or history."

While development cannot be discontinued simply to protect archaeological sites, having a basic understanding of what might be impacted before development takes place could help protect sites and at least the information they can provide. The Arizona Antiquities Act of 1960 is an example of some ways in which archaeological sites can be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haury|first1=Emil|title=The Arizona Antiquities Act of 1960|journal=Kiva|volume=26|issue=1|pages=19-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vandalism===
Vandalism is also a prominent force of damage to archaeological sites. A range of actions can be considered, including graffiti, carving, deconstruction, and burning. These can be intentional or unintentional. Intentional vandalism is when visitors know that there is an archaeological site and yet still chose to harm it in some way. Unintentional vandalism happens when the visitor vandalizes while not realizing they are at an archaeological site.

An example of an unintentional vandalism is if someone is hunting small game and they see several rock around and decide to pile them up into a berm to shoot from behind. Unbeknownst to them, those rocks were not just naturally placed but actually a collapsed wall of an ancient building, with the majority of it underground. An example of intentional vandalism is graffiti. This can be considered intentional even if the visitors are unaware of the location being an archaeological site, because there is purposeful destruction even of a natural location. [[Tumamoc Hill]] in Tucson, Arizona has been subjected to this form of vandalism for centuries. Tumamoc Hill has a site on its top and has rock art all along the sides. It appears as though visitors throughout history have decided to join in on this tradition by adding their own initials and artwork.&lt;ref name="Tumamoc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Gayle|last2=Boyle|first2=Peter|title=New Perspectives on the Rock Art and Prehistoric Settlement Organization of Tumamoc Hill, Tucson, Arizona|date=2013|publisher=Arizona State Museum, The University of Arizona|location=Tucson|isbn=978-1-889747-93-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to protect an archaeological site from vandalism, a combination of techniques needs to be used. The most important is education of the public. This isn't just in terms of explaining that vandalism is bad, but rather to also educate them on the importance of these sites and what can be lost if they do chose to vandalize the site. This can be as easily done as adding signage. Another strategy is to discourage the activity through adding barriers, patrols, or even full-time observation. Another vital way to help is to routinely survey the area in order to track changes. This technique can also assist in terms of weathering damage.&lt;ref name="Tumamoc" /&gt;

===War===
[[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction ]]
Throughout history, war has also caused much destruction of archaeological and historical sites. The Nazis during World War II destroyed many buildings during the [[planned destruction of Warsaw]], including several palaces and other buildings dating back to before the 13th century. In more recent times, the Taliban destroyed the sacred Buddha statue in Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rashid|first1=Ahmed|title=After 1,700 Years, Buddhas fall to Taliban dynamite|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1326063/After-1700-years-Buddhas-fall-to-Taliban-dynamite.html|website=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ISIS YouTube videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perez|first1=Chris|title=ISIS ransacks museum, destroys 2,000-year-old artifacts|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/26/isis-destroys-ancient-iraqi-artifacts/|website=New York Post|publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevention of this is virtually impossible without large-scale efforts such as those done by the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] that has become popularized by the 2014 movie ''[[The Monuments Men]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==People involved==
===Archaeologists===
The goal of archaeologists as well as other archaeological site conservators is "To preserve the physical remains of our past and to employ them in perpetuating our historical heritage."&lt;ref name="Arch" &gt;{{cite book|last1=South|first1=Stanley|title=The Role of the Archaeologist in the Conservation-Preservation Process in "Preservation and Conservation: Principles and Practices"|date=1976|publisher=The Preservation Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=35-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way an archaeologist can assist in this is to be as thorough in their documentation as possible. This way, even if the site is physically destroyed, there are existing records of how it once was. It is also important that archaeologists use excavation techniques that impact the site as little as possible and saves features. A current technique used is that the entire site is not actually excavated, only parts that are viewed as being able to answer research questions the best.&lt;ref name="Arch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=John|title=Reading 9: Conservation Manual (1923) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=47-49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A previous technique used was to reconstruct walls and other features of the site in order to make it look more like it did when in use, however that has been mostly going out of style and instead the preservation of how the site was found is growing greater and greater in importance.

===Visitors===
Visitors hold a large responsibility in regards to archaeological site preservation. This goes beyond just vandalism. Even just their presence can be harmful for a site. An example of this happened at [[Recapture Canyon]] in Utah. In 2007, the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had to close access to the canyon to off-road vehicles due to the damage it was causing local archaeological sites.&lt;ref name="BLM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crandall|first1=Megan|title=BLM Statement Regarding Proposed Illegal ATV Ride in Recapture Canyon|url=http://www.blm.gov/ut/st/en/info/newsroom/2014/may/blm_statement_regarding.html|website=BLM}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several visitors did not listen to this and actually created a wider trail through the canyon. Also, in May 2014 a large protest was held. This protest consisted of hundreds of protesters riding off-road vehicles through the canyon itself.&lt;ref name="BLM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuzmanic|first1=Joyce|title=Blanding: OHV riders, militia protest BLM ride through Recapture Canyon|url=http://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2014/05/10/jek-ohv-riders-militia-gather-protest-blm/#.VTFlM5MtwjU|publisher=St. George News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large amount of people going through in such a short amount of time, it is very possible that the protest itself caused further damage.

In order to combat further damage, archaeological sites that are open to the public are given trails that do not actually impact the site while still giving visitors a good view of it. It is important for visitors to understand their own impact on archaeological sites they visit. If there is a designated path, they should remain on it. If they see artifacts, they can point to them and take pictures but not pick them up and move them.

===Conservators===
Conservators are the leaders in going the extra mile for archaeological site conservation. It is these specialists that need to formulate the largest and longest-lasting plan. Martha Demas has created a great outline that conservators can rely on in order to create the most impactful plan.&lt;ref name="Reburial" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Demas|first1=Martha|title=Reading 64: Planning of Conservation and Management of Archaeological Sites: A Values-Based Approach (2000) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=653-675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Identification and description

##Physical Condition: ''What is the condition of the site or structure; what are the threats?''
## Management Context: ''What are the current constraints and opportunities that will affect the conservation and management of the site?''
#Response
##Establish Purpose and Policies: ''For what purpose is the site being conserved and managed? How are the values of the site going to be preserved?''
##Set Objectives: ''What will be done to translate policies into actions?''
##Develop Strategies: ''How will the objectives be put into practice?''
##Synthesize and Prepare Plan
#Periodic Review and Revision

==Techniques==
The purpose of any technique used on an archaeological site is to strengthen its ability to resist damage and/or reinstate its cultural significance and ability to teach about its history.

===Restoration===
Restoration is the "returning of the existing fabric of a place to a known earlier state by removing accretions or by reassembling existing components without the introduction of new material."&lt;ref name="Rest"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolfitt|first1=Catherine|title=Reading 51: Preventive Conservation of Ruins: Reconstruction, Reburial and Enclosure (2007) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=503-513}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest difficulty in this technique is the lack of introducing new material. Ideally, this is the primary technique to be used in order to strengthen the site from further damage.

===Reconstruction===
[[File:Pucllana Archaeological site - restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Huaca Pucllana]] Reconstruction Effort]]
Reconstruction is "returning a place to a known earlier state; distinguished from restoration by the introduction of new material into the fabric."&lt;ref name="Rest" /&gt; The aim of restoration is to "preserve and reveal the aesthetic and historic value of the monument and is based on respect for original material and authentic documents."&lt;ref name="ICOMOS"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petzet|first1=Michael|title=International Charters for Conservation and Restoration|date=2004|publisher=ICOMOS|location=Germany|edition=2|url=http://openarchive.icomos.org/431/1/Monuments_and_Sites_1_Charters.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also debate on whether this is considered conservation work or not, due to potential miss use of that fact in order to over-reconstruct.&lt;ref name="Rest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rest2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Nicholas|title=Reading 52: The Reconstruction of Ruins: Principles and Practices (2009) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=514-527}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriateness of this technique is highly dependent upon the region, the amount of known knowledge of the site itself, as well as the actual condition of the site. The older a site, the more difficult it is to be confident in the reconstruction. Reconstruction should also be identifiable upon inspection as well as reversible.&lt;ref name="Rest2" /&gt; A common form of reconstruction is the re-plastering of floors and walls. Due to weathering, the plaster that originally protected surfaces has eroded away and left the surfaces vulnerable. The re-plastering then adds that layer of protection back and in many cases was at least the same technique as originally even if it isn't exactly the same material.

===Recreation/renovation===
Recreation/renovation is the "speculative creation of a presumed earlier state on the basis of surviving evidence from that place to other sites, and on deductions drawn from that evidence using new materials."&lt;ref name="Rest" /&gt; This is the least favorable option as it is less likely to reinstate the originality of the site and many times includes the destruction of existing authentic materials in order to add new materials. It is deemed justifiable if it is the only form of effective conservation available. 
or if conservation measures prove to be unfeasible.&lt;ref name="ICOMOS" /&gt;

===Relocation===
[[File:Abusimbel.jpg|thumb|Mid-move of the Abu Simbel Temples]]
Relocation is a dramatic form of conservation which involves the physical movement of the site or part of the site itself.&lt;ref name="ICOMOS" /&gt; This should only take place if the site would be heavily damaged or even eliminated if it were to not be moved. A famous example of this is the move of the [[Abu Simbel temples]]. The movement of these temples was expensive as well as challenging, but if the move did not take place they would be completely underwater due to the construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]].

'''''Dastūr al-Mulūk''''' ({{lang-fa|دستور الملوک}})&lt;ref&gt;Variants: ''Dastur al-Moluk'', ''Dastur-ol-Moluk'', ''Dastur-ul-Muluk'', ''Dastūr-ul-Mulūk''.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of only three surviving [[administrative handbook]]s from early 18th-century [[Safavid]] [[Iran]] and an important research tool for scholars in [[Iranology]]. The Persian manuscript was edited during the 1960s by the Iranian scholar [[Mohammad Taqi Danesh Pajouh]].

A Russian translation by Dr Vil'danova appeared in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]], in the 1990s. In 2002, an annotated English translation ({{ISBN|983-9379-26-7}}), which contains also a facsimile of what was then thought among scholars to be the complete manuscript, was published and translated into English for the first time by the German scholar [[:de:Christoph Marcinkowski|Christoph Marcinkowski]], based on his dissertation. 

Already in 2000, this dissertation was awarded by then Iranian President [[Mohammad Khatami]] the First Prize for Best Research on Iranian Culture Award for the Year 2000 (International Category) by the Iranian Ministry of Culture. A Persian translation of Marcinkowski's 2002 study by Ali Kordabadi and Mansur Sefatgol appeared in 1385 AH solar (2006 CE) in Tehran at Markaz-e Asnad va Tarikh-e Diplomasi (published by the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs). 

Subsequently, the Iranian scholar [[Iraj Afshar]] discovered and edited the remainder of the manuscript. This part, too, was translated into English and discussed by Dr. Marcinkowski in the ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'', the journal of the [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft|German Oriental Society]] (see below).

===Music competition in Japan===
In 2012, Hebert published ''Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools'',&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2012). ''Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese School''. Dordrecht: Springer Press {{ISBN|9400721773}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book that identified the world's largest music competition and documented the experiences of its participants. With more than 14,000 competing [[wind bands]] and widely admired performances, Japan is an especially important nation for instrumental [[music education]], and Hebert's ethnographic and historical monograph has been described in the journal ''Music Education Research'' as "the most comprehensive information about concert (wind) band participation in any country."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gouzouasis and Alan Henderson (2012). Secondary Student Perspectives on Musical and Educational Outcomes from Participation in Band Festivals.

His book performs the remarkable: a call to explore new ways of doing high school band programmes differently."&lt;ref&gt;Norman Stanfield (2014).

[http://ssjj.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/2/337.extract "Social Science Japan Journal"], 16(2), pp.337-340.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also describes Japanese composers, and has been used for concert program notes by prominent conductors, such as [[Eugene Corporon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lonestarwindorchestra.com/connect/concert-programs/notes-from-japan/ | title=Lonestar Wind Orchestra: Notes from Japan | publisher= Lonestar Wind Orchestra, Dallas, Texas, USA | accessdate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tim Reynish (who describes it as "compulsory reading for anyone interested in Japanese music")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timreynish.com/repertoire/repertoire-by-country/japan.php#windb|title=Repertoire By Country - Repertoire - Tim Reynish|work=timreynish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book helps to explain why [[music competitions]] are a global phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David G.

===Music globalization, transculturation and hybridity===
According to Roberta Pike, Hebert asserts that "research is needed to explore the role of culture in music education."&lt;ref&gt;Roberta E. Pike, Japanese Education: Selective Bibliography of Psychosocial Aspects (Fremont, CA: Jain, 2007), p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; From a global perspective, Hebert has examined how musical practices, technologies, and genres are adopted into new contexts, including educational and religious traditions within institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, D.

Hebert's work has also addressed the challenges of representing [[cultural diversity]] and embracing pluralism in music education, claiming for music a unique role in [[intercultural communication]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2010).

Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Press {{ISBN|1409430804}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book includes contributions by music education researchers from several continents, and discusses "how music contributes to the creation of an emotional climate in schools, and its function in fostering the formation of particular loyalties, identities and dispositions."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G.

(2013). Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education. "Fontes Artis Musicae", 60(2), pp.123-125.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Hebert has argued that "intercultural music transmission" enables national boundaries to be positively transcended via music participation.&lt;ref&gt;David G.

===Historical ethnomusicology===
Hebert's interests in global music [[historiography]] developed as he explored such topics as how European music was adopted in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2012) [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-2178-4_2 "Where are These Bands From? – An Historical Overview"] in ''Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools''.

== Philosophical orientation ==
Hebert claims that [[postmodernist]] discourse no longer offers an adequate explanation for contemporary musical practices, and that most music philosophy suffers from an [[Ethnocentrism |ethnocentric]] orientation. Rather, he advocates a global-historical perspective: that humanity has recently exited a period of "digital prehistory" to enter a phase of "data saturation" through ubiquitous [[mass surveillance]],&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and McCollum, Jonathan (2014).

Parlando, 48(4) [in Hungarian translation, by Mariann Abraham].&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that local and global forces converge to "stamp" the identities of individual actors suspended within a social structure shaped by participatory media. Hebert also argues that music, now most commonly consumed in digital form, may be understood as "content" in a "selfie-stick society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hebert | first = David | last2 = Rykowski | first2 = Mikolaj |title = Music Glocalization: Heritage and Innovation in a Digital Age | publisher = Cambridge Scholars | location = Newcastle, UK | url = http://www.cambridgescholars.com/music-glocalization | year = 2018 }} {{ISBN|9781527503939}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, this new context results in music creation and consumption increasingly transcending earlier connections to space and time, engendering both a blurring and reactionary institutionalization of local genres and historical styles. Consequently, Hebert contends that music education policies and practices should be re-envisioned to emphasize individual originality and empowerment via a musicianship of "flexibility",&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2009) [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-90-481-2700-9_4 "Musicianship, Musical Identity and Meaning as Embodied Practice"] In T.

''Music Educators Journal'', vol.101, no. 3, pp.77-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Music scholars have noted that Hebert "believes music education will become more relevant and effective when it attends more completely to 'creative agency via technology and musical hybridity'," and that "Music learned in school should have some connection to the music the student engages with outside of school and that musicianship should be understood as an ‘embodied practice situated in sociocultural contexts’."&lt;ref&gt;Jeananne Nichols (2011).

Hebert and Marja Heimonen (2013). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10632913.2013.803421 "Public Policy and Music Education in Norway and Finland"].

''Criticism.'' 
While largely accepted, some of Hebert's conclusions have faced opposition from other scholars. His research in Japan controversially suggests that some important aspects of music history are inaccurately "remembered", and he has argued that similar issues may be found in common music history textbooks in the US and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and McCollum, Jonathan (2014). "Philosophy of History and Theory in Historical Ethnomusicology". In J. McCollum and D. G. Hebert, Eds., ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology''. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books / Rowman &amp; Littlefield, pp.85-148 {{ISBN|0739168266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebert asserts that music contests can have not only positive, but also negative consequences for participants and the musical traditions they display, and require careful design for desirable outcomes. Some music educators defend traditional pedagogies that Hebert and others claim need to be redeveloped or supplemented with new approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fonder [https://genius.com/Mark-fonder-professor-of-music-education-at-ithaca-college-no-default-or-reset-necessary-large-ensembles-enrich-many-annotated "No Default or Reset Necessary – Large Ensembles Enrich Many."]; See debate between Hebert and Kenneth Phillips in 2008, [http://www.stthomas.edu/rimeonline/vol6/index.htm "Research and Issues in Music Education"], 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Walker and [[Roger Scruton]] would disagree with Hebert's position regarding the value of [[popular music pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Walker (2007). ''Music Education: Cultural Values, Social Change and Innovation''. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas.&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent Bates has argued that a "cosmopolitan" perspective may already receive excessive emphasis in the field of music education,&lt;ref&gt;Vincent C. Bates (2014). [http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Bates13_1.pdf "Rethinking cosmopolitanism in music education."]. Action, Criticism, and Theory for Music Education 13(1): 310–27.&lt;/ref&gt; while Thomas Regelski has suggested that "culture" – a concept emphasized in much of Hebert's writings – is a nebulous construct with questionable utility for the field.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Regelski (2010). [http://www2.siba.fi/musiikkikasvatuslehti/userfiles/FJME_vol13_1_nettiversio.pdf "Culturalism, Multi-Culturalism, and Multi-Musical Prosperity."].

Taking for granted an equal [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|moral status]] as [[person]]s, '''difference feminism''' asserts that there are differences between men and women but that no value judgment can be placed upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/carol-gilligan/|title = Carol Gilligan |website= Psychology's Feminist Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "difference feminism" developed during the "equality-versus-difference debate" in American feminism in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Joan|title=Deconstructing Equality-Versus-Difference: Or, the Uses of Post-structuralist Theory for Feminism|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1988|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.2307/3177997|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently fell out of favor and use. In the 1990s feminists addressed the binary logic of "difference" versus "equality" and moved on from it, notably with postmodern and/or deconstructionist approaches that either dismantled or did not depend on that dichotomy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bock|first1=Gisela|last2=James|first2=Susan|title=Beyond Equality and Difference|date=1992|publisher=Routledge|isbn = 9780415079891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|location = London|isbn = 9781446228043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference feminism did not require a commitment to [[gender essentialism|essentialism]]. Most strains of difference feminism did not argue that there was a biological, inherent, ahistorical, or otherwise "essential" link between womanhood and traditionally feminine values, habits of mind (often called "ways of knowing"&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiebinger|first1=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=2 footnote 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These feminists simply sought to recognize that, in the present, women and men are significantly different and to explore the devalued "feminine" characteristics.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tandon|first1=Neeru|title=Feminism: A Paradigm Shift|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strains of difference feminism, for example [[Mary Daly]]'s, argue not just that women and men were different, and had different values or different ways of knowing, but that women and their values were superior to men's.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This viewpoint does not require essentialism, although there is ongoing debate about whether Daly's feminism is essentialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoagland|first1=Sarah Lucia|last2=Frye|first2=Marilyn|title=Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandilands|first1=Catriona|title=The Good-Natured Feminist Ecofeminism and the Quest for Democracy|date=1999|pages=chapter 5: "Cyborgs and Queers"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Difference feminism was developed by feminists in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to popular liberal feminism (also known as "[[equality feminism]]"), which emphasized the similarities between women and men in order to argue for equal treatment for women. Difference feminism, although it still aimed at equality between men and women, emphasized the differences between men and women and argued that identicality or sameness are not necessary in order for men and women, and masculine and feminine values, to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal feminism aimed to make society and law gender-neutral, since it saw recognition of gender difference as a barrier to rights and participation within liberal democracy, while difference feminism held that gender-neutrality harmed women "whether by impelling them to imitate men, by depriving society of their distinctive contributions, or by letting them participate in society only on terms that favor men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference feminism drew on earlier nineteenth-century strains of thought, for example the work of German writer [[Elise Oelsner]], which held that not only should women be allowed into formerly male-only spheres and institutions (e.g. public life, science) but that those institutions should also be expected to change in a way that recognizes the value of traditionally devalued feminine ethics (like care [see [[ethics of care]]]). On the latter point, many feminists have re-read the phrase "difference feminism" in a way that asks "what difference does feminism make?" (e.g. to the practice of science) rather than "what differences are there between men and women"?&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Essentialism and Difference Feminism==
Some have argued that the thought of certain prominent second-wave feminists, like psychologist [[Carol Gilligan]] and radical feminist theologian [[Mary Daly]], is "essentialist." In philosophy essentialism is the belief that "(at least some) objects have (at least some) essential properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accidental vs Essential Properties|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/essential-accidental/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of sexual politics essentialism is taken to mean that "women" and "men" have fixed essences or essential properties (e.g. behavioral or personality traits) that cannot be changed. However, essentialist interpretations of Daly and Gilligan have been questioned by some feminist scholars, who argue that charges of "essentialism" are often used more as terms of abuse than as theoretical critiques based on evidence,&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyes|first1=Cressida J.|title=Anti-Essentialism in Practice: Carol Gilligan and Feminist Philosophy|journal=Hypatia|date=1997|volume=13|issue=3|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1997.tb00009.x|pages=142–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braidotti|first1=Rosi|title="Essentialism" in Feminism and Psychoanalysis: A Critical Dictionary|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not accurately reflect Gilligan&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; or Daly's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suhonen|first1=Marja|title="Toward Biophilic Be-ing: Mary Daly's Feminist Metaethics and the Question of Essentialism" in Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly|date=2000|publisher=Penn State University Press|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; views.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19391">{{about|a measure of medication or chemical exposure||Dose (disambiguation)}}

A '''dose''' is a measured quantity of a medicine, nutrient, or pathogen which is delivered as a unit. The greater the quantity delivered, the larger the dose. Doses are most commonly measured for compounds in medicine. The term is usually applied to the quantity of a [[drug]] or other agent administered for [[therapeutic]] purposes, but may be used to describe any case where a substance is introduced to the body. In [[nutrition]], the term is usually applied to how much of a specific [[nutrient]] is in a person's diet or in a particular food, meal, or [[dietary supplement]]. For [[bacteria]]l or [[Virus|viral]] agents, dose typically refers to the amount of the pathogen required to infect a host. For information on dosage of toxic substances, see [[Toxicology]]. For information on excessive intake of pharmaceutical agents, see [[Drug overdose]].

== Factors affecting dose ==
A ‘dose’ of any chemical or biological agent ([[active ingredient]]) has several factors which are critical to its effectiveness. The first is [[concentration]], that is, how much of the agent is being administered to the body at once.

Another factor is the duration of exposure. Some drugs or supplements have a [[Modified-release dosage (medicine)|slow-release feature]] in which portions of the medication are metabolized at different times, which changes the impacts the active ingredients have on the body. Some substances are meant to be taken in small doses over large periods of time to maintain a constant level in the body, while others are meant to have a large impact once and be expelled from the body after its work is done. It’s entirely dependent on the function of the drug or supplement.

The [[route of administration]] is important as well. Whether a drug is [[Ingestion|ingested]] orally, [[injection (medicine)|injected]] into a muscle or vein, [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorbed]] through a [[Mucous membrane|mucus membrane]], or any of the other types of administration routes, affects how quickly the substance will be metabolized by the body and thus effects the concentration of the active ingredient(s). [[Dose–response relationship|Dose-response curves]] may illustrate the relationship of these metabolic effects.

== Medicines  ==

=== Over-the-counter medications ===
In over-the-counter medicines, dosage is based on age. Typically, different doses are recommended for children 6 years and under, children aged 6 to 12 years, and persons 12 years and older, but outside of those ranges the guidance is slim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ucm209647.htm|title=How Drugs are Developed and Approved - OTC (Nonprescription) Drugs|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead to serial under or overdosing, as smaller people take more than they should and larger people take less. Over-the-counter medications are typically accompanied by a set of instructions directing the patient to take a certain small dose, followed by another small dose if their symptoms don’t subside. Under-dosing is a common problem in pharmacy, as predicting an average dose that is effective for all individuals is extremely challenging because body weight and size impacts how the dose acts within the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knopf|first=Hildtraud|last2=Wolf|first2=Ingrid-Katharina|last3=Sarganas|first3=Giselle|last4=Zhuang|first4=Wanli|last5=Rascher|first5=Wolfgang|last6=Neubert|first6=Antje|date=2013-01-01|title=Off-label medicine use in children and adolescents: results of a population-based study in Germany|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=13|pages=631|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-631|issn=1471-2458|pmc=3706213|pmid=23822744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prescription drugs ===
Prescription drug dosage is based typically on body weight.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lahc.edu/classes/nursing/nurs302/chapter14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs come with a recommended dose in milligrams or micrograms per kilogram of body weight, and that is used in conjunction with the patient's body weight to determine a safe dosage. In single dosage scenarios, the patient's body weight and the drug's recommended dose per kilogram are used to determine a safe one-time dose. In drugs where multiple doses of treatment are needed in a day, the physician must take into account information regarding the total amount of the drug which is safe to use in one day, and how that should be broken up into intervals for the most effective treatment for the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Sheng-dong|last2=Zhu|first2=Ling-ling|last3=Chen|first3=Meng|last4=Xia|first4=Ping|last5=Zhou|first5=Quan|date=2016-04-12|title=Weight-based dosing in medication use: what should we know?|journal=Patient Preference and Adherence|volume=10|pages=549–560|doi=10.2147/PPA.S103156|issn=1177-889X|pmc=4835122|pmid=27110105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medication underdosing occurs commonly when physicians write prescriptions for a dosage that is correct for a certain time, but fails to increase the dosage as the patient needs (i.e. weight based dosing in children, or increasing dosages of chemotherapy drugs if a patient’s condition worsens).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288319635|title=Research paper insights: Medication underdosing and underprescribing: Issues that may contribute to polypharmacy, poor outcomes|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical cannabis ===
[[Medical cannabis]] is used to treat the symptoms of a wide variety of diseases and conditions. The dose of cannabis depends on the individual, the condition being treated, and the ratio of [[cannabidiol]] (CBD) to [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) in the cannabis. CBD is a chemical component of cannabis that is not intoxicating and used to treat conditions like [[epilepsy]] and other neuropsychiatric disorders. THC is a chemical component of cannabis that is [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]]. It has been used to treat nausea and discomfort in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy treatment. For anxiety, depression, and other mental health ailments, a CBD to THC ratio of 10 to 1 is recommended.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;https://www.projectcbd.org/sites/projectcbd/files/downloads/pcbd_dosingguide_2-12-2015_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; For cancer and neurological conditions, a CBD to THC ratio of 1 to 1 is recommended.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The correct dosage for a patient is dependent on their individual reaction to both chemicals, and therefore the dosing must be continually adjusted once treatment is initiated to find the right balance.

There is limited consensus throughout the scientific community regarding the effectiveness of medicinal cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.prevention.com/health/14-uses-medical-marijuana|title=How Effective Is Medical Marijuana? Here's A Closer Look At 14 Different Uses|date=2015-04-22|work=Prevention|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobson|first=Roni|title=The Case for Medical Marijuana|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/medical-marijuana-how-the-evidence-stacks-up/|journal=Scientific American Mind|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=15|doi=10.1038/scientificamericanmind0514-15|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer ===
Calculating drug dosages for treatment for more serious diseases like cancer is commonly done through measuring the Body Surface Area of the patient. There are approximately 25 different formulae for measuring a patient’s body surface area, none of them exact.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; See also [[Body surface area]]. Because of the variety of methods to select when determining a patient’s body surface area, studies show that choosing the best method for an individual patient is a difficult task, and often a patient receives too much or too little medication based on physical anomalies that don’t necessarily fit perfectly with the portfolio of the body surface area.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Redlarski|first=Grzegorz|last2=Palkowski|first2=Aleksander|last3=Krawczuk|first3=Marek|date=2016-06-21|title=Body surface area formulae: an alarming ambiguity|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=27966|doi=10.1038/srep27966|issn=2045-2322|pmc=4914842|pmid=27323883|bibcode=2016NatSR...627966R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because these methods are inexact, they are typically adjusted by what’s known as ‘toxicity-adjusting dosing’ where physicians monitor the immune suppression and adjust dosing according to the results to minimize either under and overdosing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gurney|first=H|date=2002-04-22|title=How to calculate the dose of chemotherapy|journal=British Journal of Cancer|volume=86|issue=8|pages=1297–1302|doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6600139|issn=0007-0920|pmc=2375356|pmid=11953888}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trial-and-error method has been shown to be risky to the patient and costly to healthcare companies, as well as inefficient, because of the constant monitoring that is required. Research is occurring constantly to develop new dosing methods that are more accurate and safe for the consumer.

=== Ongoing research ===
Another approach that’s been investigated recently is dosing on a molecular level, either through conventional delivery systems, nanoparticle delivery, light-triggered delivery, or other less known/used methods. By combining these drugs with a system that detects the concentration of drug particles in the blood, proper dosing could be achieved for each individual patient. Research in this field was initiated with monitoring of small-molecule cocaine levels in undiluted blood serum with electrochemical aptamer-based sensing. DNA aptamers, which are peptides that have with specific target molecules that they search for, fold in response to the molecule when they find it, and this technology was used in a microfluidic detection system to create an electrochemical signal that physicians can read. Researchers tested it on cocaine detection and found that it successfully found trace amounts of cocaine in blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swensen|first=James S.|last2=Xiao|first2=Yi|last3=Ferguson|first3=Brian S.|last4=Lubin|first4=Arica A.|last5=Lai|first5=Rebecca Y.|last6=Heeger|first6=Alan J.|last7=Plaxco|first7=Kevin W.|last8=Soh|first8=H. Tom.|date=2009-04-01|title=Continuous, Real-Time Monitoring of Cocaine in Undiluted Blood Serum via a Microfluidic, Electrochemical Aptamer-Based Sensor|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=131|issue=12|pages=4262–4266|doi=10.1021/ja806531z|issn=0002-7863|pmc=2715559|pmid=19271708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This research was expanded upon and led to the creation of a product called MEDIC (microfluidic electrochemical detector for in vivo continuous monitoring) developed by faculty at the University of California at Santa Barbara. MEDIC is an instrument that can continuously determine the concentrations of different molecules in the blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Brian Scott|last2=Hoggarth|first2=David A.|last3=Maliniak|first3=Dan|last4=Ploense|first4=Kyle|last5=White|first5=Ryan J.|last6=Woodward|first6=Nick|last7=Hsieh|first7=Kuangwen|last8=Bonham|first8=Andrew J.|last9=Eisenstein|first9=Michael|date=2013-11-27|title=Real-Time, Aptamer-Based Tracking of Circulating Therapeutic Agents in Living Animals|url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/213/213ra165|journal=Science Translational Medicine|language=en|volume=5|issue=213|pages=213ra165|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3007095|issn=1946-6234|pmc=4010950|pmid=24285484}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blood doesn’t have to be mixed with anything prior to testing to create a ‘serum’ as the first device did. MEDIC can detect a wide variety of drug molecules and biomarkers. In trials, early models of the device failed after about half an hour because the proteins in whole blood clung to the sensors and clogged the components. This problem was solved via a second chamber that allowed a liquid buffer to flow over the sensors with the blood, without mixing or disturbing the blood, so the results remained unchanged. The device is still in clinical trials and actual implementation in medicine is likely years away, however in the interim, its creators estimate that it could also be used in the pharmaceutical industry to allow for better testing in Phase 3 clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.futurity.org/device-sorts-blood-watch-drugs-real-time/|title=Device tests blood to watch drugs in real-time - Futurity|date=2014-01-22|work=Futurity|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vaccines ==
Vaccinations (see [[Vaccine]]) are typically dosed in milliliters because most are administered as liquids. Each individual vaccine comes with constraints regarding at what age they should be administered, how many doses must be given, and over what period of time. There are 15 vaccines that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends every person (in America) receive between birth and 18 years of age to protect themselves against various infectious agents that can cause lifelong problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent-shell.html|title=Birth-18 Years Immunization Schedule - Shell {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most vaccines require multiple doses for full immunity, given in recommended intervals depending on the vaccine. There are several typical vaccination routes:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3085.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Intramuscular injection: the needle is inserted perpendicular to the skin into the muscle, beneath the skin and (subcutaneous) tissues that rest on top. 
* Subcutaneous injection: the needle is inserted at a 45 degree angle into the (subcutaneous) tissue between the outer layer of the skin and the muscle. 
* Nasal: the vaccine is sprayed into the nose and absorbed through the nasal passage.
* Oral: the vaccine is swallowed and ingested.

== Nutrition ==
For healthy humans, experts recommend daily intake quantities of certain vitamins and minerals. The Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, and National Academy of Sciences sets a recommended Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) in several forms:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/Health_Information/Dietary_Reference_Intakes.aspx|title=Office of Dietary Supplements - Nutrient Recommendations : Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)|website=ods.od.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): average daily intake which adequately meets the nutrient requirements of 97-98% of healthy individuals. 
# Adequate Intake (AI): established when the evidence gathered for an RDA is inconclusive, An AI is assumed to recommend a daily amount to meet nutritional adequacy. 
# Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): maximum amount of a nutrient which can be consumed without causing adverse impacts to an individual’s health. 
DRIs are established for elements, vitamins, and macronutrients. Common elemental&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t3/|title=- Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D - NCBI Bookshelf|last=Calcium|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee to Review Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D. and|last2=Ross|first2=A.

Dosages for all three are established by both gender and age.

Individuals take vitamin and mineral supplements to promote healthier lifestyles and prevent development of chronic diseases. There is no conclusive evidence linking continued vitamin and mineral supplement intake with longevity of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/MVMS-Consumer/|title=Office of Dietary Supplements - Multivitamin/mineral Supplements|website=ods.od.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infectious dose==
The infectious dose of a [[pathogen]] is the number of cells required to infect the host. All pathogens have an infectious dose typically given in number of cells. The infectious dose varies by organism and can be dependent on the specific type of strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmid-Hempel|first=Paul|last2=Frank|first2=Steven A|date=2017-04-07|title=Pathogenesis, Virulence, and Infective Dose|journal=PLoS Pathogens|volume=3|issue=10|pages=1372–3|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0030147|issn=1553-7366|pmc=2042013|pmid=17967057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pathogens can infect a host with only a few cells, while others require millions or billions.

Examples of infectious doses, ranked loosely in increasing order:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.fsis.usda.gov/shared/PDF/Atlanta2010/Slides_FSEC_JGreig_Doses.pdf?redirecthttp=true&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Enterohemorrhagic E. coli]] (causes hemorrhaging of the intestines): 10 bacteria cells
* [[Hepatitis A]]: 10-100 virus particles
* [[Norovirus]] (commonly called ‘a stomach bug’): 10-100 virus particles 
* [[Rotavirus]] (severe diarrhea, can be fatal): 10-100 virus particles
* [[Shigella]] (shigellosis): 500 bacteria cells
* [[Streptococcus pyogenes]] (Group A strep throat): 1000 bacteria cells
* [[Salmonella]]: varies by strain, 100-1 billion bacteria cells 
* [[Vibrio cholerae]] (Cholera): 1000-100,000,000 bacteria cells
Typically, stomach acids can kill bacteria below the infectious dosing rage for a given pathogen and keep the host from feeling symptoms or falling ill. Complexes constructed by fat can protect infectious agents from stomach acid, making fatty foods more likely to contain pathogens that successfully infect the host. For individuals with low or reduced stomach acid concentrations, in infectious dosage for a pathogen will be lower than normal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Rather than being administered by a physician or individual, infectious dosages are transmitted to a person from other persons or the environment, are generally accidental, and result in adverse side effects until the pathogen is defeated by the individual's immune system or flushed out of the individual's system by excretory processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11095">[[Image:Carbon cycle-cute diagram.svg|thumb|Students in Environmental Engineering Science typically combine scientific studies of the biosphere with mathematical, analytical and design tools found in the engineering fields]]
'''Environmental engineering science''' ('''EES''') is a [[multidisciplinary]] field of [[engineering science]] that combines the [[biological]], [[chemical]] and physical sciences with the field of engineering.  This major traditionally requires the student to take basic engineering classes in fields such as [[thermodynamics]], advanced [[math]], computer modeling and [[simulation]] and technical classes in subjects such as [[statics]], [[mechanics]], [[hydrology]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. As the student progresses, the upper division elective classes define a specific field of study for the student with a choice in a [[Environmental Engineering Science#Electives|range]] of science, technology and engineering related classes.&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt;

==Difference with related fields==
[[Image:CalifAcadSciRoof 0820.JPG|thumb|right|Graduates of Environmental Engineering Science can go on to work on the technical aspects of designing a [[Green roof|Living Roof]] like the one pictured here at the [[California Academy of Science|California Academy of the Sciences]]]]
As a recently created program, environmental engineering science has not yet been incorporated into the terminology found among [[Environment (biophysical)|environmentally]] focused professionals.  In the few engineering colleges that offer this major, the curriculum shares more classes in common with [[environmental engineering]] than it does with [[environmental science]].  Typically, EES students follow a similar course curriculum with environmental engineers until their fields diverge during the last year of college.  The majority of the environmental engineering students must take classes designed to connect their knowledge of the environment to modern [[building materials]] and [[construction]] methods.  This is meant to direct the environmental engineer into a field where they will more than likely assist in building [[wastewater treatment|treatment facilities]], preparing [[environmental impact assessment]]s or helping to mitigate [[air pollution]] from specific point sources.

Meanwhile, the environmental engineering science student will choose a direction for their [[career]].  From the range of electives they have to choose from, these students can move into a fields such as the design of [[Radioactive waste|nuclear storage facilities]], bacterial [[bioreactors]] or [[environmental policies]]. These students combine the practical design background of an engineer with the detailed theory found in many of the [[biology|biological]] and [[physical sciences]].

==Description at universities==
===Stanford University===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Civil and Environmental Engineering department at Stanford University provides the following description for their program in Environmental Engineering and Science:
The Environmental Engineering and Science (EES) program focuses on the chemical and biological processes involved in water quality engineering, water and air pollution, remediation and hazardous substance control, human exposure to pollutants, environmental biotechnology, and environmental protection.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


===UC Berkeley===
The College of Engineering at [[UC Berkeley]] defines Environmental Engineering Science, including the following:&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{cite news|pages=27–28 |title=Engineering Announcement 2008-2009 |url=http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/EngAnn08.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203005457/http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/EngAnn08.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is a multidisciplinary field requiring an integration of physical, chemical and biological principles with engineering analysis for environmental protection and restoration. The program incorporates courses from many departments on campus to create a discipline that is rigorously based in science and engineering, while addressing a wide variety of environmental issues. Although an environmental engineering option exists within the civil engineering major, the engineering science curriculum provides a more broadly based foundation in the sciences than is possible in civil engineering
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Massachusetts Institute of Technology===

At [[MIT]], the major is described in their curriculum, including the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MIT Course Catalog: Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. |url=http://web.mit.edu/catalogue/degre.engin.civil.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering Science emphasizes the fundamental physical, chemical, and biological processes necessary for understanding the interactions between man and the environment. Issues considered include the provision of clean and reliable water supplies, flood forecasting and protection, development of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources, causes and implications of climate change, and the impact of human activities on natural cycles
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Vacuum distillation of DMSO at 70C.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Wet labs are required as part of the lower division curriculum]]

==Lower division coursework==

Lower division coursework in this field requires the student to take several laboratory-based classes in calculus-based physics, chemistry, biology, [[Mathematical programming|programming]] and [[analysis]].  This is intended to give the student background information in order to introduce them to the engineering fields and to prepare them for more technical information in their upper division coursework.

==Upper division coursework==
[[Image:FAE visualization.jpg|left|thumb|Students learn to integrate their math and statistics with software to perform analysis of physical [[systems]] like the [[Finite Element Analysis]] shown above]]

==Post graduation work==

The multidisciplinary approach in Environmental Engineering Science gives the student expertise in technical fields related to their own personal interest.  While some graduates choose to use this major to go to graduate school,&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt; students who choose to work often go into the fields of [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[environmental engineering]], [[biotechnology]], and research.  However, the less technical math, programming and writing background gives the students opportunities to pursue [[information technology|IT]] work and [[technical writing]].

'''Erotic spanking''' is the act of [[spanking]] another person for the [[sexual arousal]] or gratification of either or both parties. Activities range from a spontaneous smack on bare buttocks during a sexual activity, to occasional [[sexual roleplay]], such as [[ageplay]], to [[Corporal punishment in the home|domestic discipline]] and may involve the use of a hand or the use of a variety of spanking implements, such as a [[spanking paddle]] or cane.&lt;ref&gt;Markham, Jules. ''Consensual Spanking''. (Adlibbed Ltd., 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  Erotic spankings are commonly combined with other forms of sexual [[foreplay]]. The most common type of erotic spanking is administered on the bare [[buttocks]],&lt;ref name="Plante"/&gt; but can also be combined with [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], in order to heighten sexual arousal and feelings of helplessness.

Many cultures describe pain as an aphrodisiac. For example, the [[Kama Sutra]], in particular, goes into specific detail on how to properly strike a partner during sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Love | first = Brenda | title = [[The Encyclopedia of Unusual Sex Practices]] | year = 1992 | publisher = Greenwich Editions | location = London | pages = 113 | isbn = 0-86288-223-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and literature ==
[[Image:Tomba Della Fustigazione.jpg|thumb|267px|left|[[Fresco]] inside the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Tomb of the Whipping]] where two men are portrayed flagellating a woman in an erotic situation]]

Routine corporal punishment of women by their husbands does still exist in some parts of the world,&lt;ref&gt;Beichman, Arnold, [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/sep/30/20050930-093555-8842r/ "Where wife-beating is up for debate"], ''[[Washington Times]]'', 2 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haj-yahia |first=Muhammad M. |date=August 2003|title= Beliefs About Wife Beating Among Arab Men from Israel: The Influence of Their Patriarchal Ideology|journal=Journal of Family Violence |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=193–206 |doi=10.1023/A:1024012229984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mynation.wordpress.com/2007/12/12/most-indian-women-okay-with-wife-beating/ |title=Most Indian women okay with wife beating |accessdate=30 October 2008 |author=498A_Crusader |publisher=MyNation Foundation |date=12 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201030433/http://mynation.wordpress.com/2007/12/12/most-indian-women-okay-with-wife-beating/ |archivedate=1 February 2009 |df=dmy }}{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, today, spanking of an adult tends to be confined to erotic spanking or to BDSM contexts.

One of the earliest depictions of erotic flagellation is found in the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Tomb of the Whipping]] from the fifth century BC, named after its depictions of eroticized flagellation.

Representations of erotic spanking and flagellation make up a large portion of Victorian pornography, for instance ''1000 Nudes'' by Koetzle.&lt;ref&gt;Scheid, Uwe and Koetzle, Michael (1994). ''1000 Nudes: Uwe Scheid Collection''. Cologne: Taschen, {{ISBN|3-8228-5569-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Hundreds of thousands of engravings, photographs, and literary depictions of spanking and flagellation ("birching") fantasies circulated during the Victorian era, including erotic novellas like ''[[The Whippingham Papers]]'', ''[[The Birchen Bouquet]]'', ''[[Exhibition of Female Flagellants]]''&lt;ref name="Marcus"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between women: friendship, desire, and marriage in Victorian England | first=Sharon | last=Marcus | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2007 | isbn=0-691-12835-9 | page=147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Whore's Story: women, pornography, and the British novel, 1684-1830 | series=Ideologies of Desire | first=Bradford Keyes | last=Mudge | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-19-513505-9 | page=246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the pornographic comic opera ''[[Lady Bumtickler's Revels]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction | first=John | last=Sutherland | authorlink=John Sutherland (author) | publisher=Stanford University Press | year=1990 | isbn=0-8047-1842-3 | page=307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since their deaths, many well-known people have been discovered to have enjoyed spankings for erotic purposes or emotional gratification, including the noted British Army officer [[T. E. Lawrence]] ("[[Lawrence of Arabia]]"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = Jeremy | year = 1989 | title = The Authorized Biography of T. E.

Other examples include the poet [[Algernon Swinburne]], as implied repeatedly in his poetry, and the philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bacdefrancais.net/fessee.php|title=Les Confessions de Jean-Jacques Rousseau: La Fessée - Livre I|website=Bac de Français|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; as detailed in his autobiography ''Confessions'':&lt;ref name="Freud"&gt;{{cite book|title=Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality|year=1905|author=Sigmund Freud|authorlink=Sigmund Freud}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keenan has argued that spanking fetishism is a form of sexual orientation,&lt;ref&gt;Jillian Keenan, [http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/08/18/is_kink_a_sexual_orientation.html], ''Slate'', August 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; which should not be considered a mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Jillian Keenan, [http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/03/sexual_kinks_in_the_dsm_v_paraphilic_disorders_describe_unhappy_kinksters.html], ''Slate'', March 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==

=== Implements ===
A spanking may be carried out with the use of a bare or [[gloves|gloved]] hand, or with any of a variety of implements, including a [[Paddle (spanking)|paddle]], [[strap]], [[hairbrush]], [[feather duster]]&lt;ref&gt;Constable, Nicole ''Maid to Order in Hong Kong: Stories of Migrant Workers'' Cornell University Press, 2007 p.51&lt;/ref&gt; or [[belt (clothing)|belt]].&lt;ref name="Plante"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rebecca F. Plante|url=http://haworthpress.com/store/ArticleAbstract.asp?ID=65902|title=Sexual Spanking, the Self, and the Construction of Deviance|journal=Journal of Homosexuality |publisher=[[Haworth Press]]|doi=10.1300/J082v50n02_04 | year = 2006 | volume = 50 | pages = 59–79|pmid=16803759|issue=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular implements are [[walking stick (device)|canes]], [[riding crop]]s, [[whip (implement)|whip]]s, [[switch (rod)|switch]]es, [[birching|birch]]es, [[sneaker (footwear)|sneaker]]s, phonebooks, rolled-up catalogs or newspapers, [[rulers]] or ''[[martinet]]''.

=== Costume ===
A '''spank skirt''' or '''spanking skirt''' has an additional opening in back designed to expose the buttocks. While the name ''spank skirt'' suggests that the wearer could be spanked "bare bottom" without removing or repositioning the skirt, this item may be worn for reasons other than spanking, for instance, exposure.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Considered [[Fetish clothes|fetish wear]], spank skirts are typically tight-fitting and made of fetishistic materials (such as [[leather]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] or [[latex]]). Regardless of the gender of the wearer, spank skirts are usually considered female attire. The male gender role equivalent might be [[Chaps|motorcycle chaps]].

Other garments associated with spanking as well as humiliation are ruffled or [[rhumba panties]], women's panties with rows of ruffles on the rear panel or outside.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

=== Apparatus ===
A '''spanking bench''' or '''spanking horse''' is a piece of furniture used to position a spankee on, with or without restraints. They come in many sizes and styles, the most popular of which is similar to a [[sawhorse]] with a padded top and rings for restraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=I Was a Teenage Dominatrix: a memoir | first=Shawna | last=Kenney | authorlink=Shawna Kenney | publisher=[[Last Gasp]] | year=2002 | isbn=0-86719-530-4 | page=49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century British [[dominatrix]] Mrs. [[Theresa Berkley]] became famous for her invention of the [[Berkley Horse]], a similar form of BDSM apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Autumn | last=Stanley | title=Mothers and daughters of invention: notes for a revised history of technology, Volume 36 | publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] | year=1995 | isbn=0-8135-2197-1 | pages=585–586 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3138">'''EuroNanoForum 2009''' was the fourth conference in a set of [[Europe]]an [[nanotechnology]] conferences organized within the framework of national presidencies and promoted by DG research, Directorate G.

==Previous Conferences==

The EuroNanoForum 2009 conference built up on the success of EuroNanoForum 2003, EuroNanoForum 2005 and EuronanoForum 2007 and addressed “Nanotechnology for sustainable economy”. The focus was to grow opportunity and responsibility to leveraging nanotechnology to reduce [[pollution]], conserve resources and, ultimately, build a "clean" environmentally sustainable economy as well as to address concerns for the safe and responsible the development of nanotechnology.

The EuroNanoForum 2009 was organized as a four-day conference taking place from June 2–5, 2009 at [[Prague]] Conference Centre (CCP) within the frame of the Czech presidency, which ran from January to June 2009. The conference was conceived as an accompanying event of the presidency, under the auspices of the Czech Ministry for Education Youth and Sports (MEYS) as a support action of NMP programme of FP7. The EuroNanoForum 2009 focused on the “Nanotechnology for sustainable economy” exploring environmental as well as societal impact of the industrial applications of nanotechnology. This issue involves not only very broad and diverse areas of nanotechnology R&amp;D such as nanomaterials, nanoelectronics and [[photonics]], and bionanotechnologies but also energetics, [[environmental engineering]], [[toxicology]] and even [[climatology]]. This created a unique opportunity for researches and industrial experts coming from diverse fields of science and technology to meet each other and get involved in inspiring and fruitful dialogue or start cross-fertilising collaboration.

[[Fair trade]] is where a farmer or craftsperson is paid a fair price for their product, one that represents its true worth, not just the lowest price that it is possible to pay. This is a price that covers the cost of production and enables the producer to live with dignity.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Trade? He Tauhokohoko I Runga I Te Tika?'' (2nd ed, Global Education Centre, Wellington, New Zealand, 2008) at 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Fair Trade New Zealand is an organisation that was launched in 2005 which supports fair trade by ensuring that farmers and workers' rights are not exploited.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Australia New Zealand [http://fairtrade.org.nz/What-is-Fairtrade/Who-we-are "Who We Are"] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Oxfam]] New Zealand, there are several companies to support fairly traded goods from, which are exported to New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam New Zealand [https://www.oxfam.org.nz/what-we-do/issues/fair-trade "Fair trade"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013-2014 there were 42 Fair Trade Licensees and Traders in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2013/14 Annual Report ''Fair Trade By The Numbers''.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2015-2016 this number rose to 54 Fair Trade Licensees and Traders in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2015/16 Annual Report ''Fair Trade By The Numbers''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gwen Green, Oxfam's Engagement Director, says: "when farmers are paid fairly for their products, we see people able to make real improvements to their lives and their communities. Producers who used to struggle to feed their families are able to give their children an education, and communities can build schools and develop businesses. It is one of the smart solutions to poverty".&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam New Zealand [https://www.oxfam.org.nz/news/kiwis-have-fairtrade-cuppa-give-farmers-fair-go "Kiwis have a Fairtrade cuppa to give farmers a fair go"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Wellington became the first fair trade capital city in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Wellington Fair Trade [https://www.wellingtonfairtrade.org.nz "Fair Trade City"] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Whangarei was recognised by the Fair Trade Association of Australia New Zealand as being one of four fair trade councils in New Zealand, and the first fair trade district in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Lambly [http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/northland/91210547/whangarei-becomes-first-fair-trade-district-in-nz "Whangarei becomes first Fair Trade District in New Zealand"] (5 April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fair trade and human rights==
[[International human rights law]] is founded on the idea that all human beings have the same set of fundamental rights.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moeckli, Sangeeta Shah and Sandesh Sivakumaran ''International Human Rights Law'' (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, 2014) at 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to equality and non-discrimination provides that human beings, regardless of their status or membership of a particular group, are entitled to the same set of rights.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moeckli, Sangeeta Shah and Sandesh Sivakumaran ''International Human Rights Law'' (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, 2014) at 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), adopted in 1948, includes in it protections against discrimination and slavery, and provides for the rights to freedom of association and to form and join trade unions, the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work, to protection against unemployment and the right to equal pay for equal work.&lt;ref&gt;Adam McBeth, Justin Nolan and Simon Rice ''The International Law of Human Rights'' (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 2011) at 554.&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of equality is reflected in the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR): 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights'.

Freedom from slavery and compulsory labour is recognised in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR).&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom from slavery and the prohibition of the slave trade refers to the practice of treating human beings as property.&lt;ref&gt;Adam McBeth, Justin Nolan and Simon Rice ''The International Law of Human Rights'' (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 2011) at 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Forced or compulsory labour is also prohibited under article 8 of the Covenant, although it is subject to exceptions. That is, performance of labour as part of a prison sentence will not breach a state's obligations.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art 8(3)(b).&lt;/ref&gt; The right to employment with just and favourable conditions is recognised in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR), and these conditions should provide workers with fair wages and equal pay for work of equal value.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, art 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand law and standards==
New Zealand law does not generally have extraterritorial effect. The extraterritorial application of human rights regimes can be defined as the existence of a legal obligation to respect rights.&lt;ref&gt;Marko Milanovic ''Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011) at 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fair Trading Act 1986]] deals with misleading and deceptive conduct,&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trading Act 1986, s 9&lt;/ref&gt; and despite its title, has no direct legal connection with this particular aspect of fair trade in New Zealand. In New Zealand slavery and forced labour are criminalised. A person is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years who, within or outside New Zealand, sells and purchases, or in any way whatsoever deals with any person as a slave.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1961, ss 98(1).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery]] is prohibited by  the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]]. Slavery is also not mentioned in the [[Human Rights Act 1993]]. There is currently no law that fair trade products need to be endorsed or supported through both private and public organisations in New Zealand.

==Fair trade labelling laws==
The [[Fairtrade Mark]] indicates that products purchased by consumers are supporting farmers and workers as they work to improve their livelihoods and provide better support to their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Australia New Zealand [http://fairtrade.org.nz/What-is-Fairtrade/What-Fairtrade-does "What Fairtrade Does"] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015-2016 79% of New Zealanders recognised the Fairtrade Mark.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2015/16 Annual Report ''Fairtrade By The Numbers''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, recognition of the Fairtrade Mark in New Zealand reached 78% and measured at NZ$89 million.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2015/16 Annual Report ''Strengthening Regional Impact'', at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The total revenue for Fairtrade ANZ has increased by 29% in the 2016 Financial Year.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2015/16 Annual Report ''Strengthening Regional Impact'', at 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are two recognised international fair trade systems - the [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO) and [[Fairtrade Labelling Organisations International]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Trade? He Tauhokohoko I Runga I Te Tika?'' (2nd ed, Global Education Centre, Wellington, New Zealand, 2008) at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fair trade label appears on product packaging and is a consumer guarantee which is awarded to specific products that have been traded according to the International Fair trade labelling standards.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Trade? He Tauhokohoko I Runga I Te Tika?'' (2nd ed, Global Education Centre, Wellington, New Zealand, 2008) at 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the WFTO certifies organisations as fair trade organisations - throughout their entire supply chain.

==Principles of fair trade==
The [[Fair Trade Federation]] is an organisation that recognises and upholds those principles to promote equity in international trade.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Federation [http://www.fairtradefederation.org/fair-trade-federation-principles/ "Fair Trade Federation Principles"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation works with The [[World Fair Trade Organisation]] (WFTO) and subscribes to similar fair trade principles. The organisation has ten principles of fair trade which it follows. These principles listed below are sourced from the WFTO website:&lt;ref&gt;[http://wfto.com/fair-trade/10-principles-fair-trade "Ten Principles of Fair Trade"] (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
#	Opportunities for disadvantaged producers
#	Transparency and accountability
#	Fair trade practices
#	Fair payment
#	No child labour, no forced labour
#	No discrimination, gender equity, freedom of association
#	Good working conditions
#	Capacity building
#	Promote fair trade
#	Respect for the environment

==Fair trade suppliers==
Oxfam New Zealand works with suppliers that sell a range of fair trade products in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam New Zealand [https://www.oxfam.org.nz/what-we-do/issues/fair-trade/buy-fairtrade "Buy Fairtrade"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Trade Aid, Whittaker's, All Good Bananas, and L'Affare are some suppliers that trade fair trade products.
* Trade Aid is New Zealand's oldest and largest fair trade organisation, which was established in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Trade Aid New Zealand [https://www.tradeaid.org.nz/our-story/ "Our Story"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The original goal of Trade Aid is to "support the work of self-help organisations through long-term trading relationships based on transparency and fairness".&lt;ref&gt;Trade Aid "How fair is fair?" ''Education Series 2''.&lt;/ref&gt; Each year Trade Aid allocates New Zealand Government aid monies - $220,000 in 2012-13 - to fund projects aimed at increasing sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Trade Aid "Business Matters" ''Education Series 6''.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade Aid sources its products from more than 65 trading partner organisations who buy these products from small groups of farmers and artisans.&lt;ref&gt;Trade Aid New Zealand [https://www.tradeaid.org.nz/about-us/ "About Us"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Whittaker's]] have fair trade certification for two of their chocolate block products, the 5 Roll Refined Creamy Milk and 72% Dark Ghana. The cocoa beans for these blocks come from the Fair trade cooperative [[Kuapa Kokoo]] in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Australia New Zealand [http://fairtrade.org.nz/News/News/Archive/Whittakers-creamiest-block-cream-of-the-crop "Whittaker's Creamiest Block"] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Whittaker's buys all of its cocoa beans through the Ghana Cocoa Board. The Ghana Cocoa Board is the government organisation responsible for marketing the Ghanaian cocoa crop. The Ghana Cocoa Board, in partnership with other organisations, is committed to ensuring that the cocoa industry in Ghana is conducted in a socially responsible manner.&lt;ref&gt;Ghana Cocoa Board [https://www.cocobod.gh "GCB"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Whittaker's is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation, an organisation that support farmers and communities in cocoa-growing regions in several third world countries.&lt;ref&gt;World Cocoa Foundation [http://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/about-wcf/history-mission/ "History and mission"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
*All Good Bananas is a 100% New Zealand owned and operated company.&lt;ref&gt;All Good Organics [http://allgoodorganics.co.nz/fairtrade-bananas/ "Fairtrade Bananas"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first fair trade bananas import to New Zealand in 2010, $940,000 has been given back to the El Guabo community in fair trade premium funding.&lt;ref&gt;All Good Organics [http://allgoodorganics.co.nz/about "About"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
*L'Affare is a coffee business that was established in Wellington, New Zealand in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;L'Affare [http://www.laffare.co.nz/about/ "About"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; L'Affare partners with Trade Aid which supports the imports of fair trade coffee from local communities worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laffare.co.nz/coffee/fairtrade/ "Fair Trade and Sustainability"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universities==
There are two universities in New Zealand that have been recognised by the [[Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand]] as fair trade universities. In 2013 the [[University of Otago]] became the first New Zealand university to be granted fair trade accreditation, along with more than 100 universities around the world that have become fair trade institutions.&lt;ref&gt;University of Otago [http://www.otago.ac.nz/otagobulletin/news/otago057741.html "Otago Becomes New Zealand's First Fairtrade University"] (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Vice Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne says: "I am proud of the effort staff and students have gone to make this happen and look forward to a long and meaningful association with Fairtrade. We now have Fairtrade products available at all seven outlets on campus and 90 per cent of residential students have access to Fairtrade products in their colleges". In July 2017, the [[University of Canterbury]] was also granted fair trade accreditation, becoming the first entirely fair trade campus in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;University of Canterbury [http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/news/2017/university-of-canterbury-recognised-as-a-fair-trade-university.html "Canterbury Recognised As A Fairtrade University"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The fair trade criteria for accreditation is that 50 per cent of products should be fair trade, where that option is available.&lt;ref&gt;University of Canterbury [http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/news/2017/university-of-canterbury-recognised-as-a-fair-trade-university.html "Canterbury Recognised As A Fairtrade University"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The supporting of fair trade products at University of Canterbury means that the campus uses fair trade coffee, tea and hot drinking chocolate, as well as selling Trade Aid chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;University of Canterbury [http://www.sustain.canterbury.ac.nz/fairtrade/ "Fair Trade"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Chair of the UC Fair Trade Committee Dr John Hopkins stated "by the time we applied for accreditation, UC purchases for tea and coffee had reached 80 per cent, and are still rising". Professor Ian Wright from the University of Canterbury says: "our staff and students can be proud that their commitment will have far-reaching impacts, not only in raising awareness in the local community, but in directly benefiting producers, growers and workers in developing countries".&lt;ref&gt;University of Canterbury [http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/news/2017/university-of-canterbury-recognised-as-a-fair-trade-university.html "Canterbury Recognised As A Fairtrade University"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6740">The '''fuzzy pay-off method for real option valuation''' ('''FPOM''' or '''pay-off method''') &lt;ref&gt;Collan, M., Fullér, R., and Mezei, J., 2009, [http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jamds/2009/238196.html Fuzzy Pay-Off Method for Real Option Valuation], ''[[Journal of Applied Mathematics and Decision Sciences]]'', vol. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is a new method for [[valuation (finance)|valuing]] [[real options]], created in 2008. It is based on the use of [[fuzzy logic]] and [[fuzzy number]]s for the creation of the possible pay-off [[statistical distribution|distribution]] of a project (real option). The structure of the method is similar to the probability theory based [[Datar–Mathews method for real option valuation]],&lt;ref&gt;Datar, V. &amp; Mathews, S. 2004. European Real Options: An Intuitive Algorithm for the Black Scholes Formula. Journal of Applied Finance, 14(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, S. &amp; Datar, V. 2007. A Practical Method for Valuing Real Options: The Boeing Approach. Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, 19(2): 95–104.&lt;/ref&gt; but the method is not based on probability theory and uses fuzzy numbers and possibility theory in framing the real option valuation problem.

==Method==

The Fuzzy pay-off method derives the real option value from a pay-off distribution that is created by using three or four cash-flow scenarios (most often created by an expert or a group of experts). The pay-off distribution is created simply by assigning each of the three cash-flow scenarios a corresponding definition with regards to a fuzzy number (triangular fuzzy number for three scenarios and a trapezoidal fuzzy number for four scenarios). This means that the pay-off distribution is created without any simulation whatsoever. This makes the procedure easy and transparent. The scenarios used are a minimum possible scenario (the lowest possible outcome), the maximum possible scenario (the highest possible outcome) and a best estimate (most likely to happen scenario) that is mapped as a fully possible scenario with a full degree of membership in the set of possible outcomes, or in the case of four scenarios used - two best estimate scenarios that are the upper and lower limit of the interval that is assigned a full degree of membership in the set of possible outcomes.

The main observations that lie behind the model for deriving the real option value are the following:
# The fuzzy NPV of a project is (equal to) the pay-off distribution of a project value that is calculated with [[fuzzy number]]s.
# The mean value of the positive values of the fuzzy [[net present value|NPV]] is the "possibilistic" mean value of the positive fuzzy NPV values.
# Real option value, ROV, calculated from the fuzzy NPV is the "possibilistic" [[mean value]]&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, R. &amp; Majlender, P. 2003. On weighted possibilistic mean and variance of fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 136: 363–374.&lt;/ref&gt; of the positive fuzzy NPV values multiplied with the positive area of the fuzzy NPV over the total area of the fuzzy NPV.

The real option formula can then be written simply as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ROV} = \frac{A(\mathrm{Pos})}{A(\mathrm{Pos})+A(\mathrm{Neg})} \times E[A_+]&lt;/math&gt;

::where ''A''(Pos) is the area of the positive part of the fuzzy distribution, ''A''(Neg) is the area of the negative part of the fuzzy distribution, and ''E''[''A''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;] is the mean value of the positive part of the distribution. It can be seen that when the distribution is totally positive, the real options value reduces to the expected (mean) value, ''E''[''A''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;].

As can be seen, the real option value can be derived directly from the fuzzy NPV, without simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Collan, M., Fullér, R., and Mezei, J., 2009, Fuzzy Pay-Off Method for Real Option Valuation, Journal of Applied Mathematics and Decision Sciences, vol. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, simulation is not an absolutely necessary step in the Datar–Mathews method, so the two methods are not very different in that respect. But what is totally different is that the Datar–Mathews method is based on probability theory and as such has a very different foundation from the pay-off method that is based on ''possibility'' theory: the way that the two models treat uncertainty is fundamentally different.

==Use of the method==
The pay-off method for real option valuation is very easy to use compared to the other real option valuation methods and it can be used with the most commonly used [[spreadsheet|spreadsheet software]] without any [[add-in]]s. The method is useful in analyses for decision making regarding investments that have an uncertain future, and especially so if the underlying data is in the form of cash-flow scenarios. The method is less useful if optimal timing is the objective. The method is flexible and accommodates easily both one-stage investments and multi-stage investments ([[compound option|compound]] real options).

The method has been taken into use in some large international industrial companies for the valuation of [[research and development]] projects and portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;Heikkilä, M., 2009, Selection of R&amp;D Portfolios of Real Options with Fuzzy Pay-offs under Bounded Rationality, IAMSR Research Report, 1/2009, {{ISBN|978-952-12-2316-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these analyses [[triangular distribution|triangular]] fuzzy numbers are used. Other uses of the method so far are, for example, R&amp;D project valuation  IPR valuation, valuation of [[M&amp;A]] targets and expected synergies,&lt;ref&gt;Kinnunen, J., 2010, Valuing [[M&amp;A|M&amp;A Synergies]] as (Fuzzy) Real Options, 14th Annual International Conference on Real Options in Rome, Italy, June 16–19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; valuation and optimization of M&amp;A strategies, valuation of area development (construction) projects, valuation of large industrial real investments. 

The use of the pay-off method is lately taught within the larger framework of real options, for example at the [[Lappeenranta University of Technology]] and at the [[Tampere University of Technology]] in Finland.

'''The Hockerton Housing Project''' is a small community of five [[earth sheltering|earth sheltered]] homes on the outskirts of [[Hockerton]], Nottinghamshire, UK.

The houses were designed by ‘green’ [[architects]] [[Brenda and Robert Vale|Professor Brenda Vale and Dr Robert Vale]].&lt;ref&gt;Energy Saving Trust, The Hockerton Housing Project: a case study&lt;/ref&gt; Low carbon living is facilitated through the use of renewable energy, the water system, food grown on site, and the community's approach to work and transport.&lt;ref&gt;East Midlands Regional Assembly, "UK’s first earth-sheltered, self-sufficient ecological housing development", www.emra.gov.uk, last accessed 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The homes were completed in September 1998 after three years of planning and 18 months of construction, at a cost of about £65,000.&lt;ref&gt;Ecology Building Society, Hockerton housing: low impact living, http://www.ecology.co.uk/html/aboutus/casestudies/hockerton.htm, last accessed 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Two homes have since changed ownership on the open property market.

==Layout==
The development consists of a terrace of five single story dwellings which are earth-sheltered at the rear (North), so that the ground surface slopes and blends smoothly into the field at the back. The houses have [[passive solar]] heating (a combination of high [[thermal mass]] and the south-facing conservatory) removing the need for a space heating system and the greatest factor in lowering energy use.

Each house is 6 metres deep with a 19 metre conservatory to the south. This runs the full width of each dwelling. A repeated modular bay system of 3.2m in width was used for ease and cost of construction. Most of the internal rooms have 3 metre high French windows linking them to the conservatory. Those rooms that are not so dependent on natural light, such as utility and bathing areas are located towards the rear of the homes.

The surrounding 40,000 square metre site allows for crop cultivation, the rearing of sheep and chickens, and self-sufficiency in water and energy.&lt;ref&gt;EST,ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy generation and use==
Two [[wind turbines]] and a [[solar photovoltaic]] system provide most of the energy required to run the homes. All systems are grid linked, which allows for both import of energy during periods of supply shortfall, and export for periods of excess energy production. The excess exported offsets the imported energy from the grid.

•	6&amp;nbsp;kW proven [[wind turbine]] installed early 2002 year (upgraded in 2008) &lt;br /&gt;
•	7.65&amp;nbsp;kW peak array of [[photovoltaics]] (solar electric) installed August 2002 complimenting wind power.&lt;br /&gt;
•	5&amp;nbsp;kW Iskra [[wind turbine]] installed in 2005 – installed as part of construction of a community building

The typical energy use for the house is about 10kWhrs/day (all electric). This is about 10% of a typical UK home. The majority of the electricity use is generated by the on-site renewables which has reduced energy bills to about £100/annum. This is offset by income from [[Renewables Obligation]] certificates, and may in future benefit from [[feed-in tariff]]s.

==Water capture, use and processing&lt;ref&gt;NARYANAN, Narvi, WHITE, Trudi, KRAUSS, Terry, JONES-Lofting, Chris, "Water Supply and Irrigation Systems", Geographical, Mar2000, Vol. 72 Issue 3, p90, 2p&lt;/ref&gt;==
There are two water capture and treatment systems.

'''Non-drinking water:'''Rainfall on the fields is channeled to a sump from where it is pumped to a reservoir to the north of the buildings. This reservoir holds enough water for 250 days. The water is sand filtered and treated with chlorine before entering the homes.

'''Drinking or potable water:'''Drinking water is captured from the conservatory roofs in copper pipes, which are slightly antiseptic, and stored in a tank that holds at least 100 days worth of drinking water. The water is passed through 3 filters before it enters the homes: a five-micrometre string filter, a carbon filter and then a UV-light filter which kills bacteria and viruses.

'''Water use''' is reduced through low-flush toilets and flow-restrictors on shower heads. Detergent free laundry balls keep the water unpolluted.

'''Processing waste water:'''A [[reed bed]] sewage system is in place to process waste water. Solid waste is captured in a septic tank. This is emptied each quarter and waste is composted on-site. Liquid waste then takes 100 days to pass through the reed-bed, with the reeds roots breaking down the liquid effluent.

==Co-operation and community==
All residents own their homes but are also members of a co-operative.&lt;ref&gt;Ecology Building Society, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; Each home, as part of the lease, undertakes to spend 300 unpaid hours per year on managing and maintaining the site, from the infrastructure of the energy and water systems through to lambing and growing food; and 300 paid hours per year supporting the joint business which runs tours and educational events, hosts away-days and consulting on both new and retrofit energy efficient building.&lt;ref&gt;Hockerton Housing Project, FAQ, http://www.hockertonhousingproject.org.uk/SEFS/ID.780/SEFE/ViewItem.asp, last accessed 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12361">Introduced by [[William Benoit]], '''image restoration theory''' outlines strategies that can be employed to restore image in an event where reputation has been damaged. Image restoration theory can be applied as an approach for understanding personal or organizational crisis situations.

Benoit outlines this theory in ''Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: A Theory of Image Restoration Strategies''.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit, William.outlines (1995). ''Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: A Theory of Image Restoration Strategies''. New York: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic concepts of image restoration theory ==

Two components must be present in a given attack to the image of an individual or organization: 
# The accused is held responsible for an action, and
# the act is considered offensive.

Image restoration theory is grounded in two fundamental assumptions.

# '''Communication is a goal directed activity'''. Communicators may have multiple goals that are not collectively compatible, but people try to achieve goals that are most important to them at the time, with reasonable cost. 
# '''Maintaining a favorable reputation is a key goal of communication'''. Because face, image, or reputation is valued as important, individuals or organizations are motivated to take action when it is compromised.

Perception is fundamental to image restoration, as the accused actor will not engage in a defensive strategy unless the perception exists that he is at fault. The actor who committed the wrongful act must decide on the strategy of best course based on their specific situation. Factors such as credibility, audience perceptions, and the degree of offensiveness of the act must be taken into account.

== Theoretical framework ==
The theory of image restoration builds upon theories of [[Apologetics|apologia]] and accounts. Apologia is a formal defense or justification of an individual’s opinion, position, or actions,&lt;ref&gt;Fearn-Banks, Kathleen. (2009). ''Crisis Communications: A Casebook Approach''. Mahweh: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; and an account is a statement made by an individual or organization to explain unanticipated or transgressive events.

Benoit claims that these treatments of image restoration focus on identifying options rather than prescribing solutions. He grounds image restoration theory on a comprehensive literature review of apologia and accounts theories.

Specific influences of image restoration theory include Rosenfield’s (1968) theory of analog, Ware and Linkugel's (1973) theory of apologia;&lt;ref&gt;http://changingminds.org/techniques/conversation/excusing/apologia.htm#war&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Burke]]'s (1970) theory of goals and purification; Ryan's (1982) kategoria and apologia; Scott and Lyman's (1968) analysis of accounts; [[Goffman]]’s (1967) remedial moves; Schonbach's (1980) updated analysis of Scott and Lyman’s (1968) theory; and Schlenker’s (1980) analysis of impression management and accounts.

== Typology of image restoration strategies ==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Strategy !! Explanation
|-
| '''Denial''' || The accused may ''simply deny'' that the act occurred, or ''shift the blame'' to the 'real' culprit
|-
| '''Evading responsibility''' || When unable to deny performing the act in question, the accused may attempt to evade responsibility. This strategy has four components.

''Provocation'': the actor may claim that the act was committed in response to another wrongful act. 
&lt;br/&gt;''[[Defeasibility]]'': the actor pleads a lack of knowledge or control about important factors related to the offensive act
&lt;br/&gt;''Make an excuse based on accidents'': the actor may make an excuse for factors beyond their control
&lt;br/&gt;''Suggest the action was justified based on good intentions'': the actor asks not to be held fully responsible based on their good, rather than evil motives in committing the act.

|-
| '''Reducing offensiveness''' || The accused may attempt to reduce the degree of negative feeling experienced by the audience. This strategy has six components.

''Bolstering'': used to mitigate the negative effects by strengthening the audience’s positive idea of the accused. They may remind the audience of previous good acts or good reputation. 
&lt;br/&gt;''Minimization'': attempts convince the audience that the act in question is less serious as it appears.
&lt;br/&gt;''Differentiation'': the act is distinguished from other more offensive acts to lessen the audience’s negative feelings by comparison.
&lt;br/&gt;''Transcendence'': the act is placed in a broad context to place it in a different, less offensive frame of reference.  
&lt;br/&gt;''Attacking accuser'': the actor attacks their accusers, to question the credibility of the source of the accusations
&lt;br/&gt;''Compensation'': the actor offers to redress the victims of their action to offset negative feelings towards them.

|-
| '''Corrective action''' || The accused claims that they will correct the problem. This can involve restoring the situation to its prior state, or promising to make changes to prevent its reoccurrence. 
|-
| '''Mortification''' || The accused admits responsibility and asks for forgiveness.

== Case studies ==

=== Case studies by Benoit ===

Based on several case studies by Benoit and his colleagues, Coombs (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, W. T. (2006). Crisis Management: A communicative approach. In C. H. Botan &amp; V. Hazleton (Eds.), Public Relations Theory II (171-197). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; cited a number of prescriptive recommendations for the use of crisis strategies (Benoit, 1995;&lt;ref&gt;Benoit, W. L. (1995). Accounts, excuses, and apologies: A theory of image restoration. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Brinson &amp; Benoit, 1996,&lt;ref&gt;Brinson, S. L., &amp; Benoit, W.L. (1996). Dow Corning’s image repair strategies in the breast implant crisis. Communication Quarterly, 44(1), 29-41.&lt;/ref&gt; 1999&lt;ref&gt;Brinson, S. L., &amp; Benoit, W. L. (1999). The tarnished star: Restoring Texaco’s damaged public image. Management Communication Quarterly, 12, 483-510.&lt;/ref&gt;). 1) The dominant recommendation is for an organization to immediately admit fault/accept responsibility, 2) Corrective actions should be taken and an organization need to publicize those actions, 3) Bolstering, which is directly related to the charge, is the most effective strategy, and 4) If the organization was innocent, Denial is an effective strategy. “Image restoration theory is the dominant line of research generating these recommendations. The most common recommendations suggest using the mortification and corrective action crisis response when an organization is guilty.” (Coombs, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;191)&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, W. T. (2006). Crisis Management: A communicative approach. In C. H. Botan &amp; V. Hazleton (Eds.), Public Relations Theory II (171-197). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here representative case studies by Benoit and his colleagues are introduced.

=== Limitation of Image repair theory – Coombs ===

Even though image restoration theory represented the use of mortification (accepting responsibility) and corrective action, there might be alternative recommendation. For instance, his studies using [[situational crisis communication theory]] found no support for always using mortification and corrective action. Also, the mortification and corrective action strategies had no greater effect than a simple bolstering strategy in a criminal violation crisis such as racial discrimination (Coombs, 2006&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, W. T. (2006). Crisis Management: A communicative approach. In C. H. Botan &amp; V. Hazleton (Eds.), Public Relations Theory II (171-197). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Additionally, in terms of the limitation of case studies in image restoration theory, Coombs (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, W. T. (2006). Crisis Management: A communicative approach. In C. H. Botan &amp; V. Hazleton (Eds.), Public Relations Theory II (171-197). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that closer scrutiny with insights should be taken before offering strategies to crisis managers as facts. In order to gaining additional insights into the use of crisis responses, he pointed out many similar crises should be examined for patterns of strategy use and effect and “a large number of cases could be coded and subjected to loglinear analysis in order to identify patterns.” (Coombs, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;191-192)&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, W. T. (2006). Crisis Management: A communicative approach. In C. H. Botan &amp; V. Hazleton (Eds.), Public Relations Theory II (171-197). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Cola Wars ===
Coca-Cola and Pepsi’s longstanding competition&lt;ref&gt;[[Cola Wars]]&lt;/ref&gt; reached its peak when Coke and Pepsi placed advertisements in Nation’s Restaurant News with unmistakable attacks from both sides.

Benoit analyses advertisements from both companies from 1990-1992 to address the persuasive strategies of Coke and Pepsi to determine recommendations for image restoration following an attack. He advises that companies should avoid making false claims, provide adequate support for claims, and develop themes throughout a campaign, and avoid arguments that might backfire.

An '''inventory''' is an itemized list of [[Object (museum)|objects]] that the [[museum]] has [[Accession number (library science)|accessioned]] or received via loan(s) and must be physically located by an examiner.  A complete, one-hundred percent inventory, or a random inventory of the [[Collection (museum)|collection]] must be carried out periodically to ensure the museum is operating under best practices and for security purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy H. Dudley, Irma Bezold Wilkinson, et al., ''Museum Registration Methods'' (Washington, D.C.: American Association of Museums, 1979), 413,415.&lt;/ref&gt;   The museum is legally responsible and ethically obligated for the maintenance of up-to-date information detailing the location of all objects within the collection, including loaned items and objects that have yet to be accessioned; this is stipulated by many museum associations, including the [http://www.aam-us.org/museumresources/ethics/coe.cfm American Association of Museums].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon McKenna and Efthymia Patsatzi, ed., ''SPECTRUM: The UK Museum Documentation Standard'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2007), 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Necessity ==

Although inventories require a large amount of work and are not part of the more glitzy side of museum work, their value is nonetheless extremely important.  The upkeep of the collections’ inventory record is needed for minimum collections accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Smith Finch, "The Essential Collections Inventory," in ''Registrars on Record: Essays on Museum Collection Management'', ed. Mary Case (Washington, D.C.: American Association of Museums, 1988),157.&lt;/ref&gt;   Inventories provide the collections manager and or the registrar with information for insurance purposes, security, and alerts staff to possible [[Art conservation and restoration|conservation]] or [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] needs of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy H. Dudley, Irma Bezold Wilkinson, et al., ''Museum Registration Methods'' (Washington, D.C.: American Association of Museums, 1979), 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
The completion and upkeep of and an inventory system helps to deter and aid in the early detection of theft of the collection.  The [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) urges museums to complete and maintain their inventory systems because "If a museum does not know what is in its collection, where the works are located, and the condition they are in, it, in effect, invites theft because it will have no immediate sense that an object has disappeared, and most important, it will have no descriptive information to aid the recovery of an object in the event of a theft."&lt;ref&gt;International Council of Museums and International Committee on Museum Security, Robert B. Burke and Sam Adeloye, ed., ''A Manual of Basic Museum Security'', (Leicester, Great Britain: deVoyle, Leicester, 1986), 15-6.&lt;/ref&gt;   
&lt;br&gt;

The type of inventory system used by a museum will be dictated by the '''Collections Management Policy (CMP)'''.  The CMP will determine how often items, what items, and how many items are to be inventory.  Museums need to periodically complete a one-hundred percent inventory of their collection, but for the period in between the completion of such an inventory, a random sampling of the collection is sufficient.  A random sampling of the collection serves as an indicator for the rest of the collection.  If all the items are accounted for in a random sampling, then it can be assumed that rest of the collections’ records is just as reliable.  However, a complete inventory provides the institution with the knowledge that the entire collection can be accounted for; the random sampling is used to check the consistency of the collections’ records.

An ongoing inventory method is a system that inventories on a regular basis high value items or items that are more susceptible to theft. This method resembles an iceberg, with the high value items being at the top of the iceberg.  As the inventory method progresses further down the iceberg, items of lesser value can be found.  Items found toward the center of the iceberg, need to be inventoried less than those found higher up on the berg, and more than items found below its position.  Items at the lowest position of the iceberg, below the water’s surface, may only need to be inventoried annually.&lt;ref&gt;International Council of Museums and the International Security Committee, "Protection, security and conservation of collections," in ''Collections Management'', ed. Anne Fahy (London: Routledge, 1995), 257.&lt;/ref&gt;   With this type of inventory system, the most important or most valued objects are accounted for on a regular basis.

===Review===
Inventories serve several purposes, including the opportunity for review of the '''collections department'''.  Such review includes: 
*are all objects accounted for and found to be stored properly; 
*is there any preservation or conservation issues that need to be brought to the attention of the '''registrar''', '''collections manager''', or [[curator]]; 
*is the collections’ location records reliable?  
An inventory provides a systematic review of the collections department’s records and helps to identify any problems.  How smoothly an inventory goes is actually a reflection upon the institution.  If an inventory is completed with little or no issues, then the collections department is running well; however, if many issues arise during the inventory process, this may be indicative of a collections department in need of review and change.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy H. Dudley, Irma Bezold Wilkinson, et al., ''Museum Registration Methods'' (Washington, D.C.: American Association of Museums, 1979), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy ==

Every museum must complete an inventory on a regular basis and this requirement should be stated in the museum’s CMP.  The CMP should also outline the steps that need to be carried out in the inventory process, including: 
*an examination of each object and its records; 
*the condition of every object should be noted; 
*any updates to records shall be made; 
*and the inventory list will be filed in the museum’s accession file.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon McKenna and Efthymia Patsatzi, ed., ''SPECTRUM: The UK Museum Documentation Standard'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2007), 77-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planning and scheduling ==

Sufficient time spent in planning must be devoted before beginning such a task as an inventory.  A well thought out inventory procedure will efficiently utilize staff and their time.  Such procedure should include:
# The scope and purpose of the inventory.
# Sources of funding for staff and equipment with a commitment from management for adequate time and resources to complete the inventory.
# Resources required to complete the inventory (e.g. staff hours, computers, making and labeling equipment, imaging equipment, etc.)
# Establish a timetable for the start and completion of the inventory.
# Ascertain who will run and or carry out the inventory.
# Identify the method of approach to completing the inventory, including standards used to record findings.
# How to [[Collection catalog|catalogue]] and manage information produced by the inventory and how that information will be reviewed and interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Ashby, Gordon McKenna, and Matthew Stiff, ed., ''SPECTRUM Knowledge: Standards for cultural information management'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2001), 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Gordon McKenna and Efthymia Patsatzi, ed., ''SPECTRUM: The UK Museum Documentation Standard'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2007), 78.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conducting an inventory ==
[[File:Cataloguing a lion head.jpg|thumb|A taxidermied lion's head displayed in the Natural History Museum, Dublin, being labelled as part of a museum inventory and cataloguing.]]

Now that inventory policy and procedure have been established, it is time to carry out the inventory.  Conducting an inventory is the final step to the inventory process, it is relatively simple in that the actions are repetitive, but it can be one of the most time consuming parts of the inventory process depending upon the size of the collection and the intended scope of the inventory. 
&lt;br&gt;

Select a method of approach when beginning the inventory process.  How will the collection be inventoried?  Shelf by shelf; or in numerical order of the catalogue?  Once the inventory method is decided, a uniformed and basic inventory record for each object needs to be created.  Such a record might contain the following:
# Object Number
# Object Name
# Brief Description of Object
# Condition (provides opportunity to conduct a condition check of the object)
# Current Location
# Notes (any other details not included in checklist, such as alerting the need for conservation treatment)
# Recorder and Date&lt;ref&gt;Gordon McKenna and Efthymia Patsatzi, ed., ''SPECTRUM: The UK Museum Documentation Standard'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2007), 79.

The '''Isabelline''' style, also called the '''Isabelline Gothic''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Gótico Isabelino''), or '''Castilian late Gothic''', was the dominant architectural style of the [[Crown of Castile]] during the reign of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], [[Queen Isabella I of Castile]] and King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] in the late-15th century to early-16th century. The Frenchman Émile Bertaux named the style after Queen Isabella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Annie Cloulas|title=Mélanges de la Casa de Velázquez|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CS1jRpHT40kC&amp;pg=PA159|volume=16|year=1980|publisher=Casa de Velázquez|location=Madrid|isbn=978-84-600-2213-8|page=159|chapter=Origines et évolution du terme "Plateresco"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Durliat1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel Durliat|title=L'Architecture espagnole|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5mtLAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22style%20Isabelle%22|year=1966|publisher=Privat-Didier|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It represents the transition between late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and early [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] architecture, with original features and decorative influences of the Castilian tradition, the [[Flanders|Flemish]], the [[Mudéjar]], and to a much lesser extent, Italian architecture. The consideration or not of the Isabelline as a Gothic or Renaissance style, or as an [[Eclecticism in architecture|Eclectic]] style, or as a phase within a greater [[Plateresque]] generic, is a question debated by historians of art and unresolved. &lt;ref&gt;"... is not satisfactory the supposedly enlightening the denomination of Gothic Plateresque, from the terminology adopted by D. Bayón for what Durliat called as Isabelline style and, as a binder of the one and the other (Marías), because if conceptually there is continuity, the ornamental repertoire used is very different, and there is no record of the use of the term for the medieval decorative fantasies. " Soto Caba, Virginia. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20120301233038/http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/artesp/contextos/7626.htm ''The Platersque issue'']" in ''ArteHistoria''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Isabelline style introduced several structural elements of the Castilian tradition and the typical [[Flanders]]'s flamboyant forms, as well as some ornaments of [[Islamic]] influence. Many of the buildings that were built in this style were commissioned by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] or were in some way sponsored by them. A similar style called [[Manueline]] developed concurrently in [[Portugal]]. The most obvious characteristic of the Isabelline is the predominance of [[Heraldry|heraldic]] and [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] motifs, especially the symbols of the [[Coat of arms of the King of Spain|yoke and arrows]] and the pomegranate, which refer to the Catholic Monarchs. Also characteristic of this period is ornamentation using beaded motifs of orbs worked in plaster or carved in stone.

After the Catholic Monarchs had completed the [[Reconquista]] in 1492 and started the colonization of the Americas, imperial Spain began to develop a consciousness of its growing power and wealth, and in its exuberance launched a period of construction of grand monuments to symbolize them. Many of these monuments were built at the command of the Queen; thus Isabelline Gothic manifested the desire of the Spanish ruling classes to display their own power and wealth. This exuberance found a parallel expression in the extreme profusion of decoration which has been called [[Plateresque]].

References to classical antiquity in the architecture of Spain were more literary, whereas in Italy, the prevalence of Roman-era buildings had given 'Gothic' a meaning adapted to Italian classicist taste. Until the Renaissance took hold in the Iberian peninsula, the transition from the 'Modern' to the 'Roman' in Spanish architecture had hardly begun. These terms were applied with a meaning different from what one would expect now&amp;mdash; the 'Modern', an originally Spanish style, referred to the Gothic and its rational efficiency,&lt;ref&gt;Maroto, J. ''Historia del Arte'', Casals, {{ISBN|978-84-218-4021-4}}, pg. 195, citing, among others, to Diego de Sagredo ''Las Medidas del Romano'', 1526.&lt;/ref&gt; while the 'Roman' was the neoclassical or emotional and sensualist style of the [[Italian Renaissance]].

Regardless of the spatial characteristics of the interiors, Gothic buildings utilized proven structural systems. The Gothic style in the Iberian Peninsula had undergone a series of changes under the influence of local tradition, including much smaller windows which allowed the construction of roofs with substantially less pitch and even flat roofs. This made for a truly original style, yet more efficient construction. Spanish architects, accustomed to their Gothic structural conventions,  looked with some contempt on the visible metal braces that Italian architects were forced to put on their buildings' arches to resist horizontal thrust, while their own Gothic building methods had avoided this problem.

The development of classical architecture in the Iberian Peninsula, as elsewhere, had been moribund during the centuries of building construction done in the Gothic tradition, and the neoclassical movement of the Italian Renaissance was late to arrive there. A unique style with modern elements evolved from the Gothic inheritance in Spain. Perhaps the best example of this [[syncretistic]] style is the [[Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes, Toledo|Monastery of San Juan de los Reyes]] in Toledo; designed by the architect [[Juan Guas]], its Gothic ideals are expressed more in the construction than in the design of the interior space, as the relationship with original French Gothic building techniques had receded with the passage of time.

In the Isabelline style, decorative elements of Italianate origin were combined with Iberian traditional elements to form ornamental complexes that overlaid the structures, while retaining many Gothic elements, such as [[pinnacle]]s and [[Pointed arch#Architecture|pointed arches]]. Isabelline architects clung to the Gothic solution of the problem of how to distribute the weight burden of vaults pressing on pillars (not on the walls, as in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] or Italian Renaissance styles): that is, by propping them up with flying buttresses. After 1530, although the Isabelline style continued to be used and its decorative ornaments were still evolving, Spanish architecture began to incorporate Renaissance ideas of form and structure.

'''L. Bancel LaFarge''' (1900-1989) was an [[United States|American]] [[architect]].  He was a founding member of the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]].&lt;ref name="nyt1989obit"&gt;Flint, Peter B. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/04/obituaries/l-b-la-farge-89-an-architect.html?scp=1&amp;sq=bancel%20laFarge&amp;st=cse  "L. B. La Farge, 89, an Architect,"] ''New York Times.'' July 4, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Louis Bancel LaFarge was born into a prominent American family. His grandfather, [[John LaFarge]], was a noted American artist. His grandmother was a granddaughter of Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] and a direct descendant of [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890279-1,00.html  "Religion: Reasoned Optimist,"] ''Time.'' March 3, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Bancel LaFarge, was an artist who continued his father's work in glass,&lt;ref name="mfaa"&gt;Monuments Men Foundation: [http://www.monumentsmenfoundation.org/monumentsmen/ Monuments Men] LaFarge, Maj. L. Bancel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Time.'' March 3, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; and his brother Tom was a mural painter.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, T. ''Emigrés in the Wilderness''. New York: Macmilland, 1941, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

LaFarge was a graduate of [[Harvard College]] and the [[Yale School of Architecture]].&lt;ref name="mfaa"/&gt; He married Margaret Hockaday, with whom he had three children: Timothy, Benjamin, and Celestine.

==Career==
LaFarge established himself as an architect in New York specializing in domestic architecture.  His practice was interrupted by military service in the Second World War.  At war's end, he returned to his work as an architect. At one time he served as president of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects (1958-1960), and he was a founding member of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (1965–70).&lt;ref name="nyt1989obit"/&gt;

==World War II==
Major LaFarge was assigned to the 7th Army in Europe during the Second World War.  He was the Chief of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives]] (MFAA) section.  LaFarge was the first MFAA officer to arrive in France after [[D-Day]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="mfaa"/&gt;

'''Land systems''' constitute the terrestrial component of the Earth system and encompass all processes and activities related to the human use of land, including socioeconomic, technological and organizational investments and arrangements, as well as the benefits gained from land and the unintended social and ecological outcomes of societal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verburg|first=Peter H|last2=Erb|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Mertz|first3=Ole|last4=Espindola|first4=Giovana|date=2013-10-01|title=Land System Science: between global challenges and local realities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343513000936|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|series=Human settlements and industrial systems|volume=5|issue=5|pages=433–437|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2013.08.001|pmc=4018982|pmid=24851141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes  in land systems have large consequences for the local environment and human well-being and are at the same time pervasive factors of global environmental change. Land provides vital resources to society, such as food, fuel, fibres and many other [[ecosystem services]] that support production functions, regulate risks of natural hazards, or provide cultural and spiritual services.  By using the land, society alters and modifies the quantity and quality of the provision of these services.

Land system changes are the direct result of human decision making at multiple scales ranging from local land owners decisions to national scale land use planning and global trade agreements. The aggregate impact of many local land system changes has far reaching consequences for the Earth System, that feedback on ecosystem services, human well-being and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crossman|first=Neville D|last2=Bryan|first2=Brett A|last3=de Groot|first3=Rudolf S|last4=Lin|first4=Yu-Pin|last5=Minang|first5=Peter A|date=2013-10-01|title=Land science contributions to ecosystem services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343513000729|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|series=Human settlements and industrial systems|volume=5|issue=5|pages=509–514|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2013.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, land system change is both a cause and consequence of socio-ecological processes.

The Global Land Programme (GLP) of [[Future Earth]] is an interdisciplinary community of science and practice fostering the study of land systems and the co-design of solutions for global sustainability.

The '''Lilly Research Centre''' is a medical research centre in [[Surrey]]. It is the European headquarters of [[Eli Lilly and Company]].

==History==
In 1968, when the centre opened, Eli Lilly was spending £20m on research in the UK. The average research cost of a [[New chemical entity|new molecular entity]] is currently over £1bn. In 2003, a £40m investment transformed the site into a Centre of Excellence in Neuroscience Research. 

[[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]] visited the site on 11 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 12 June 2003, page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directors===
* David Dennen
* John Wold 1983-
* [[Karin Briner]] 2007-10

==Structure==
It is accessed via the [[A30 road|A30]] and B3020, and the [[A322 road|A322]] via junction 3 of the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3]]. The site has a 200-seat restaurant. The EMC building opened in 2000. The site is set in woodland.

The concept is based on a systematic user co-creation approach integrating research and innovation processes. These are integrated through the co-creation, exploration, experimentation and evaluation of innovative ideas, scenarios, concepts and related technological artefacts in real life use cases. Such use cases involve user communities, not only as observed subjects but also as a source of creation. This approach allows all involved stakeholders to concurrently consider both the global performance of a product or service and its potential adoption by users. This consideration may be made at the earlier stage of research and development and through all elements of the product life-cycle, from design up to recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Kusiak, A.; Tang, C.-Y.: Innovation in a requirement life-cycle framework, Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, IMS’2006, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey, 2006, 61-67.&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Concurrent engineering]]

More recently, the [[Web 2.0]] has demonstrated the positive impact of involving user communities in [[new product development]] (NPD) such as [[mass collaboration]] projects (e.g.  [[crowdsourcing]], [[Wisdom of Crowds]]) in [[collective intelligence|collectively]] creating new contents and applications.

A living lab is not similar to a [[testbed]] as its philosophy is to turn users, from being traditionally considered as observed subjects for testing modules against requirements, into value creation in contributing to the co-creation and exploration of emerging ideas, breakthrough scenarios, innovative concepts and related artefacts. Hence, a living lab rather constitutes an experiential environment, which could be compared to the concept of [[experiential learning]], where users are immersed in a creative social space for designing and experiencing their own future. Living labs could also be used by policy makers and users/citizens for designing, exploring, experiencing and refining new policies and regulations in real-life scenarios for evaluating their potential impacts before their implementations.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Description==
The term ''living lab'' has emerged in parallel from the ambient intelligence research communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ami-communities.eu/wiki/AMI%40Work_on-line_Communities|title=AMI@Work on-line Communities |work=AMI@Work Communities Wiki |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; context and from the discussion on experience and application research (EAR).&lt;ref&gt;ISTAG EAR working group report "Involving users in the development of Ambient Intelligence" on http://www.cordis.lu/ist/istag.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of the term is based on the concept of [[user experience]]&lt;ref&gt;Gaver, W.W., Boucher, A., Pennington, S. and Walker, B.

William J. Mitchell, Kent Larson, and Alex (Sandy) Pentland at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are credited with first exploring the concept of a Living Laboratory.  They argued that a living lab represents a user-centric research methodology for sensing, prototyping, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts. Nowadays, several living lab descriptions and definitions are available from different sources.&lt;ref&gt;Core Labs (2006), http://www.ami-communities.net/wiki/CORELABS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niitamo, V.-P.; Kulkki, S.; Eriksson, M.; Hribernik, K.

Living Labs for user-driven open innovation. An overview of the Living Labs methodology, activities and achievements. January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Mitchell, Larson and Pentland, formed the first US-based living labs research consortium. According to the consortium website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livinglabs.mit.edu |title=MIT Living Labs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The convergence of globalization, changing demographics, and urbanization is transforming almost every aspect of our lives.  We face new choices about where and how we work, live, travel, communicate, and maintain health.  Ultimately, our societies are being transformed.  MIT Living Labs brings together interdisciplinary experts to develop, deploy, and test - in actual living environments - new technologies and strategies for design that respond to this changing world.  Our work spans in scale from the personal to the urban, and addresses challenges related to health, energy, and creativity.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consortium has since been reorganized as the City Science Initiative at the MIT Media Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cities.media.mit.edu/ |title=MIT City Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "living lab" or "living laboratory" is also used for representing a residential home research facility where the behaviour of people living in this house is observed and usage patterns are collected by researchers that are investigating methods for merging new technologies with user-centered design. In this type of living lab, users are more observed subjects than engaged in the co-creation of ideas and breakthrough scenarios. There are examples of such research facilities like PlaceLab at MIT developed by Kent Larson and Stephen Intille and ExperienceLab at Philips Research. In the Netherlands, Utrecht University has created the Governance Lab Utrecht

* Co-creation: bring together technology push and application pull (i.e. crowdsourcing, crowdcasting) into a diversity of views, constraints and knowledge sharing that sustains the ideation of new scenarios, concepts and related artefacts.
* Exploration: engage all stakeholders, especially user communities, at the earlier stage of the co-creation process for discovering emerging scenarios, usages and behaviours through live scenarios in real or virtual environments (e.g. [[virtual reality]], [[augmented reality]], [[mixed reality]]).
* Experimentation: implement the proper level of technological artefacts to experience live scenarios with a large number of users while collecting data which will be analysed in their context during the evaluation activity.
* Evaluation: assess new ideas and innovative concepts as well as related technological artefacts in real life situations through various dimensions such as socio-ergonomic, socio-cognitive and socio-economic aspects; make observations on the potentiality of a viral adoption of new concepts and related technological artefacts through a confrontation with users' value models.

{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}
The '''Macchina of Santa Rosa''' is a 30 metre high tower, which is rebuilt every year in the months of July and August in honor of [[Rose of Viterbo|Saint Rose of Viterbo]], the patron saint of the city of [[Viterbo]], Italy. Every year on the evening of 3 September 100 men called "Facchini di Santa Rosa" (porters of Saint Rose) hoist the Macchina and carry it through the very narrow streets and squares of the medieval town centre. The whole route is a little bit more than {{convert|1|km|0|abbr=on}}.

The procession is an important event in Viterbo and attracts thousands of people. Today, the procession is included in the [[UNESCO]] Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref name=portale&gt;
[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.infoviterbo.it/macchina-di-santa-rosa.html&amp;prev=search "The Machine of Santa Rosa", il Portale del Turismo a Viterbo e Provincia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The celebration consists of two distinct parts. On the afternoon of 2 September, a reliquary containing the heart of Santa Rosa is carried in procession accompanied by people in period costumes of the 14th through the 19th centuries. The transport of Machine of Santa Rosa takes place the following evening. The term "machine" is borrowed from classical Greek theater.&lt;ref name=sodality&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.facchinidisantarosa.it/&amp;prev=search Sodalizio Dei Facchini]&lt;/ref&gt;

The transport of the Macchina dates back to the transfer of the body of Saint Rose of Viterbo. In 1258, six years after her death, her body was moved at the wish of [[Pope Alexander IV]], from the former church Santa Maria del Poggio to the church Santa Maria delle Rose (today the pilgrimage chapel of Saint Rose). It is possible that originally a statue of St. Rose lit on a canopy was carried in procession.&lt;ref name=city&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.macchinasantarosa.it/&amp;prev=search "Trasporto della Macchina di Santa Rosa", City of Viterbo]&lt;/ref&gt; Guilds were very active in the processions in the 14th century. From 1654 through 1663 the procession was suspended due to the plague.

The first "machine" was probably designed by Count Sebastian Gregory Fani in 1686. The Civic Museum of Viterbo has a collection of sketches of the machine dating to 1690.&lt;ref name=city/&gt; In the 18th century the noble families of Viterbo sponsored lavish machines of Saint Rose.

In 1790 the machine fell during the move. In 1801 the cries of a spectator robbed of her jewels by some pickpockets in the Piazza Fontana Grande panicked some cavalry horses. Twenty-two people in the crowd died in the ensuing confusion and later that night the machine caught fire in Piazza delle Erbe. Because of these events, the transport was temporarily banned by [[Pope Pius VII]], only to resume around 1810. In 1814 tilted backwards and a few porters died.&lt;ref name=city/&gt;

In 1893 pouring rain prevented the transport, which proved fortunate when it was later discovered that some anarchists were planning to throw bombs at the machine. The transport was suspended with the outbreak of World War I, but resumed in 1918.&lt;ref name=mauro&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.cesarini.eu/santa%2520rosa.htm&amp;prev=search Galeotti, Mauro. "La Machina di Santa Rosa"]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1924 to 1951 (except for the interruption caused by the Second World War) the Machine of Santa Rosa was designed and constructed by Virgilio Papini, whose family had a long history of building the machines. In 1967 a new design did not get farther than the end of Via Cavour due to either excessive weight, or height, or tired Facchini.&lt;ref name=sodality/&gt;

On the occasion of the arrival of the pontifex [[John Paul II]], on 27 May 1984 there was organized a special transport.&lt;ref name=mauro/&gt; On 6 September 2009, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] viewed the new Macchina of Santa Rosa Fiore del Cielo in front of the pilgrimage chapel.

In April 2014 the "Flower of Heaven" was erected at the Milan Expo; the new tower for 2015 is called "Gloria".&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/15_aprile_17/expo-milano-arriva-macchina-santa-rosa-e8a509b8-e4ee-11e4-845e-5bcd794907be.shtml&amp;prev=search "The machinery of Santa Rosa comes to Milan Expo", ''Chronicle'' (Milan), 17 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Until a few decades ago, the Machine of Santa Rosa was built with paper mache and mounted on a wooden frame.  Today, that system has been abandoned and replaced with various materials, such as resin, plastic and glass fiber, supported by a framework of steel pipes.

Every five years a design competition is launched for a new Macchina. 
The guidelines of the competition ask for a 28m high tower, which is measured from the shoulder of the porters. The construction's maximum weight is to be less than 5 tonnes and the maximum width 4.3 metres.
This is to respect the narrow parts of the historical centre, where eaves and balconies could strike the Macchina during transportation.

The appearance of the Macchina has changed throughout history. 
The altar-like constructions from the 18th century developed to constructions similar to church towers and in the 2nd half of the 20th century they developed to 30m high sculptural towers.
While originally the towers were mainly made from [[papier mâché]], today materials like steel, [[aluminium]] and [[fibre glass]] are used to achieve a light and fireproof construction.

The current model (since 2009) is called "Fiore del Cielo" (ital. Flower of Heaven).&lt;ref name=portale/&gt; It was designed by the architecture office [[Architecture and Vision]] (architects: [[Arturo Vittori]] and [[Andreas Vogler]]).
The design is characterized by the three golden helix surfaces which grow upwards.
In contrast to the former Macchina many innovations were introduced. Some of these are the golden color scheme and more than 1200 computer-controlled [[LED]] lights, which are illuminating the handmade textile roses. A special scenography was developed, which also includes a rain of rose petals on the spectators at a certain stop.

==Facchini==
The Sodality Facchini of Santa Rosa was founded in 1978 to keep alive the age old tradition and ensure it is done in a safe and responsible manner. The Sodality also promotes cultural activities, tourism, and mutual aid for its members. The Sodality was one of the signatories to the UNESCO project application. It is based at the Museum of the Society Facchini of Santa Rosa which opened in 1994.&lt;ref name=sodality/&gt;

The Facchini wear a white uniform with a red sash tied at the waist and a headdress covered in leather. To be selected as one of the Facchini is considered a particular honor, and one most pass a test of strength, carrying a 160-pound box on his shoulders for at least seventy meters without stopping. Before setting out they receive a special blessing.&lt;ref name=machine/&gt; At around 9 pm the Facchini lift the 5 ton Macchina and start the first leg of the passage to the cheers of onlookers. For most of the route, the Facchini walk without any visual aid, directed by the capofacchini and guides posted at the four corners of the machine.

==Transport==
[[File:La Macchina.JPG|thumb|Fiore del Cielo on 5 September 2009]]

The transport of the Macchina of Santa Rosa is the annual main event of the city of [[Viterbo]].
Already at the afternoon the streets of the historical centre are being filled with citizens and visitors.
The transport begins at the Porta Romana, where the assembled Macchina stays in a scaffold, which is covered with curtains.
At around 8 pm the 800 candles of the Macchina are lighted by the local fire brigade.
The street lighting will be switched off completely.

During the transport there are five breaks. During these breaks the Macchina is put on special frames. The stopping places are:

* Piazza Fontana Grande
* Piazza del Plebiscito (in front of the guildhall)
* Piazza delle Erbe
* Corso Italia (in front of the church Santa Maria del Suffragio)
* Piazza del Teatro.&lt;ref name=machine&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.macchinadisantarosa.viterbo.it/&amp;prev=search "The Machine of Santa Rosa Viterbo", City of Viterbo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last stretch up to the church of Santa Rosa has a remarkable inclination. In order to overcome this slope, the Macchina is pulled by ropes and additional people and is eventually placed in front of the pilgrimage chapel. The Macchina is exposed there for some days after the event.

'''''Malaysia and the Club of Doom''''' (The Collapse of The Islamic Countries) is a book published in 2006 by [[Syed Akbar Ali]] who argues that countries with a [[Muslim]] majority population have collapsed economically, politically and socially.

==Theses==
With a particular focus on [[Malaysia]], the thesis of the book is that growing [[Islamization|Islamisation]] of the political and social climate in Islamic countries are causing democracy and freedom to be threatened by religious irrationalism. He attempts to show how the curtailing of [[democracy]] and [[freedom of speech]] have caused those countries to collapse.  He further draws a distinction between Islam and its current practises, and offers his perspective that current practises of Muslims are not in vein with the true meaning of [[Islam]] with that being the underlying cause for the collapse of those countries.

The book takes pains to stress that many practises that define Islam on the world stage like stringent laws, cruel punishments and irrational beliefs cannot be found in the [[Quran]]. Syed Akbar Ali then proceeds to show that many of these extra Quranic beliefs and practises which have brought about the downfall of the Muslims are actually taken from the [[Bible]].

In the Malaysian context, his book also exposes a masquerade whereby certain 'Islamic' laws pertaining to divorce are actually a reworded version of [[English common law|English Law]] taken from the Marriage and Divorce Act -  a left over of British colonialism. The book also dismisses '[[Islamic banking]]' as 'Arabic banking' i.e. conventional banking with Arabic prefixes attached for camouflage.

==Author==
Syed Akbar Ali (49 years' old) is well known among the Malaysian [[intelligentsia]], especially among its Muslim intellectuals.  A graduate of an American university who developed a career in banking, Syed was also an often controversial newspaper columnist - pushing the envelope on free and unfettered discussion on religious and political issues in Malaysia.

His debut book ''To Digress A Little'', published in July 2005, stirred much discussion in Malaysia for its frank and honest appraisal of Malaysia's [[affirmative action]] policies which it claims have now outlived their usefulness.

{{Maya civilization}}
A unique and intricate style, the tradition of '''Mayan architecture''' spans several thousands of years. Often, the buildings most dramatic and easily recognizable as Mayans are the stepped  pyramids of the
[[Terminal Pre-classic]] period and beyond. Being based on the general [[Mesoamerican architecture|Mesoamerican architectural]] traditions, these pyramids relied on intricate carved stone in order to create a stairstep design. Each pyramid was dedicated to a deity whose shrine sat at its top. During this "height" of Maya culture, the centers of their religious, commercial and bureaucratic power grew into large cities, namely [[Tikal]] and [[Uxmal]]. Through observation of the numerous consistent elements and stylistic distinctions, remnants of Maya architecture have become an important key to understanding the evolution of their ancient temples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elan.com.mx/biblioteca/Function%20and%20Meaning%20in%20Classic%20Maya%20Architecture.pdf#page=56]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban design==
{{see also|Maya city}}

As Maya cities spread throughout the varied geography of [[Mesoamerica]], the extent of site planning appears to have been minimal; their cities having been built somewhat haphazardly as dictated by the topography of each independent location. Maya architecture tends to integrate a great degree of natural features. For instance, some cities existing on the flat [[limestone]] plains of the northern Yucatán grew into great sprawling municipalities, while others built in the hills of [[Usumacinta]] utilized the natural loft of the topography to raise their towers and temples to impressive heights. However, some semblance of order, as required by any large city, still prevailed.
At the onset of large-scale construction, a predetermined axis was typically established in congruence with the cardinal directions. Depending upon the location and availability of natural resources such as fresh-water wells, or ''[[cenotes]]'', the city grew by connecting great plazas with the numerous platforms that created the sub-structure for nearly all Maya buildings, by means of ''[[sacbeob]]'' causeways. As more structures were added and existing structures re-built or remodeled, the great Maya cities seemed to take on an almost random identity that contrasts sharply with other great Mesoamerican cities such as [[Teotihuacan]] and its rigid grid-like construction.

[[File:Temples of the Cross Group.jpg|thumb|left|Palenque, [[Temple of the Cross Complex]]]]
At the heart of the Maya city existed the large plazas surrounded by their most valued governmental and religious buildings such as the royal [[acropolis]], great pyramid temples, and occasionally [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballcourts]]. Though city layouts evolved as nature dictated, careful attention was placed on the directional orientation of temples and observatories so that they were constructed in accordance with Maya interpretation of the orbits of the stars. Immediately outside this ritual center were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines: the less sacred and less important structures had a greater degree of privacy. Outside the constantly evolving urban core were the less permanent and more modest homes of the common people.

[[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Era]] Maya urban design could easily be described as the division of space by great monuments and causeways. In this case, the open public plazas were the gathering places for the people and the focus of the urban design, while interior space was entirely secondary. Only in the Late Post-Classic era did the great Maya cities develop into more fortress-like defensive structures that lacked, for the most part, the large and numerous plazas of the Classic.

==Building process==
All evidence seems to suggest that most stone buildings existed on top of a platform sub-structure that varied in height from less than a meter, in the case of terraces and smaller structures, to 45 meters in the case of great temples and pyramids. A flight of often steep stone steps split the large stepped platforms on at least one side, contributing to the common bi-symmetrical appearance of Maya architecture. Depending on the prevalent stylistic tendencies of an area, these platforms most often were built of a stucco and cut stone exterior filled with densely packed gravel. As is the case with many other Maya reliefs, those on the platforms often were related to the intended purpose of the residing structure. Thus, as the sub-structural platforms were completed, the grand residences and temples of the Maya were constructed on the solid foundations of the platforms. As all structures were built, little attention seems to have been given to their utilitarian functionality and much to external aesthetics; however, a certain repeated aspect, the [[corbeled arch]], was often utilized to mimic the appearance and feel of the simple Maya hut. Though not an effective tool to increase interior space, as it required thick stone walls to support the high ceiling, some temples utilized repeated arches, or a [[corbelled vault]], to construct what the Maya referred to as ''[[pibnal]]'', or [[sweatbath]], such as those in the [[Temple of the Cross]] at Palenque. As structures were completed, typically extensive relief work was added, often to the covering of stucco used to smooth any imperfections; however, many [[lintel]] carvings have been discovered, as well as actual stone carvings used as a facade. Commonly, these would continue uninterrupted around an entire structure and contain a variety of artwork pertaining to the inhabitants or purpose of a building. Though not the case in all Maya locations, broad use of painted stucco has been discovered as well.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

It has been suggested that, in conjunction to the [[Maya calendar|Maya Long Count Calendar]], every fifty-two years, or cycle, temples and pyramids were remodeled and rebuilt. It appears now that the rebuilding process was often instigated by a new ruler or for political matters, as opposed to matching the calendar cycle. However, the process of rebuilding on top of old structures is indeed a common one. Most notably, the [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]] at Tikal seems to be the sum total of 1,500 years of architectural modifications.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''Building Materials                                                                                                                                                                                '''

The Mayan civilization used very simple tools for building their structures.  The most common tools use were made of stone found in surrounding areas.  Limestone was a huge part of the Mayan tool making, as limestone was geographically very abundant in most settlements.  Locations of the Mayan cities were chosen with the access to necessary stones in mind.  This allowed most quarries to be right outside the city for easy access to blocks needed for construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.courses.psu.edu/anth/anth008_cmg149/mbm.html|title=Mayan construction:  building materials|last=Moore|first=Christina|website=www.courses.psu.edu|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Top Limestone quarries used were Palenque and Tikal.  Though Limestone was the most important material they still collected sandstone from Quiriguá and volcanic tuff from Copan. 

The Mayan people had taken advantage of mortar on most structural projects.  The Mayans used a very difficult process of limestone under large amounts of heat to create their mortar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Maya_Architecture/|title=Maya Architecture|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mortar was so widely used, the Mayans even used it for sculptures, facades, and floor layers.  Their mortar was very effective on a large building lifetime, but humid climates can have a negative effect on the mortar. 

For more important construction projects the Mayans would cover the entire structures exterior with stucco, followed by bright paintings, prioritizing red, yellow, green, and blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mayansandtikal.com/mayan-architecture/mayan-buildings-daily-life-or-architecture/#Mayan_Building_Materials|title=Mayan Buildings|website=mayansandtikal.com|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable constructions==

===Ceremonial platforms===
These were commonly limestone platforms of typically less than four meters in height where public ceremonies and religious rites were performed. Constructed in the fashion of a typical foundation platform, these were often accented by carved figures, altars and perhaps ''[[tzompantli]]'', a stake used to display the heads of victims or defeated [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] opponents.

===Palaces===
Large and often highly decorated, the palaces usually sat close to the center of a city and housed the population's elite. Every exceedingly large royal palace, or one consisting of many chambers on different levels might be referred to as an acropolis. However, often these were one-story and consisted of small chambers and typically at least one interior courtyard; these structures appear to take into account the needed functionality required of a residence, as well as the decoration required for their inhabitants stature. Archaeologists seem to agree that many palaces are home to various tombs. At [[Copán]], beneath over four-hundred years of later remodeling, a tomb for one of the ancient rulers has been discovered and the North Acropolis at [[Tikal]] appears to have been the site of numerous burials during the Terminal Pre-classic and Early Classic periods.[[File:Sayil Palacio Plan EN.png|thumb|left|Sayil, Yucatán. Three-story palace.]][[File:Palenque - El Palacio - Rekonstruktion.jpg|thumb|right|Palenque, Palace]]

===E-groups===
"[[E-Group]]" is a classification given by [[Mayanist]]s to certain structure complexes present at a number of Maya sites located in the central and southern Maya lowlands (e.g., the [[Petén Basin|Petén region]]). Complexes of this type consist of a stepped pyramid main structure, situated on the western side of a quadrilateral plaza or platform. A raised but rather elongated structure appears along the eastern side of the plaza, running north-south; a variation has three smaller temple mounds on top of or replacing this platform, the middle of these substructures placed directly opposite the main structure. Often, two other subsidiary structures appear on the north and south sides of the plaza, respectively. The main western structure is typically terraced (i.e. has several levels), with inset stairways on each of its four sides, with only the eastern stairway, leading from the plaza, providing access to the summit. The stairways have large balustrades which protrude from the pyramid, which were decorated with large [[stucco]] masks and panels of architectural art. In other examples, believed to be of a later date, this quadripartite stairway configuration is lacking.

E-group complexes are named after their prototypical example, Structure E-VII-sub at the site of [[Uaxactun]]. They were first identified as a meaningful complex by archaeologist [[Frans Blom]] in 1924, who excavated the site under the auspices of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington|Carnegie Institution of Washington]].

It has been theorized that these E-groups are observatories, because the eponymous group at Uaxactun contains alignments corresponding approximately to sunrises on the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es. However, all other E-groups have different orientations, which pertain to widespread groups of astronomical alignments that are also embedded in a number of buildings of other types; hence the term "observatory" applied to these assemblages is hardly warranted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=Astronomy and architecture in the Maya lowlands |journal=Journal of Skyscape Archaeology |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=189-215 |doi=10.1558/jsa.30050}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ideas seem to stem from the possible creation story told by the relief and artwork that adorns these structures.

===Triadic Groups===
They consist of an elevated platform (either an extensive acropolis or a steep pyramid) with a monumental stairway, with a central building facing the stairs, and two lateral structures facing each other on both sides of the platform. This formal complex has been attributed to the earthly re-creation of the Celestial Hearth (modern-day constellation of Orion), or a stage for enthronement rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently Triadic Groups have been interpreted as sanctuaries commemorating Maize God's resurrection upon the Flowery Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Such complexes appear during the Late Preclassic times and gradually decrease in number until their disappearance in the Early Postclassic.

===Pyramids and temples===
Often the most important temples sat atop towering Maya pyramids, some of over two-hundred feet, such as that at [[El Mirador]]. The sanctuary on top commonly was heightened by a crest or roof comb. While recent discoveries point toward the extensive use of pyramids as tombs, the temples themselves seem to rarely, if ever, contain burials. [[Image:Tikal6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tikal]], temple pyramid with prominent roof comb]]

At Chichén Itzá there is a pyramid called [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] ('the castle'). With four stairways, each with 91 steps (with the upper platform they sum up to 365), and having other architectural elements appearing in astronomically significant numbers, it is a good example of Maya myth and astronomical cycles joined in architecture. Also referred to as the Pyramid of Kukulcán, the structure provides a remarkable display, observed by thousands of modern visitors at the equinoxes. The setting sun's rays are projected on the northern balustrade, create the illusion of a snake winding its way down the steps of the pyramid. The snake is composed of several triangle shapes giving it the appearance of a diamond back snake. At the base of the northern stairway there are massive snake head sculptures, making this effect even more persuasive. While it is a widespread belief that this light-and-shadow effect was achieved on purpose to record the equinoxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.exploratorium.edu/ancientobs/chichen/HTML/castillo.html|title=Ancient Observatories: Chichén Itzá|author=|date=|website=www.exploratorium.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/world-heritage/chichen-itza|title=Chichen Itza -- World Heritage Site -- National Geographic|author=|date=15 November 2010|website=nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea is highly unlikely: it has been shown that the phenomenon can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes, making impossible to determine any date by observing this effect alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=El Sol en Chichén Itzá y Dzibilchaltún: la supuesta importancia de los equinoccios en Mesoamérica |journal=Arqueología Mexicana |date=2018 |volume=XXV |issue=149 |pages=26-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya architecture is vastly different from the others in Meso-American cultures. The blend of mythology and astronomical events can be found in nearly all Maya palace or pyramid structures. One will also notice the heavy influence of the Toltecs in the architecture at Chichén Itzá. The Toltecs invaded the Maya and merged their cultural traditions around the year 1000.&lt;ref name="ancient.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Chichen_Itza/|title=Chichen Itza|author=|date=|website=ancient.eu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114073941/https://www.ancient.eu/Chichen_Itza/|archivedate=14 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observatories===
The Maya were keen astronomers and had mapped out the phases of celestial objects, especially the [[Sun]], [[Venus]] and the [[Moon]]. Many temples have doorways and other features aligning to celestial events. Round temples, often dedicated to [[Kukulcan]], are perhaps those most often described as "observatories" by modern ruin tour-guides. It is now known, however, that many buildings of different types and uses were oriented on astronomical grounds, mostly to sunrises and sunsets on specific dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=A. |last2=Hartung |first2=H. |title=Maya City Planning and the Calendar |date=1986 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=Anthony F. |title=Skywatchers: A Revised and Updated Version of Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico |date=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dates recorded are concentrated in four agriculturally significant seasons and tend to be separated by multiples of elementary periods of the calendrical system (13 and 20 days), suggesting that the orientations allowed the use of observational calendars intended to facilitate a proper scheduling of agricultural and associated ceremonial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sánchez Nava |first1=Pedro Francisco |last2=Šprajc |first2=Ivan |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura maya de las tierras bajas |date=2015 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-607-484-727-7 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297155454_Orientaciones_astronomicas_en_la_arquitectura_maya_de_las_tierras_bajas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the important Maya buildings were oriented on the basis of astronomical criteria, their primary functions were religious, residential or administrative; the label "observatory" applied to any structural type is thus hardly warranted.

===Ballcourts===
As an integral aspect of the Mesoamerican lifestyle, the courts for their ritual ballgame were constructed throughout the Maya realm, often on a grand scale. The playing alleys of ballcourts were defined by two long walls.  Courts built earlier in Maya history (as at [[Cobá]]) had sloped sides, while ones built later (as at [[Chichén Itzá]]) had vertical sides. Frequently, the ends were enclosed so as to create an [[Image:I, heavily serifed.png|10px]]-shaped court when viewed from above.[[Image:Chichen itza ballcourt.jpg|thumb|right|Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza]]

When the Maya played games in the Ballcourts, the ball was made of solid rubber and was sometimes as much as a foot in diameter. It was passed between teams ranged on opposite ends of the court. The players could hit it only with their knees or hips, much like football or soccer today. Points could be scored when the opponents failed to return the ball correctly. In central Mexico, and in late times in Yucatán, rings of stone were set high up in the side walls of the court. It was considered a particular triumph for a player to knock the ball through the ring.&lt;ref&gt;Proskouriakoff, Tatiana. (2002). An Album of Maya Architecture. Mineola, New York: Dover Publications, Inc. p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cave sites==
There are also [[cave]] sites that are important to the Maya. [[Maya cave sites]] include [[Jolja Cave]], the cave site at [[Naj Tunich]], the [[Candelaria Caves]], and the [[Cave of the Witch]]. There are also cave [[creation myth]]s among the Maya. Some cave sites are still used by the modern Maya in the [[Chiapas highlands]] in Mexico.

[[File:МГЕ-Фото.JPG|thumb|300px|''Concise Mining Encyclopaedia'']]

The '''''Mining Encyclopedia''''' ({{lang-uk|Гірнича енциклопедія}}) is a [[Ukrainian language]] comprehensive set of [[encyclopedia]]s about the science and technology of [[mining]]. The encyclopedias were compiled by more than 100 of the leading [[earth scientist]]s in Ukraine and overseas, headed by [[Volodymyr Biletskyy]].&lt;ref name="Fik"/&gt;

The first installment of the project, the ''Explanatory Dictionary of Mining'' ({{lang-uk|Тлумачний гірничий словник}}) was published in 1998 by the [[Donetsk National Technical University]] and is now available online.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

The second phase of the project involved the publication of the 3-volume ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mining'' ({{lang-uk|Гірничий енциклопедичний словник}}) between 2001–2004. This set contains 12,700 encyclopedic articles.&lt;ref name="Fik"/&gt;

The third stage involved the publication of the 3-volume ''Concise Mining Encyclopaedia'' ({{lang-uk|Мала гірнича енциклопедія}}) between 2004–2013. This comprehensive set contains 17,350 entries,&lt;ref name="Fik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bulletin"/&gt; with numerous illustrations.&lt;ref name="Note01"/&gt; A valuable feature of the encyclopedia is that all entries are written simultaneously in Ukrainian, Russian, English and German languages.&lt;ref name="Fik"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://studiapolskoukrainskie.uw.edu.pl/wp-content/uploads/sites/153/2016/07/19-Valentyna-Sobol.pdf Valentyna Sobol. Plenary Session of the Shevchenko Scientific Society in Lviv on 26 March 2016. // [[Studia Polsko – Ukrainskie]]. Tom 3/2016] &lt;/ref&gt;

These encyclopedias are used as textbooks at the [[National Mining University of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="National Mining University"/&gt;

'''Mircea Eliade''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈmirt͡ʃe̯a eliˈade|lang}}; {{OldStyleDate|March 9|1907|February 24}} – April 22, 1986) was a [[Romania]]n historian of religion, fiction writer, philosopher, and professor at the [[University of Chicago]]. He was a leading interpreter of religious experience, who established [[paradigm]]s in religious studies that persist to this day. His theory that ''[[Hierophany|hierophanies]]'' form the basis of religion, splitting the human experience of reality into [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|sacred and profane]] space and time, has proved influential.&lt;ref name="Doniger Forward p.xiii"&gt;Wendy Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most influential contributions to religious studies was his theory of [[Eternal Return (Eliade)|''Eternal Return'']], which holds that myths and rituals do not simply commemorate hierophanies, but, at least to the minds of the religious, actually participate in them.&lt;ref name="Doniger Forward p.xiii"/&gt;

His literary works belong to the [[fantastic]] and [[Autobiographical novel|autobiographical]] genres. The best known are the novels ''[[Bengal Nights (novel)|Maitreyi]]'' ("La Nuit [[Bengal]]i" or "Bengal Nights"), ''[[Noaptea de Sânziene]]'' ("The Forbidden Forest"), ''Isabel și apele diavolului'' ("Isabel and the Devil's Waters") and ''[[Romanul Adolescentului Miop]]'' ("Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent"), the [[novella]]s ''[[Domnișoara Christina]]'' ("Miss Christina") and ''[[Youth Without Youth (novella)|Tinerețe fără tinerețe]]'' ("Youth Without Youth"), and the short stories ''[[Secretul doctorului Honigberger]]'' ("The Secret of Dr. Honigberger") and ''[[La Țigănci]]'' ("With the Gypsy Girls").

Early in his life, Eliade was a journalist and essayist, a disciple of Romanian [[far-right]] philosopher and journalist [[Nae Ionescu]], and a member of the literary society ''Criterion''. In the 1940s, he served as cultural attaché to the United Kingdom and Portugal. Several times during the late 1930s, Eliade publicly expressed his support for the [[Iron Guard]], a [[Fascism|fascist]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] political organization. His political involvement at the time, as well as his other [[Far-right politics|far right]] connections, were frequently criticised after [[World War II]].

Noted for his vast erudition, Eliade had fluent command of five languages ([[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[English language|English]]) and a reading knowledge of three others ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Sanskrit]]). He was elected a posthumous member of the [[Romanian Academy]].

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Born in [[Bucharest]], he was the son of [[Romanian Land Forces]] officer Gheorghe Eliade (whose original surname was Ieremia)&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"&gt;''Biografie'', in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smihai"&gt;Silviu Mihai, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=3920&amp;art=8997&amp;diraut=123&amp;cHash=ae6af0be58 "A doua viaţă a lui Mircea Eliade" ("Mircea Eliade's Second Life")], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', February 6, 2006; retrieved July 31, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeana ''née'' Vasilescu.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"&gt;Călinescu, p.956&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] believer, Gheorghe Eliade registered his son's birth four days before the actual date, to coincide with the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical calendar]] feast of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]].&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; Mircea Eliade had a sister, Corina, the mother of [[Semiotics|semiologist]] [[Sorin Alexandrescu]].&lt;ref name="scnostal"&gt;Simona Chiţan, "Nostalgia după România" ("Nostalgia for Romania"), interview with Sorin Alexandrescu, in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', June 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; His family moved between [[Tecuci]] and Bucharest, ultimately settling in the capital in 1914,&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; and purchasing a house on Melodiei Street, near [[Piața Rosetti]], where Mircea Eliade resided until late in his teens.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"&gt;Sergio Vila-Sanjuán, [http://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20070530/51355796343/paseo-por-el-bucarest-de-mircea-eliade.html "Paseo por el Bucarest de Mircea Eliade" ("Passing through Mircea Eliade's Bucharest")], in ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', May 30, 2007 {{es icon}}; retrieved January 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade kept a particularly fond memory of his childhood and, later in life, wrote about the impact various unusual episodes and encounters had on his mind. In one instance during the [[World War I]] [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian Campaign]], when Eliade was about ten years of age, he witnessed the bombing of Bucharest by [[German Empire|German]] [[zeppelin]]s and the [[Patriotism|patriotic]] fervor in the occupied capital at news that Romania was able to stop the [[Central Powers]]' advance into [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"&gt;[[Ion Hadârcă]], [http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20070428/article_3/ "Mircea Eliade la începuturi" ("Mircea Eliade at His Beginnings")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108070458/http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20070428/article_3/ |date=2007-11-08 }}, in ''Revista Sud-Est'', 1/2007; retrieved January 21, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He described this stage in his life as marked by an unrepeatable [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]].&lt;ref name="ipcmahapar"&gt;[[Ioan P. Culianu]], "Mahaparanirvana", in [http://www.elhilodeariadna.org/index.asp ''El Hilo de Ariadna''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230010917/http://www.elhilodeariadna.org/index.asp |date=2007-12-30 }}, Vol. II&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Ellwood98-99&gt;Ellwood, p.98–99&lt;/ref&gt; Recalling his entrance into a drawing room that an "eerie iridescent light" had turned into "a fairy-tale palace", he wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I practiced for many years [the] exercise of recapturing that epiphanic moment, and I would always find again the same plenitude. I would slip into it as into a fragment of time devoid of duration—without beginning, middle, or end. During my last years of lycée, when I struggled with profound attacks of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], I still succeeded at times in returning to the golden green light of that afternoon. [...] But even though the beatitude was the same, it was now impossible to bear because it aggravated my sadness too much. By this time I knew the world to which the drawing room belonged [...] was a world forever lost.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Autobiography'', in Ellwood, p.98–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robert Ellwood, a professor of religion who did his graduate studies under Mircea Eliade,&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; saw this type of [[nostalgia]] as one of the most characteristic themes in Eliade's life and academic writings.&lt;ref name = Ellwood98-99&gt;Ellwood, p.98–99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence and literary debut===
After completing his primary education at the school on Mântuleasa Street,&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; Eliade attended the [[Spiru Haret National College]] in the same class as [[Arșavir Acterian]], [[Haig Acterian]], and [[Petre Viforeanu]] (and several years the senior of [[Nicolae Steinhardt]], who eventually became a close friend of Eliade's).&lt;ref name="Steinhardt, in Handoca"&gt;Steinhardt, in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt; Among his other colleagues was future philosopher [[Constantin Noica]]&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; and Noica's friend, future art historian [[Barbu Brezianu]].&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Marinescu, [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2004-03-13/%E2%80%9CAm+luat+din+intamplarile+vietii+tot+ce+este+mai+frumos%E2%80%9D,+spune+cercetatorul+operei+brancusiene " 'Am luat din întâmplarile vieţii tot ce este mai frumos', spune cercetatorul operei brâncuşiene" (" 'I Took the Best Out of Life's Occurrences', Says Researcher of Brancusi's Work")], interview with [[Barbu Brezianu]], in ''[[Curierul Naţional]]'', March 13, 2004; retrieved February 22, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Eliade was fascinated with the natural world, which formed the setting of his very first literary attempts,&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; as well as with [[Romanian folklore]] and the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith as expressed by peasants.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Growing up, he aimed to find and record what he believed was the common source of all religious traditions.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; The young Eliade's interest in physical exercise and adventure led him to pursue [[mountaineering]] and [[sailing]],&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; and he also joined the [[Cercetaşii României|Romanian Boy Scouts]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Vlădescu, "100 de ani de cercetaşi" ("100 Years of Scouting"), in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', August 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

With a group of friends, he designed and sailed a boat on the [[Danube]], from [[Tulcea]] to the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Roman, ''Continental Drift: Colliding Continents, Converging Cultures'', [[CRC Press]], [[Institute of Physics Publishing]], Bristol and Philadelphia, 2000, p.60 {{ISBN|0-7503-0686-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Eliade grew estranged from the educational environment, becoming disenchanted with the discipline required and obsessed with the idea that he was uglier and less virile than his colleagues.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; In order to cultivate his willpower, he would force himself to swallow insects&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; and only slept four to five hours a night.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; At one point, Eliade was failing four subjects, among which was the study of the [[Romanian language]].&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;

Instead, he became interested in [[natural science]] and [[chemistry]], as well as the [[occult]],&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; and wrote short pieces on [[Entomology|entomological]] subjects.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Despite his father's concern that he was in danger of losing his already weak eyesight, Eliade read passionately.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; One of his favorite authors was [[Honoré de Balzac]], whose work he studied carefully.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Eliade also became acquainted with the [[Modernism|modernist]] short stories of [[Giovanni Papini]] and [[social anthropology]] studies by [[James George Frazer]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

His interest in the two writers led him to learn [[Italian language|Italian]] and English in private, and he also began studying [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; At the time, Eliade became acquainted with [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]]'s poems and the ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; He was also interested in philosophy—studying, among others, [[Socrates]], [[Vasile Conta]], and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Epictetus]], and read works of history—the two Romanian historians who influenced him from early on were [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] and [[Nicolae Iorga]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; His first published work was the 1921 ''Inamicul viermelui de mătase'' ("The Silkworm's Enemy"),&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; followed by ''Cum am găsit piatra filosofală'' ("How I Found the [[Philosopher's stone|Philosophers' Stone]]").&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Four years later, Eliade completed work on his debut volume, the autobiographical ''[[Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent]]''.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

===University studies and Indian sojourn===

[[File:Mircea Eliade young.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Eliade in 1933]]
Between 1925 and 1928, he attended the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculty of Philosophy and Letters in 1928, earning his diploma with a study on Early Modern [[Italy|Italian]] philosopher [[Tommaso Campanella]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; In 1927, Eliade traveled to Italy, where he met Papini&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; and collaborated with the scholar [[Giuseppe Tucci]].

It was during his student years that Eliade met [[Nae Ionescu]], who lectured in [[Logic]], becoming one of his disciples and friends.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.954, 955; Nastasă, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially attracted to Ionescu's radical ideas and his interest in religion, which signified a break with the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] tradition represented by senior academics such as [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], [[Dimitrie Gusti]], and [[Tudor Vianu]] (all of whom owed inspiration to the defunct literary society ''[[Junimea]]'', albeit in varying degrees).&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;

Eliade's scholarly works began after a long period of study in [[British India]], at the [[University of Calcutta]]. Finding that the [[Maharaja]] of [[Kassimbazar]] sponsored [[Europe]]an scholars to study in India, Eliade applied and was granted an allowance for four years, which was later doubled by a Romanian [[scholarship]].&lt;ref name="Nastasă, p.237"&gt;Nastasă, p.237&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 1928, he sailed for [[Calcutta]] to study [[Sanskrit]] and philosophy under [[Surendranath Dasgupta]], a [[Bengal]]i [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge alumnus]] and professor at Calcutta University, the author of a five volume ''History of Indian Philosophy''. Before reaching the [[Indian subcontinent]], Eliade also made a brief visit to [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; Once there, he visited large areas of the region, and spent a short period at a [[Himalaya]]n ''[[ashram]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, p.150; Nastasă, p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied the basics of [[Indian philosophy]], and, in parallel, learned Sanskrit, [[Pali]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] under Dasgupta's direction.&lt;ref name="Nastasă, p.237"/&gt; At the time, he also became interested in the actions of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], whom he met personally,&lt;ref name="rossfriesian"&gt;Kelley L. Ross, [http://www.friesian.com/eliade.htm ''Mircea Eliade''], on [http://www.friesian.com/ friesian.com]; retrieved July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Satyagraha]]'' as a phenomenon; later, Eliade adapted Gandhian ideas in his discourse on spirituality and Romania.&lt;ref name="rossfriesian"/&gt;

In 1930, while living with Dasgupta, Eliade fell in love with his host's daughter, [[Maitreyi Devi]], later writing a barely disguised autobiographical novel ''[[Bengal Nights (novel)|Maitreyi]]'' (also known as "La Nuit Bengali" or "Bengal Nights"), in which he claimed that he carried on a physical relationship with her.&lt;ref name="kamani"&gt;Ginu Kamani, [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/143651.html "A Terrible Hurt: The Untold Story behind the Publishing of Maitreyi Devi"], at the University of Chicago Press website; retrieved July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade received his [[PhD]] in 1933, with a thesis on [[Yoga]] practices.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Biografie'', in Handoca; Nastasă, p.237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ribas"&gt;Albert Ribas, "Mircea Eliade, historiador de las religiones" ("Mircea Eliade, Historian of Religions"), in ''El Ciervo. Revista de pensamiento y cultura'', Año 49, Núm. 588 (Marzo 2000), p.35–38&lt;/ref&gt; The book, which was translated into [[French language|French]] three years later,&lt;ref name="Nastasă, p.237"/&gt; had significant impact in academia, both in Romania and abroad.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

He later recalled that the book was an early step for understanding not just Indian religious practices, but also Romanian spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Nastasă, p.238&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, Eliade began a correspondence with the [[Sri Lanka|Ceylonese]]-born philosopher [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]].&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.150"&gt;McGuire, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936–1937, he functioned as honorary assistant for Ionescu's course, lecturing in [[Metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.442; Ornea, p.452&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Mircea Eliade had a physical relationship with the actress Sorana Țopa, while falling in love with Nina Mareș, whom he ultimately married.&lt;ref name="scnostal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcommare"&gt;[[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=16282&amp;print=true "Jurnalul unui om mare" ("The Diary of A Big Man")], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 338, September 2006; retrieved January 23, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, introduced to him by his new friend [[Mihail Sebastian]], already had a daughter, Giza, from a man who had divorced her.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Eliade subsequently adopted Giza,&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"&gt;Şora, in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt; and the three of them moved to an apartment at 141 [[Dacia Boulevard]].&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; He left his residence in 1936, during a trip he made to the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]], when he first visited [[London]], [[Oxford]] and [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;

===''Criterion'' and ''Cuvântul''===
[[File:Casa lui Eliade.jpg|thumb|250px|Eliade's home in [[Bucharest]] (1934–1940)]]
After contributing various and generally polemical pieces in university magazines, Eliade came to the attention of journalist [[Pamfil Șeicaru]], who invited him to collaborate on the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] paper ''[[Cuvântul]]'', which was noted for its harsh tones.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; By then, ''Cuvântul'' was also hosting articles by Ionescu.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;

As one of the figures in the ''[[Criterion (literary society)|Criterion]]'' [[literary society]] (1933–1934), Eliade's initial encounter with the traditional [[far right]] was polemical: the group's conferences were stormed by members of [[A. C. Cuza]]'s [[National-Christian Defense League]], who objected to what they viewed as [[pacifism]] and addressed [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] insults to several speakers, including Sebastian;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.150–151, 153&lt;/ref&gt; in 1933, he was among the signers of a manifesto opposing [[Nazi Germany]]'s state-enforced [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.174–175&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, at a time when Sebastian was publicly insulted by Nae Ionescu, who prefaced his book (''De două mii de ani...'') with thoughts on the "eternal damnation" of Jews, Mircea Eliade spoke out against this perspective, and commented that Ionescu's references to the verdict "[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|Outside the Church there is no salvation]]" contradicted the notion of God's [[omnipotence]].&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1934, in Ornea, p.408; see also Ellwood, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; However, he contended that Ionescu's text was not evidence of antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1934, in Ornea, p.408–409&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, reflecting on the early history of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] and its [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish community]], he deplored the expulsion of Jewish savants from Romanian soil, making specific references to [[Moses Gaster]], [[Heimann Hariton Tiktin]] and [[Lazăr Șăineanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1936, in Ornea, p.410&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade's views at the time focused on innovation—in the summer of 1933, he replied to an anti-[[Modernism|modernist]] critique written by [[George Călinescu]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;All I wish for is a deep change, a complete transformation. But, for God's sake, in any direction other than [[spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1933, in Ornea, p.167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He and friends [[Emil Cioran]] and [[Constantin Noica]] were by then under the influence of [[Trăirism]], a school of thought that was formed around the ideals expressed by Ionescu. A form of [[existentialism]], Trăirism was also the synthesis of traditional and newer [[right-wing]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, a public polemic was sparked between Eliade and [[Camil Petrescu]]: the two eventually reconciled and later became good friends.&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt;

Like Mihail Sebastian, who was himself becoming influenced by Ionescu, he maintained contacts with intellectuals from all sides of the political spectrum: their entourage included the right-wing [[Dan Botta]] and [[Mircea Vulcănescu]], the non-political Petrescu and [[Ionel Jianu]], and [[Belu Zilber]], who was a member of the illegal [[Romanian Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="tanasezilber2"&gt;[[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=569&amp;nr=2003-08-18 "Belu Zilber", Part II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010402/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2003-08-18&amp;art=569 |date=2007-09-27 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr. 701, August 2003; retrieved October 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also included [[Haig Acterian]], [[Mihail Polihroniade]], [[Petru Comarnescu]], [[Marietta Sadova]] and [[Floria Capsali]].&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"&gt;[[Andrei Oişteanu]], [https://archive.is/20071019121943/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2007-12-05&amp;art=4157 "Mihail Sebastian şi Mircea Eliade: cronica unei prietenii accidentate" ("Mihail Sebastian and Mircea Eliade: the Chronicle of an Abrupt Friendship)"], in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr. 926, December 2007; retrieved January 18, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also close to [[Mihail (Marcel) Avramescu|Marcel Avramescu]], a former [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] writer whom he introduced to the works of [[René Guénon]].&lt;ref name="pccheie"&gt;[[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=8679&amp;print=true "Eliade în cheie ezoterică" ("Eliade in Esoterical Key")], review of Marcel Tolcea, ''Eliade, ezotericul'' ("Eliade, the Esoteric"), in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 175, July 2003; retrieved July 16, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A doctor in the [[Kabbalah]] and future [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] cleric, Avramescu joined Eliade in editing the short-lived [[Esotericism|esoteric]] magazine ''Memra'' (the only one of its kind in Romania).&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=14626 "Recuperarea lui Ionathan X.

Among the intellectuals who attended his lectures were [[Mihai Şora]] (whom he deemed his favorite student), [[Eugen Schileru]] and [[Miron Constantinescu]]—known later as, respectively, a philosopher, an art critic, and a sociologist and political figure of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]].&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; [[Mariana Şora|Mariana Klein]], who became Șora's wife, was one of Eliade's female students, and later authored works on his scholarship.&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt;

Eliade later recounted that he had himself enlisted Zilber as a ''Cuvântul'' contributor, in order for him to provide a [[Marxism|Marxist]] perspective on the issues discussed by the journal.&lt;ref name="tanasezilber2"/&gt; Their relation soured in 1935, when the latter publicly accused Eliade of serving as an agent for the secret police, ''[[Siguranța Statului]]'' (Sebastian answered to the statement by alleging that Zilber was himself a secret agent, and the latter eventually retracted his claim).&lt;ref name="tanasezilber2"/&gt;

===1930s political transition===
Eliade's articles before and after his adherence to the principles of the [[Iron Guard]] (or, as it was usually known at the time, the ''Legionary Movement''), beginning with his ''Itinerar spiritual'' ("Spiritual Itinerary", serialized in ''Cuvântul'' in 1927), center on several political ideals advocated by the far right.

They displayed his rejection of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberalism]] and the [[Modernization|modernizing]] goals of the [[1848 Wallachian revolution]] (perceived as "an abstract apology of Mankind"&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1933, in Ornea, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and "ape-like imitation of [Western] Europe"),&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1936, in Ornea, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for [[democracy]] itself (accusing it of "managing to crush all attempts at national renaissance",&lt;ref name = "Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.53"&gt;Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and later praising [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] on the grounds that, according to Eliade, "[in Italy,] he who thinks for himself is promoted to the highest office in the shortest of times").&lt;ref name="Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.53"/&gt; He approved of an [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] state centered on the Orthodox Church (in 1927, despite his still-vivid interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], he recommended young [[intellectual]]s "the return to the Church"),&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1927, in Ornea, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; which he opposed to, among others, the [[Secularism|secular]] nationalism of [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]];&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1935, in Ornea, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to this particular ideal as "Romanianism", Eliade was, in 1934, still viewing it as "neither fascism, nor [[chauvinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1934, in Ornea, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade was especially dissatisfied with the incidence of unemployment among intellectuals, whose careers in state-financed institutions had been rendered uncertain by the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1933, in Ornea, pp. 178, 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Eliade was the focus of a campaign in the far right press, being targeted for having authored "[[pornography]]" in his ''[[Domnișoara Christina]]'' and ''Isabel și apele diavolului''; similar accusations were aimed at other cultural figures, including [[Tudor Arghezi]] and [[Geo Bogza]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, pp. 445–55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Assessments of Eliade's work were in sharp contrast to one another: also in 1936, Eliade accepted an award from the [[Romanian Writers' Society]], of which he had been a member since 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, pp. 525–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  In summer 1937, through an official decision which came as a result of the accusations, and despite student protests, he was stripped of his position at the University.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p. 86; Ornea, pp. 452–53; Şora, in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade decided to sue the [[Minister of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Ministry of Education]], asking for a symbolic compensation of 1 [[Romanian leu|leu]].&lt;ref name= "Ornea, p.453"&gt;Ornea, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; He won the trial, and regained his position as Nae Ionescu's assistant.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.453" /&gt;

Nevertheless, by 1937, he gave his intellectual support to the Iron Guard, in which he saw "a [[Christianity|Christian]] revolution aimed at creating a new Romania",&lt;ref name="Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.203"&gt;Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; and a group able "to reconcile Romania with God".&lt;ref name = "Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.203" /&gt; His articles of the time, published in Iron Guard papers such as ''Sfarmă Piatră'' and ''[[Buna Vestire]]'', contain ample praises of the movement's leaders ([[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], [[Ion Moţa]], [[Vasile Marin]], and [[Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.202–206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oscaderea"&gt;[[Ovidiu Şimonca]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=14834 "Mircea Eliade şi 'căderea în lume'" ("Mircea Eliade and 'the Descent into the World'")] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121222064543/http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=14834 |date=2012-12-22 }}, review of Florin Ţurcanu, ''Mircea Eliade.

He eventually enrolled in the ''Totul pentru Țară'' ("Everything for the Fatherland" Party), the political expression of the Iron Guard,&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.207"&gt;Ornea, p.207&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to its [[Romanian general election, 1937|1937 electoral campaign]] in [[Prahova County]]—as indicated by his inclusion on a list of party members with [[Counties of Romania|county]]-level responsibilities (published in ''Buna Vestire'').&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.207"/&gt;

===Internment and diplomatic service===
The stance taken by Eliade resulted in his arrest on July 14, 1938 after a crackdown on the Iron Guard authorized by [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]. At the time of his arrest, he had just interrupted a column on ''Provincia și legionarismul'' ("The Province and Legionary Ideology") in ''[[Vremea]]'', having been singled out by [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Armand Călinescu]] as an author of Iron Guard [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.208–209&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade was kept for three weeks in a cell at the ''[[Siguranţa Statului]]'' Headquarters, in an attempt to have him sign a "declaration of dissociation" with the Iron Guard, but he refused to do so.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.209"&gt;Ornea, p.209&lt;/ref&gt; In the first week of August he was transferred to a makeshift camp at [[Miercurea-Ciuc]]. When Eliade began coughing blood in October 1938, he was taken to a clinic in [[Moroeni]].&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.209"/&gt; Eliade was simply released on November 12, and subsequently spent his time writing his play ''Iphigenia'' (also known as ''Ifigenia'').&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; In April 1940, with the help of [[Alexandru Rosetti]], became the Cultural Attaché to the [[United Kingdom]], a posting cut short when Romanian-British foreign relations were broken.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.209"/&gt;

After leaving London he was assigned the office of Counsel and [[Press secretary|Press Officer]] (later Cultural Attaché) to the Romanian Embassy in [[Portugal]],&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Biografie'', in Handoca; Nastasă, p.442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cavrcitim"&gt;[[Cătălin Avramescu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=135&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=3508 "Citim una, înţelegem alta" ("We Read One Thing and Understand Another")], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Vol. III, August 2006; retrieved January 28, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mlimpost"&gt;[[Michael Löwy]], [http://assr.revues.org/document3128.html Review of Daniel Dubuisson, ''Impostures et pseudo-science.

His office involved disseminating propaganda in favor of the Romanian state.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; In February 1941, weeks after the bloody [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]] was crushed by Antonescu, ''Iphigenia'' was staged by the [[National Theater Bucharest]]—the play soon raised doubts that it owed inspiration to the Iron Guard's ideology, and even that its inclusion in the program was a Legionary attempt at subversion.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

In 1942, Eliade authored a volume in praise of the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'', established in Portugal by [[António de Oliveira Salazar]],&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mesalaz"&gt;Eliade, ''Salazar'', in "Eliade despre Salazar" ("Eliade on Salazar"), ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', October 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.90&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that "The Salazarian state, a Christian and [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] one, is first and foremost based on love".&lt;ref name="mesalaz"/&gt; On July 7 of the same year, he was received by Salazar himself, who assigned Eliade the task of warning Antonescu to withdraw the [[Romanian Army]] from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] ("[In his place], I would not be grinding it in [[Russia]]").&lt;ref name="in Handoca"&gt;Eliade, in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade also claimed that such contacts with the leader of a neutral country had made him the target for [[Gestapo]] surveillance, but that he had managed to communicate Salazar's advice to [[Mihai Antonescu]], Romania's [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Foreign Minister]].&lt;ref name="rossfriesian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in Handoca"/&gt;

In autumn 1943, he traveled to [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupied France]], where he rejoined [[Emil Cioran]], also meeting with scholar [[Georges Dumézil]] and the [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] writer [[Paul Morand]].&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; At the same time, he applied for a position of lecturer at the [[University of Bucharest]], but withdrew from the race, leaving [[Constantin Noica]] and [[Ion Zamfirescu]] to dispute the position, in front of a panel of academics comprising [[Lucian Blaga]] and [[Dimitrie Gusti]] (Zamfirescu's eventual selection, going against Blaga's recommendation, was to be the topic of a controversy).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.442–443&lt;/ref&gt; In his private notes, Eliade wrote that he took no further interest in the office, because his visits abroad had convinced him that he had "something great to say", and that he could not function within the confines of "a minor culture".&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; Also during the war, Eliade traveled to [[Berlin]], where he met and conversed with controversial political theorist [[Carl Schmitt]],&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; and frequently visited [[Spain under Franco|Francoist Spain]], where he notably attended the 1944 Lusitano-Spanish scientific congress in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jgspania"&gt;Joaquín Garrigós, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=191&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=6740 "Pasiunea lui Mircea Eliade pentru Spania" ("Mircea Eliade's Passion for Spain")], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Vol. IV, October 2007; retrieved January 21, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aoopium"&gt;[[Andrei Oişteanu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2007-05-11&amp;art=3719 "Mircea Eliade, de la opium la amfetamine" ("Mircea Eliade, from Opium to Amphetamines")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516220935/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=3719&amp;nr=2007-05-11 |date=2007-05-16 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr. 896, May 2007; retrieved January 17, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his trips to Spain that Eliade met philosophers [[José Ortega y Gasset]] and [[Eugeni d'Ors]].

Nina Eliade fell ill with [[uterine cancer]] and died during their stay in [[Lisbon]], in late 1944. As the widower later wrote, the disease was probably caused by an [[abortion]] procedure she had undergone at an early stage of their relationship.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; He came to suffer from [[clinical depression]], which increased as Romania and her [[Axis Powers|Axis]] allies suffered major defeats on the Eastern Front.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; Contemplating a return to Romania as a soldier or a [[monk]],&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; he was on a continuous search for effective [[antidepressant]]s, medicating himself with [[passion flower]] extract, and, eventually, with [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; This was probably not his first experience with drugs: vague mentions in his notebooks have been read as indication that Mircea Eliade was taking [[opium]] during his travels to [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; Later, discussing the works of [[Aldous Huxley]], Eliade wrote that the British author's use of [[mescaline]] as a source of inspiration had something in common with his own experience, indicating 1945 as a date of reference and adding that it was "needless to explain why that is".&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt;

===Early exile===
At signs that the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]] was about to take hold, Eliade opted not to return to the country. On September 16, 1945, he moved to [[France]] with his adopted daughter Giza.&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; Once there, he resumed contacts with Dumézil, who helped him recover his position in academia.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; On Dumézil's recommendation, he taught at the ''[[École Pratique des Hautes Études]]'' in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; It was estimated that, at the time, it was not uncommon for him to work 15 hours a day.&lt;ref name="ribas"/&gt; Eliade married a second time, to the Romanian exile Christinel Cotescu.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msrsotia"&gt;Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, [http://www.zf.ro/articol_87328/cottestii__familia_sotiei_lui_mircea_eliade.html "Cotteştii: familia soţiei lui Mircea Eliade" ("The Cottescus: the Family of Mircea Eliade's Wife")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803223957/http://www.zf.ro/articol_87328/cottestii__familia_sotiei_lui_mircea_eliade.html |date=2008-08-03 }}, in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', June 30, 2006; retrieved January 22, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second wife, the descendant of [[boyar]]s, was the sister-in-law of the conductor [[Ionel Perlea]].&lt;ref name="msrsotia"/&gt;

Together with [[Emil Cioran]] and other Romanian expatriates, Eliade rallied with the former diplomat [[Alexandru Busuioceanu]], helping him publicize [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] opinion to the [[Western Europe]]an public.&lt;ref name="guleaobsc"&gt;Dan Gulea, [https://archive.is/20130113115235/http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=12070 "O perspectivă sintetică" ("A Syncretic Perspective")], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 242, October 2004; retrieved October 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also briefly involved in publishing a Romanian-language magazine, titled ''Luceafărul'' ("The Morning Star"),&lt;ref name="guleaobsc"/&gt; and was again in contact with [[Mihail Șora]], who had been granted a [[scholarship]] to study in France, and with Șora's wife [[Mariana Şora|Mariana]].&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; In 1947, he was facing material constraints, and [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] found him a job as a [[French language|French-language]] teacher in the [[United States]], at a school in [[Arizona]]; the arrangement ended upon Coomaraswamy's death in September.&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.150"/&gt;

Beginning in 1948, he wrote for the journal ''Critique'', edited by French philosopher  [[Georges Bataille]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; The following year, he went on a visit to Italy, where he wrote the first 300 pages of his novel ''[[Noaptea de Sânziene]]'' (he visited the country a third time in 1952).&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; He collaborated with [[Carl Jung]] and the ''[[Eranos]]'' circle after [[Henry Corbin]] recommended him in 1949,&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.150"/&gt; and wrote for the ''Antaios'' magazine (edited by [[Ernst Jünger]]).&lt;ref name="ribas"/&gt; In 1950, Eliade began attending ''Eranos'' conferences, meeting Jung, [[Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn]], [[Gershom Scholem]] and [[Paul Radin]].&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, p.150–151&lt;/ref&gt; He described ''Eranos'' as "one of the most creative cultural experiences of the modern Western world."&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.151"&gt;McGuire, p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1956, he moved to the United States, settling in [[Chicago]] the following year.&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; He had been invited by [[Joachim Wach]] to give a series of lectures at Wach's home institution, the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.151"/&gt; Eliade and Wach are generally admitted to be the founders of the "Chicago school" that basically defined the study of religions for the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics in History"&gt;[http://marty-center.uchicago.edu/conferences/wach_eliade/about.shtml Conference on ''Hermeneutics in History: Mircea Eliade, Joachim Wach, and the Science of Religions''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211130723/http://marty-center.uchicago.edu/conferences/wach_eliade/about.shtml |date=2006-12-11 }}, at the [http://marty-center.uchicago.edu/ University of Chicago Martin Marty Center.

In 1966, Mircea Eliade became a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; He also worked as editor-in-chief of [[Macmillan Publishers]]' ''Encyclopedia of Religion'', and, in 1968, lectured in religious history at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Oişteanu, "Mircea Eliade şi mişcarea hippie"&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during that period that Mircea Eliade completed his voluminous and influential ''History of Religious Ideas'', which grouped together the overviews of his main original interpretations of religious history.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; He occasionally traveled out of the United States, such as attending the Congress for the History of Religions in [[Marburg]] (1960) and visits to [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;

===Final years and death===
Initially, Eliade was attacked with virulence by the [[Romanian Communist Party]] press, chiefly by ''[[România Liberă]]''—which described him as "the Iron Guard's ideologue, [[Enemy of the people|enemy of the working class]], apologist of Salazar's dictatorship".&lt;ref&gt;''România Liberă'', ''passim'' September–October 1944, in Frunză, p.251&lt;/ref&gt; However, the regime also made secretive attempts to enlist his and Cioran's support: [[Haig Acterian]]'s widow, theater director [[Marietta Sadova]], was sent to Paris in order to re-establish contacts with the two.&lt;ref name="tismetern"&gt;[[Vladimir Tismăneanu]], ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'' (Romanian translation of ''Stalinism for All Seasons''), [[Polirom]], Iaşi, 2005, p.187, 337. {{ISBN|973-681-899-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the move was planned by Romanian officials, her encounters were to be used as evidence incriminating her at a February 1960 trial for treason (where [[Constantin Noica]] and [[Dinu Pillat]] were the main defendants).&lt;ref name="tismetern"/&gt; Romania's secret police, the [[Securitate]], also portrayed Eliade as a spy for the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] and a former agent of the Gestapo.&lt;ref name="zfscriit"&gt;Alexandru Popescu, [http://www.zf.ro/articol_109162/alexandru_popescu__ix___scriitorii_si_spionajul.html "Scriitorii şi spionajul" ("Writers and Spying")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215185224/http://www.zf.ro/articol_109162/alexandru_popescu__ix___scriitorii_si_spionajul.html |date=2008-02-15 }}, in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', January 26, 2007; retrieved November 8, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was slowly [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] at home beginning in the early 1960s, under the rule of [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]].&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.448–449&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Eliade was approached by the [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] regime in several ways, in order to have him return.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; The move was prompted by the officially sanctioned nationalism and Romania's claim to independence from the [[Eastern Bloc]], as both phenomena came to see Eliade's prestige as an asset. An unprecedented event occurred with the interview that was granted by Mircea Eliade to poet [[Adrian Păunescu]], during the latter's 1970 visit to Chicago; Eliade complimented both Păunescu's activism and his support for official tenets, expressing a belief that
&lt;blockquote&gt;the youth of Eastern Europe is clearly superior to that of Western Europe. [...] I am convinced that, within ten years, the young revolutionary generation shan't be behaving as does today the noisy minority of [[New Left|Western contesters]]. [...] Eastern youth have seen the abolition of traditional institutions, have accepted it [...] and are not yet content with the structures enforced, but rather seek to improve them.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1970, in [[Paul Cernat]], "Îmblânzitorul României Socialiste. De la Bîrca la Chicago şi înapoi" ("The Tamer of Socialist Romania.

Păunescu's visit to Chicago was followed by those of the nationalist official writer [[Eugen Barbu]] and by Eliade's friend Constantin Noica (who had since been released from jail).&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; At the time, Eliade contemplated returning to Romania, but was eventually persuaded by fellow Romanian intellectuals in exile (including [[Radio Free Europe]]'s [[Virgil Ierunca]] and [[Monica Lovinescu]]) to reject Communist proposals.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; In 1977, he joined other exiled Romanian intellectuals in signing a telegram protesting the repressive measures newly enforced by the Ceauşescu regime.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; Writing in 2007, Romanian anthropologist [[Andrei Oișteanu]] recounted how, around 1984, the Securitate unsuccessfully pressured to become an [[agent of influence]] in Eliade's Chicago circle.&lt;ref name="teodoist"&gt;Cristian Teodorescu, [http://cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=11526&amp;art=30480&amp;cHash=19a3e7c987 "Eliade şi Culianu prin ocheanul lui Oişteanu" ("Eliade and Culianu through Oişteanu's Lens")], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', June 14, 2007; retrieved November 7, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his later years, Eliade's fascist past was progressively exposed publicly, the stress of which probably contributed to the decline of his health.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; By then, his writing career was hampered by severe [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; The last academic honors bestowed upon him were the [[Académie française|French Academy]]'s [[Bordin Prize]] (1977) and the title of ''[[Honorary degree|Doctor Honoris Causa]]'', granted by the [[University of Washington]] (1985).&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;

In his work on the history of religion, Eliade is most highly regarded for his writings on [[Alchemy]],&lt;ref&gt;'Eliade offers a theoretical background for understanding alchemy from the perspective of  the history of  religion.

Eliade's thinking was in part influenced by [[Rudolf Otto]], [[Gerardus van der Leeuw]], [[Nae Ionescu]] and the writings of the [[Traditionalist School]] ([[René Guénon]] and [[Julius Evola]]).&lt;ref name="pccheie"/&gt; For instance, Eliade's ''The Sacred and the Profane'' partially builds on Otto's ''[[Numinous|The Idea of the Holy]]'' to show how religion emerges from the experience of the sacred, and myths of time and nature.

Eliade is known for his attempt to find broad, cross-cultural parallels and unities in religion, particularly in myths. [[Wendy Doniger]], Eliade's colleague from 1978 until his death, has observed that "Eliade argued boldly for universals where he might more safely have argued for widely prevalent patterns".&lt;ref&gt;Doniger's foreword to Eliade's ''Shamanism'' (Princeton University Press edition, 1972, p.xii)&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Treatise on the History of Religions'' was praised by French philologist [[Georges Dumézil]] for its coherence and ability to synthesize diverse and distinct mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil, "Introducere", in Eliade, ''Tratat de istorie a religiilor: Introducere'' ("Religious History Treatise" – ''Patterns in Comparative Religion''), [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Ellwood describes Eliade's approach to religion as follows. Eliade approaches religion by imagining an ideally "religious" person, whom he calls ''homo religiosus'' in his writings. Eliade's theories basically describe how this ''homo religiosus'' would view the world.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.99"&gt;Ellwood, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that all religious practitioners actually think and act like ''homo religiosus''. Instead, it means that religious behavior "says through its own language" that the world is as ''homo religiosus'' would see it, whether or not the real-life participants in religious behavior are aware of it.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.104"&gt;Ellwood, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ellwood writes that Eliade "tends to slide over that last qualification", implying that traditional societies actually thought like ''homo religiosus''.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.104"/&gt;

====Sacred and profane====
[[File:Mosesshoesspeculum.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Moses]] taking off his shoes in front of the [[burning bush]] (illustration from a 16th-century edition of the ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'').]]
Eliade argues that "Yahweh is both kind and wrathful; the God of the Christian mystics and theologians is terrible and gentle at once".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.450"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; He also thought that the Indian and [[China|Chinese]] mystic tried to attain "a state of perfect indifference and neutrality" that resulted in a coincidence of opposites in which "pleasure and pain, desire and repulsion, cold and heat [...] are expunged from his awareness".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.450"/&gt;

Eliade's understanding of religion centers on his concept of [[hierophany]] (manifestation of the Sacred)—a concept that includes, but is not limited to, the older and more restrictive concept of [[theophany]] (manifestation of a god).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.20–22; ''Shamanism'', p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of religious thought, Eliade argues, hierophanies give structure and orientation to the world, establishing a sacred order. The "profane" space of nonreligious experience can only be divided up geometrically: it has no "qualitative differentiation and, hence, no orientation [is] given by virtue of its inherent structure".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.22"&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, profane space gives man no pattern for his behavior. In contrast to profane space, the site of a hierophany has a sacred structure to which religious man conforms himself. A hierophany amounts to a "revelation of an absolute reality, opposed to the non-reality of the vast surrounding expanse".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.21"&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.21&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of "[[hierotopy|sacred space]]" demanding a certain response from man, Eliade gives the story of [[Moses]] halting before [[Yahweh]]'s manifestation as a [[burning bush]] (''[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'' 3:5) and taking off his shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Origin myths and sacred time====
Eliade notes that, in traditional societies, myth represents the absolute truth about primordial time.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.23"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.23&lt;/ref&gt; According to the myths, this was the time when the Sacred first appeared, establishing the world's structure—myths claim to describe the primordial events that made society and the natural world be that which they are. Eliade argues that all myths are, in that sense, origin myths: "myth, then, is always an account of a ''creation''".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional societies believe that the power of a thing lies in its origin.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.15&lt;/ref&gt; If origin is equivalent to power, then "it is the first manifestation of a thing that is significant and valid"&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.34&lt;/ref&gt; (a thing's reality and value therefore lies only in its first appearance).

According to Eliade's theory, only the Sacred has value, only a thing's first appearance has value and, therefore, only the Sacred's first appearance has value. Myth describes the Sacred's first appearance; therefore, the mythical age is sacred time,&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.23"/&gt; the only time of value: "primitive man was interested only in the ''beginnings'' [...] to him it mattered little what had happened to himself, or to others like him, in more or less distant times".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.44"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade postulated this as the reason for the "[[nostalgia]] for origins" that appears in many religions, the desire to return to a primordial [[Paradise]].&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.44"/&gt;

====Eternal return and "Terror of history"====
{{Main|Eternal return (Eliade)}}
Eliade argues that traditional man attributes no value to the linear march of historical events: only the events of the mythical age have value. To give his own life value, traditional man performs myths and rituals. Because the Sacred's essence lies only in the mythical age, only in the Sacred's first appearance, any later appearance is actually the first appearance; by recounting or re-enacting mythical events, myths and rituals "re-actualize" those events.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.68–69&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade often uses the term "[[archetype]]s" to refer to the mythical models established by the Sacred, although Eliade's use of the term should be distinguished from the use of the term in [[Jungian psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Leeming, "Archetypes"&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, argues Eliade, religious behavior does not only commemorate, but also participates in, sacred events:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ''imitating'' the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythical hero, or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.23"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eliade called this concept the "[[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]]" (distinguished from the [[Eternal return|philosophical concept of "eternal return"]]). Wendy Doniger noted that Eliade's theory of the eternal return "has become a truism in the study of religions".&lt;ref name="Doniger Forward p.xiii"/&gt;

Eliade attributes the well-known "cyclic" vision of time in ancient thought to belief in the eternal return. For instance, the [[New Year]] ceremonies among the [[Mesopotamia]]ns, the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], and other [[Ancient Near East|Near Eastern]] peoples re-enacted their [[Cosmogony|cosmogonic]] myths. Therefore, by the logic of the eternal return, each New Year ceremony ''was'' the beginning of the world for these peoples. According to Eliade, these peoples felt a need to return to the Beginning at regular intervals, turning time into a circle.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality, p.47–49&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade argues that yearning to remain in the mythical age causes a "terror of history": traditional man desires to escape the linear succession of events (which, Eliade indicated, he viewed as empty of any inherent value or sacrality). Eliade suggests that the abandonment of mythical thought and the full acceptance of linear, historical time, with its "terror", is one of the reasons for modern man's anxieties.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', Chapter 4; ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.231–245&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional societies escape this anxiety to an extent, as they refuse to completely acknowledge historical time.

====''Coincidentia oppositorum''====
Eliade claims that many myths, rituals, and mystical experiences involve a "coincidence of opposites", or ''[[coincidentia oppositorum]]''. In fact, he calls the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' "the mythical pattern".&lt;ref&gt;In ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'' (p.419), Eliade gives a section about the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' the title "Coincidentia Oppositorum—THE MYTHICAL PATTERN". Beane and Doty chose to retain this title when excerpting this section in ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'' (p. 449).&lt;/ref&gt; Many myths, Eliade notes, "present us with a twofold revelation":
&lt;blockquote&gt;they express on the one hand the diametrical opposition of two divine figures sprung from one and the same principle and destined, in many versions, to be reconciled at some ''illud tempus'' of eschatology, and on the other, the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' in the very nature of the divinity, which shows itself, by turns or even simultaneously, benevolent and terrible, creative and destructive, solar and serpentine, and so on (in other words, actual and potential).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', p. 449&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Eliade argues that "Yahweh is both kind and wrathful; the God of the Christian mystics and theologians is terrible and gentle at once".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.450"/&gt; He also thought that the Indian and Chinese mystic tried to attain "a state of perfect indifference and neutrality" that resulted in a coincidence of opposites in which "pleasure and pain, desire and repulsion, cold and heat [...] are expunged from his awareness".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.450"/&gt;

According to Eliade, the ''coincidentia oppositorum''’s appeal lies in "man's deep dissatisfaction with his actual situation, with what is called the human condition".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.439"/&gt; In many mythologies, the end of the mythical age involves a "fall", a fundamental "[[Ontology|ontological]] change in the structure of the World".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.440"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', p. 440&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' is a contradiction, it represents a denial of the world's current logical structure, a reversal of the "fall".

Also, traditional man's dissatisfaction with the post-mythical age expresses itself as a feeling of being "torn and separate".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.439"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', p. 439&lt;/ref&gt; In many mythologies, the lost mythical age was a Paradise, "a paradoxical state in which the contraries exist side by side without conflict, and the multiplications form aspects of a mysterious Unity".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.440"/&gt; The ''coincidentia oppositorum'' expresses a wish to recover the lost unity of the mythical Paradise, for it presents a reconciliation of opposites and the unification of diversity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the level of pre-systematic thought, the mystery of totality embodies man's endeavor to reach a perspective in which the contraries are abolished, the Spirit of Evil reveals itself as a stimulant of Good, and Demons appear as the night aspect of the Gods.&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.440"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Exceptions to the general nature===
[[File:Meister von Torcello 001.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Last Judgment]] (detail) in the 12th century [[Byzantine art|Byzantine mosaic]] at [[Torcello]].]]
Eliade acknowledges that not all religious behavior has all the attributes described in his theory of sacred time and the eternal return. The [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Islam|Muslim]] traditions embrace linear, historical time as sacred or capable of sanctification, while some [[Eastern religions|Eastern traditions]] largely reject the notion of sacred time, seeking escape from the [[wheel of time|cycles of time]].

Because they contain rituals, Judaism and Christianity necessarily—Eliade argues—retain a sense of cyclic time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''by the very fact that it is a religion'', Christianity had to keep at least one mythical aspect—[[Liturgy|liturgical]] Time, that is, the periodic rediscovery of the ''illud tempus'' of the beginnings [and] an ''imitation'' of the [[Christ]] as ''exemplary pattern''.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Judaism and Christianity do not see time as a circle endlessly turning on itself; nor do they see such a cycle as desirable, as a way to participate in the Sacred. Instead, these religions embrace the concept of linear history progressing toward the [[Messianic Age]] or the [[Last Judgment]], thus initiating the idea of "progress" (humans are to work for a Paradise in the future).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 64–65, 169&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eliade's understanding of Judaeo-Christian [[eschatology]] can also be understood as cyclical in that the "end of time" is a return to God: "The final catastrophe will put an end to history, hence will restore man to eternity and beatitude".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-[[Islam]]ic [[Persian Empire|Persian]] religion of Zoroastrianism, which made a notable "contribution to the religious formation of the West",&lt;ref name="Eliade v.1 p.302"&gt;Eliade, ''A History of Religious Ideas'', vol. 1, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; also has a linear sense of time. According to Eliade, the Hebrews had a linear sense of time before being influenced by Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref name="Eliade v.1 p.302"/&gt; In fact, Eliade identifies the Hebrews, not the Zoroastrians, as the first culture to truly "valorize" historical time, the first to see all major historical events as episodes in a continuous divine revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''A History of Religious Ideas'', vol. 1, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eliade argues, Judaism elaborated its mythology of linear time by adding elements borrowed from Zoroastrianism—including [[Dualistic cosmology#Moral dualism|ethical dualism]], a savior figure, the future resurrection of the body, and the idea of cosmic progress toward "the final triumph of Good".&lt;ref name="Eliade v.1 p.302"/&gt;

The [[Indian religions]] of the East generally retain a cyclic view of time—for instance, the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] doctrine of ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]''. According to Eliade, most religions that accept the cyclic view of time also embrace it: they see it as a way to return to the sacred time. However, in [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and some forms of Hinduism, the Sacred lies outside the flux of the material world (called ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'', or "illusion"), and one can only reach it by escaping from the cycles of time.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.109&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Sacred lies outside cyclic time, which conditions humans, people can only reach the Sacred by escaping the [[human condition]]. According to Eliade, [[Yoga]] techniques aim at escaping the limitations of the body, allowing the soul (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') to rise above ''maya'' and reach the Sacred (''[[nirvana]]'', ''[[moksha]]''). Imagery of "freedom", and of death to one's old body and rebirth with a new body, occur frequently in Yogic texts, representing escape from the bondage of the temporal human condition.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', Volume 2, p.312–14&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade discusses these themes in detail in ''Yoga: Immortality and Freedom''.

===Symbolism of the Center===
{{Main|Axis mundi}}
[[File:AM 738 4to Yggdrasill.png|thumb|150px|The [[World Tree|Cosmic Tree]] ''[[Yggdrasill]]'', as depicted in a 17th-century [[Iceland]]ic miniature.]]
A recurrent theme in Eliade's myth analysis is the ''[[axis mundi]]'', the Center of the World. According to Eliade, the Cosmic Center is a necessary corollary to the division of reality into the Sacred and the profane. The Sacred contains all value, and the world gains purpose and meaning only through hierophanies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the homogeneous and infinite expanse, in which no point of reference is possible and hence no orientation is established, the [[hierophany]] reveals an absolute fixed point, a center.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.21"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because profane space gives man no orientation for his life, the Sacred must manifest itself in a hierophany, thereby establishing a sacred site around which man can orient himself. The site of a hierophany establishes a "fixed point, a center".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; This Center abolishes the "homogeneity and relativity of profane space",&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.22"/&gt; for it becomes "the central axis for all future orientation".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.21"/&gt;

A manifestation of the Sacred in profane space is, by definition, an example of something breaking through from one plane of existence to another. Therefore, the initial hierophany that establishes the Center must be a point at which there is contact between different planes—this, Eliade argues, explains the frequent mythical imagery of a [[World Tree|Cosmic Tree]] or Pillar joining Heaven, Earth, and the [[underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.259–260&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade noted that, when traditional societies found a new territory, they often perform consecrating rituals that reenact the hierophany that established the Center and founded the world.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.32–36&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the designs of traditional buildings, especially temples, usually imitate the mythical image of the ''axis mundi'' joining the different cosmic levels. For instance, the [[Babylon]]ian [[ziggurat]]s were built to resemble cosmic mountains passing through the heavenly spheres, and the rock of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] was supposed to reach deep into the ''[[tehom]]'', or primordial waters.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.40, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the logic of the [[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]], the site of each such symbolic Center will actually be the Center of the World:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be said, in general, that the majority of the sacred and ritual trees that we meet with in the history of religions are only replicas, imperfect copies of this exemplary archetype, the Cosmic Tree. Thus, all these sacred trees are thought of as situated at the Centre of the World, and all the ritual trees or posts [...] are, as it were, magically projected into the Centre of the World.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Eliade's interpretation, religious man apparently feels the need to live not only near, but ''at'', the mythical Center as much as possible, given that the Center is the point of communication with the Sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Eliade argues, many traditional societies share common outlines in their mythical [[geography|geographies]]. In the middle of the known world is the sacred Center, "a place that is sacred above all";&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.39&lt;/ref&gt; this Center anchors the established order.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.22"/&gt; Around the sacred Center lies the known world, the realm of established order; and beyond the known world is a chaotic and dangerous realm, "peopled by ghosts, demons, [and] 'foreigners' (who are [identified with] demons and the souls of the dead)".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.29&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, traditional societies place their known world at the Center because (from their perspective) their known world is the realm that obeys a recognizable order, and it therefore must be the realm in which the Sacred manifests itself; the regions beyond the known world, which seem strange and foreign, must lie far from the Center, outside the order established by the Sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', pp. 39–40; Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

===The High God===
{{See also|Sky father|Deus otiosus}}
According to some "evolutionistic" theories of religion, especially that of [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], cultures naturally progress from [[animism]] and [[polytheism]] to [[monotheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p.157, 161&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, more advanced cultures should be more monotheistic, and more primitive cultures should be more polytheistic. However, many of the most "primitive", pre-agricultural societies believe in a supreme [[Sky father|sky-god]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.93; ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.38–40, 54–58&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Eliade, post-19th-century scholars have rejected Tylor's theory of evolution from [[animism]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p.161&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the discovery of supreme sky-gods among "primitives", Eliade suspects that the earliest humans worshiped a heavenly Supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.38, 54; ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.176&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', he writes, "The most popular prayer in the world is addressed to 'Our Father who art in heaven.' It is possible that man's earliest prayers were addressed to the same heavenly father."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Eliade disagrees with [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]], who thought the earliest form of religion was a strict monotheism. Eliade dismisses this theory of "primordial monotheism" (''Urmonotheismus'') as "rigid" and unworkable.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p.162; see also Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.54–58&lt;/ref&gt; "At most," he writes, "this schema [Schmidt's theory] renders an account of human [religious] evolution since the [[Paleolithic]] era".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; If an ''Urmonotheismus'' did exist, Eliade adds, it probably differed in many ways from the conceptions of God in many modern monotheistic faiths: for instance, the primordial High God could manifest himself as an animal without losing his status as a celestial Supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p. 176–77&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eliade, heavenly Supreme Beings are actually less common in more advanced cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.54–55&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade speculates that the discovery of agriculture brought a host of [[Fertility god|fertility gods and goddesses]] into the forefront, causing the celestial Supreme Being to fade away and eventually vanish from many ancient religions.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.138&lt;/ref&gt; Even in primitive hunter-gatherer societies, the High God is a vague, distant figure, dwelling high above the world.&lt;ref&gt;See Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.54–56&lt;/ref&gt; Often he has no [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] and receives [[prayer]] only as a last resort, when all else has failed.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.134–36; ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade calls the distant High God a ''[[deus otiosus]]'' ("idle god").&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.93–94&lt;/ref&gt;

In belief systems that involve a ''deus otiosus'', the distant High God is believed to have been closer to humans during the mythical age. After finishing his works of creation, the High God "forsook the earth and withdrew into the highest heaven".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.134&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the Sacred's distance from "profane" life, life lived after the mythical age: by escaping from the profane condition through religious behavior, figures such as the [[shaman]] return to the conditions of the mythical age, which include nearness to the High God ("by his ''flight'' or ascension, the shaman [...] meets the God of Heaven face to face and speaks directly to him, as man sometimes did ''in illo tempore''").&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.66"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.66&lt;/ref&gt; The shamanistic behaviors surrounding the High God are a particularly clear example of the eternal return.

===Shamanism===

====Overview====
[[File:Schamanin während einer Kamlanie-Zeremonie am Feuer in Kysyl.jpg|thumb|260px|A [[shaman]] performing a ceremonial in [[Tuva]].]]
Eliade's scholarly work includes a study of shamanism, ''[[Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy]]'', a survey of shamanistic practices in different areas. His ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'' also addresses shamanism in some detail.

In ''Shamanism'', Eliade argues for a restrictive use of the word ''shaman'': it should not apply to just any [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]] or [[medicine man]], as that would make the term redundant; at the same time, he argues against restricting the term to the practitioners of the sacred of [[Siberia]] and [[Central Asia]] (it is from one of the titles for this function, namely, ''šamán'', considered by Eliade to be of [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] origin, that the term itself was introduced into Western languages).&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism'', p. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade defines a shaman as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;he is believed to cure, like all doctors, and to perform miracles of the [[fakir]] type, like all magicians [...] But beyond this, he is a [[psychopomp]], and he may also be a priest, [[Mysticism|mystic]], and poet.&lt;ref name="Eliade, Shamanism, p.4"&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If we define shamanism this way, Eliade claims, we find that the term covers a collection of phenomena that share a common and unique "structure" and "history".&lt;ref name="Eliade, Shamanism, p.4"/&gt; (When thus defined, shamanism tends to occur in its purest forms in [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting]] and [[Herding|pastoral]] societies like those of Siberia and Central Asia, which revere a celestial High God "on the way to becoming a ''deus otiosus''".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.6, 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade takes the shamanism of those regions as his most representative example.)

In his examinations of shamanism, Eliade emphasizes the shaman's attribute of regaining man's condition before the "Fall" out of sacred time: "The most representative mystical experience of the archaic societies, that of shamanism, betrays the ''Nostalgia for Paradise'', the desire to recover the state of freedom and beatitude before 'the Fall'."&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.66"/&gt; This concern—which, by itself, is the concern of almost all religious behavior, according to Eliade—manifests itself in specific ways in shamanism.

====Death, resurrection and secondary functions====
According to Eliade, one of the most common shamanistic themes is the shaman's supposed death and [[resurrection]]. This occurs in particular during his [[initiation]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', pp.82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the procedure is supposed to be performed by spirits who dismember the shaman and strip the flesh from his bones, then put him back together and revive him. In more than one way, this death and resurrection represents the shaman's elevation above human nature.

First, the shaman dies so that he can rise above human nature on a quite literal level. After he has been dismembered by the initiatory spirits, they often replace his old organs with new, magical ones (the shaman dies to his profane self so that he can rise again as a new, sanctified, being).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Second, by being reduced to his bones, the shaman experiences rebirth on a more symbolic level: in many hunting and herding societies, the bone represents the source of life, so reduction to a skeleton "is equivalent to re-entering the womb of this primordial life, that is, to a complete renewal, a mystical rebirth".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.63&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade considers this return to the source of life essentially equivalent to the eternal return.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, the shamanistic phenomenon of repeated death and resurrection also represents a transfiguration in other ways. The shaman dies not once but many times: having died during initiation and risen again with new powers, the shaman can send his spirit out of his body on errands; thus, his whole career consists of repeated deaths and resurrections. The shaman's new ability to die and return to life shows that he is no longer bound by the laws of profane time, particularly the law of death: "the ability to 'die' and come to life again [...] denotes that [the shaman] has surpassed the human condition".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Having risen above the human condition, the shaman is not bound by the flow of history. Therefore, he enjoys the conditions of the mythical age. In many myths, humans can speak with animals; and, after their initiations, many shamans claim to be able to communicate with animals. According to Eliade, this is one manifestation of the shaman's return to "the ''illud tempus'' described to us by the paradisiac myths".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

The shaman can descend to the underworld or ascend to heaven, often by climbing the [[World Tree]], the cosmic pillar, the sacred ladder, or some other form of the ''[[axis mundi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.64&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the shaman will ascend to heaven to speak with the High God. Because the gods (particularly the High God, according to Eliade's ''deus otiosus'' concept) were closer to humans during the mythical age, the shaman's easy communication with the High God represents an abolition of history and a return to the mythical age.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.66"/&gt;

Because of his ability to communicate with the gods and descend to the land of the dead, the shaman frequently functions as a [[psychopomp]] and a [[medicine man]].&lt;ref name="Eliade, Shamanism, p.4"/&gt;

==Eliade's philosophy==

===Early contributions===
In addition to his political essays, the young Mircea Eliade authored others, philosophical in content. Connected with the ideology of [[Trăirism]], they were often prophetic in tone, and saw Eliade being hailed as a herald by various representatives of his generation.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; When Eliade was 21 years old and publishing his ''Itinerar spiritual'', literary critic [[Şerban Cioculescu]] described him as "the column leader of the spiritually mystical and [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] youth."&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Cioculescu discussed his "impressive erudition", but argued that it was "occasionally plethoric, poetically inebriating itself through abuse".&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Cioculescu's colleague [[Perpessicius]] saw the young author and his generation as marked by "the specter of war", a notion he connected to various essays of the 1920s and 30s in which Eliade threatened the world with the verdict that a new conflict was looming (while asking that young people be allowed to manifest their will and fully experience freedom before perishing).&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

One of Eliade's noted contributions in this respect was the 1932 ''Soliloquii'' ("Soliloquies"), which explored [[Existentialism|existential philosophy]]. [[George Călinescu]] who saw in it "an echo of [[Nae Ionescu]]'s lectures",&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"&gt;Călinescu, p.954&lt;/ref&gt; traced a parallel with the essays of another of Ionescu's disciples, [[Emil Cioran]], while noting that Cioran's were "of a more exulted tone and written in the [[Aphorism|aphoristic]] form of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]]".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.955&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu recorded Eliade's rejection of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], citing the author's stated indifference towards any "naïveté" or "contradictions" that the reader could possibly reproach him, as well as his dismissive thoughts of "theoretical data" and mainstream philosophy in general (Eliade saw the latter as "inert, infertile and pathogenic").&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"/&gt; Eliade thus argued, "a sincere brain is unassailable, for it denies itself to any relationship with outside truths."&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.954"&gt;Eliade, in Călinescu, p.954&lt;/ref&gt;

The young writer was however careful to clarify that the existence he took into consideration was not the life of "instincts and personal [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]]", which he believed determined the lives of many humans, but that of a distinct set comprising "personalities".&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.954"/&gt; He described "personalities" as characterized by both "purpose" and "a much more complicated and dangerous alchemy".&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.954"/&gt; This differentiation, George Călinescu believed, echoed Ionescu's metaphor of man, seen as "the only animal who can fail at living", and the duck, who "shall remain a duck no matter what it does".&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, in Călinescu, p.953, 954&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, the purpose of personalities is infinity: "consciously and gloriously bringing [existence] to waste, into as many skies as possible, continuously fulfilling and polishing oneself, seeking ascent and not circumference."&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.954"/&gt;

In Eliade's view, two roads await man in this process. One is glory, determined by either work or procreation, and the other the [[asceticism]] of religion or magic—both, Călinescu believed, where aimed at reaching the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], even in those cases where Eliade described the latter as an "abyssal experience" into which man may take the plunge.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"/&gt; The critic pointed out that the addition of "a magical solution" to the options taken into consideration seemed to be Eliade's own original contributions to his mentor's philosophy, and proposed that it may have owed inspiration to [[Julius Evola]] and his disciples.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"/&gt; He also recorded that Eliade applied this concept to human creation, and specifically to artistic creation, citing him describing the latter as "a magical joy, the victorious break of the iron circle" (a reflection of ''[[imitatio dei]]'', having salvation for its ultimate goal).&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"/&gt;

===Philosopher of religion===

====Anti-reductionism and the "transconscious"====
By profession, Eliade was a historian of religion. However, his scholarly works draw heavily on philosophical and psychological terminology. In addition, they contain a number of philosophical arguments about religion. In particular, Eliade often implies the existence of a universal psychological or spiritual "essence" behind all religious phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.110–11&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these arguments, some have accused Eliade of over-generalization and "[[essentialism]]", or even of promoting a theological agenda under the guise of historical scholarship. However, others argue that Eliade is better understood as a scholar who is willing to openly discuss sacred experience and its consequences.&lt;ref&gt;For example, according to Wendy Doniger (Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.xv), Eliade has been accused "of being a crypto-theologian"; however, Doniger argues that Eliade is better characterized as "an open hierogian". Likewise, Robert Ellwood (Ellwood, p.111) denies that Eliade practiced "covert theology".&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying religion, Eliade rejects certain "[[Reductionism|reductionist]]" approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allen, ''Myth and Religion in Mircea Eliade'', [[Routledge]], London, 2002, p.45–46; [[Adrian Marino]], ''L'Herméneutique de Mircea Eliade'', [[Éditions Gallimard]], Paris, 1981, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade thinks a religious phenomenon cannot be reduced to a product of culture and history. He insists that, although religion involves "the social man, the economic man, and so forth", nonetheless "all these conditioning factors together do not, of themselves, add up to the life of the spirit".&lt;ref name="Eliade p.32"&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this anti-reductionist position, Eliade argues against those who accuse him of overgeneralizing, of looking for [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] at the expense of [[particular]]s. Eliade admits that every religious phenomenon is shaped by the particular culture and history that produced it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When the Son of God incarnated and became the Christ, he had to speak [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]; he could only conduct himself as a Hebrew of his times [...] His religious message, however universal it might be, was conditioned by the past and present history of the Hebrew people. If the Son of God had been born in India, his spoken language would have had to conform itself to the structure of the [[Languages of India|Indian languages]].&lt;ref name="Eliade p.32"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Eliade argues against those he calls "[[Historicism|historicist]] or [[Existentialism|existentialist]] philosophers" who do not recognize "man in general" behind particular men produced by particular situations&lt;ref name="Eliade p.32"/&gt; (Eliade cites [[Immanuel Kant]] as the likely forerunner of this kind of "historicism").&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that human consciousness transcends (is not reducible to) its historical and cultural conditioning,&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.33&lt;/ref&gt; and even suggests the possibility of a "transconscious".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.17&lt;/ref&gt; By this, Eliade does not necessarily mean anything supernatural or mystical: within the "transconscious", he places religious motifs, symbols, images, and nostalgias that are supposedly universal and whose causes therefore cannot be reduced to historical and cultural conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

====Platonism and "primitive ontology"====
According to Eliade, traditional man feels that things "acquire their reality, their identity, only to the extent of their participation in a transcendent reality".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.5"&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; To traditional man, the profane world is "meaningless", and a thing rises out of the profane world only by conforming to an ideal, mythical model.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.34"&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade describes this view of reality as a fundamental part of "primitive [[ontology]]" (the study of "existence" or "reality").&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.34"/&gt; Here he sees a similarity with the philosophy of [[Plato]], who believed that physical phenomena are pale and transient imitations of eternal models or "Forms" (''see [[Theory of forms]]''). He argued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Plato could be regarded as the outstanding philosopher of 'primitive mentality,' that is, as the thinker who succeeded in giving philosophic currency and validity to the modes of life and behavior of archaic humanity.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.34"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eliade thinks the [[Platonic realism|Platonic]] ''Theory of forms'' is "primitive ontology" persisting in [[Greek philosophy]]. He claims that Platonism is the "most fully elaborated" version of this primitive ontology.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Dadosky, p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Structure of Religious Knowing: Encountering the Sacred in Eliade and Lonergan'', [[John Daniel Dadosky]] argues that, by making this statement, Eliade was acknowledging "indebtedness to Greek philosophy in general, and to Plato's theory of forms specifically, for his own theory of archetypes and repetition".&lt;ref&gt;Dadosky, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dadosky also states that "one should be cautious when trying to assess Eliade's indebtedness to Plato".&lt;ref&gt;Dadosky, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; Dadosky quotes [[Robert Segal]], a professor of religion, who draws a distinction between Platonism and Eliade's "primitive ontology": for Eliade, the ideal models are patterns that a person or object may or may not imitate; for Plato, there is a Form for everything, and everything imitates a Form by the very fact that it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, in Dadosky, p.105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existentialism and secularism====
Behind the diverse cultural forms of different religions, Eliade proposes a universal: traditional man, he claims, "always believes that there is an absolute reality, ''the sacred'', which transcends this world but manifests itself in this world, thereby sanctifying it and making it real".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.202"&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.202&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, traditional man's behavior gains purpose and meaning through the Sacred: "By imitating divine behavior, man puts and keeps himself close to the gods—that is, in the real and the significant."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eliade, "modern nonreligious man assumes a new existential situation".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.202"/&gt; For traditional man, historical events gain significance by imitating sacred, transcendent events. In contrast, nonreligious man lacks sacred models for how history or human behavior should be, so he must decide on his own how history should proceed—he "regards himself solely as the subject and agent of history, and refuses all appeal to transcendence".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.203"&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.203&lt;/ref&gt; From the standpoint of religious thought, the world has an objective purpose established by mythical events, to which man should conform himself: "Myth teaches [religious man] the primordial 'stories' that have constituted him existentially."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.12; see also Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.20, 145.&lt;/ref&gt; From the standpoint of [[Secularism|secular]] thought, any purpose must be invented and imposed on the world by man. Because of this new "existential situation", Eliade argues, the Sacred becomes the primary obstacle to nonreligious man's "freedom". In viewing himself as the proper maker of history, nonreligious man resists all notions of an externally (for instance, divinely) imposed order or model he must obey: modern man "''makes himself'', and he only makes himself completely in proportion as he desacralizes himself and the world. [...] He will not truly be free until he has killed the last god".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.203"/&gt;

====Religious survivals in the secular world====
Eliade says that secular man cannot escape his bondage to religious thought. By its very nature, secularism depends on religion for its sense of identity: by resisting sacred models, by insisting that man make history on his own, secular man identifies himself only through opposition to religious thought: "He [secular man] recognizes himself in proportion as he 'frees' and 'purifies' himself from the '[[superstition]]s' of his ancestors."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, modern man "still retains a large stock of camouflaged myths and degenerated rituals".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.205&lt;/ref&gt; For example, modern social events still have similarities to traditional initiation rituals, and modern novels feature mythical motifs and themes.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 205; ''Myth and Reality'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, secular man still participates in something like the eternal return: by reading modern literature, "modern man succeeds in obtaining an 'escape from time' comparable to the 'emergence from time' effected by myths".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 205; see also Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade sees traces of religious thought even in secular academia. He thinks modern scientists are motivated by the religious desire to return to the sacred time of origins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One could say that the anxious search for the origins of Life and Mind; the fascination in the 'mysteries of Nature'; the urge to penetrate and decipher the inner structure of Matter—all these longings and drives denote a sort of nostalgia for the primordial, for the original universal ''matrix''. Matter, Substance, represents the ''absolute origin'', the beginning of all things.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Eliade believes the rise of materialism in the 19th century forced the religious nostalgia for "origins" to express itself in science. He mentions his own field of History of Religions as one of the fields that was obsessed with origins during the 19th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The new discipline of History of Religions developed rapidly in this cultural context. And, of course, it followed a like pattern: the [[Positivism|positivistic]] approach to the facts and the search for origins, for the very beginning of religion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;All Western historiography was during that time obsessed with the quest of ''origins''. [...] This search for the origins of human institutions and cultural creations prolongs and completes the naturalist's quest for the origin of species, the biologist's dream of grasping the origin of life, the geologist's and the astronomer's endeavor to understand the origin of the Earth and the Universe. From a psychological point of view, one can decipher here the same nostalgia for the 'primordial' and the 'original'.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some of his writings, Eliade describes modern political ideologies as secularized mythology. According to Eliade, [[Marxism]] "takes up and carries on one of the great [[eschatological]] myths of the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean world, namely: the redemptive part to be played by the Just (the 'elect', the 'anointed', the 'innocent', the 'missioners', in our own days the [[proletariat]]), whose sufferings are invoked to change the ontological status of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'' 1960, pp. 25–26, in Ellwood, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade sees the widespread myth of the [[Golden Age]], "which, according to a number of traditions, lies at the beginning and the end of History", as the "precedent" for [[Karl Marx]]'s vision of a [[classless society]].&lt;ref name="Myths2526, Ell92"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'' 1960, pp. 25–26, in Ellwood, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, he sees Marx's belief in the final triumph of the good (the proletariat) over the evil (the [[bourgeoisie]]) as "a truly messianic Judaeo-Christian ideology".&lt;ref name="Myths2526, Ell92"/&gt; Despite Marx's hostility toward religion, Eliade implies, his ideology works within a conceptual framework inherited from religious mythology.

Likewise, Eliade notes that Nazism involved a [[Nazi occultism|pseudo-pagan mysticism]] based on [[Germanic paganism|ancient Germanic religion]]. He suggests that the differences between the Nazis' pseudo-Germanic mythology and Marx's pseudo-Judaeo-Christian mythology explain their differing success:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In comparison with the vigorous optimism of the communist myth, the mythology propagated by the national socialists seems particularly inept; and this is not only because of the limitations of the racial myth (how could one imagine that the rest of Europe would voluntarily accept submission to the master-race?), but above all because of the fundamental pessimism of the Germanic mythology. [...] For the eschaton prophesied and expected by the ancient Germans was the [[ragnarok]]—that is, a catastrophic end of the world.&lt;ref name="Myths2526, Ell92"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Modern man and the "terror of history"====
According to Eliade, modern man displays "traces" of "mythological behavior" because he intensely needs sacred time and the eternal return.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Despite modern man's claims to be nonreligious, he ultimately cannot find value in the linear progression of historical events; even modern man feels the "terror of history": "Here too [...] there is always the struggle against Time, the hope to be freed from the weight of 'dead Time,' of the Time that crushes and kills."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eliade, this "terror of history" becomes especially acute when violent and threatening historical events confront modern man—the mere fact that a terrible event has happened, that it is part of history, is of little comfort to those who suffer from it. Eliade asks rhetorically how modern man can "tolerate the catastrophes and horrors of history—from collective deportations and massacres to [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]]—if beyond them he can glimpse no sign, no transhistorical meaning".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade indicates that, if repetitions of mythical events provided sacred value and meaning for history in the eyes of ancient man, modern man has denied the Sacred and must therefore invent value and purpose on his own. Without the Sacred to confer an absolute, objective value upon historical events, modern man is left with "a [[Relativism|relativistic]] or [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] view of history" and a resulting "spiritual aridity".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.152&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 4 ("The Terror of History") of ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'' and chapter 9 ("Religious Symbolism and the Modern Man's Anxiety") of ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', Eliade argues at length that the rejection of religious thought is a primary cause of modern man's anxieties.

====Inter-cultural dialogue and a "new humanism"====
Eliade argues that modern man may escape the "Terror of history" by learning from traditional cultures. For example, Eliade thinks [[Hinduism]] has advice for modern Westerners. According to many branches of Hinduism, the world of historical time is illusory, and the only absolute reality is the immortal soul or ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' within man. According to Eliade, Hindus thus escape the terror of history by refusing to see historical time as the true reality.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.240–241&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade notes that a [[Western philosophy|Western]] or [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] philosopher might feel suspicious toward this Hindu view of history:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One can easily guess what a European historical and [[Existentialism|existentialist]] philosopher might reply [...] You ask me, he would say, to 'die to History'; but man is not, and he ''cannot be'' anything else but History, for his very essence is temporality. You are asking me, then, to give up my authentic existence and to take refuge in an abstraction, in pure Being, in the ''atman'': I am to sacrifice my dignity as a creator of History in order to live an a-historic, inauthentic existence, empty of all human content. Well, I prefer to put up with my anxiety: at least, it cannot deprive me of a certain heroic grandeur, that of becoming conscious of, and accepting, the human condition.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p. 241"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Eliade argues that the Hindu approach to history does not necessarily lead to a rejection of history. On the contrary, in Hinduism historical human existence is not the "absurdity" that many Continental philosophers see it as.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p. 241"/&gt; According to Hinduism, history is a divine creation, and one may live contentedly within it as long as one maintains a certain degree of detachment from it: "One is devoured by Time, by History, not because one lives in them, but because one thinks them ''real'' and, in consequence, one forgets or undervalues eternity."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.242&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Eliade argues that Westerners can learn from non-Western cultures to see something besides absurdity in suffering and death. Traditional cultures see suffering and death as a [[rite of passage]]. In fact, their [[initiation]] rituals often involve a symbolic death and resurrection, or symbolic ordeals followed by relief. Thus, Eliade argues, modern man can learn to see his historical ordeals, even death, as necessary initiations into the next stage of one's existence.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.243"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.243&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade even suggests that traditional thought offers relief from the vague [[anxiety]] caused by "our obscure presentiment of the end of the world, or more exactly of the end of ''our'' world, our ''own'' civilization".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.243"/&gt; Many traditional cultures have myths about the end of their world or civilization; however, these myths do not succeed "in paralysing either Life or Culture".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.243"/&gt; These traditional cultures emphasize cyclic time and, therefore, the inevitable rise of a new world or civilization on the ruins of the old. Thus, they feel comforted even in contemplating the end times.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.243–244&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade argues that a Western spiritual rebirth can happen within the framework of Western spiritual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.244&lt;/ref&gt; However, he says, to start this rebirth, Westerners may need to be stimulated by ideas from non-Western cultures. In his ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', Eliade claims that a "genuine encounter" between cultures "might well constitute the point of departure for a new [[humanism]], upon a world scale".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.245&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity and the "salvation" of History====
Mircea Eliade sees the [[Abrahamic religion]]s as a turning point between the ancient, cyclic view of time and the modern, linear view of time, noting that, in their case, sacred events are not limited to a far-off primordial age, but continue throughout history: "time is no longer [only] the circular Time of the [[Eternal Return (Eliade)|Eternal Return]]; it has become linear and irreversible Time".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; He thus sees in Christianity the ultimate example of a religion embracing linear, historical time. When God is born as a man, into the stream of history, "all history becomes a [[theophany]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.153&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, "Christianity strives to ''save'' history".&lt;ref name="Eliade p.170"&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.170&lt;/ref&gt; In Christianity, the Sacred enters a human being (Christ) to save humans, but it also enters history to "save" history and turn otherwise ordinary, historical events into something "capable of transmitting a trans-historical message".&lt;ref name="Eliade p.170"/&gt;

From Eliade's perspective, Christianity's "trans-historical message" may be the most important help that modern man could have in confronting the terror of history. In his book ''Mito'' ("Myth"), [[Italy|Italian]] researcher [[Furio Jesi]] argues that Eliade denies man the position of a true protagonist in history: for Eliade, true human experience lies not in intellectually "making history", but in man's experiences of joy and grief. Thus, from Eliade's perspective, the Christ story becomes the perfect myth for modern man.&lt;ref name="Jesi, p.66-67"&gt;Jesi, p.66–67&lt;/ref&gt; In Christianity, God willingly entered historical time by being born as Christ, and accepted the suffering that followed. By identifying with Christ, modern man can learn to confront painful historical events.&lt;ref name="Jesi, p.66-67"/&gt; Ultimately, according to Jesi, Eliade sees Christianity as the only religion that can save man from the "Terror of history".&lt;ref&gt;Jesi, p.66–70&lt;/ref&gt;

In Eliade's view, traditional man sees time as an endless repetition of mythical archetypes. In contrast, modern man has abandoned mythical archetypes and entered linear, historical time—in this context, unlike many other religions, Christianity attributes value to historical time. Thus, Eliade concludes, "Christianity incontestably proves to be the religion of 'fallen man'", of modern man who has lost "the paradise of archetypes and repetition".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Modern gnosticism", Romanticism and Eliade's nostalgia====
In analyzing the similarities between the "mythologists" Eliade, [[Joseph Campbell]] and Carl Jung, Robert Ellwood concluded that the three modern mythologists, all of whom believed that myths reveal "timeless truth",&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilled the role "[[Gnosticism|gnostics]]" had in [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. The diverse religious movements covered by the term "gnosticism" share the basic doctrines that the surrounding world is fundamentally evil or inhospitable, that we are trapped in the world through no fault of our own, and that we can be saved from the world only through secret knowledge (''[[gnosis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Ellwood claimed that the three mythologists were "modern gnostics through and through",&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; remarking,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether in [[Augustus|Augustan Rome]] or modern Europe, democracy all too easily gave way to [[totalitarianism]], technology was as readily used for battle as for comfort, and immense wealth lay alongside abysmal poverty. [...] Gnostics past and present sought answers not in the course of outward human events, but in knowledge of the world's beginning, of what lies above and beyond the world, and of the secret places of the human soul. To all this the mythologists spoke, and they acquired large and loyal followings.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Ellwood, the mythologists believed in gnosticism's basic doctrines (even if in a secularized form). Ellwood also believes that [[Romanticism]], which stimulated the modern study of mythology,&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.19"&gt;Ellwood, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; strongly influenced the mythologists. Because Romantics stress that emotion and imagination have the same dignity as reason, Ellwood argues, they tend to think political truth "is known less by rational considerations than by its capacity to fire the passions" and, therefore, that political truth is "very apt to be found [...] in the distant past".&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.19"/&gt;

As modern gnostics, Ellwood argues, the three mythologists felt alienated from the surrounding modern world. As scholars, they knew of primordial societies that had operated differently from modern ones. And as people influenced by Romanticism, they saw myths as a saving ''gnosis'' that offered "avenues of eternal return to simpler primordial ages when the values that rule the world were forged".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Ellwood identifies Eliade's personal sense of nostalgia as a source for his interest in, or even his theories about, traditional societies.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.99, 117&lt;/ref&gt; He cites Eliade himself claiming to desire an "eternal return" like that by which traditional man returns to the mythical paradise: "My essential preoccupation is precisely the means of escaping History, of saving myself through symbol, myth, rite, archetypes".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, quoted by [[Virgil Ierunca]], ''The Literary Work of Mircea Eliade'', in Ellwood, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ellwood's view, Eliade's nostalgia was only enhanced by his exile from Romania: "In later years Eliade felt about his own Romanian past as did primal folk about mythic time. He was drawn back to it, yet he knew he could not live there, and that all was not well with it."&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.101"&gt;Ellwood, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that this nostalgia, along with Eliade's sense that "exile is among the profoundest metaphors for all human life",&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; influenced Eliade's theories. Ellwood sees evidence of this in Eliade's concept of the "Terror of history" from which modern man is no longer shielded.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.102&lt;/ref&gt; In this concept, Ellwood sees an "element of nostalgia" for earlier times "when the sacred was strong and the terror of history had barely raised its head".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Eliade's scholarship==

===Overgeneralization===
Eliade cites a wide variety of myths and rituals to support his theories. However, he has been accused of making over-generalizations: many scholars think he lacks sufficient evidence to put forth his ideas as universal, or even general, principles of religious thought. According to one scholar, "Eliade may have been the most popular and influential contemporary historian of religion", but "many, if not most, specialists in anthropology, sociology, and even history of religions have either ignored or quickly dismissed" Eliade's works.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allen, "Eliade and History", in ''Journal of Religion'', 52:2 (1988), p.545&lt;/ref&gt;

The classicist [[Geoffrey Kirk|G. S. Kirk]] criticizes Eliade's insistence that [[Australian Aborigines]] and ancient [[Mesopotamia]]ns had concepts of "being", "non-being", "real", and "becoming", although they lacked words for them. Kirk also believes that Eliade overextends his theories: for example, Eliade claims that the modern myth of the "[[noble savage]]" results from the religious tendency to idealize the primordial, mythical age.&lt;ref name="Kirk, Myth..., footnote, p.255"&gt;Kirk, ''Myth...'', footnote, p.255&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kirk, "such extravagances, together with a marked repetitiousness, have made Eliade unpopular with many anthropologists and sociologists".&lt;ref name="Kirk, Myth..., footnote, p.255"/&gt; In Kirk's view, Eliade derived his theory of [[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]] from the functions of [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]] and then proceeded to apply the theory to other mythologies to which it did not apply. For example, Kirk argues that the eternal return does not accurately describe the functions of [[Native American mythology|Native American]] or [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, ''The Nature of Greek Myths'', p.64–66&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk concludes, "Eliade's idea is a valuable perception about certain myths, not a guide to the proper understanding of all of them".&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, ''The Nature of Greek Myths'', p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

Even [[Wendy Doniger]], Eliade's successor at the University of Chicago, claims (in an introduction to Eliade's own ''Shamanism'') that the eternal return does not apply to all myths and rituals, although it may apply to many of them.&lt;ref name="Doniger Forward p.xiii"/&gt; However, although Doniger agrees that Eliade made over-generalizations, she notes that his willingness to "argue boldly for universals" allowed him to see patterns "that spanned the entire globe and the whole of human history".&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; Whether they were true or not, she argues, Eliade's theories are still useful "as starting points for the comparative study of religion". She also argues that Eliade's theories have been able to accommodate "new data to which Eliade did not have access".&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of empirical support===
Several researchers have criticized Eliade's work as having no [[Empirical method|empirical]] support. Thus, he is said to have "failed to provide an adequate methodology for the history of religions and to establish this discipline as an empirical science",&lt;ref name="ricketts"&gt;Mac Linscott Ricketts, "Review of ''Religion on Trial: Mircea Eliade and His Critics'' by Guilford Dudley III", in ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', Vol. 46, No. 3 (September 1978), p.400–402&lt;/ref&gt; though the same critics admit that "the history of religions should not aim at being an empirical science anyway".&lt;ref name="ricketts"/&gt; Specifically, his claim that the sacred is a structure of human consciousness is distrusted as not being empirically provable: "no one has yet turned up the basic category ''sacred''".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory D. Alles, "Review of ''Changing Religious Worlds: The Meaning and End of Mircea Eliade'' by Brian Rennie", in ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', Vol. 71, p.466–469 (Alles' italics)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there has been mention of his tendency to ignore the social aspects of religion.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; Anthropologist Alice Kehoe is highly critical of Eliade's work on Shamanism, namely because he was not an anthropologist but a historian. She contends that Eliade never did any field work or contacted any indigenous groups that practiced Shamanism, and that his work was synthesized from various sources without being supported by direct field research.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Kehoe, ''Shamans and Religion: An Anthropological Exploration in Critical Thinking'', Waveland Press, London, 2000, ''passim''. {{ISBN|1-57766-162-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Professor Kees W. Bolle of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] argues that "Professor Eliade's approach, in all his works, is empirical":&lt;ref name="bolle"&gt;Kees W. Bolle, ''The Freedom of Man in Myth'', [[Vanderbilt University Press]], Nashville, 1968, p.14. {{ISBN|0-8265-1248-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolle sets Eliade apart for what he sees as Eliade's particularly close "attention to the various particular motifs" of different myths.&lt;ref name="bolle"/&gt; French researcher Daniel Dubuisson places doubt on Eliade's scholarship and its scientific character, citing the Romanian academic's alleged refusal to accept the treatment of religions in their historical and cultural context, and proposing that Eliade's notion of ''[[hierophany]]'' refers to the actual existence of a supernatural level.&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt;

[[Ronald Inden]], a historian of [[India]] and University of Chicago professor, criticized Mircea Eliade, alongside other intellectual figures ([[Carl Jung]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] among them), for encouraging a "romantic view" of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="indenmorny"&gt;Inden, in Morny Joy, "Irigaray's Eastern Expedition", Chapter 4 of Morny Joy, [[Kathleen O'Grady]], Judith L. Poxon, ''Religion in French Feminist Thought: Critical Perspectives'', [[Routledge]], London, 2003, p.63. {{ISBN|0-415-21536-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that their approach to the subject relied mainly on an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] approach, and made Hinduism seem like "a private realm of the imagination and the religious which modern, Western man lacks but needs."&lt;ref name="indenmorny"/&gt;

===Far right and nationalist influences===
Although his scholarly work was never subordinated to his early political beliefs, the school of thought he was associated with in [[interwar]] Romania, namely [[Trăirism]], as well as the works of [[Julius Evola]] he continued to draw inspiration from, have thematic links to fascism.&lt;ref name="pccheie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and academic Marcel Tolcea has argued that, through Evola's particular interpretation of Guénon's works, Eliade kept a traceable connection with [[far right]] ideologies in his academic contributions.&lt;ref name="pccheie"/&gt; Daniel Dubuisson singled out Eliade's concept of ''homo religiosus'' as a reflection of fascist [[elitism]], and argued that the Romanian scholar's views of [[Judaism]] and the [[Old Testament]], which depicted Hebrews as the enemies of an ancient cosmic religion, were ultimately the preservation of an [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] discourse.&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt;

A piece authored in 1930 saw Eliade defining Julius Evola as a great thinker and offering praise to the controversial intellectuals [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arthur de Gobineau]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] and the [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt; Evola, who continued to defend the core principles of mystical fascism, once protested to Eliade about the latter's failure to cite him and Guénon. Eliade replied that his works were written for a contemporary public, and not to initiates of esoteric circles.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Fragments d'un Journal 11, 1970–1978'', [[Éditions Gallimard]], Paris, 1981, p.194&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1960s, he, together with Evola, [[Louis Rougier]], and other intellectuals, offered support to [[Alain de Benoist]]'s controversial ''[[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne]]'', part of the ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' intellectual trend.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p.173; Douglas R. Holmes, ''Integral Europe: Fast-Capitalism, Multiculturalism, Neofascism'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, 2000, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, Eliade was also preoccupied with the cult of [[Zalmoxis]] and its supposed [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="boia"&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''Istorie şi mit în conştiinţa românească'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1997 (tr. ''History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness'', [[Central European University Press]], Budapest, 2001), p.152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "Zalmoxis, The Vanishing God", in ''[[Slavic Review]]'', Vol. 33, No. 4 (December 1974), p.807–809&lt;/ref&gt; This, like his conclusion that [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] had been superficial inside [[Roman Dacia]], was a view celebrated by contemporary partisans of [[Protochronism|Protochronist]] nationalism.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boia"/&gt; According to historian [[Sorin Antohi]], Eliade may have actually encouraged Protochronists such as [[Edgar Papu]] to carry out research which resulted in the claim that medieval Romanians had anticipated the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Antohi, preface to Liiceanu, p.xx&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of Eliade, Jung, and Campbell, Ellwood also discusses the connection between academic theories and controversial political involvements, noting that all three mythologists have been accused of [[reactionary]] political positions. Ellwood notes the obvious parallel between the [[conservatism]] of myth, which speaks of a primordial golden age, and the conservatism of far right politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.xiii–xiv&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ellwood argues that the explanation is more complex than that. Wherever their political sympathies may have sometimes been, he claims, the three mythologists were often "apolitical if not antipolitical, scorning any this-worldly salvation".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the connection between mythology and politics differs for each of the mythologists in question: in Eliade's case, Ellwood believes, a strong sense of nostalgia ("for childhood, for historical times past, for cosmic religion, for paradise"),&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.99"/&gt; influenced not only the scholar's academic interests, but also his political views.

Because Eliade stayed out of politics during his later life, Ellwood tries to extract an implicit political philosophy from Eliade's scholarly works. Ellwood argues that the later Eliade's nostalgia for ancient traditions did not make him a political reactionary, even a quiet one. He concludes that the later Eliade was, in fact, a "radical [[Modernism|modernist]]".&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.119"&gt;Ellwood, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellwood,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who see Eliade's fascination with the primordial as merely reactionary in the ordinary political or religious sense of the word do not understand the mature Eliade in a sufficiently radical way. [...] Tradition was not for him exactly [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] 'prescription' or sacred trust to be kept alive generation after generation, for Eliade was fully aware that tradition, like men and nations, lives only by changing and even occultation. The tack is not to try fruitlessly to keep it unchanging, but to discover where it is hiding.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.119"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Eliade, religious elements survive in secular culture, but in new, "camouflaged" forms.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.118&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Ellwood believes that the later Eliade probably thought modern man should preserve elements of the past, but should not try to restore their original form through reactionary politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.119–20&lt;/ref&gt; He suspects that Eliade would have favored "a minimal rather than a maximalist state" that would allow personal spiritual transformation without enforcing it.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.120"&gt;Ellwood, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars have accused Eliade of "[[essentialism]]", a type of over-generalization in which one incorrectly attributes a common "essence" to a whole group—in this case, all "religious" or "traditional" societies. Furthermore, some see a connection between Eliade's essentialism with regard to religion and fascist essentialism with regard to races and nations.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.111"&gt;Ellwood, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; To Ellwood, this connection "seems rather tortured, in the end amounting to little more than an ''ad hominem'' argument which attempts to tar Eliade's entire [scholarly] work with the ill-repute all decent people feel for [[Sturmabteilung|storm troopers]] and the Iron Guard".&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.111"/&gt; However, Ellwood admits that common tendencies in "mythological thinking" may have caused Eliade, as well as Jung and Campbell, to view certain groups in an "essentialist" way, and that this may explain their purported antisemitism: "A tendency to think in generic terms of peoples, races, religions, or parties, which as we shall see is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking, including that of such modern mythologists as our three, can connect with nascent anti-Semitism, or the connection can be the other way."&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.x&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==

===Generic traits===
Many of Mircea Eliade's literary works, in particular his earliest ones, are noted for their [[eroticism]] and their focus on subjective experience. Modernist in style, they have drawn comparisons to the contemporary writings of [[Mihail Sebastian]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.963&lt;/ref&gt; [[I. Valerian]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.843&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ion Biberi]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.967&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Giovanni Papini]], his literary passions included [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Miguel de Unamuno]],&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; as well as [[André Gide]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Eliade also read with interest the prose of [[Romain Rolland]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers [[Voltaire]] and [[Denis Diderot]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; As a youth, he read the works of Romanian authors such as [[Liviu Rebreanu]] and [[Panait Istrati]]; initially, he was also interested in [[Ionel Teodoreanu]]'s prose works, but later rejected them and criticized their author.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

Investigating the works' main characteristics, [[George Călinescu]] stressed that Eliade owed much of his style to the direct influence of French author André Gide, concluding that, alongside [[Camil Petrescu]] and a few others, Eliade was among Gide's leading disciples in [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]].&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"/&gt; He commented that, like Gide, Eliade believed that the artist "does not take a stand, but experiences good and evil while setting himself free from both, maintaining an intact curiosity."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"/&gt; A specific aspect of this focus on experience is sexual experimentation—Călinescu notes that Eliade's fiction works tend to depict a male figure "possessing all practicable women in [a given] family".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"&gt;Călinescu, p.959&lt;/ref&gt; He also considered that, as a rule, Eliade depicts woman as "a basic means for a sexual experience and repudiated with harsh [[egotism]]."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt;

For Călinescu, such a perspective on life culminated in "banality", leaving authors gripped by the "cult of the self" and "a contempt for literature".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"/&gt; Polemically, Călinescu proposed that Mircea Eliade's supposed focus on "aggressive youth" served to instill his [[Interwar period|interwar]] Romanian writers with the idea that they had a common destiny as a generation apart.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"/&gt; He also commented that, when set in Romania, Mircea Eliade's stories lacked the "perception of immediate reality", and, analyzing the non-traditional names the writer tended to ascribe to his Romanian characters, that they did not depict "specificity".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"&gt;Călinescu, p.958&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in Călinescu's view, Eliade's stories were often "[[Sensationalism|sensationalist]] compositions of the illustrated magazine kind."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.960"&gt;Călinescu, p.960&lt;/ref&gt; Mircea Eliade's assessment of his own pre-1940 literary contributions oscillated between expressions of pride&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; and the bitter verdict that they were written for "an audience of little ladies and high school students".&lt;ref name="cavrcitim"/&gt;

A secondary but unifying feature present in most of Eliade's stories is their setting, a magical and part-fictional [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; In part, they also serve to illustrate or allude to Eliade's own research in the field of religion, as well as to the concepts he introduced.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Thus, commentators such as [[Matei Călinescu]] and [[Carmen Mușat]] have also argued that a main characteristic of Eliade's [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] prose is a substitution between the [[supernatural]] and the mundane: in this interpretation, Eliade turns the daily world into an incomprehensible place, while the intrusive supernatural aspect promises to offer the sense of life.&lt;ref name="musatalcatuire"&gt;[[Carmen Muşat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=4693&amp;print=true "Despre fantastica alcătuire a realului" ("On the Fantastic Shape of Reality")], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 131, August–September 2002; retrieved January 17, 2008{{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion was in turn linked to Eliade's own thoughts on [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], and in particular his idea that, once "camouflaged" in life or history, [[miracle]]s become "unrecognizable".&lt;ref name="musatalcatuire"/&gt;

===Oriental themed novels===
One of Eliade's earliest fiction writings, the controversial [[first-person narrative]] ''Isabel şi apele diavolului'', focused on the figure of a young and brilliant academic, whose self-declared fear is that of "being common".&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.956"&gt;Eliade, in Călinescu, p.956&lt;/ref&gt; The hero's experience is recorded in "notebooks", which are compiled to form the actual narrative, and which serve to record his unusual, mostly sexual, experiences in [[British India]]—the narrator describes himself as dominated by "a devilish indifference" towards "all things having to do with art or [[metaphysics]]", focusing instead on eroticism.&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.956"/&gt; The guest of a [[pastor]], the scholar ponders sexual adventures with his host's wife, servant girl, and finally with his daughter Isabel. Persuading the pastor's adolescent son to run away from home, becoming the sexual initiator of a twelve-year-old girl and the lover of a much older woman, the character also attempts to seduce Isabel. Although she falls in love, the young woman does not give in to his pressures, but eventually allows herself to be abused and impregnated by another character, letting the object of her affection know that she had thought of him all along.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.957"&gt;Călinescu, p.957&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Eliade's best-known works, the novel ''[[Bengal Nights (novel)|Maitreyi]]'', dwells on Eliade's own experience, comprising camouflaged details of his relationships with [[Surendranath Dasgupta]] and Dasgupta's daughter [[Maitreyi Devi]]. The main character, Allan, is an [[England|Englishman]] who visits the Indian engineer Narendra Sen and courts his daughter, herself known as Maitreyi. The narrative is again built on "notebooks" to which Allan adds his comments. This technique Călinescu describes as "boring", and its result "cynical".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.957"/&gt;

Allan himself stands alongside Eliade's male characters, whose focus is on action, sensation and experience—his chaste contacts with Maitreyi are encouraged by Sen, who hopes for a marriage which is nonetheless abhorred by his would-be European son-in-law.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.957"/&gt; Instead, Allan is fascinated to discover Maitreyi's Oriental version of [[Platonic love]], marked by spiritual attachment more than by physical contact.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.957–958&lt;/ref&gt; However, their affair soon after turns physical, and she decides to attach herself to Allan as one would to a husband, in what is an informal and intimate wedding ceremony (which sees her vowing her love and invoking an [[Chthonic|earth goddess]] as the seal of union).&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; Upon discovering this, Narendra Sen becomes enraged, rejecting their guest and keeping Maitreyi in confinement. As a result, his daughter decides to have intercourse with a lowly stranger, becoming pregnant in the hope that her parents would consequently allow her to marry her lover. However, the story also casts doubt on her earlier actions, reflecting rumors that Maitreyi was not a virgin at the time she and Allan first met, which also seems to expose her father as a hypocrite.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt;

George Călinescu objected to the narrative, arguing that both the physical affair and the father's rage seemed artificial, while commenting that Eliade placing doubt on his Indian characters' honesty had turned the plot into a piece of "[[Ethnology|ethnological]] humor".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; Noting that the work developed on a classical theme of [[miscegenation]], which recalled the prose of [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] and [[Pierre Loti]],&lt;ref name="Căl. p.957"/&gt; the critic proposed that its main merit was in introducing the [[Exoticism|exotic novel]] to local literature.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt;

Mircea Eliade's other early works include ''Șantier'' ("Building Site"), a part-novel, part-diary account of his Indian sojourn. George Călinescu objected to its "monotony", and, noting that it featured a set of "intelligent observations", criticized the "banality of its ideological conversations."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; ''Șantier'' was also noted for its portrayal of [[drug addiction]] and intoxication with [[opium]], both of which could have referred to Eliade's actual travel experience.&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt;

===Portraits of a generation===
In his earliest novel, titled ''[[Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent]]'' and written in the first person, Eliade depicts his experience through high school.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; It is proof of the influence exercised on him by the literature of [[Giovanni Papini]], and in particular by Papini's story ''[[Un uomo finito]]''.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Each of its chapters reads like an independent [[novella]], and, in all, the work experiments with the limits traced between novel and diary.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Literary critic [[Eugen Simion]] called it "the most valuable" among Eliade's earliest literary attempts, but noted that, being "ambitious", the book had failed to achieve "an aesthetically satisfactory format".&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; According to Simion, the innovative intent of the ''Novel...'' was provided by its technique, by its goal of providing authenticity in depicting experiences, and by its insight into [[adolescent psychology]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; The novel notably shows its narrator practicing self-[[flagellation]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

Eliade's 1934 novel ''Întoarcerea din rai'' ("Return from Paradise") centers on Pavel Anicet, a young man who seeks knowledge through what Călinescu defined as "sexual excess".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; His search leaves him with a reduced sensitivity: right after being confronted with his father's death, Anicet breaks out in tears only after sitting through an entire dinner.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; The other characters, standing for Eliade's generation, all seek knowledge through violence or retreat from the world—nonetheless, unlike Anicet, they ultimately fail at imposing rigors upon themselves.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; Pavel himself eventually abandons his belief in sex as a means for enlightenment, and commits suicide in hopes of reaching the level of primordial unity. The solution, George Călinescu noted, mirrored the strange murder in Gide's ''[[Lafcadio's Adventures]]''.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; Eliade himself indicated that the book dealt with the "loss of the beatitude, illusions, and optimism that had dominated the first twenty years of '[[Greater Romania]]'."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Ellwood, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Ellwood connected the work to Eliade's recurring sense of loss in respect to the "atmosphere of euphoria and faith" of his adolescence.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.101"/&gt; Călinescu criticizes ''Întoarcerea din rai'', describing its dialog sequences as "awkward", its narrative as "void", and its artistic interest as "non-existent", proposing that the reader could however find it relevant as the "document of a mentality".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt;

The lengthy novel ''Huliganii'' ("The Hooligans") is intended as the fresco of a family, and, through it, that of an entire generation. The book's main protagonist, Petru Anicet, is a composer who places value in experiments; other characters include Dragu, who considers "a hooligan's experience" as "the only fertile debut into life", and the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] Alexandru Pleşa, who is on the search for "the heroic life" by enlisting youth in "perfect regiments, equally intoxicated by a collective myth."&lt;ref name="admestmeanea"&gt;[[Gabriela Adameşteanu]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Cum-suporta-individul-socurile-Istoriei.-Dialog-cu-Norman-MANEA*articleID_14662-articles_details.html "Cum suportă individul şocurile Istoriei. Dialog cu Norman Manea" ("How the Individual Bears the Shocks of History. A Dialog with Norman Manea")], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 304, January 2006; retrieved January 16, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Călinescu, p.958–959&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu thought that the young male characters all owed inspiration to [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s [[Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov]] (''see [[Crime and Punishment]]'').&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; Anicet, who partly shares Pleșa's vision for a collective experiment, is also prone to sexual adventures, and seduces the women of the Lecca family (who have hired him as a piano teacher).&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; Romanian-born novelist [[Norman Manea]] called Anicet's experiment: "the paraded defiance of [[bourgeois]] conventions, in which venereal disease and lubricity dwell together."&lt;ref name="admestmeanea"/&gt; In one episode of the book, Anicet convinces Anișoara Lecca to gratuitously steal from her parents—an outrage which leads her mother to moral decay and, eventually, to suicide.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; George Călinescu criticized the book for inconsistencies and "excesses in Dostoyevskianism", but noted that the Lecca family portrayal was "suggestive", and that the dramatic scenes were written with "a remarkable poetic calm."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt;

The novel ''[[Marriage in Heaven]]'' depicts the correspondence between two male friends, an artist and a common man, who complain to each other about their failures in love: the former complains about a lover who wanted his children when he did not, while the other recalls being abandoned by a woman who, despite his intentions, did not want to become pregnant by him. Eliade lets the reader understand that they are in fact talking about the same woman.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.960"/&gt;

===Fantastic and fantasy literature===
Mircea Eliade's earliest works, most of which were published at later stages, belong to the [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre. One of the first such literary exercises to be printed, the 1921 ''Cum am găsit piatra filosofală'', showed its adolescent author's interest in themes that he was to explore throughout his career, in particular [[esotericism]] and [[alchemy]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Written in the first person, it depicts an experiment which, for a moment, seems to be the discovery of the [[philosophers' stone]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; These early writings also include two sketches for novels: ''Minunata călătorie a celor cinci cărăbuși in țara furnicilor roșii'' ("The Wonderful Journey of the Five Beetles into the Land of the Red Ants") and ''Memoriile unui soldat de plumb'' ("The Memoirs of a Lead Soldier").&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; In the former, a company of beetle spies is sent among the red ants—their travel offers a setting for [[Satire|satirical]] commentary.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Eliade himself explained that ''Memoriile unui soldat de plumb'' was an ambitious project, designed as a fresco to include the birth of the Universe, [[abiogenesis]], [[human evolution]], and the entire world history.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

Eliade's fantasy novel ''[[Domnișoara Christina]]'', was, on its own, the topic of a scandal.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; The novel deals with the fate of an eccentric family, the Moscus, who are haunted by the ghost of a murdered young woman, known as Christina. The apparition shares characteristics with [[vampire]]s and with ''[[strigoi]]'': she is believed to be drinking the blood of cattle and that of a young family member.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; The young man Egor becomes the object of Christina's desire, and is shown to have intercourse with her.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; Noting that the plot and setting reminded one of [[horror fiction]] works by the German author [[Hanns Heinz Ewers]], and defending ''Domnişoara Christina'' in front of harsher criticism, Călinescu nonetheless argued that the "international environment" in which it took place was "upsetting".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; He also depicted the plot as focused on "major impurity", summarizing the story's references to [[necrophilia]], [[menstruation|menstrual]] [[sexual fetishism|fetish]] and [[ephebophilia]].&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt;

Eliade's short story ''Șarpele'' ("The Snake") was described by George Călinescu as "[[Hermeticism|hermetic]]".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; While on a trip to the forest, several persons witness a feat of magic performed by the male character Andronic, who summons a snake from the bottom of a river and places it on an island. At the end of the story, Andronic and the female character Dorina are found on the island, naked and locked in a sensual embrace.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; Călinescu saw the piece as an allusion to [[Gnosticism]], to the [[Kabbalah]], and to [[Babylonian mythology]], while linking the snake to the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure and major [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent symbol]] [[Ophion]].&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; He was however dissatisfied with this introduction of iconic images, describing it as "languishing".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.960"/&gt;

The short story ''Un om mare'' ("A Big Man"), which Eliade authored during his stay in Portugal, shows a common person, the engineer Cucoanes, who grows steadily and uncontrollably, reaching immense proportions and ultimately disappearing into the wilderness of the [[Bucegi Mountains]].&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"&gt;[[Mircea Iorgulescu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=99&amp;nr=2002-05-20 "''L'Affaire'', după Matei" (''L'Affaire'', according to Matei"), Part II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010509/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=99&amp;nr=2002-05-20 |date=2007-09-27 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr. 636, May 2002; retrieved January 17, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade himself referenced the story and [[Aldous Huxley]]'s experiments in the same section of his private notes, a matter which allowed [[Matei Călinescu]] to propose that ''Un om mare'' was a direct product of its author's experience with drugs.&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; The same commentator, who deemed ''Un om mare'' "perhaps Eliade's most memorable short story", connected it with the ''[[uriaș]]i'' characters present in [[Romanian folklore]].&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"/&gt;

===Other writings===
Eliade reinterpreted the Greek mythological figure [[Iphigeneia]] in his eponymous 1941 play. Here, the maiden falls in love with [[Achilles]], and accepts to be sacrificed on the [[pyre]] as a means to ensure both her lover's happiness (as predicted by an [[oracle]]) and her father [[Agamemnon]]'s victory in the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name="raifigenia"&gt;[[Radu Albala]], "Teatrul Naţional din Bucureşti.

In addition to his fiction, the exiled Eliade authored several volumes of memoirs and diaries and travel writings. They were published sporadically, and covered various stages of his life. One of the earliest such pieces was ''India'', grouping accounts of the travels he made through the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="jgspania"/&gt; Writing for the [[Spain|Spanish]] journal ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', commentator [[Sergio Vila-Sanjuán]] described the first volume of Eliade's ''Autobiography'' (covering the years 1907 to 1937) as "a great book", while noting that the other main volume was "more conventional and insincere."&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; In Vila-Sanjuán's view, the texts reveal Mircea Eliade himself as "a Dostoyevskyian character", as well as "an accomplished person, a [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethian]] figure".&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

A work that drew particular interest was his ''Jurnal portughez'' ("Portuguese Diary"), completed during his stay in [[Lisbon]] and published only after its author's death. A portion of it dealing with his stay in Romania is believed to have been lost.&lt;ref name="scnostal"/&gt; The travels to Spain, partly recorded in ''Jurnal portughez'', also led to a separate volume, ''Jurnal cordobez'' ("Cordoban Diary"), which Eliade compiled from various independent notebooks.&lt;ref name="jgspania"/&gt;  ''Jurnal portughez'' shows Eliade coping with [[clinical depression]] and political crisis, and has been described by [[Andrei Oișteanu]] as "an overwhelming [read], through the immense suffering it exhales."&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; Literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] argued that part of the volume is "a masterpiece of its time", while concluding that some 700 pages were passable for the "among others" section of [[Bibliography of Mircea Eliade|Eliade's bibliography]].&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; Noting that the book featured parts where Eliade spoke of himself in eulogistic terms, notably comparing himself favorably to Goethe and Romania's national poet [[Mihai Eminescu]], Cernat accused the writer of "egolatry", and deduced that Eliade was "ready to step over dead bodies for the sake of his spiritual 'mission' ".&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; The same passages led philosopher and journalist [[Cătălin Avramescu]] to argue that Eliade's behavior was evidence of "[[megalomania]]".&lt;ref name="cavrcitim"/&gt;

Eliade also wrote various essays of literary criticism. In his youth, alongside his study on [[Julius Evola]], he published essays which introduced the Romanian public to representatives of modern [[Spanish literature]] and philosophy, among them [[Adolfo Bonilla San Martín]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Eugeni d'Ors]], [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]] and [[Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo]].&lt;ref name="jgspania"/&gt; He also wrote an essay on the works of [[James Joyce]], connecting it with his own theories on the [[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]] ("[Joyce's literature is] saturated with nostalgia for the myth of the eternal repetition"), and deeming Joyce himself an anti-[[Historicism|historicist]] "archaic" figure among the modernists.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Robert Spoo, ''James Joyce and the Language of History: Dedalus's Nightmare'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York, Oxford, 1994, p.158. {{ISBN|0-19-508749-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, Eliade edited the collected works of Romanian historian [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

M. L. Ricketts discovered and translated into English a previously unpublished play written by Mircea Eliade in Paris 1946 ''Aventura Spirituală'' (''A Spiritual Adventure''). It was published by for the first time in ''[[Theory in Action]]'' -the journal of the [[Transformative Studies Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transformativestudies.org/publications/theory-in-action-the-journal-of-tsi/past-issues/volume-5-number-1-january-2012/ Transformative Studies Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; vol. 5 (2012): 2–58.

==Controversy: antisemitism and links with the Iron Guard==

===Early statements===
The early years in Eliade's public career show him to have been highly tolerant of [[Jew]]s in general, and of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish minority in Romania]] in particular. His early condemnation of [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] policies was accompanied by his caution and moderation in regard to [[Nae Ionescu]]'s various anti-Jewish attacks.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.408–409, 412&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the 1930s, Mihail Sebastian was marginalized by Romania's antisemitic policies, and came to reflect on his Romanian friend's association with the far right. The subsequent ideological break between him and Eliade has been compared by writer [[Gabriela Adameşteanu]] with that between [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]].&lt;ref name="admestmeanea"/&gt; In his ''Journal'', published long after his 1945 death, Sebastian claimed that Eliade's actions during the 1930s show him to be an antisemite. According to Sebastian, Eliade had been friendly to him until the start of his political commitments, after which he severed all ties.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Before their friendship came apart, however, Sebastian claimed that he took notes on their conversations (which he later published) during which Eliade was supposed to have expressed antisemitic views. According to Sebastian, Eliade said in 1939:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Poles' resistance]] in [[Warsaw]] is a Jewish resistance. Only yids are capable of the blackmail of putting women and children in the front line, to take advantage of the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]]' sense of scruple. The Germans have no interest in the destruction of Romania. Only a pro-German government can save us... What is [[Bukovina#Preceding events and Second World War|happening on the frontier with Bukovina]] is a scandal, because new waves of Jews are flooding into the country. Rather than a Romania again invaded by kikes, it would be better to have a German protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The friendship between Eliade and Sebastian drastically declined during the war: the latter writer, fearing for his security during the pro-Nazi [[Ion Antonescu]] regime (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''), hoped that Eliade, by then a diplomat, could intervene in his favor; however, upon his brief return to Romania, Eliade did not see or approach Sebastian.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

Later, Mircea Eliade expressed his regret at not having had the chance to redeem his friendship with Sebastian before the latter was killed in a car accident.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in Handoca"/&gt; [[Paul Cernat]] notes that Eliade's statement includes an admission that he "counted on [Sebastian's] support, in order to get back into Romanian life and culture", and proposes that Eliade may have expected his friend to vouch for him in front of hostile authorities.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; Some of Sebastian's late recordings in his diary show that their author was reflecting with nostalgia on his relationship with Eliade, and that he deplored the outcome.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

Eliade provided two distinct explanations for not having met with Sebastian: one was related to his claim of being followed around by the [[Gestapo]], and the other, expressed in his diaries, was that the shame of representing a regime that humiliated Jews had made him avoid facing his former friend.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; Another take on the matter was advanced in 1972 by the [[Israel]]i magazine ''Toladot'', who claimed that, as an official representative, Eliade was aware of Antonescu's agreement to implement the [[Final Solution]] in Romania and of how this could affect Sebastian (''see [[Holocaust in Romania]]'').&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; In addition, rumors were sparked that Sebastian and Nina Mareş had a physical relationship, one which could have contributed to the clash between the two literary figures.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

Beyond his involvement with a movement known for its antisemitism, Eliade did not usually comment on Jewish issues. However, an article titled ''Piloţii orbi'' ("The Blind Pilots"), contributed to the journal ''Vremea'' in 1936, showed that he supported at least some Iron Guard accusations against the Jewish community:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the war [that is, [[World War I]]], Jews have occupied the villages of [[Maramureş historical region|Maramureş]] and [[Bukovina]], and gained the absolute majority in the towns and cities in [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;It was popular prejudice in the late 1930s to claim that [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian Jews]] in the [[Soviet Union]] had obtained Romanian citizenship illegally after crossing the border into [[Maramureş historical region|Maramureş]] and Bukovina. In 1938, this accusation served as an excuse for the [[Octavian Goga]]-[[A. C. Cuza]] government to suspend and review all Jewish citizenship guaranteed after 1923, rendering it very difficult to regain (Ornea, p.391). Eliade's mention of Bessarabia probably refers to an earlier period, being his interpretation of a pre-[[Greater Romania]] process.&lt;/ref&gt; [...] It would be absurd to expect Jews to resign themselves in order to become a minority with certain rights and very many duties—after they have tasted the honey of power and conquered as many command positions as they have. Jews are currently fighting with all forces to maintain their positions, expecting a future offensive—and, as far as I am concerned, I understand their fight and admire their vitality, tenacity, genius.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1936, in Ornea, p.412–413; partially in the ''Final Report'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One year later, a text, accompanied by his picture, was featured as answer to an inquiry by the Iron Guard's ''[[Buna Vestire]]'' about the reasons he had for supporting the movement. A short section of it summarizes an anti-Jewish attitude:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Can the Romanian nation end its life in the saddest decay witnessed by history, undermined by misery and [[syphilis]], conquered by Jews and torn to pieces by foreigners, demoralized, betrayed, sold for a few million [[Romanian leu|lei]]?&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.413; in the ''Final Report'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the literary critic [[Z. Ornea]], in the 1980s Eliade denied authorship of the text. He explained the use of his signature, his picture, and the picture's caption, as having been applied by the magazine's editor, [[Mihail Polihroniade]], to a piece the latter had written after having failed to obtain Eliade's contribution; he also claimed that, given his respect for Polihroniade, he had not wished to publicize this matter previously.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.206; Ornea is skeptical of these explanations, given the long period of time spent before Eliade gave them, and especially the fact that the article itself, despite the haste in which it must have been written, has remarkably detailed references to many articles written by Eliade in various papers over a period of time.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polemics and exile===
Dumitru G. Danielopol, a fellow diplomat present in [[London]] during Eliade's stay in the city, later stated that the latter had identified himself as "a guiding light of [the Iron Guard] movement" and victim of [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]'s repression.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; In October 1940, as the [[National Legionary State]] came into existence, the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]] [[blacklist]]ed Mircea Eliade, alongside five other  Romanians, due to his Iron Guard connections and suspicions that he was prepared to spy in favor of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="zfscriit"/&gt; According to various sources, while in [[Portugal]], the diplomat was also preparing to disseminate [[propaganda]] in favor of the Iron Guard.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; In ''Jurnal portughez'', Eliade defines himself as "a Legionary",&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; and speaks of his own "Legionary climax" as a stage he had gone through during the early 1940s.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

The depolitisation of Eliade after the start of his diplomatic career was also mistrusted by his former close friend [[Eugène Ionesco]], who indicated that, upon the close of [[World War II]], Eliade's personal beliefs as communicated to his friends amounted to "all is over now that Communism has won".&lt;ref&gt;Ionesco, 1945, in Ornea, p.184&lt;/ref&gt; This forms part of Ionesco's severe and succinct review of the careers of Legionary-inspired intellectuals, many of them his friends and former friends, in a letter he sent to [[Tudor Vianu]].&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.184–185&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Ionesco indicated to [[Petru Comarnescu]] that he did not want to see either Eliade or Cioran, and that he considered the two of them "Legionaries for ever"—adding "we are [[hyena]]s to one another".&lt;ref&gt;Ionesco, 1946, in Ornea, p.211&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade's former friend, the communist [[Belu Zilber]], who was attending the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Conference]] in 1946, refused to see Eliade, arguing that, as an Iron Guard affiliate, the latter had "denounced left-wingers", and contrasting him with Cioran ("They are both Legionaries, but [Cioran] is honest").&lt;ref&gt;[[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=575&amp;nr=2003-08-25 "Belu Zilber" (III)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011339/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2003-08-25&amp;art=575 |date=2007-09-27 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr.702, August 2003; retrieved October 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Eliade's political activities were brought into discussion as he was getting ready to publish a translation of his ''Techniques du Yoga'' with the left-leaning [[Italy|Italian]] company ''[[Giulio Einaudi Editore]]''—the denunciation was probably orchestrated by Romanian officials.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.210"&gt;Ornea, p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1954, when [[Horia Sima]], who led the Iron Guard during its exile, was rejected by a faction inside the movement, Mircea Eliade's name was included on a list of persons who supported the latter—although this may have happened without his consent.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.210"/&gt; According to exiled [[dissident]] and novelist [[Dumitru Ţepeneag]], around that date, Eliade expressed his sympathy for Iron Guard members in general, whom he viewed as "courageous".&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Coroiu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090115020500/http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/un-roman-la-paris-0.html "Un român la Paris"], in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', August 31, 2006; retrieved October 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Robert Ellwood, the Eliade he met in the 1960s was entirely apolitical, remained aloof from "the passionate politics of that era in the United States", and "[r]eportedly [...] never read newspapers"&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.83"&gt;Ellwood, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; (an assessment shared by [[Sorin Alexandrescu]]).&lt;ref name="scnostal"/&gt; Eliade's student [[Ioan Petru Culianu]] noted that journalists had come to refer to the Romanian scholar as "the great recluse".&lt;ref name="ipcmahapar"/&gt; Despite Eliade's withdrawal from radical politics, Ellwood indicates, he still remained concerned with Romania's welfare. He saw himself and other exiled Romanian intellectuals as members of a circle who worked to "maintain the culture of a free Romania and, above all, to publish texts that had become unpublishable in Romania itself".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Ordeal by Labyrinth'', in Ellwood, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1969, Eliade's past became the subject of public debate in [[Israel]]. At the time, historian [[Gershom Scholem]] asked Eliade to explain his attitudes, which the latter did using vague terms.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oişteanu, Angajamentul..."&gt;Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this exchange, Scholem declared his dissatisfaction, and argued that Israel could not extend a welcome to the Romanian academic.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; During the final years of Eliade's life, his disciple Culianu exposed and publicly criticized his 1930s pro-Iron Guard activities; relations between the two soured as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sorin Antohi]], [http://www.iwm.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=306&amp;Itemid=478 "Exploring the Legacy of Ioan Petru Culianu"], in the [http://www.iwm.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=109&amp;Itemid=231 ''Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen Post''], Newsletter 72, Spring 2001; retrieved July 16, 2007; Ted Anton, [http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9209/culianu.html "The Killing of Professor Culianu"], in ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', Volume 2, No. 6, September/October 1992; retrieved July 29, 2007; Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade's other Romanian disciple, [[Andrei Oişteanu]], noted that, in the years following Eliade's death, conversations with various people who had known the scholar had made Culianu less certain of his earlier stances, and had led him to declare: "Mr. Eliade was never antisemitic, a member of the Iron Guard, or pro-Nazi. But, in any case, I am led to believe that he was closer to the Iron Guard than I would have liked to believe."&lt;ref&gt;Culianu, in Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt;

At an early stage of his polemic with Culianu, Eliade complained in writing that "it is not possible to write an objective history" of the Iron Guard and its leader [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]].&lt;ref name="Eliade, in Ellwood, p.91"/&gt; Arguing that people "would only accept apologetics [...] or executions", he contended: "After [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], even honest people cannot afford being objective".&lt;ref name="Eliade, in Ellwood, p.91"&gt;Eliade, in Ellwood, p.91; in Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posterity===
Alongside the arguments introduced by Daniel Dubuisson, criticism of Mircea Eliade's political involvement with antisemitism and fascism came from Adriana Berger, [[Leon Volovici]], Alexandra Lagniel-Lavastine, Florin Țurcanu and others, who have attempted to trace Eliade's antisemitism throughout his work and through his associations with contemporary antisemites, such as the Italian fascist [[occultist]] [[Julius Evola]]. Volovici, for example, is critical of Eliade not only because of his support for the Iron Guard, but also for spreading antisemitism and [[anti-Masonry]] in 1930s Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Volovici, ''Nationalist Ideology and Antisemitism: The Case of Romanian Intellectuals in the 1930s'', [[Pergamon Press]], Oxford, 1991, p.104–105, 110–111, 120–126, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, exiled novelist [[Norman Manea]] published an essay firmly condemning Eliade's attachment to the Iron Guard.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

Other scholars, like [[Bryan S. Rennie]], have claimed that there is, to date, no evidence of Eliade's membership, active services rendered, or of any real involvement with any fascist or totalitarian movements or membership organizations, nor that there is any evidence of his continued support for nationalist ideals after their inherently violent nature was revealed. They further assert that there is no imprint of overt political beliefs in Eliade's scholarship, and also claim that Eliade's critics are following political agendas.&lt;ref name="rossfriesian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan S. Rennie]], ''Reconstructing Eliade: Making Sense of Religion'', [[State University of New York Press]], Albany, 1996, p.149–177. {{ISBN|0-7914-2763-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanian scholar Mircea Handoca, editor of Eliade's writings, argues that the controversy surrounding Eliade was encouraged by a group of exiled writers, of whom Manea was a main representative, and believes that Eliade's association with the Guard was a conjectural one, determined by the young author's Christian values and [[Conservatism|conservative]] stance, as well as by his belief that a Legionary Romania could mirror Portugal's ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]''.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Handoca opined that Eliade changed his stance after discovering that the Legionaries had turned violent, and argued that there was no evidence of Eliade's actual affiliation with the Iron Guard as a political movement.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Additionally, Joaquín Garrigós, who translated Eliade's works into [[Spanish language|Spanish]], claimed that none of Eliade's texts he ever encountered show him to be an antisemite.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Mircea Eliade's nephew and commentator [[Sorin Alexandrescu]] himself proposed that Eliade's politics were essentially conservative and [[Patriotism|patriotic]], in part motivated by a fear of the [[Soviet Union]] which he shared with many other young intellectuals.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Based on Mircea Eliade's admiration for [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]], various other authors assess that Eliade remained committed to [[nonviolence]].&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

Robert Ellwood also places Eliade's involvement with the Iron Guard in relation to scholar's conservatism, and connects this aspect of Eliade's life with both his nostalgia and his study of primal societies. According to Ellwood, the part of Eliade that felt attracted to the "freedom of new beginnings suggested by primal myths" is the same part that felt attracted to the Guard, with its almost mythological notion of a new beginning through a "national resurrection".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.100–101&lt;/ref&gt; On a more basic level, Ellwood describes Eliade as an "instinctively spiritual" person who saw the Iron Guard as a spiritual movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; In Ellwood's view, Eliade was aware that the "[[golden age]]" of antiquity was no longer accessible to secular man, that it could be recalled but not re-established. Thus, a "more accessible" object for nostalgia was a "secondary silver age within the last few hundred years"—the [[Kingdom of Romania]]'s 19th century cultural renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.xiv&lt;/ref&gt; To the young Eliade, the Iron Guard seemed like a path for returning to the silver age of Romania's glory, being a movement "dedicated to the cultural and national renewal of the Romanian people by appeal to their spiritual roots".&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.83"/&gt; Ellwood describes the young Eliade as someone "capable of being fired up by mythological archetypes and with no awareness of the evil that was to be unleashed".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Eliade's withdrawal from politics, and also because the later Eliade's religiosity was very personal and idiosyncratic,&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.120"/&gt; Ellwood believes the later Eliade probably would have rejected the "corporate sacred" of the Iron Guard.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.120"/&gt; According to Ellwood, the later Eliade had the same desire for a Romanian "resurrection" that had motivated the early Eliade to support the Iron Guard, but he now channeled it apolitically through his efforts to "maintain the culture of a free Romania" abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his writings, Eliade says, "Against the terror of History there are only two possibilities of defense: action or contemplation."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Forbidden Forest'', in Ellwood, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellwood, the young Eliade took the former option, trying to reform the world through action, whereas the older Eliade tried to resist the terror of history intellectually.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.101"/&gt;

Eliade's own version of events, presenting his involvement in far right politics as marginal, was judged to contain several inaccuracies and unverifiable claims.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.202, 208–211, 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Eliade depicted his arrest as having been solely caused by his friendship with [[Nae Ionescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.202, 209&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, answering Gershom Scholem's query, he is known to have explicitly denied ever having contributed to ''[[Buna Vestire]]''.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; According to [[Sorin Antohi]], "Eliade died without ever clearly expressing regret for his Iron Guard sympathies".&lt;ref name="Antohi p.xxiii"&gt;Antohi, preface to Liiceanu, p.xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; [[Z. Ornea]] noted that, in a short section of his ''Autobiography'' where he discusses the ''Einaudi'' incident, Eliade speaks of "my imprudent acts and errors committed in youth", as "a series of malentendus that would follow me all my life."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Ornea, p.210&lt;/ref&gt; Ornea commented that this was the only instance where the Romanian academic spoke of his political involvement with a dose of self-criticism, and contrasted the statement with Eliade's usual refusal to discuss his stances "pertinently".&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.210"/&gt; Reviewing the arguments brought in support of Eliade, Sergio Vila-Sanjuán concluded: "Nevertheless, Eliade's pro-Legionary columns endure in the newspaper libraries, he never showed his regret for this connection [with the Iron Guard] and always, right up to his final writings, he invoked the figure of his teacher Nae Ionescu."&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

In his ''Felix Culpa'', Manea directly accused Eliade of having embellished his memoirs in order to minimize an embarrassing past.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; A secondary debate surrounding Eliade's alleged unwillingness to dissociate with the Guard took place after ''Jurnalul portughez'' saw print. Sorin Alexandrescu expressed a belief that notes in the diary show Eliade's "break with his far right past".&lt;ref name="scnostal"/&gt; [[Cătălin Avramescu]] defined this conclusion as "whitewashing", and, answering to Alexandrescu's claim that his uncle's support for the Guard was always superficial, argued that ''Jurnal portughez'' and other writings of the time showed Eliade's disenchantment with the Legionaries' Christian stance in tandem with his growing sympathy for [[Nazism]] and its [[Nazi occultism|pagan messages]].&lt;ref name="cavrcitim"/&gt; Paul Cernat, who stressed that it was the only one of Eliade's autobiographical works not to have been reworked by its author, concluded that the book documented Eliade's own efforts to "camouflage" his political sympathies without rejecting them altogether.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;

Oișteanu argued that, in old age, Eliade moved away from his earlier stances and even came to sympathize with the non-[[Marxism|Marxist]] Left and the [[hippie]] [[youth movement]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teodoist"/&gt; He noted that Eliade initially felt apprehensive about the consequences of hippie activism, but that the interests they shared, as well as their advocacy of [[communalism]] and [[free love]] had made him argue that hippies were "a quasi-religious movement" that was "rediscovering the sacrality of Life".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Oişteanu, "Mircea Eliade şi mişcarea hippie"&lt;/ref&gt; Andrei Oișteanu, who proposed that Eliade's critics were divided into a "maximalist" and a "minimalist" camp (trying to, respectively, enhance or shadow the impact Legionary ideas had on Eliade), argued in favor of moderation, and indicated that Eliade's fascism needed to be correlated to the political choices of his generation.&lt;ref name="Oişteanu, Angajamentul..."/&gt;

===Political symbolism in Eliade's fiction===
Various critics have traced links between Eliade's fiction works and his political views, or Romanian politics in general. Early on, [[George Călinescu]] argued that the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] model outlined in ''Huliganii'' was: "An allusion to certain bygone political movements [...], sublimated in the ever so abstruse philosophy of death as a path to knowledge."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; By contrast, ''Întoarcerea din rai'' partly focuses on a failed [[Communism|communist]] rebellion, which enlists the participation of its main characters.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt;

''Iphigenia''‍'s story of self-sacrifice, turned voluntary in Eliade's version, was taken by various commentators, beginning with [[Mihail Sebastian]], as a favorable allusion to the Iron Guard's beliefs on commitment and death, as well as to the bloody outcome of the 1941 [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]].&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; Ten years after its premiere, the play was reprinted by Legionary refugees in Argentina: on the occasion, the text was reviewed for publishing by Eliade himself.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; Reading ''Iphigenia'' was what partly sparked Culianu's investigation of his mentor's early political affiliations.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

A special debate was sparked by ''Un om mare''. Culianu viewed it as a direct reference to [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] and his rise in popularity, an interpretation partly based on the similarity between, on one hand, two monikers ascribed to the Legionary leader (by, respectively, his adversaries and his followers), and, on the other, the main character's name (''Cucoanes'').&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"/&gt; [[Matei Călinescu]] did not reject Culianu's version, but argued that, on its own, the piece was beyond political interpretations.&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"/&gt; Commenting on this dialog, literary historian and essayist [[Mircea Iorgulescu]] objected to the original verdict, indicating his belief that there was no historical evidence to substantiate Culianu's point of view.&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"/&gt;

Alongside Eliade's main works, his attempted novel of youth, ''Minunata călătorie a celor cinci cărăbuși in țara furnicilor roșii'', which depicts a population of red ants living in a totalitarian society and forming bands to harass the beetles, was seen as a potential allusion to the [[Soviet Union]] and to communism.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Despite Eliade's ultimate reception in [[Communist Romania]], this writing could not be published during the period, after [[Censorship|censors]] singled out fragments which they saw as especially problematic.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

==Cultural legacy==

===Tributes===
[[Image:Stamp of Moldova 038.jpg|thumb|230px|Eliade's portrait on a [[Moldova]]n stamp]]
[[File:Aleea Clasicilor Eliade.jpg|thumb|230px|Portrait on the [[Alley of Classics, Chişinău|Alley of Classics]], [[Chişinău]]]]
An endowed chair in the History of Religions at the [[University of Chicago]] Divinity School was named after Eliade in recognition of his wide contribution to the research on this subject; the current (and first incumbent) holder of this chair is [[Wendy Doniger]].

To evaluate the legacy of Eliade and [[Joachim Wach]] within the discipline of the history of religions, the University of Chicago chose 2006 (the intermediate year between the 50th anniversary of Wach's death and the 100th anniversary of Eliade's birth), to hold a two-day conference in order to reflect upon their academic contributions and their political lives in their social and historical contexts, as well as the relationship between their works and their lives.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics in History"/&gt;

In 1990, after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]], Eliade was elected posthumously to the [[Romanian Academy]]. In Romania, Mircea Eliade's legacy in the field of the history of religions is mirrored by the journal ''Archaeus'' (founded 1997, and affiliated with the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of History). The 6th European Association for the Study of Religion and International Association for the History of Religions Special Conference on ''Religious History of Europe and Asia'' took place from September 20 to September 23, 2006, in [[Bucharest]]. An important section of the Congress was dedicated to the memory of Mircea Eliade, whose legacy in the field of history of religions was scrutinized by various scholars, some of whom were his direct students at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rahr.ro/RAHR/Conference2006/index.htm |title=''The Sixth EASR and IAHR Special Conference'' |accessdate=2009-07-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011070115/http://www.rahr.ro/RAHR/Conference2006/index.htm |archivedate=October 11, 2006 |df= }}; retrieved July 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

As Antohi noted, Eliade, [[Emil Cioran]] and [[Constantin Noica]] "represent in [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]] ultimate expressions of excellence, [Eliade and Cioran] being regarded as proof that Romania's [[Interwar period|interwar]] culture (and, by extension, Romanian culture as a whole) was able to reach the ultimate levels of depth, sophistication and creativity."&lt;ref name="Antohi p.xxiii"/&gt; A [[TVR 1|Romanian Television 1]] poll carried out in 2006 nominated Mircea Eliade as the 7th Greatest Romanian in history; his case was argued by the journalist [[Dragoş Bucurenci]] (''see [[100 greatest Romanians]]''). His name was given to a boulevard in the northern Bucharest area of [[Primăverii]], to a street in [[Cluj-Napoca]], and to high schools in Bucharest, [[Sighişoara]], and [[Reşiţa]]. The Eliades' house on Melodiei Street was torn down during the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], and an apartment block was raised in its place; his second residence, on [[Dacia Boulevard]], features a memorial plaque in his honor.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

Eliade's image in contemporary culture also has political implications. Historian [[Irina Livezeanu]] proposed that the respect he enjoys in Romania is matched by that of other "nationalist thinkers and politicians" who "have reentered the contemporary scene largely as heroes of a pre- and anticommunist past", including Nae Ionescu and Cioran, but also [[Ion Antonescu]] and [[Nichifor Crainic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Irina Livezeanu]], ''Cultural Politics in Greater Romania: Regionalism, Nation Building and Ethnic Struggle, 1918–1930'', [[Cornell University Press]], [[New York City]], 1995, p.x. {{ISBN|0-8014-8688-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, according to Oişteanu (who relied his assessment on Eliade's own personal notes), Eliade's interest in the American hippie community was reciprocated by members of the latter, some of whom reportedly viewed Eliade as "a [[guru]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Eliade has also been hailed as an inspiration by [[Germany|German]] representatives of the ''[[Neue Rechte]]'', claiming legacy from the [[Conservative Revolutionary movement]] (among them is the controversial magazine ''[[Junge Freiheit]]'' and the essayist [[Karlheinz Weißmann]]).&lt;ref name="altitudini"&gt;[http://www.altitudini.ro/articles.php?ai=1399 "Biografia lui Mircea Eliade la o editură germană radicală de dreapta" ("Mircea Eliade's Biography at a Right-Wing Radical German Publishing House")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903051830/http://www.altitudini.ro/articles.php?ai=1399 |date=2007-09-03 }}, in [http://www.altitudini.ro/ ''Altitudini''], Nr. 17, July 2007; retrieved November 8, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Florin Ţurcanu's biographical volume on Eliade was issued in a German translation by the Antaios publishing house, which is mouthpiece for the ''Neue Rechte''.&lt;ref name="altitudini"/&gt; The edition was not reviewed by the mainstream German press.&lt;ref name="altitudini"/&gt; Other sections of the European [[far right]] also claim Eliade as an inspiration, and consider his contacts with the Iron Guard to be a merit—among their representatives are the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Neo-fascism|neofascist]] [[Claudio Mutti]] and Romanian groups who trace their origin to the Legionary Movement.&lt;ref name="Oişteanu, Angajamentul..."/&gt;

===Portrayals, filmography and dramatizations===
Early on, Mircea Eliade's novels were the subject of [[satire]]: before the two of them became friends, [[Nicolae Steinhardt]], using the pen name ''Antisthius'', authored and published [[Parody|parodies]] of them.&lt;ref name="Steinhardt, in Handoca"/&gt; [[Maitreyi Devi]], who strongly objected to Eliade's account of their encounter and relationship, wrote her own novel as a reply to his ''[[Bengal Nights (novel)|Maitreyi]]''; written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], it was titled ''[[Na Hanyate]]'' (translated into English as "It Does Not Die").&lt;ref name="kamani"/&gt; Several authors, including [[Ioan Petru Culianu]], have drawn a parallel between [[Eugène Ionesco]]'s [[Theatre of the Absurd|Absurdist]] play of 1959, ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinoceros]]'', which depicts the population of a small town falling victim to a mass metamorphosis, and the impact fascism had on Ionesco's closest friends (Eliade included).&lt;ref&gt;Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."; Ornea, p.19, 181&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Saul Bellow]] published his controversial ''[[Ravelstein]]'' novel. Having for its setting the [[University of Chicago]], it had among its characters Radu Grielescu, who was identified by several critics as Eliade. The latter's portrayal, accomplished through statements made by the eponymous character, is polemical: Grielescu, who is identified as a disciple of [[Nae Ionescu]], took part in the [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|Bucharest Pogrom]], and is in Chicago as a refugee scholar, searching for the friendship of a Jewish colleague as a means to rehabilitate himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Iorgulescu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2002-05-27&amp;art=103 "Portretul artistului ca delincvent politic" ("The Portrait of the Artist as a Political Offender"), Part I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008065648/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2002-05-27&amp;art=103 |date=2007-10-08 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr.637, May 2002; retrieved July 16, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Romanian literary critic and translator Antoaneta Ralian, who was an acquaintance of Bellow's, argued that much of the negative portrayal was owed to a personal choice Bellow made (after having divorced from Alexandra Bagdasar, his Romanian wife and Eliade disciple).&lt;ref name="ralian"&gt;[http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_19388-A-incetat-din-viata-laureatul-Premiului-Nobel-Saul-Bellow.htm Antoaneta Ralian, interviewed on the occasion of Saul Bellow's death] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110532/http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_19388-A-incetat-din-viata-laureatul-Premiului-Nobel-Saul-Bellow.htm |date=2007-09-29 }}, [[BBC|BBC Romania]], April 7, 2005 (hosted by hotnews.ro); retrieved July 16, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also mentioned that, during a 1979 interview, Bellow had expressed admiration for Eliade.&lt;ref name="ralian"/&gt;

The 1988 film ''[[The Bengali Night]]'', directed by Nicolas Klotz and based upon the French translation of ''Maitreyi'', stars [[United Kingdom|British]] actor [[Hugh Grant]] as Allan, the European character based on Eliade, while [[Supriya Pathak]] is Gayatri, a character based on Maitreyi Devi (who had refused to be mentioned by name).&lt;ref name="kamani"/&gt; The film, considered "[[Pornography|pornographic]]" by [[Hinduism|Hindu]] activists, was only shown once in [[India]].&lt;ref name="kamani"/&gt; In addition to ''The Bengali Night'', films based on, or referring to, his works, include: ''Mircea Eliade et la redécouverte du Sacré'' (1987), part of the television series ''Architecture et Géographie sacrées'', by [[Paul Barbă Neagră]]; ''[[Miss Christina (1992 film)|Domnişoara Christina]]'' (1992), by Viorel Sergovici; ''[[Eu Adam]]'' (1996), by [[Dan Pița]]; ''[[Youth Without Youth (film)|Youth Without Youth]]'' (2007), by [[Francis Ford Coppola]].

Eliade's ''Iphigenia'' was again included in theater programs during the late years of the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] regime: in January 1982, a new version, directed by [[Ion Cojar]], premiered at the [[National Theater Bucharest]], starring [[Mircea Albulescu]], [[Tania Filip]] and [[Adrian Pintea]] in some of the main roles.&lt;ref name="raifigenia"/&gt; Dramatizations based on his work include ''[[La Țigănci]]'', which has been the basis for two theater adaptations: ''Cazul Gavrilescu'' ("The Gavrilescu Case"), directed by [[Gelu Colceag]] and hosted by the [[Nottara Theater]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Irina Margareta Nistor]], [http://agenda.liternet.ro/articol/5148/Irina-Margareta-Nistor/Un-cuplu-creator-de-teatru---Gelu-si-Roxana-Colceag.html "Un cuplu creator de teatru – Gelu şi Roxana Colceag" ("A Theater Producing Couple – Gelu and Roxana Colceag")], September 2001, at the [http://agenda.liternet.ro/ LiterNet publishing house]; retrieved January 18, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an eponymous play by director Alexandru Hausvater, first staged by the [[Odeon Theatre (Bucharest)|Odeon Theater]] in 2003 (starring, among others, [[Adriana Trandafir]], [[Florin Zamfirescu]], and [[Carmen Tănase]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adevarul.ro/index.php?section=articole&amp;screen=index&amp;id=39710&amp;duminica=1 "''La ţigănci''...&amp;nbsp;cu Popescu" (''To the Gypsy Girls''...&amp;nbsp;with Popescu")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327210015/http://www.adevarul.ro/index.php?section=articole&amp;screen=index&amp;id=39710&amp;duminica=1 |date=2008-03-27 }}, in ''[[Adevărul]]'', May 31, 2003; retrieved December 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, on Eliade's 100th birthday, the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company]] hosted the ''Mircea Eliade Week'', during which [[radio drama]] adaptations of several works were broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agenda.liternet.ro/articol/3964/Comunicat-de-presa/Saptamana-Mircea-Eliade-la-Radio-Romania.html "Săptămâna ''Mircea Eliade'' la Radio România" ("The ''Mircea Eliade'' Week on Radio Romania")] (2007 press communique) {{ro icon}}, at the [http://agenda.liternet.ro/ LiterNet publishing house]; retrieved December 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In September of that year, director and dramatist Cezarina Udrescu staged a [[multimedia]] performance based on a number of works Mircea Eliade wrote during his stay in [[Portugal]]; titled ''Apocalipsa după Mircea Eliade'' ("The Apocalypse According to Mircea Eliade"), and shown as part of a Romanian Radio cultural campaign, it starred [[Ion Caramitru]], [[Oana Pellea]] and [[Răzvan Vasilescu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gandul.info/arte/scrieri-eliade-visniec-cadrul-festivalului-enescu.html?3940;909322 "Scrieri de Eliade şi Vişniec, în cadrul festivalului Enescu" ("Texts by Eliade and Vişniec, as Part of the Enescu Festival")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922041749/http://www.gandul.info/arte/scrieri-eliade-visniec-cadrul-festivalului-enescu.html?3940;909322 |date=2007-09-22 }}, in ''[[Gândul]]'', September 12, 2007; retrieved December 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Domnișoara Christina'' has been the subject of two [[opera]]s: the first, carrying the same Romanian title, was authored by Romanian composer [[Șerban Nichifor]] and premiered in 1981 at the Romanian Radio;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimec.ro/Muzica/evenimadd/simn2004/ZiuaIV.htm ''Săptămâna Internaţională a Muzicii Noi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6852">[[File:Modernphysicsfields.svg|thumb|right|468px|[[Classical physics]] is usually concerned with everyday conditions: speeds much lower than the [[speed of light]], and sizes much greater than that of atoms. Modern physics is usually concerned with high velocities and small distances.]]

'''Modern physics''' is the post-Newtonian conception of [[physics]]. It implies that [[classical physics|classical descriptions]] of phenomena are lacking, and that an accurate, "modern", description of [[nature]] requires theories to incorporate elements of [[quantum mechanics]] or [[theory of relativity|Einsteinian relativity]], or both. In general, the term is used to refer to any branch of physics either developed in the early 20th century and onwards, or branches greatly influenced by early 20th century physics.

Small velocities and large distances is usually the realm of [[classical physics]]. Modern physics, however, often involves extreme conditions: quantum effects typically involve distances comparable to [[atom]]s (roughly [[1 E-9 m|10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m]]), while relativistic effects typically involve velocities comparable to the [[speed of light]] (roughly [[1 E8 m/s|3]] &lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt; [[1 E8 m/s|10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s]]). In general, quantum and relativistic effects exist across all scales, although these effects can be very small in [[everyday life]].

==Overview==
{{Modern Physics}}

In a literal sense, the term ''modern physics'', means up-to-date physics. In this sense, a significant portion of so-called ''[[classical physics]]'' is modern. However, since roughly 1890, new discoveries have caused significant [[paradigm shift]]s: the advent of [[quantum mechanics]] (QM) and of [[Theory of relativity|Einsteinian relativity]] (ER). Physics that incorporates elements of either QM or ER (or both) is said to be ''modern physics''. It is in this latter sense that the term is generally used.

Modern physics is often encountered when dealing with extreme conditions. Quantum mechanical effects tend to appear when dealing with "lows" (low temperatures, small distances), while relativistic effects tend to appear when dealing with "highs" (high velocities, large distances), the "middles" being classical behaviour. For example, when analysing the behaviour of a [[gas]] at [[room temperature]], most phenomena will involve the (classical) [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. However near [[absolute zero]], the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution fails to account for the observed behaviour of the gas, and the (modern) [[Fermi–Dirac distribution|Fermi–Dirac]] or [[Bose–Einstein distribution|Bose–Einstein]] distributions have to be used instead.

File:Max Planck 1933.jpg|German physicist [[Max Planck]], founder of [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Very often, it is possible to find – or "retrieve" – the classical behaviour from the modern description by analysing the modern description at low speeds and large distances (by taking a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], or by making an [[approximation theory|approximation]]). When doing so, the result is called the ''[[classical limit]]''.
[[File:Black body.svg|thumb|left|250px|Classical physics ([[Rayleigh–Jeans law]], black line) failed to explain [[black body radiation]] – the so-called [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]. The quantum description ([[Planck's law]], colored lines) is said to be ''modern physics''.]]
{{Cquote|The term "modern physics," taken literally, means of course, the ''sum total'' of knowledge under the head of present-day physics. In this sense, the physics of 1890 is still modern; very few statements made in a good physics text of 1890 would need to be deleted today as untrue...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand... there have been enormous advances in physics, and some of these advances have brought into question, or have directly contradicted, certain theories that had seemed to be strongly supported by the experimental evidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, few, if any physicists in 1890 questioned the [[Light#Wave theory|wave theory of light]]. Its triumphs over the old [[Corpuscular theory of light|corpuscular theory]] seemed to be final and complete, particularly after the brilliant [[Heinrich Hertz#Electromagnetic research|experiments of Hertz]], in 1887, which demonstrated, beyond doubt, the fundamental soundness of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light]]. And yet... these very experiments of Hertz brought to light a new phenomenon—the [[photoelectric effect]]—which played an important part in establishing the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]. The latter theory... is diametrically opposed to the wave theory of light; indeed, the reconciliation of these two theories... was one of the great problems of the first quarter of the twentieth century.

Traditionally in [[Western classical music|Western music]], a '''musical tone''' is a steady [[periodic function|periodic]] sound. A musical tone is characterized by its [[duration (music)|duration]], [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[amplitude|intensity]] (or [[loudness]]), and [[timbre]] (or quality).&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Musical note|note]]s used in [[music]] can be more complex than musical tones, as they may include aperiodic aspects, such as attack [[transient (acoustics)|transients]], [[vibrato]], and [[Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release|envelope modulation]].

A simple tone, or [[Pure tone|pure tone]], has a [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] [[waveform]].  A '''complex tone''' is a combination of two or more pure tones that have a periodic pattern of repetition, unless specified otherwise.

The [[Fourier theorem]] states that any periodic waveform can be approximated as closely as desired as the sum of a series of sine waves with frequencies in a [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]] and at specific [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationships to each other. The common denominator frequency, which is also often the lowest of these frequencies is the [[fundamental frequency]], and is also the inverse of the period of the waveform. The fundamental frequency determines the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of the tone, which is perceived by the human hearing. In music, [[Musical note|note]]s are assigned to tones with different fundamental frequencies, in order to describe the pitch of played tones.

[[File:Fluorescein (2).jpg|thumb|[[Fluorescein]] aqueous solutions, diluted from 1–10,000 parts-per-million]]
In [[science]] and [[engineering]], the '''parts-per notation''' is a set of pseudo-units to describe small values of miscellaneous [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless quantities]], e.g. [[mole fraction]] or [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]]. Since these [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] are quantity-per-quantity measures, they are pure numbers with no associated [[units of measurement]]. Commonly used are '''ppm''' (parts-per-million, {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;}}), '''ppb''' (parts-per-billion, {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;}}), '''ppt''' (parts-per-[[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]], {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and '''ppq''' (parts-per-quadrillion, {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;}}). This notation is not part of the SI system and its meaning is ambiguous.

==Overview==
Parts-per notation is often used describing dilute solutions in [[chemistry]], for instance, the relative abundance of dissolved minerals or pollutants in water. The quantity “1&amp;nbsp;ppm” can be used for a mass fraction if a water-borne pollutant is present at one-millionth of a [[gram]] per gram of sample solution. When working with aqueous solutions, it is common to assume that the density of water is 1.00 g/mL. Therefore, it is common to equate 1 kilogram of water with 1 L of water. Consequently, 1 ppm corresponds to 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L and 1 ppb corresponds to 1 μg/L.

Similarly, parts-per notation is used also in [[physics]] and [[engineering]] to express the value of various proportional phenomena. For instance, a special metal alloy might expand 1.2 [[micrometre|micrometers]] per [[metre|meter]] of length for every [[Celsius|degree Celsius]] and this would be expressed as “''[[Coefficient of thermal expansion|α]]''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.2&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C.” Parts-per notation is also employed to denote the change, stability, or [[Standard deviation|uncertainty]] in measurements. For instance, the accuracy of land-survey distance measurements when using a [[laser rangefinder]] might be 1&amp;nbsp;millimeter per kilometer of distance; this could be expressed as “[[Accuracy and precision|Accuracy]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;ppm.”&lt;ref&gt;This is a simplified explanation. Laser rangefinders typically have a measurement [[granularity]] of one to ten millimeters; thus, the complete specification for distance measurement accuracy might read as follows:&amp;nbsp; Accuracy: ±(1&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;ppm). Consequently, a distance measurement of only a few meters would still have an accuracy of ±1&amp;nbsp;mm in this example.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts-per notations are all [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless quantities]]: in mathematical expressions, the units of measurement always cancel. In fractions like “2 nanometers per meter” (2&amp;nbsp;n&lt;s&gt;m&lt;/s&gt;/&lt;s&gt;m&lt;/s&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;nbsp;nano&amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;nbsp;ppb&amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;0.000&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;000&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;001)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; so the [[quotient]]s are pure-number [[coefficient]]s with positive values less than&amp;nbsp;1. When parts-per notations, including the [[percent]] symbol (%), are used in regular prose (as opposed to mathematical expressions), they are still pure-number dimensionless quantities. However, they generally take the literal “parts per” meaning of a comparative ratio (e.g., “2&amp;nbsp;ppb” would generally be interpreted as “two parts in a billion parts”).&lt;ref name="BIPM"&gt;BIPM: [http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section5-3-7.html 5.3.7 ''Stating values of dimensionless quantities, or quantities of dimension one]''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts-per notations may be expressed in terms of any unit of the same measure. For instance, the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of a certain [[brass]] alloy, ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;18.7&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C, may be expressed as 18.7&amp;nbsp;([[Micrometre|µm]]/m)/°C, or as 18.7&amp;nbsp;(µ[[Inch|in]]/in)/°C; the numeric value representing a relative proportion does not change with the adoption of a different unit of measure.&lt;ref&gt;In the particular case of coefficient of thermal expansion, the change to inches (one of the [[United States customary units|U.S. customary units]]) is typically also accompanied by a change to [[Fahrenheit|degrees Fahrenheit]]. Since a Fahrenheit-sized interval of temperature is only {{frac|5|9}} that of a Celsius-sized interval, the value is typically expressed as 10.4&amp;nbsp;(µin/in)/°F rather than 18.7&amp;nbsp;(µin/in)/°C.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a [[metering pump]] that injects a trace chemical into the main process line at the proportional flow rate ''[[Volumetric flow rate|Q]]&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;125&amp;nbsp;ppm, is doing so at a rate that may be expressed in a variety of volumetric units, including 125&amp;nbsp;µL/L, 125&amp;nbsp;µ[[Gallon|gal]]/gal, 125&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/[[Cubic metre|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], etc.

===In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy===

In [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (NMR), [[chemical shift]] is usually expressed in ppm. It represents the difference of a measured frequency in parts per million from the reference frequency. The reference frequency depends on the instrument's magnetic field and the element being measured. It is usually expressed in MHz. Typical chemical shifts are rarely more than a few hundred Hz from the reference frequency, so chemical shifts are conveniently expressed in ppm (Hz/MHz). Parts-per notation gives a dimensionless quantity that does not depend on the instrument's field strength.

==Parts-per expressions==&lt;!-- This specific section is linked from [[Uranium]] and other articles; please do not rename this section. In the following equivalencies, it is assumed that one xxxx of water has a volume of 0.05 ml (20 xxxx per milliliter).--&gt;
{{visualisation_parts_per.svg}}
*''One part per [[100 (number)|hundred]]'' is generally represented by the [[percent sign]] (%) and denotes one part [[percentage|per 100 parts]], one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about fifteen minutes out of one day.
{{anchor|Thousand}}
*''One part per [[thousand]]'' should generally be spelled out in full and '''not''' as "ppt" (which is usually understood to represent "parts per trillion"). It may also be denoted by the [[per mille|permille]] sign (‰). Note however, that specific disciplines such as oceanography, as well as educational exercises, do use the "ppt" abbreviation. "One part per thousand" denotes one part per 1000 parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about one and a half minutes out of one day.
*''One part per [[ten thousand]]'' is denoted by the [[Basis point#Permyriad|permyriad]] sign (‱). Although rarely used in science (ppm is typically used instead), one permyriad has an unambiguous value of one part per {{val|10000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about nine seconds out of one day.&lt;br&gt;In contrast, in [[finance]], the [[basis point]] is typically used to denote changes in or differences between percentage interest rates (although it can also be used in other cases where it is desirable to express quantities in hundredths of a percent). For instance, a change in an interest rate from 5.15% per annum to 5.35% per annum could be denoted as a change of 20 basis points (per annum).&lt;!--NOTE TO EDITORS:

Unlike the % symbol, which constitutes a formatting exception to the rule of the SI, a space goes between the value and both the permille and permyriad symbols (‰ and {{unicode|‱}}). Besides adhering to the rule of the SI, this is also good technical writing practice as it helps to distinguish these two less-common symbols from the percent symbol.

--&gt; As with interest rates, the words "per annum" (or "per year") are often omitted. In that case, the basis point is a quantity with a dimension of (time&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/basis-points-bps-definition/|title=What are Basis Points (BPS)?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''One part per [[million]]'' ('''ppm''') denotes one part per {{val|1000000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, {{sfrac|{{val|1000000}}}} × 100% = 0.0001% (or 1% = {{val|10000}} ppm), and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about 32 seconds out of a year; in [[distance measurement]], it is equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;mm of error per km of distance traversed.
{{anchor|ppb}}
*''One part per [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]'' ('''ppb''') denotes one part per {{val|1000000000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, {{sfrac|{{val|1000000000}}}} × 100% = {{val|0.0000001}}% (or 1% = {{val|10000000}} ppb) and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about three seconds out of a [[century]].
{{anchor|ppt}}
*''One part per [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]]'' ('''ppt''') denotes one part per {{val|1000000000000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about thirty seconds out of every million years.
{{anchor|ppq}}
*''One part per [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1015|quadrillion]]'' ('''ppq''') denotes one part per {{val|1000000000000000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about two and a half minutes out of the [[age of the Earth]] (4.5 billion years). Although relatively uncommon in analytical chemistry, measurements at the ppq level are sometimes performed.&lt;ref&gt;
Measurements of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] are routinely made at the ''sub''-ppq level. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) currently sets a hard limit of 30&amp;nbsp;ppq for dioxin in drinking water but once recommended a voluntary limit of 0.013&amp;nbsp;ppq. Also, radioactive contaminants in drinking water, which are quantified by measuring their radiation, are often reported in terms of ppq; 0.013&amp;nbsp;ppq is equivalent to the thickness of a sheet of paper versus a journey of {{val|146000}} trips around the world.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE REGARDING {{val|146000}} TRIPS AROUND THE WORLD:

The analogy of paper thickness vs. 146k trips around the world may be so wildly counterintuitive that the statement might seemingly be in error, but please do not change the statement without first understanding the below math (shown here with excess precision):

Paper thickness = 0.0030 inch = 0.0000762 m (0.003 × 25.4 mm/inch ÷ 1000 mm/m)
Earth’s mean circumference = 40,041,470 m

In then follows that…
[[Image:Image-Olympic Pool Munich 1972, color adj.jpg|thumb|right|300px|One part per trillion (1 ppt) is a proportion equivalent to a drop of water diluted into 400 [[Olympic-size swimming pool]]s.]]

In [[science]] and [[engineering]], the '''parts-per notation''' is a set of pseudo-units to describe

146,386.7 trips × 40,041,470 m × 0.013E-15 = 0.0000762 m = 0.0030 inch = paper thickness
--&gt;

== Criticism ==

Although the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (an international standards organization known also by its [[France|French]]-language initials BIPM) recognizes the use of parts-per notation, it is not formally part of the [[International System of Units]] (SI).&lt;ref name="BIPM"/&gt; Note that although “[[Percentage|percent]]” (%) is not formally part of the SI, both the BIPM and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] take the position that ''“in mathematical expressions, the internationally recognized symbol % (percent) may be used with the SI to represent the number 0.01”'' for dimensionless quantities.&lt;ref name="BIPM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantities and units'' - Part 0: ''General principles'', ISO 31-0:1992.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics|IUPAP]], ''“a continued source of annoyance to unit purists has been the continued use of percent, ppm, ppb, and ppt.”''&lt;ref name="IUPAP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Report on recent Committee activities on behalf of IUPAP to the 1999 IUPAP General Assembly |author-first=Brian W. |author-last=Petley |date=September 1998 |url=http://archive.iupap.org/commissions/interunion/iu14/ga-99.html&lt;!-- http://www.iupap.org/commissions/interunion/iu14/ga-99.html --&gt; |access-date=2017-08-15 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815113700/http://archive.iupap.org/commissions/interunion/iu14/ga-99.html |archive-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[#SI-compliant expressions|SI-compliant expressions]] should be used as an alternative, the parts-per notation remains nevertheless widely used in technical disciplines. The main problems with the parts-per notation are the following:

=== Long and short scales ===

Because the [[Names of large numbers|named numbers]] starting with a “[[Long and short scales|billion]]” have different values in different countries, the BIPM suggests avoiding the use of “ppb” and “ppt” to prevent misunderstanding. The U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) takes the stringent position, stating that ''“the language-dependent terms [ .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. ] are not acceptable for use with the SI to express the values of quantities.”''&lt;span style="margin-left:0.3em"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NIST: ''[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html#7.10.3 Rules and Style Conventions for Expressing Values of Quantities: 7.10.3 ppm, ppb, and ppt]''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

=== Thousand vs. trillion ===

Although "ppt" usually means "parts per trillion", it occasionally means "parts per thousand". Unless the meaning of "ppt" is defined explicitly, it has to be determined from the context.

=== Mass fraction vs. mole fraction vs. volume fraction ===

Another problem of the parts-per notation is that it may refer to [[Mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]], [[mole fraction]] or [[volume fraction]]. Since it is usually not stated which quantity is used, it is better to write the unit as kg/kg, mol/mol or m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (even though they are all dimensionless).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is quite significant when dealing with gases and it is very important to specify which quantity is being used. For example, the conversion factor between a mass fraction of 1 ppb and a mole fraction of 1 ppb is about 4.7 for the greenhouse gas [[CFC-11]] in air. For volume fraction, the suffix "V" or "v" is sometimes appended to the parts-per notation (e.g., ppmV, ppbv, pptv).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA On-line Tools for Site Assessment Calculation: Indoor Air Unit Conversion|url=http://www.epa.gov/athens/learn2model/part-two/onsite/ia_unit_conversion.html|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Milton R. Beychok|title=Fundamentals of Stack Gas Dispersion|url=http://www.air-dispersion.com/formulas.html|article=Air Dispersion Modeling Conversions and Formulas|publisher=Milton R. Beychok|edition=4th|isbn=0964458802|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, ppbv and pptv are also often used for mole fractions (which is identical to volume fraction only for ideal gases).

To distinguish the mass fraction from volume fraction or mole fraction, the letter w (standing for weight) is sometimes added to the abbreviation (e.g., ppmw, ppbw).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Introduction to Green Engineering|url=https://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/CE_2050_F12/2012/08/23/units/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the parts-per notation is generally quite fixed inside most specific branches of science, leading some researchers to draw the conclusion that their own usage (mass/mass, mol/mol, volume/volume, or others) is the only correct one. This, in turn, leads them to not specify their usage in their publications, and others may therefore misinterpret their results. For example, [[electrochemistry|electrochemists]] often use volume/volume, while [[Chemical engineering|chemical engineers]] may use mass/mass as well as volume/volume. Many academic papers of otherwise excellent level fail to specify their usage of the parts-per notation.

Note that the notations in the “SI units” column above are all [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless quantities]]; that is, the units of measurement factor out in expressions like “1&amp;nbsp;nm/m” (1&amp;nbsp;n&lt;s&gt;m&lt;/s&gt;/&lt;s&gt;m&lt;/s&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1&amp;nbsp;nano&amp;nbsp;= 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;) so the [[quotient]]s are pure-number [[coefficient]]s with values less than 1.

==Uno==
Because of the cumbersome nature of expressing certain dimensionless quantities per SI guidelines, the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) in 1999 proposed the adoption of the special name "uno" (symbol: U) to represent the number 1 in dimensionless quantities.&lt;ref name="IUPAP"/&gt; This symbol is not to be confused with the always-italicized symbol for the variable "uncertainty" (symbol: ''U''). This unit name "uno" and its symbol could be used in combination with the [[SI prefix]]es to express the values of dimensionless quantities that are much less—or even ''greater''—than one.&lt;ref&gt;Certain mathematical functions can produce proportional quantities with values greater than 1.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Common parts-per notations in terms of the uno are given in the table below.

In 2004, a report to the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (known also by its French-language initials CIPM) stated that response to the proposal of the uno "had been almost entirely negative" and the principal proponent "recommended dropping the idea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report of the 16th meeting (13–14 May 2004) to the International Committee for Weights and Measures, of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures |author=Consultative Committee for Units |date=13–14 May 2004 |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310054340/http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf |archive-date=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the uno has not been adopted by any [[standards organization]] and it appears unlikely it will ever become an officially sanctioned way to express low-value (high-ratio) dimensionless quantities. The proposal was instructive, however, as to the perceived shortcomings of the current options for denoting dimensionless quantities.

==Improper applications==
Parts-per notation may properly be used only to express true dimensionless quantities; that is, the units of measurement ''must'' cancel in expressions like "1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg" so that the quotients are pure numbers with values less than 1. Mixed-unit quantities such as "a [[radon]] concentration of 15&amp;nbsp;p[[Curie|Ci]]/[[Litre|L]]" are not dimensionless quantities and may not be expressed using any form of parts-per notation, such as "15&amp;nbsp;ppt". Other examples of measures that are not dimensionless quantities are as follows:

* [[Particulate|Particulate matter]] in the air: 50&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; not 50&amp;nbsp;ppb.
* A [[stepper motor]]/gear system that produces a motion of 1&amp;nbsp;µm/pulse; not 1&amp;nbsp;ppm
* Mercury vapor concentration in air: 0.6&amp;nbsp;ng/[[Litre|L]]; not 0.6&amp;nbsp;ppt&lt;!--EDITORS NOTE: This example intentionally juxtaposes nano (one billionth) and ppt (parts per trillion) rather than ppb, as a lead-in to the below discussion regarding how what is commonly done with aqueous concentrations (where one liter of water has a mass of 1 kg) may not be done with air.--&gt;

Note however, that it is not uncommon to express aqueous concentrations—particularly in drinking-water reports intended for the general public—using parts-per notation (2.1&amp;nbsp;ppm, 0.8&amp;nbsp;ppb, etc.) and further, for those reports to state that the notations denote milligrams per [[Litre|liter]] or micrograms per liter. Although "2.1&amp;nbsp;mg/L" is not a dimensionless quantity, it is assumed in scientific circles that "2.1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg" (2.1&amp;nbsp;ppm) is the true measure because one liter of water has a mass of about one kilogram. The goal in all [[technical writing]] (including drinking-water reports for the general public) is to clearly communicate to the intended audience with minimal confusion. Drinking water is intuitively a volumetric quantity in the public’s mind so measures of contamination expressed on a per-liter basis are considered to be easier to grasp. Still, it is technically possible, for example, to "dissolve" more than one liter of a very hydrophilic chemical in 1 liter of water; parts-per notation would be confusing when describing its solubility in water (greater than a million parts per million), so one would simply state the volume (or mass) that will dissolve into a liter, instead.

When reporting air-borne rather than water-borne densities, a slightly different convention is used since air is approximately 1000 times less dense than water. In water, 1&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is roughly equivalent to parts-per-trillion whereas in air, it is roughly equivalent to parts-per-billion. Note also, that in the case of air, this convention is much less accurate. Whereas one liter of water is almost exactly 1&amp;nbsp;kg, one cubic meter of air is often taken as 1.143&amp;nbsp;kg—much less accurate, but still close enough for many practical uses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

'''Political criticism''' (also referred to as '''political commentary''' or '''political discussion''') is [[criticism]] that is specific of or relevant to [[politics]], including [[policies]], [[politicians]], [[political parties]], and types of [[government]].

==Controversy==
There has been controversy over the relevance and importance of political criticism in civilizations, particularly [[democratic societies]].

Advocates argue that political discussion creates and promotes the variety of opinions necessary for a true democracy. The [[American constitution]] is often pointed to as support for the belief, ensuring for all peoples under its administration such maxims as [[free speech]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Critics of this philosophy argue that the general public (and, on a more individual  basis, the "Average Joe") lacks the resources and capability to conceive opinions that are educated enough to be taken seriously. Thus, the abundance and fervent promotion of such opinions merely confuses and complicates political matters that, given an appropriate amount of factual education, are either easily understood or should be discussed only by those with sufficient [[intelligence]] to do the matter justice.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Methods==
There are many methods used throughout [[written history|history]] of promoting political opinions and with the development of new  [[technologies]] new ways have materialized both in recent and ancient history. Some of the most common include the following:

===Books===
[[Image:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumbnail|250px|left|[[The Bible]], one of the most influential books of all time]]
Throughout history one of the most influential methods (arguably '''the''' most influential method) of promoting political opinions has been literary. This peculiar pattern of books influencing the thinking of the masses, reinstated with such books as [[the Bible]], [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], the [[Qur'an]], ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and many others, has been attributed to many of the characteristics of [[writing]]. While it has been proven that a well-written book can indeed appeal to one's intellect with reasoning and ideas sprung from [[common sense]], the drive of [[literature]] and writing is most commonly considered to be derivative of the [[emotions|emotional impact]] of the text, guiding people to think a certain way by making them feel a certain way. This often has great political consequences, most particularly when the subject of the emotional reaction is a plea for moral justice, as can be seen (to use America as an example once more) in the aftermath of the publication of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] concerning American views about [[slavery]]. It is from this correlation between books and politics that the phrase, "[[the pen is mightier than the sword]]", derives.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Television and films===
Since their development in this past century, both [[television]] and [[films]] have often had far-reaching political effects throughout the world. Influential films and television events include [[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]], [[Citizen Kane]], the works of [[Walt Disney]], and such political [[satire]] as that found in [[The Simpsons]]. Like literature (see above), a movie or television event has the capacity to have emotional impact on its viewers, making it an invaluable tool for politics. This attribute is noticed and used frequently by politicians and ordinary citizens alike; political [[propaganda]] on the screen now has an effect on everything from a nation's outlook on its economy to the smallest of elections and political decisions.

===Political cartoons===
{{Main|Political satire}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:conscripcartoon.jpg|thumb|150px|Editorial cartoon concerning [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]'s freedom from his [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|Conscription promise]] by [[Johnny Canuck]].]] --&gt;
[[Political cartoons]] (also known as "editorial cartoons") are infamous for their ability to promote political views through satirical means. With cartoons the fight for the minds of the public is not a [[:wikt:verbal|verbal]] but a [[visual]] one and leaving strong impressions with the use of powerful  [[symbols]] or [[metaphors]] in order to communicate the artist's messages.

===News===
Since many people know only a very little about their civilization and its present state except for what is told to them by [[news media|the media]], the potential for influence is extremely high with the publication of [[newspapers]], news broadcasts, etc. Any bias in these mediums alters people's impressions of current events into different understandings and opinions than those that may have been chosen with more accurate information.

===Internet===
With the recent invention of the [[Internet]], political criticism has been greatly extended to anyone with a connection to the [[World Wide Web]]. In a few decades already this has revolutionized politics to the extent that the public now has a virtually unlimited education quite literally at its fingertips, allowing people to choose with less work what aspects of current politics they wish to research.

The many means of exchanging ideas, including [[blogs]] and [[internet forum]]s, has extended the political debate to anyone that cares to contribute.  This ability and speed that which ideas can flow has literally changed the way that [[political parties]] stay connected to [[Electoral district|constituents]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2817">'''Pouncing''' is an art technique used for transferring an image from one surface to another.  It is similar to tracing, and is useful for creating copies of a sketch outline to produce finished works.
[[File:Tracing wheel - 01.jpg|thumb|A pounce wheel, also known as a tracing wheel]]
Pouncing has been a common technique for centuries, used to create copies of portraits and other works that would be finished as oil paintings, engravings, and so on. The most common method involves laying semi-transparent paper over the original image, then tracing along the lines of the image by creating pricked marks on the top sheet of paper.  This pounced drawing made of pricked holes is laid over a new working surface. A powder such as chalk, graphite or pastel is forced through the holes to leave an outline on the working surface below, thus transferring the image. The powder is applied by being placed into a small bag of thin fabric such as cheesecloth, then dabbed onto the pricked holes of the pounced drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cofrentes nuclear power plant cooling towers retouched.jpg|thumb|285x285px|Typical cooling towers of nuclear power plant]]
'''Power plant engineering''' or '''power station engineering''' is a division of [[power engineering]], and is defined as "the engineering and technology required for the [[Electricity generation|production]] of [[Power station|central station]] [[electric power]]."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Plant Engineering|last=Weisman|first=Joel|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|year=1985|isbn=0-13-597252-3|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 07632|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is focused on the generation of power for industries and communities, not for household power production. The field is an interdisciplinary field, using the theoretical base of both [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[electrical engineering]]. The engineering aspect of power plant management has evolved with technology and has become progressively more complicated. The introduction of [[Nuclear power|nuclear technology]] and the progression of other existing technologies have allowed power to be created in more ways and on a larger scale than was previously possible. The assignment of different types of engineers to the design, construction, and operation of a new power plant is dependent on the type of system being built such as whether it is a [[nuclear power plant]], [[hydroelectric plant]], or solar plant.

== History ==
[[File:PearlStreetStation.jpg|thumb|Pearl Street Station 1882]]
Power plant engineering got its start in the 1800s when small systems were used by individual factories to provide [[electrical power]]. Originally the only source of power came from DC, or [[direct current]], systems.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/HistElectPowTrans.html|title=History of Electrification Sites|last=Center|first=Copyright 2014 Edison Tech|website=www.edisontechcenter.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this was suitable for business, electricity was not accessible for most of the public body. During these times, the coal powered [[steam engine]] was costly to run and there was no way for the power to be transmitted over distances. [[Hydroelectricity]] was one of the most utilized forms of power generation as [[water mills]] could be used to create power to transmit to small towns.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

It wasn't until the introduction of AC, or [[alternating current]], [[AC power|power systems]] that allowed for the creation of power plants as we know them today. AC systems allowed power to be transmitted over larger distances than DC systems allowed and thus, large power stations were able to be created. One of the progenitors of long-distance power-transmission was the [[International Electrotechnical Exhibition|Lauffen to Frankfurt power plant]] which spanned 109 miles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/LauffenFrankfurt.html|title=Lauffen to Frankfurt 1891|last=Center|first=Copyright 2015 Edison Tech|website=www.edisontechcenter.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lauffen-Frankfurt demonstrated how [[three-phase power]] could be effectively applied to transmit power over long distances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brighthubengineering.com/power-plants/18686-what-are-power-plants/|title=What are Power Plants?|website=Brighthub Engineering|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three-phase power had been the progeny of years of research in power distribution and the Lauffen-Frankfurt was the first exhibition to show its real potential for future use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The engineering knowledge needed to perform these tasks enlists the help of several fields of engineering including mechanical, electrical, [[nuclear engineering|nuclear]] and [[civil engineering|civil engineers]]. When power plants were up and coming, engineering tasks needed to create these facilities mainly consisted of mechanical, civil, and electrical engineers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These disciplines allowed for the planning and construction of power plants. But when nuclear power plants were created it introduced nuclear engineers to perform the calculations necessary to maintain safety standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/47749-nuclear-engineering.html|title=What Is Nuclear Engineering?|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governing principles ==

=== First Law of Thermodynamics ===
In simple terms, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] states that [[energy]] cannot be created nor destroyed; however, power can be converted from one form of energy to another form of energy. This is especially important in power generation because power production in nearly all types of power plants relies upon the use of a [[Electric generator|generator]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Generators are used to convert [[mechanical energy]] into electrical energy; for example, [[wind turbines]] utilize a large blade connected to a shaft which turns the generator when rotated. The generator then creates electricity due to the interaction of a conductor within a magnetic field. In this case, the mechanical energy generated by the wind is converted, through the generator, into electric energy. Most power plants rely on these conversions to create usable electric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/electricity3.htm|title=How Electricity Works|date=2004-05-28|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second law of thermodynamics ===
The [[second law of thermodynamics]] conceptualizes that the [[entropy]] of a closed system can never decrease. As the law relates to power plants, it dictates that heat is to flow from a body at high temperature to a body at low temperature (the device in which electricity is being generated).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This law is particularly pertinent to [[thermal power plants]] which derive their energy from the [[combustion]] of a [[fuel]] source.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Types of power plants ==
All power plants are created with the same goal: to produce electric power as efficiently as possible. However, as technology has evolved, the sources of energy used in power plants has evolved as well.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The introduction of more renewable/sustainable forms of energy has caused an increase in the improvement and creation of certain power plants.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Hydroelectric power plants ===
[[File:Diablo Dam (from WA SR 20).jpg|thumb|239x239px|Hydroelectric Dam]]
[[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric power plants]] generate power using the force of water to turn generators. They can be categorized into three different types; impoundment, diversion and pumped storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/types-hydropower-plants|title=Types of Hydropower Plants {{!}} Department of Energy|website=www.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impoundment and diversion hydroelectric power plants operate similarly in that each involves creating a barrier to keep water from flowing at an uncontrollable rate, and then controlling the flow rate of water to pass through turbines to create electricity at an ideal level. Mechanical engineers are in charge of calculating flow rates and other volumetric calculations necessary to turn the generators at the electrical engineers specifications. Pumped storage hydroelectric power plants operate in a similar manner but only function at peak hours of power demand. At calm hours the water is pumped uphill, then is released at peak hours to flow from a high to low elevation to turn turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/hyhowworks.html|title=Hydroelectric Power: How it works, USGS Water-Science School|last=USGS|first=Howard Perlman,|website=water.usgs.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engineering knowledge required to assess the performance of pumped storage hydroelectric power plants is very similar to that of the impoundment and diversion power plants.

=== Thermal power plants ===

[[Thermal power station|Thermal power plants]] are split into two different categories; those that create electricity by burning fuel and those that create electricity via prime mover. A common example of a thermal power plant that produces electricity by the consumption of fuel is the nuclear power plant. Nuclear power plants use a [[nuclear reactor|nuclear reactor's]] heat to turn water into steam.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This steam is sent through a turbine which is connected to an electric generator to generate electricity. [[Nuclear power plant]]s account for 20% of [[Energy in the United States|America's electricity generation]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thermal-powerplant.blogspot.com/2010/05/thermal-power-plant-classification.html|title=Thermal Power Plant Classification|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a fuel burning power plant is [[Fossil fuel power station|coal power plant]]. [[Fossil fuel power station|Coal power plants]] generate 50% of the United States' electricity supply.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Coal power plants operate in a manner similar to nuclear power plants in that the heat from the burning coal powers a steam turbine and electric generator.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; There are several types of engineers that work in a Thermal Power Plant. Mechanical engineers maintain performance of the thermal power plants while keeping the plants in operation.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://work.chron.com/engineers-work-solar-1835.html|title=Engineers Who Work With Solar|last=Wagner|first=Vivian|date=|website=Houston Chronicle|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear Engineer generally handle fuel efficiency and disposal of nuclear waste; however, in Nuclear Power Plants they work directly with nuclear equipment.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collegegrad.com/careers/nuclear-engineers|title=Nuclear Engineers|last=|first=|date=|website=CollegeGrad|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical Engineers deals with the power generating equipment as well as the calculations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sokanu.com/careers/electrical-engineer/#what-does-an-electrical-engineer-do|title=What Does An Electrical Engineer Do?|last=|first=|date=|website=Sokanu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar power plants ===
[[File:Fixed Tilt Solar panel at Canterbury Municipal Building Canterbury New Hampshire.jpg|thumb|237x237px|Solar field]]
[[Solar power plant]]s derive their energy from sunlight, which is made accessible via [[photovoltaics]] (PV's). Photovoltaic panels, or [[solar panels]], are constructed using photovoltaic cells which are made of [[semiconductor]] materials that release electrons when they are warmed by the thermal energy of the sun. The new flow of electrons generates electricity within the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/solar-power/|title=Solar Power Has Benefits as a Source of Alternative Energy|date=2009-10-09|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While PV's are an efficient method of producing electricity, they do burn out after a decade and thus, must be replaced; however, their efficiency, cost of operation, and lack of [[noise pollution|noise]]/[[pollution|physical pollutants]] make them one of the cleanest and least expensive forms of energy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Solar power plants require the work of many facets of engineering; electrical engineers are especially crucial in constructing the solar panels and connecting them into a grid, computer engineers code the cells themselves so that electricity can be effectively and efficiently produced, and civil engineers play the very important role of identifying areas where solar plants are able to collect the most energy.&lt;ref name="Wagner"/&gt;

=== Wind power plants ===
[[File:Middelgrunden wind farm 2009-07-01 edit filtered.jpg|thumb|239x239px|Wind power plant]]
[[Wind farm|Wind power plants]], also known as wind turbines, derive their energy from the wind by connecting a generator to the fan blades and using the rotational motion caused by [[wind]] to power the generator.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/how-do-wind-turbines-work|title=How Do Wind Turbines Work? {{!}} Department of Energy|website=www.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the generated power is fed back into the power grid. Wind power plants can be implemented on large, open expanses of land or on large bodies of water such as the oceans; they simply rely on being in areas that experience significant amounts of wind.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Technically, wind turbines are a form of solar power in that they rely on pressure differentials caused by uneven heating of the earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Wind turbines solicit the knowledge from mechanical, electrical, and civil engineers. Knowledge of fluid dynamics from the help of mechanical engineers is crucial in determining the viability of locations for wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/career-map-mechanical-engineer|title=Mechanical Engineer|last=|first=|date=|website=Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical engineers ensure that power generation and transmission is possible.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Civil engineers are important in the construction and utilization of wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sokanu.com/careers/civil-engineer/#what-does-a-civil-engineer-do|title=What does a Civil Engineer Do?|last=|first=|date=|website=Sokanu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Power plant engineering covers a broad spectrum of engineering disciplines. The field can solicit information from mechanical, electrical, nuclear, and civil engineers.

These engineers work in Nuclear Power plants and require licenses for practice while working in the power plant. They require work experience, passing the Professional Engineering Exam(PE), Fundamental Engineering Exam (FE), and a degree from an [[ABET|Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc]] (ABET) approved school.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Nuclear engineers work with the handling of nuclear material and operations of a nuclear power plant. These operations can range from handling of nuclear wastes, nuclear material experiments, and design of nuclear equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/nuclear-engineers.htm#tab-2|title=What Nuclear Engineers Do|last=|first=|date=April 13, 2018|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil ===
[[Civil engineering|Civil engineers]] focuses on the construction, expenses and building of the power plant.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/civil-engineers.htm#tab-4|title=Civil Engineers|last=|first=|date=April 13, 2018|website=US Bureau of Labor Statistics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil Engineers require passing the Professional Engineering Exam (PE), Fundamental Engineering Exam (FE), and a degree from an [[ABET|Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology, Inc.]] (ABET) approved school.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; They work with making sure the structure of the power plant, the location and the design and safety of the power plant.

=== Associations ===
While there are many disparities between the aforementioned engineering disciplines, they all cover material related to [[heat transfer|heat]] or electricity transmission. Obtaining a degree from an [[ABET]] accredited school in any one of these disciplines is essential to becoming a power plant engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/articles/How_to_Become_a_Power_Plant_Operator_Career_Guide.html|title=How to Become a Power Plant Operator: Career Guide|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many associations which qualified engineers can join, including the [[ASME|American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME), the [[IEEE|Institute of Electric and Electronic Engineers]] (IEEE), and the [http://www.asope.org/ American Society of Power Engineers] (ASOPE).

== Fields ==
'''[[Power station#Operations|Power plant operation and maintenance]]''' consists of optimizing the efficiency and power output of power plants and ensuring long term operation.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.spbstu.ru/education/programs/programs-in-english/master-s-degree/power-plant-engineering/|title=Power Plant Engineering|website=english.spbstu.ru|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; These power plants are large scale, and used to supply power for communities and industry. [[Microgeneration|Individual household electric power generators]] are not included.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

'''Power station design''' consists of the design of new power plant systems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are many types of power plants, and each type requires specific expertise, as well as interdisciplinary teamwork, to build a modern system.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13215">The term “School Brand”, similar to "brand" as it applies to traditional business applications, is any type of term, mark or insignia, which identifies one organization or product from another. These marks were intended to indicate an affiliation with a particular school, group, organization, trade, manufacturer, or maker.

== History ==

While “branding” has history as far back as 1100&amp;nbsp;BCE, in a period referred to as the [[Vedic Period]], “School Branding” however is a relatively new concept. Many universities and colleges, now operate in a businesslike market where students are “customers” and other schools are competition. To successfully compete, a school must develop and market its own brand that differentiates it from the thousands of other schools vying for students and funding. Although most have marketing budgets, schools are still climbing the learning curve when relating to effective branding.

According to Branding Strategy Insider, school branding surfaced in the early 1800s when a few sororities and fraternities literally branded their pledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2006/08/history_of_bran.html/ |title=History of Branding - Brand Strategy Insider |publisher=Brandingstrategyinsider.com |date=2006-08-14 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, tobacco and patent medicine companies began branding their products as a way to identify them and build buyer loyalty. Brand identity also helped protect the customer by holding companies more accountable for product quality. By the mid-1800s, branding became central to business strategy as consumer companies such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] began using it in their marketing.

Higher education waited over a century to follow the corporate world. According to University Business, schools adopted branding in the early 2000s, when they realized that higher learning had evolved into a marketplace of customers and providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitybusiness.com/article/have-college-brands-delivered-their-promise|title=Have College Brands Delivered on Their Promise?|author=Robert A. Sevier|publisher=UB University Business|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of for-profit and online universities created more choices for students, and those newer schools were aggressively marketing in corporate style. Students were becoming more diverse, and schools could no longer take demographics for granted. At the same time, schools ranging from elementary to colleges and universities, had to compete harder for government funding and private endowments. To meet the challenges, universities invested in market research, logos and other marketing efforts that often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

== Present situation ==

Today’s school branding goes a step further and identifies a school’s unique competitive advantage. As stated in the Gallup Business Journal, a brand promises what the student experience will be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessjournal.gallup.com/content/28081/building-brand-higher-education.aspx/ |title=Building Brand Higher Education - Gallup Business Journal |publisher=Businessjournal.gallup.com |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many school departments produce their own distinctive communications, which can muddy the message. Colleges are grappling with the fact that the message is only effective if the entire faculty and leadership commit as one voice to the brand promise.

Schools also need to communicate their brand in a way that resonates emotionally with students. When people feel a message, they are more likely to remember it and respond. Brandgarten advocates using archetypes in branding to focus the emotional message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandgarten.com/2012/05/07/branding-higher-education|title=Branding Higher Education|publisher=brandgarden|date=May 5, 2012|accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a school that places a high value on community service might use the archetype of the caregiver to tell its story. Prospective students would hear the call to service in all of the college's communications and could decide whether it was a potential match. Prior to branding, the same college would have been lost among superficially similar schools.

One recent rebranding occurred when [[Beaver College]], in Pennsylvania, surveyed prospective students and discovered that 30 percent of people considering the university did not apply because of the name. As a result, Beaver College was rebranded as [[Arcadia University]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunzel|first1=David|title=Universities Sell Their Brands|journal=The Journal of Product and Brand Management|date=2007|volume=16 |issue=2|pages=152-153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition of need ==

[[Harvard University]], viewed as the college gold standard, relies on branding to help recruit students and donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randall |first=Kevin |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1361340/does-branding-pay-colleges-harvard-thinks-so/ |title=Does Branding Pay Off for Colleges? Harvard Thinks So |publisher=Fast Company |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university took a lesson from its own business school and has applied for trademarks to protect several taglines. According to Fast Company, Harvard has already won approval for the taglines "Ask what you can do" and "Lessons learned". Harvard has also taken the entrepreneurial step of licensing its name to an upscale clothing line, which helps with branding as well as its funding mission.

Although colleges may be fairly new to branding, Neuromarketing points out that they represent the longest-lived brands in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fri, Jul 17, 2009 Neuromarketing, Branding |url=http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/college-branding.htm/ |title=College Branding |publisher= Neuromarketing |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools exist for decades and even centuries and today have thousands of rivals. As baby boomers age out of the education market, the declining number of prospective students is increasing competition among schools. Schools have responded with glossy marketing campaigns but still lag in branding. Neuromarketing notes that much college marketing material portrays similar images of a pleasant campus filled with smiling professors and a diverse student body. Websites, brochures and even tours often leave students and their families no wiser as to what makes a particular school special.

The missing ingredient is brand development, as [[Columbia University]] discovered in recent years. According to Neuromarketing, Columbia branded itself as the only Ivy League school in New York City and began showcasing the Manhattan experience in its marketing materials. Student applications have since increased over the competition, and many applicants cited location as the reason they chose Columbia University. Administrators of Columbia University realized that name recognition alone was not enough to attract more of the right students, and its branding strategy paid off.

Even as schools compete for students, those students are learning to brand themselves in an effort to impress colleges. High school is the right time to start building a personal brand, advises Visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vizibility.net/blog/its-never-too-early-personal-branding-for-high-school-college-students/ |title=It’s Never Too Early - Personal Branding for High School &amp; College Students - Visibility |author=Adrian Maynard| publisher=Vizibility.net |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young students can take several steps to enhance their uniqueness, beginning with defining a niche that will serve as the core of their brand. To build the school brand, they can start a quality blog and network both online and offline about its subject. Additional help in for schools in building a brand can be found by extended resources to companies like VIP Branding, who specializes in school branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalvillageconcerns.com/ |title=Specializing in School Branding - VIP Branding |publisher=Globalvillageconcerns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allocation of resources to expert branding companies, allows school administrators to focus their attention to the needs of the school. By the time these students are ready to apply for college, they will have an edge over those who left personal branding up to the admissions essay.

Today’s students shop with brand awareness, and schools need to have a compelling message in place to attract them. Online school stores, like the ones offered through the Varsity Shop Program, provide a new avenue for schools to market themselves and their brand, through specialty designed and branded products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsityshop.com/ |title=Varsity Shop Program |publisher=varsityshop.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although schools tends to be leery of corporate tactics, branding is an opportunity for them to define for themselves what makes them special. By doing so, schools enrich what they offer creating school spirit and student pride, helping students to carry that commitment and care onto higher education.

== Repercussions of improper use ==

While many school administrators, recognize the power of school branding, the lack of resources and funding have led to alternative solutions to professional branding. Logo infringement has increased through the years as a result of this acknowledged need for branding. Numerous schools across the United States are infringing upon trademarked logos without realizing they are in violation. The [[Sanford Herald]] notated a recent case with [[Lake Mary High School]] out of [[Florida]], was in such a case, when the school was given a cease and desist order to terminate the use of their ram logo because as their ram logo was too similar the [[Dodge Ram]] logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mysanfordherald.com/view/full_story_obits/7668253/article-Lake-Mary-rallies-around-new-ram|title=Lake Mary rallies around a new ram|author=Rachel Delinski|publisher=The Sanford Herold|date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, logo infringement is accidental, but the resulting repercussions of using trademarked logos can lead to litigation, exorbitant fines, and can be disparaging on school morale.

In addition to logo infringement, the loss of brand identity is another resulting drawback to improper school branding. Unprofessionally designed logos or mascots, can lead to an undesired identity or a variety of versions, which can lead to brand confusion as notated in by Brand Empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandempowerment.com/schools/school-challenges/brand-control/ |title=Brand Control |publisher=Brand Empowerment |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sinulator''' is a [[cybersex]] device. The device connects to a range of [[sex toy]]s and allows a person to control the sex toys connected to the sinulator over an internet connection, termed [[Teledildonics]]. These devices are becoming popular with many adult web content providers.

'''Suicidology''' is the scientific study of [[suicidal behaviour]], the causes of suicidalness and [[suicide prevention]].&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maris, Berman, Silverman|first=Ronald, Alan, Mortan|title=Comprehensive Textbook of Suicidology|year=2000|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=72 Spring Street, New York, NY 10012|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different fields and disciplines involved with suicidology, the two primary ones being psychology and sociology. Every year, about one million people die by suicide, which is a mortality rate of sixteen per 100,000 or one death every forty seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide prevention (SUPRE)|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicideprevent/en/|publisher=WHO|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide is largely preventable with the right actions, knowledge about suicide, and a change in society's view of suicide to make it more acceptable to talk about suicide.

==Short history==
Most suicidologists think about the history of suicide in terms of courts, church, press, morals, and society. In Ancient Greece, there were several opinions about suicide. It was tolerated and even lauded when committed by patricians (generals and philosophers) but condemned if committed by  [[plebeians]] (common people) or slaves. In Rome, suicide was viewed rather neutrally, even positively because life was held cheaply. During early Christianity, excessive martyrdom and a penchant toward suicide frightened church elders sufficiently for them to introduce a serious deterrent. Suicide was thought of as a crime because it precluded possibility of repentance, and it violated the sixth commandment which is ''Thou shall not kill''. During this time, St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] emphasized that suicide was a mortal sin because it disrupted God's power over man's life and death. However, nowhere in the Judeo-Christian Bible is there a directive forbidding suicide. This belief took hold and for hundreds of years thereafter played an important part in the Western view of suicide. Over the last 200 years, the main focus of suicide has moved from accusations that it is a sin to effort at compassion, understanding, and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shneidman|first=Edwin|title=Comprehending Suicide Landmarks in 20th-Century Suicidology|year=2001|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=750 First Street, NE Washingtion DC 20002|pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parts of study==
There are many points of study within suicidology. Suicidology studies not only death by suicide and attempted suicide but also partial self-destruction, [[suicidal ideation]], [[parasuicide]], and self-destructive behaviors and attitudes.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; Suicidal ideation is when someone is having thoughts or showing gestures of suicide. For example, it could be as simple as someone saying that "life is not worth living any more" or it can be extreme as "I'm going to kill myself by jumping off a bridge." Parasuicide is when someone causes deliberate harm to themselves. For example, if someone were to take an overdose of medicine and live. Self-destructive behaviors are anything that cause harm to oneself. This can be intentional or unintentional. Some examples are alcoholism, risky sports, some sexual disorders, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;   By way of a [[suicide note]] the person who is suiciding has the last word. It is also a way for the person to explain, bring closure (or not), to give guilt, to dictate wishes, to control, to forgive or to blame. Here is a list of the parts that might go into a suicide note.

==Contributors==
One of the first to contribute to the study of suicidology is Edwin S. Shneidman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Shneidman]]&lt;/ref&gt; Edwin Shneidman is considered to be the father of suicidology. Shneidman's definition of suicide is a conscious act of self-induced annihilation, best understood as a multidimensional malaise in a needful individual who defines an issue for which suicide is perceived as the best solution.  He thought of suicide as psychache or intolerable psychological pain. Another notable person in the field of suicidology is [[Emile Durkheim]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emile Durkheim]]&lt;/ref&gt;  To Durkheim the word suicide is applied to all cases of death resulting directly or indirectly from a positive or negative act of the victim himself, which he knows will produce this result. Basically he saw suicide as an external and constraining social fact independent of individual psychopathology.  In David J. Mayo's definition there were four elements to suicide. The first element: A suicide has taken place only if a death has occurred. The second element: The death must be of one's own doing. The third element: The agency of suicide can be active or passive and, lastly, it implies intentionally ending one's own life.  [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Menninger]] had similar views on suicide. Their definition of suicide had three different aspects. One was a murder involving hatred or the wish to kill. The second one was a murder by the self often involving guilt or the wish to be killed. The last one is the wish to die. They thought of suicide being a murderous death wish that was turned back upon one's own self. Sigmund Freud also believed that we had two opposing basic instincts—life (eros) and death (thanatos)—and all instincts sought tension reduction. He also believed that suicide is more likely in advanced civilizations requiring greater repression of sexual and aggressive energy. Jean Baechler's definition of suicide was that suicide denotes all behavior that seeks and finds the solution to an existential problem by making an attempt on the life of the subject. Another worker in the field of suicidology was Joseph H. Davis. The definition he gave for suicide was a suicide is a fatal willful self-inflicted life-threatening act without apparent desire to live; implicit are two basic components lethality and intent. [[Albert Camus]] also did some work in this field. He believed that whether one can live or chooses to live is the only truly serious philosophical problem. He also claimed that man created a god in order to be able to live without a wish to kill himself and that the only human liberty is to come to terms with death. He introduced Darwinian thought into his teachings.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

==Suicide myths==
Here is a list of suicide myths and the truth behind these myths.&lt;ref name="Providing Access to Help 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Providing Access to Help|title=PATH Training Manual|year=2011|publisher=PATH|location=Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Myths !! Truths
|-
| People who die by suicide always leave notes. || Most people don't leave notes. Only a small percentage leave any type of explanations about why they've chosen to kill themselves.
|-
| People who die by suicide don't warn others. || Out of ten people who kill themselves, eight have given definite clues to their intentions. They leave numerous clues and warnings to others, although some of their clues may be non-verbal or difficult to detect.
|-
| People who talk about suicide are only trying to get attention. || Few die by suicide without first letting someone else know how they feel. People thinking about suicide give clues and warnings as cries for help. Over 70% who do threaten to kill themselves either make an attempt or die by suicide. 
|-
| Once someone has already decided to die by suicide, nothing is going to stop them. || Most of the time suicidal people are ambivalent about suicide. Most individuals don't want to die; they just want the pain they are feeling to stop. 
|-
| Once the emotional state improves, the risk of suicide is over. || The highest rates of suicide occur within about three months of an apparent improvement in a severely depressed state. Energy level is the important factor in someone who's improving having the energy to act on a suicidal impulse, if they perceive a stumbling block to recovery. 
|-
| After a person has attempted suicide, it is unlikely they will try again. || People who have attempted suicide are very likely to try again. 80% of people who die by suicide have made at least one previous attempt. 
|-
| Don't mention suicide to someone who's showing signs of severe depression; it will plant the idea in their mind and they will act on it. || Many depressed people have already considered suicide as an option. Talking about suicide generally provides a sense of relief and understanding to the person. Talking about suicide is one of the most helpful things you can do. 
|-
| A non-fatal attempt means that the person wasn't serious about ending their life. || Some people are naive about how to kill themselves. The attempt in and of itself is the most important factor, not the method.

The '''Text Creation Partnership''' ('''TCP''') is a not-for-profit organization based in the library of the [[University of Michigan]] {{as of
 |2000
 |alt=since 2000}}. Its purpose is to produce large-scale full-text electronic resources (especially in the humanities) on behalf of both member institutions (particularly academic libraries) and scholarly publishers, under an arrangement calculated to serve the needs of both, and in so doing to demonstrate the value of a business model that sees corporate and non-profit information-providers as potentially amicable collaborators rather than as antagonistic vendors and customers respectively.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview see {{cite journal

TCP has sponsored four text-creation projects to date. The first and the largest is "EEBO-TCP (Phase I)" (2001–2009), an effort to produce structurally marked-up full-text transcriptions of 25,000+ of the roughly 125,000 books to be found either in the Pollard and Redgrave and Wing [[short-title catalogue]]s of early English printed books, or among the [[Thomason Tracts]], that is, from among nearly all books, pamphlets, and broadsides published in English or in England before 1700. The books were selected and transcribed from the digital scans produced by [[ProQuest]] Information and Learning, and distributed by them as a web-based product under the name "'''Early English Books Online'''" (EEBO). The scans from which the texts were transcribed were themselves made from the microfilm copies made over the years by ProQuest and its antecedent companies, including the original University Microfilms, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EEBO-TCP Phase I concluded at the end of 2009, having transcribed about 25,300 titles, and immediately moved into EEBO-TCP Phase II (2009–), a sequel project dedicated to converting all the remaining unique English-language monographs (roughly 45,000 additional titles).

The third TCP project was Evans-TCP (2003–2007, with some ongoing work through 2010), an effort to transcribe 6,000 of the 36,000 pre-1800 titles listed in Charles Evans' ''American Bibliography,'' and distributed, again as page images scanned from microfilm copies, by [[Readex]], a division of [[NewsBank, Inc.]] under the name "[[Archive of Americana]]" ("Early American Imprints, series I: Evans, 1639–1800"). Evans-TCP has produced e-texts of nearly 5,000 books.

The final TCP project was ECCO-TCP (2005–2010, with some work ongoing), an effort to transcribe 10,000 eighteenth-century books from among the 136,000 titles available in [[Thomson-Gale]]'s web-based resource, "Eighteenth-Century Collections Online" (ECCO). ECCO-TCP ran out of funding in 2010 after transcribing about 3,000 (and editing about 2,400) titles.

==Organization==

The TCP is overseen by a Board of Directors, drawn chiefly from senior library administrators at partner institutions, representatives of the corporate partners, and the [[Council on Library and Information Resources]] (CLIR). The Board is assisted in matters of selection and scholarship by an academic advisory group that includes faculty in the fields of early modern English and American studies.

The TCP has informal ties to a number of University-based scholarly text projects, especially in helping to provide them with source texts with which to work. Institutions represented include Northwestern University (IL), Oxford University (UK), Washington University (St. Louis), the University of Sydney (Australia), the University of Toronto (ON), and the University of Victoria (BC). TCP has also worked with students by sponsoring an Undergraduate Essay Contest every year, convening task forces on the uses of TCP texts in pedagogy, and appealing to scholars and students for ideas on selection and use.

Text production is managed through the University of Michigan's [[Digital Library Production Service]] (DLPS), with its extensive experience in the production of SGML/XML-encoded electronic texts. DLPS is assisted by [[Oxford University's]] Bodleian Digital Libraries Systems &amp; Services (BDLSS), including the late [[Sebastian Rahtz]].&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.it.ox.ac.uk/martinw/2016/03/23/the-oxford-text-archive-2015/&lt;/ref&gt; Small part-time production operations have also been started within two other libraries: the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies in Pratt Library (Victoria University in the University of Toronto), specializing in Latin books; and the National Library of Wales (Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru) in Aberystwyth, specializing in Welsh books.

==Commonalities==

All four TCP text projects are very similar. In each case:

# The TCP produces text from commercial image files that have in turn been created from microfilm copies of early books.
# The commercial image providers receive what is in effect a full-text index to their image product for much less than it would cost to produce themselves: value added to their product.
# The partner libraries actually own, rather than simply license, the resultant texts, and are free (subject to some conditions) to mount the texts themselves in whatever system they like, or use the texts internally as a tool of scholarship and teaching.
# The texts are created according to library-determined standards, uniform across multiple data-sets and potentially cross-searchable.
# Because they are created collaboratively, the texts are relatively inexpensive (on a per-book basis) and become more so with each library that joins the partnership.
# The texts will eventually be made freely accessible to the public at large.
# The selection of texts to convert, though differing from project to project, in each case follows similar principles: variety, significance, representative quality, avoidance of duplication; specific requests from faculty or scholarly initiatives at member institutions are also generally honored.
# TCP has been hitherto primarily interested in creating texts, not in creating a "product"; though texts from all three projects are or will be mounted on servers at the University of Michigan library, the Michigan site is not the official TCP site: any partner library with adequate resources and safeguards may do the same. EEBO-TCP texts, for example, are served by Michigan, ProQuest, the Oxford University Digital Library, and the University of Chicago.

==Standards==

All four TCP text projects are produced in the same way and to the same standards, which are documented, at least in part, on the [http://www.lib.umich.edu/tcp/docs/ TCP web site].

# '''Accuracy.''' The TCP strives to produce texts that are as accurately transcribed as possible, with a specified overall accuracy rate of 99.995% or better (i.e. one error or fewer per 20,000 characters).
# '''Keying.''' Given the nature of the material, the only method found to deliver such accuracy economically has been to have the books keyed by data conversion firms under contract.
# '''Quality control.''' Accuracy of transcription and aptness of markup are assessed in all cases by a group of library-based proofers and reviewers managed by the University of Michigan DLPS.
# '''Encoding.''' All resultant text files are marked up in valid SGML or XML (SGML is archived, XML is exported) conforming to a proprietary "Document Type Description" (DTD) derived from the P3/P4 version of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) standard.
# '''Purposeful markup.''' Compared to the full TEI, the TCP DTD is very simple and intended to capture only the features most useful for intelligible display, intelligent navigation, and productive searching. The TCP practice is to capture, so far as feasible, the overall hierarchical structure of each book (parts, sections, chapters, etc.); the features that tend to mark the beginnings and ends of divisions (headings, explicits, salutations, valedictions, datelines, bylines, epigraphs, etc.); the most significant elements of discourse and organization (paragraphs in prose, lines and stanzas in verse, speeches, speakers, and stage directions in drama, notes, block quotes, sequential numerations of all kinds); and only the most essential aspects of physical formatting (page breaks, lists, tables, font changes).
# '''Fidelity to the original.''' In each case, the text is intended to represent the book as originally printed, so far as that is possible. Printer's errors are preserved, hand-written changes are ignored, duplicate scans are omitted, out-of-order images are keyed in the intended order, and most of the unusual characters of the original are preserved.
# '''Ease of reading and searching.''' At the same time, though the transcriptions are carried out character-by-character, TCP, on the theory that all transcription is a kind of translation from one symbolic system to another, tends to define characters in terms more of their meaning than of their form, and to map eccentric letter-forms to meaningful modern equivalents, generally in keeping with the Unicode definition of "character."
# '''Languages.''' Though most of the TCP texts are in English, many are not. Books and divisions of books not in English are tagged with an appropriate language code, but are not otherwise distinguished.
# '''Omitted material.''' The TCP produces Latin-alphabet ''text''. Non-textual material such as musical notation, mathematical formulae, and illustrations (except for any text they may contain) are omitted and their locations marked with a special tag. Extended text in non-Latin alphabets (Greek, Hebrew, Persian, etc.) is also omitted.

==Accomplishments and prospects==

As of April 2011, the TCP had created about 40,000 searchable, navigable, full-text transcriptions of early books, a database of unmatched scope, scale, and utility to students in many fields. Whether it will be able to go on to produce the remaining 38,000 texts included in its ambitious recent plans (for EEBO-TCP Phase II) will depend on the validity of its original vision, arising from the theory that libraries could and should cooperate to become producers and standard-setters rather than consumers; and that universities and commercial firms, despite their very different life-cycles, constraints, and motives, could join in durable partnerships of benefit to all parties.

As of Jan 1, 2015, the full text of the EEBO phase I has been released under a Creative Commons License, and can be freely downloaded and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/2014/12/24/eebo-tcp-phase-i-public-release-what-to-expect-on-january-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 there were 28,466 titles available via Phase II. As of July 2015, ProQuest had the exclusive right for five years to distribute the EEBO-TCP Phase II collection. After those five years the texts will be made freely available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/tcp-eebo/|title=EEBO-TCP: Early English Books Online - Text Creation Partnership|website=www.textcreationpartnership.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Art of Sexual Ecstasy''''' (New York: Tarcher/Putnam, 1989) is the best-known work of author [[Margot Anand]]. It presents the foundation of her method known as "SkyDancing Tantra". It has been translated into at least eleven languages and has gone through numerous printings. It is possibly the most popular book on [[Tantra]] addressed to a Western audience, and is notable for its use of concrete sexual exercises to demonstrate the often esoteric principles of Tantra.

'''The Burrard Street Journal''' (or BSJ) is an online satire news website based in [[Vancouver]], BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.burrardstreetjournal.com/about-burrard-street-journal/ | title= The Burrard Street Journal – (Burrard Street Football) | accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site gained notoriety in August 2016 after a number of websites reported a BSJ article about then [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] moving to Canada as fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/obama-moving-to-canada-hoax | last= Silverman | first= Craig | date= 12 August 2016 | title= A Bunch Of Conservative Sites Fell For A Hoax Claiming Obama Will Move To Canada If Trump Wins | website= [[BuzzFeed]] | accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.torontosun.com/2016/08/12/sorry-us-the-jokes-on-you-obama-wont-be-moving-to-canada-if-trump-wins | date= 12 August 2016 | title= Sorry U.S., the joke's on you: Obama won't be moving to Canada if Trump wins | website= [[Toronto Sun]] | accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other Burrard Street Journal articles and videos have been reported as real news. In July 2016, an article titled 'Trump Claims America Should Never Have Given Canada Its Independence'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/20/is-trump-trolling-the-white-house-press-corps | last= Marantz | first= Andrew | date= 20 March 2017 | title= Is Trump Trolling the White House Press Corps? | magazine= [[The New Yorker]] | accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was shared over 9,000 times and in March 2016, an edited BSJ video reporting [[Donald Trump]] building a wall with Canada was shared over 50,000 times and has received 4.5 million views as of March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | date = 22 March 2016 | title = Breaking News: Donald J.

[[File:Central Park from Rock.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Central Park]] represents an ecosystem fragment within a larger urban environment.]]

'''Urban ecology''' is the scientific study of the relation of living organisms with each other and their surroundings in the context of an [[urban environment]]. The urban environment refers to environments dominated by [[population density|high-density]] residential and commercial buildings, [[Impervious surface|paved surfaces]], and other urban-related factors that create a unique landscape dissimilar to most previously studied environments in the field of [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Niemela"&gt;Niemela, J. Ecology and urban planning. Biodiversity and Conservation. 1999. 8: 119-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban ecology is a recent field of study compared to ecology as a whole. The methods and studies of urban ecology are similar to and comprise a subset of ecology. The study of urban ecology carries increasing importance because more than 50% of the world's population today lives in urban areas.&lt;ref name="UrbanEcology"&gt;Govind Singh, http://urbanecology.in/2014/10/05/urban-ecology-inputs-need-of-the-urban-era/&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it is estimated that within the next forty years, two-thirds of the world's population will be living in expanding urban centers.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;United Nations 2007. World [[urbanization]] prospects: the 2007 revision. UN.&lt;/ref&gt; The ecological processes in the urban environment are comparable to those outside the urban context. However, the types of urban [[habitats]] and the species that inhabit them are poorly documented. Often, explanations for phenomena examined in the urban setting as well as predicting changes because of urbanization are the center for scientific research.&lt;ref name="Niemela" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Plan d'Eau 2.jpg|thumb|The creation of an important stream water garden in [[Metz]]'s centre during the early 70s was one of the materializations of [[Jean-Marie Pelt]]'s works on urban ecology.]]
Ecology has historically focused on "pristine" natural environments, but by the 1970s many ecologists began to turn their interest towards ecological interactions taking place in, and caused by urban environments. [[Jean-Marie Pelt]]'s 1977 book ''The Re-Naturalized Human'',&lt;ref&gt;Pelt JM. (1977) L'Homme re-naturé. 1977. Eds Seuil. {{ISBN|2-02-004589-3}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Davis' 1978 publication ''Urbanization and the diversity of insects'',&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis BNK. Urbanisation and the diversity of insects. In: Mound L A and Walo N (eds) Diversity of Insect Faunas. Symposia of the Royal Entomological Society of London. 1978. 9: 126-138. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sukopp et al.'s 1979 article "The soil, flora and vegetation of Berlin's wastelands"&lt;ref name="Sukopp"&gt;Sukopp H, Blume HP and Kunick W (1979) "The soil, flora and vegetation of Berlin's wastelands". In: Laurie I C (ed) ''Nature in Cities''. 115-132. John Wiley, Chichester&lt;/ref&gt; are some of the first publications to recognize the importance of urban ecology as a separate and distinct form of ecology the same way one might see [[landscape ecology]] as different from [[population ecology]]. Forman and Godron's 1986 book ''Landscape Ecology''&lt;ref name="Forman"&gt;Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron. Landscape ecology. 1986. John Wiley and Sons. New York, NY. 619.&lt;/ref&gt; first distinguished urban settings and landscapes from other landscapes by dividing all landscapes into five broad types. These types were divided by the intensity of human influence ranging from pristine [[natural environment]]s to [[urban centers]].

Urban ecology is recognized as a diverse and complex concept which differs in application between North America and Europe. The European concept of urban ecology examines the [[biota (ecology)|biota]] of urban areas, while the North American concept has traditionally examined the social sciences of the urban landscape,&lt;ref&gt;Wittig, R. and H. Sukopp. Was ist Stadtökologie? Stadtökologie. 1993. 1-9. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the ecosystem fluxes and processes.&lt;ref&gt;Pickett STA, Burch WR Jr, Dalton SE, Foresman TW, Grove JM and Rowntree R A conceptual framework for the study of human ecosystems in urban areas. Urban Ecosystems. (1997b). 1:185-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

Since urban ecology is a subfield of ecology, many of the techniques are similar to that of ecology. Ecological study techniques have been developed over centuries, but many of the techniques use for urban ecology are more recently developed. Methods used for studying urban ecology involve chemical and biochemical techniques, temperature recording, heat mapping [[remote sensing]], and long-term ecological research sites.

===Chemical and biochemical techniques ===

Chemical techniques may be used to determine [[pollutant]] concentrations and their effects. Tests can be as simple as dipping a manufactured test strip, as in the case of pH testing, or be more complex, as in the case of examining the spatial and temporal variation of [[heavy metal contamination]] due to industrial runoff.&lt;ref&gt;Furness, R.W., D.R. Thompson, and P.H. Becker. Spatial and temporal variation in mercury contamination of seabirds in the North Sea. Helgolander Meeresuntersuchungen. 1995. 49: 605-615.&lt;/ref&gt; In that particular study, livers of birds from many regions of the [[North Sea]] were ground up and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] was extracted. Additionally, mercury bound in feathers was extracted from both live birds and from museum specimens to test for mercury levels across many decades. Through these two different measurements, researchers were able to make a complex picture of the spread of mercury due to industrial runoff both spatially and temporally.

Other chemical techniques include tests for [[nitrate]]s, [[phosphate]]s, [[sulfate]]s, etc. which are commonly associated with urban [[pollutant]]s such as [[fertilizer]] and industrial byproducts. These biochemical fluxes are studied in the atmosphere (e.g. [[greenhouse gas]]ses), [[aquatic ecosystem]]s and [[soil vegetation]].&lt;ref name="grim2008"/&gt; Broad reaching effects of these biochemical fluxes can be seen in various aspects of both the urban and surrounding rural ecosystems.

===Temperature data and heat mapping===

[[Temperature]] data can be used for various kinds of studies. An important aspect of temperature data is the ability to correlate temperature with various factors that may be affecting or occurring in the environment. Oftentimes, temperature data is collected long-term by the [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR), and made available to the scientific community through the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).&lt;ref name="Gallo"&gt;Gallo, K.P., A.L. McNab, T.R. Karl, J.F. Brown, J.J. Hood, and J.D. Tarpley. The Use of NOAA AVHRR Data for Assessment of the Urban Heat Island Effect. American Meteorological Society. 1993. 32: 899-908.&lt;/ref&gt; Data can be overlaid with maps of terrain, urban features, and other spatial areas to create heat maps. These heat maps can be used to view trends and distribution over time and space.&lt;ref name="Gallo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;Roth, M., T.R. Oke, and W.J. Emery. Satellite-derived urban heat island from three coastal cities and the utilization of such data in urban climatology. International Journal of Remote Sensing. 1989. 10(11): 1699-1720.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Remote sensing ===
[[File:Boston forest cover 460.gif|thumb|Remote sensing allows collection of data using satellites. This map shows urban tree canopy in Boston.]]

[[Remote sensing]]  is the technique in which data is collected from distant locations through the use of satellite imaging, [[radar]], and aerial photographs. In urban ecology, remote sensing is used to collect data about terrain, weather patterns, light, and vegetation. One application of remote sensing for urban ecology is to detect the productivity of an area by measuring the photosynthetic wavelengths of emitted light.&lt;ref name="Schochat"&gt;Schochat, E., W.L. Stefanov, M.E.A. Whitehouse, and S.H. Faeth. 2004. Urbanization and spider diversity: influences of human modification of habitat structure and productivity. Ecological Applications 14:268-280.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite images can also be used to detect differences in temperature and landscape diversity to detect the effects of urbanization.&lt;ref name="Roth" /&gt;

=== LTERs and long-term data sets ===

[[Long Term Ecological Research Network|Long-term ecological research]] (LTER) sites are research sites funded by the government that have collected reliable long-term data over an extended period of time in order to identify long-term climatic or ecological trends. These sites provide long-term temporal and spatial data such as average temperature, rainfall and other ecological processes. The main purpose of LTERs for urban ecologists is the collection of vast amounts of data over long periods of time. These long-term data sets can then be analyzed to find trends relating to the effects of the urban environment on various ecological processes, such as species diversity and abundance over time.&lt;ref name="Schochat" /&gt; Another example is the examination of temperature trends that are accompanied with the growth of urban centers.&lt;ref name="brazel"&gt;Brazel, A., N. Selover, R. Vose, and G. Heisler. 2000. The tale of two climates-Baltimore and Phoenix urban LTER sites. Climate Research 15:123-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Urban effects on the environment ==

Humans are the driving force behind urban ecology and influence the environment in a variety of ways, such as modifying land surfaces and waterways, introducing foreign species, and altering biogeochemical cycles. Some of these effects are more apparent, such as the reversal of the [[Chicago River]] to accommodate the growing pollution levels and trade on the river.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;Hill, L. The Chicago River: A Natural and Unnatural History. Lake Claremont Press. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Other effects can be more gradual such as the change in global climate due to urbanization.&lt;ref name="Changnon"&gt;Changnon, S.A. Inadvertent Weather Modification in Urban Areas: Lessons for Global Climate Change. American Meteorological Society. 1992. 73(5): 619-627.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modification of land and waterways ===
[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The "fishbone pattern" is a result of the roads in the forest created by loggers.]]Humans place high demand on land not only to build urban centers, but also to build surrounding suburban areas for housing. Land is also allocated for agriculture to sustain the growing population of the city. Expanding cities and suburban areas necessitate corresponding deforestation to meet the land-use and resource requirements of urbanization. Key examples of this are [[Deforestation in the United States]] and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="Rudel"&gt;Rudel, T.K., R. Defries, G.P. Asner, W.F. Laurance. "Changing Drivers Deforestation and New Opportunities for Conservation". Conservation Biology. 2009. 23:1396-1405.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with manipulation of land to suit human needs, natural water resources such as rivers and streams are also modified in urban establishments. Modification can come in the form of dams, artificial canals, and even the reversal of rivers. Reversing the flow of the Chicago River is a major example of urban environmental modification.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt; Urban areas in natural desert settings often bring in water from far areas to maintain the human population and will likely have effects on the local desert climate.&lt;ref name="Schochat" /&gt; Modification of aquatic systems in urban areas also results in decreased stream diversity and increased pollution.&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;Paul, M.J. and J.L. Meyer. Streams in the urban landscape. Annual Review of Ecology and Ssystematic. 2001. 32: 333-365.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade, shipping, and spread of invasive species ===
[[File:Clyde shipping.jpg|thumb|right|A ship navigates through the Firth of Clyde in Scotland, potentially carrying invasive species.]]
[[File:Kudzu on trees in Atlanta, Georgia.jpg|thumb|left|Invasive [[kudzu]] vines growing on trees in Atlanta, Georgia, USA]]

Both local shipping and long-distance trade are required to meet the resource demands important in maintaining urban areas. [[Carbon dioxide]] emissions from the transport of goods also contribute to accumulating greenhouse gases and nutrient deposits in the soil and air of urban environments.&lt;ref name="grim2008"&gt;Grimm, N.B., S.H. Faeth, N. E. Golubiewski, C.L. Redman, J. Wu., X. Bai, and J.M. Briggs. 2008. Global change and ecology of cities. Science 319:756-760.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, shipping facilitates the unintentional spread of living organisms, and introduces them to environments that they would not naturally inhabit. Introduced or [[alien species]] are populations of organisms living in a range in which they did not naturally evolve due to intentional or inadvertent human activity. Increased transportation between urban centers furthers the incidental movement of animal and plant species. Alien species often have no natural predators and pose a substantial threat to the dynamics of existing ecological populations in the new environment where they are introduced. Such invasive species are numerous and include [[house sparrow]]s, [[ring-necked pheasant]]s, [[European starling]]s, [[brown rat]]s, [[Asian carp]], [[American bullfrog]]s, [[emerald ash borer]], [[kudzu]] vines, and [[zebra mussels]] among numerous others, most notably domesticated animals.&lt;ref name="Ewel"&gt;Ewel, J.J., D.J. O'Dowd, J. Bergelson, C.C. Daehler, and C.M. D'Antonio, L. D. Gomez, and D. R. Gordon, R.J. Hobbs, A. Holt, K.R. Hopper, C.E. Hughes, M. LaHart, R.R.B. Leakey, W.G. Lee, L.L. Loope, D.H., Lorence, S.M. Louda, A.E. Lugo, P.B. McEvoy, D.M. Richardson, and P.M. Vitousek. Deliberate Introductions of Species: Research Needs. Bioscience. 1999. 49(8): 619-630.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colautti"&gt;Colautti, R.I. and H.J. MacIsaac. "A neutral terminology to define 'invasive' species". Diversity Distrib. 2004. 10:135-141.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, it has been found that removing Lantana (''[[Lantana camara|L. camara]],'' an alien species) from urban greenspaces can surprisingly have negative impacts on bird diversity locally, as it provides refugia for species like the superb fairy (Malurus cyaneus) and silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), in the absence of native plant equivalents . Although, there seems to be a density threshold in which too much Lantana (thus homogeneity in vegetation cover) can lead to a decrease in bird species richness or abundance .

=== Human effects on biogeochemical pathways ===

Urbanization results in a large demand for chemical use by industry, construction, agriculture, and energy providing services. Such demands have a substantial impact on [[biogeochemical cycles]], resulting in phenomena such as [[acid rain]], [[eutrophication]], and [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="grim2008"/&gt; Furthermore, natural biogeochemical cycles in the urban environment can be impeded due to impermeable surfaces that prevent nutrients from returning to the soil, water, and atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Kaye"&gt;Kaye, J.P., P.M. Groffman, N.B. Grimm, L.A. Baker, and R.V. Pouyat. A distinct urban biogeochemistry? Trends Ecol Evol. 2006. 21(4): 192-199.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carbon cycle-cute diagram.svg|thumb|right|Graphical representation of the carbon cycle.]]

Demand for fertilizers to meet agricultural needs exerted by expanding urban centers can alter chemical composition of soil. Such effects often result in abnormally high concentrations of compounds including sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen, and heavy metals. In addition, nitrogen and phosphorus used in fertilizers have caused severe problems in the form of agricultural runoff, which alters the concentration of these compounds in local rivers and streams, often resulting in adverse effects on native species.&lt;ref name="Roach"&gt;Roach, W.J., and N.B. Grimm. Nutrient variation in an urban lake chain and its consequences for phytoplankton production. J Environ Qual. 2009. 38(4): 1429-1440.&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known effect of agricultural runoff is the phenomenon of eutrophication. When the fertilizer chemicals from agricultural runoff reach the ocean, an [[algal bloom]] results, then rapidly dies off.&lt;ref name="Roach" /&gt; The dead algae biomass is decomposed by bacteria that also consume large quantities of oxygen, which they obtain from the water, creating a "dead zone" without oxygen for fish or other organisms. A classic example is the dead zone in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] due to agricultural runoff into the [[Mississippi River]].

Just as pollutants and alterations in the biogeochemical cycle alter river and ocean ecosystems, they exert likewise effects in the air. Smog stems from the accumulation of chemicals and pollution and often manifests in urban settings, which has a great impact on local plants and animals. Because urban centers are often considered point sources for pollution, unsurprisingly local plants have adapted to withstand such conditions.&lt;ref name="grim2008"/&gt;

== Urban effects on climate ==

Urban environments and outlying areas have been found to exhibit unique local temperatures, [[precipitation]], and other characteristic activity due to a variety of factors such as pollution and altered geochemical cycles. Some examples of the urban effects on climate are [[urban heat island]], [[oasis effect]], [[greenhouse gases]], and [[acid rain]]. This further stirs the debate as to whether urban areas should be considered a unique [[biome]]. Despite common trends among all urban centers, the surrounding local environment heavily influences much of the climate. One such example of regional differences can be seen through the urban heat island and oasis effect.&lt;ref name="brazel"/&gt;

=== Urban heat island effect ===
[[File:HeatIsland Kanto en.png|thumb|right|Graphical representation of the rising temperature in Kanto, Japan due to urban heat island.]]

The [[urban heat island]] is a phenomenon in which central regions of urban centers exhibit higher mean temperatures than surrounding urban areas.&lt;ref name="bornstein2000"&gt;Bornstein, R. and Q. Lin. Urban heat islands and summertime convective thunderstorms in Atlanta: three case studies. Atmospheric Environment. 2000. 34: 507-516.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this effect can be attributed to low city [[albedo]], the reflecting power of a surface, and the increased surface area of buildings to absorb solar radiation.&lt;ref name="brazel"/&gt; Concrete, cement, and metal surfaces in urban areas tend to absorb heat energy rather than reflect it, contributing to higher urban temperatures. Brazel et al.&lt;ref name="brazel"/&gt; found that the urban heat island effect demonstrates a positive correlation with population density in the city of Baltimore. The heat island effect has corresponding ecological consequences on resident species.&lt;ref name="grim2008"/&gt; However, this effect has only been seen in temperate climates.

=== Greenhouse gases ===

Greenhouse gas emissions include those of carbon dioxide and methane from the combustion of [[fossil fuels]] to supply energy needed by vast urban metropolises. Other greenhouse gases include water vapor, and [[nitrous oxide]]. Increases in [[greenhouse gases]] due to urban transport, construction, industry and other demands have been correlated strongly with increase in temperature. Sources of methane are agricultural dairy cows &lt;ref name="Benchaar"&gt;Benchaar, C., J. Rivest, C. Pomar, and J. Chiquette. Prediction of methane production from dairy cows using existing mechanistic models and regression equations. Journal of Animal Science. 1998. 76(2): 617-627.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moe P"&gt;Moe, P.W. and H.F. Tyrrell. Methane Production in Dairy Cows. Journal of Dairy Science. 1979. 62(10): 1583-1586.&lt;/ref&gt; and landfills.&lt;ref name="Daley"&gt;Daley, E.J., I.J. Wright, and R.E. Spitzka. Methane Production from Landfills: An introduction. American Chemical Society. 1981. 144(14): 279-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acid rain and pollution ===
[[File:AlfedPalmersmokestacks.jpg|thumb|right|Smokestacks from a wartime production plant releasing pollutants into the atmosphere.]]

Processes related to urban areas result in the emission of numerous pollutants, which change corresponding [[nutrient cycle]]s of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and other elements.&lt;ref name="Lohse"&gt;Lohse, K.A., D. Hope, R. Sponseller, J.O. Allen, and N.B. Grimm. Atmospheric deposition of carbon and nutrients across an arid metropolitan area. Sci Total Environ. 2008. 402(1):95-105.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems in and around the urban center are especially influenced by these point sources of pollution. High [[sulfur dioxide]] concentrations resulting from the industrial demands of urbanization cause [[acid rain|rainwater to become more acidic]].&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;Chen, J. Rapid urbanization in China: A real challenge to soil protection and food security. CATENA. 2007. 69(1): 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;Singh, A. and M. Agrawal. Acid rain and its ecological consequences. J Environ Biol. 2008. 29(1): 15-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an effect has been found to have a significant influence on locally affected populations, especially in aquatic environments.&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt; Wastes from urban centers, especially large urban centers in developed nations, can drive biogeochemical cycles on a global scale.&lt;ref name="grim2008"/&gt;

===Urban environment as an anthropogenic biome ===

The urban environment has been classified as an [[anthropogenic biome]],&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;Ellis, E.C. and N. Ramankutty. Putting people in the map: anthropogenic biomes of the world. Front Ecol Environ. 2008. 6(8): 439-447.&lt;/ref&gt; which is characterized by the predominance of certain species and climate trends such as urban heat island across many urban areas.&lt;ref name="Niemela" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forman" /&gt; Examples of species characteristic of many urban environments include, cats, dogs, mosquitoes, rats, flies, and pigeons, which are all generalists.&lt;ref name="Wilby"&gt;Wilby, R.L. and G.L.W. Perry. Climate change, biodiversity and the urban environment: a critical review based on London, UK. Physical Geography. 2006. 30(1): 73-98.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these are dependent on human activity and have adapted accordingly to the niche created by urban centers.

== Biodiversity and urbanization ==

Research thus far indicates that, on a small scale, urbanization often increases the [[biodiversity]] of non-native species while reducing that of native species. This normally results in an overall reduction in [[species richness]] and increase in total biomass and species abundance. Urbanization also reduces diversity on a large scale.&lt;ref name="McKinney"&gt;McKinney, M.L. (2006). Urbanization as a major cause of biotic homogenization. Biol. Cons. 127: 247–260.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Urban stream syndrome]] is a consistently observed trait of urbanization characterized by high nutrient and contaminant concentration, altered stream morphology, increased dominance of dominant species, and [[loss of biodiversity|decreased biodiversity]]&lt;ref name="Paul" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;Walsh, C.J., A.H. Roy, J.W. Feminella, P.D. Cottingham, P.M. Groffman, and R.P. Morgan II. The urban stream syndrome: current knowledge and the search for a cure. J.N. Am. Benthol. Soc. 2005. 24(3):706-723.&lt;/ref&gt; The two primary causes of urban stream syndrome are [[storm water runoff]] and [[wastewater treatment]] plant effluent.&lt;ref name="grim2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Walsh" /&gt;

=== Changes in diversity ===

Diversity is normally reduced at intermediate-low levels of urbanization but is always reduced at high levels of urbanization. These effects have been observed in vertebrates and invertebrates while plant species tend to increase with intermediate-low levels of urbanization&lt;ref name="McKinney2"&gt;McKinney M.L. (2008). Effects of urbanization on species richness: a review of plants and animals. Urb Ecos. 11: 161-176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marzluff"&gt;Marzluff J.M. (2001). Worldwide urbanization and its effects on birds. In: Marzluff J.M., Bowman R. and Donnelly R. (eds) Avian ecology in an urbanizing world. Kluwer, Norwell, Massachusetts: 19-47.&lt;/ref&gt; but these general trends do not apply to all organisms within those groups. For example, McKinney’s (2006)&lt;ref name="McKinney2"/&gt; review did not include the effects of urbanization on fishes and of the 58 studies on invertebrates, 52 included insects while only 10 included spiders. There is also a geographical bias as most of the studies either took place in North America or Europe.

The effects of urbanization also depend on the type and range of resources used by the organism.&lt;ref name="McKinney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Devictor"&gt;Devictor V., Julliard R., Jiguet F. (2008). Distribution of specialist and generalist species along spatial gradients of habitat disturbance and fragmentation. Oikos: doi: 10.1111/j.2008.0030-1299.16215.x.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimm2"&gt;Grimm N.B., Faeth S.H., Golubiewski N.E., Redman C.L., Wu J., Bai X. and Briggs J.M. (2008). Global change and the ecology of cities. Science 319: 10.1126/science.1150195.&lt;/ref&gt; Generalist species, those that use a wide range of resources and can thrive under a large range of living conditions, are likely survive in uniform environments. [[Specialist species]], those that use a narrow range of resources and can only cope with a narrow range of living conditions, are unlikely to cope with uniform environments.&lt;ref name="Devictor"/&gt; There will likely be a variable effect on these two groups of organisms as urbanization alters habitat uniformity.&lt;ref name="McKinney2"/&gt;

=== Cause of diversity change ===

The urban environment can decrease diversity through [[Habitat destruction|habitat removal]] and [[species homogenization]] - the increasing similarity between two previously distinct biological communities. [[Habitat degradation]] and [[habitat fragmentation]]&lt;ref name="Grimm2"/&gt; reduces the amount of suitable habitat by urban development and separates suitable patches by inhospitable terrain such as [[road]]s, neighborhoods, and open parks.&lt;ref name="Reed2"&gt;Reed, D.H. and G.R. Hobbs. The relationship between population size and temporal variability in population size. Anim Conserv. 2004. 7:1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this replacement of suitable habitat with unsuitable habitat will result in [[extinction]]s of native species, some shelter may be artificially created and promote the survival of non-native species (e.g. [[house sparrow]] and [[house mice]] nests).&lt;ref name="McKinney"/&gt; Urbanization promotes species homogenization through the extinction of native [[endemic species]] and the introduction of non-native species that already have a widespread abundance.&lt;ref name="McKinney"/&gt; Changes to the habitat may promote both the extinction of native endemic species and the introduction of non-native species.&lt;ref name="Rahel"&gt;Rahel F.J. (2002). Homogenization of freshwater faunas. Annual Review of Eco. Syst. 33: 291–315.&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of habitat change will likely be similar in all urban environments as urban environments are all built to cater to the needs of humans.&lt;ref name="McKinney"/&gt;

The urban environment can also increase diversity in a number of ways. Many foreign organisms are introduced and dispersed naturally or artificially in urban areas. Artificial introductions may be intentional, where organisms have some form of human use, or accidental, where organisms attach themselves to [[transportation]] vehicles.&lt;ref name="McKinney"/&gt; Humans provide food sources (e.g. [[birdfeeder]] seeds, trash, garden [[compost]])&lt;ref name="McKinney2"/&gt; and reduce the numbers of large natural [[predator]]s in urban environments,&lt;ref name="Grimm2"/&gt; allowing large populations to be supported where food and predation would normally limit the population size. There are a variety of different habitats available within the urban environment as a result of differences in land use&lt;ref name="McKinney2"/&gt; allowing for more species to be supported than by more uniform habitats.

== Civil engineering and sustainability ==

Cities should be planned and constructed in such a way that minimizes the urban effects on the surrounding environment (urban heat island, precipitation, etc.) as well as optimizing ecological activity. For example, increasing the [[albedo]], or reflective power, of surfaces in urban areas, can minimize urban heat island,&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"&gt;Rosenfeld, A.H., J.J. Romm, H. Akbari, and A.C. Lloyd. Painting the town White — and Green. Technology Review. 1997. 52(8). [A version of this article is also available at: &lt;http://EETD.LBL.gov/HeatIsland/PUBS/PAINTING/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714173907/http://eetd.lbl.gov/HeatIsland/PUBS/PAINTING/ |date=2007-07-14 }}&gt; ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld2"&gt;Rosenfeld, A. H., H. Akbari, J. J. Romm, and M. Pomerantz. Cool Communities: Strategies for Heat Island Mitigation and Smog Reduction. Energy and Buildings. 1998. 28: 51-62.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a lower magnitude of the urban heat island effect in urban areas. By minimizing these abnormal temperature trends and others, ecological activity would likely be improved in the urban setting.&lt;ref name="Niemela" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Felson"&gt;Felson, A.J. and S.T.A. Pickett. Designed experiments: new approaches to studying urban ecosystems. Front Ecol. Environ. 2005. 3(10): 549-556.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Need for remediation ===

Urbanization has indeed had a profound effect on the environment, on both local and global scales. Difficulties in actively constructing [[habitat corridor]] and returning biogeochemical cycles to normal raise the question as to whether such goals are feasible. However, some groups are working to return areas of land affected by the urban landscape to a more natural state.&lt;ref name="Blum"&gt;Blum, A. The Long View: Urban Remediation through Landscape and Architecture. Metropolis Mag. 2008. 92-95&lt;/ref&gt; This includes using landscape architecture to model natural systems and restore rivers to pre-urban states.&lt;ref name="Blum" /&gt;

=== Sustainability ===
[[File:Biogas.jpg|thumb|right|Pipes carrying biogas produced by anaerobic digestion or fermentation of biodegradable materials as a form of carbon sequestration.]]

With the ever-increasing [[resource demand|demands for resources]] necessitated by urbanization, recent campaigns to move toward sustainable energy and [[resource consumption]], such as [[LEED certification]] of buildings, [[Energy Star]] certified appliances, and [[zero emission]] vehicles, have gained momentum. Sustainability reflects techniques and consumption ensuring reasonably low resource use as a component of urban ecology. Techniques such as carbon recapture may also be used to [[Carbon Sequestration|sequester]] carbon compounds produced in urban centers rather continually emitting more of the [[greenhouse gas]].&lt;ref name="Nowak"&gt;Nowak, D.J., and D.E. Crane. Carbon Storage and Sequestration By Urban Trees In the USA. Environmental Pollution. 2002. 116: 381–389.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==

Urbanization results in a series of both local and far-reaching effects on [[biodiversity]], [[biogeochemical cycle]]s, [[hydrology]], and [[climate]], among many other stresses. Many of these effects are not fully understood, as urban ecology has only recently emerged as a scientific discipline and much more research remains to be done. Research on cities outside the US and Europe remains limited. Observations on the impact of urbanization on biodiversity and species interactions are consistent across many studies but definitive mechanisms have yet to be established. Urban ecology constitutes an important and highly relevant subfield of ecology, and further study must be pursued to more fully understand the effects of human urban areas on the environment.

'''Vélizy – Villacoublay Air Base''' ({{lang-fr|Base aérienne 107 Vélizy-Villacoublay}}) {{airport codes||LFPV}} is a [[French Air Force]] ({{lang-fr|'''Armée de l'Air'''}} (ALA) base.  The base is located approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}} southeast of [[Vélizy-Villacoublay]]; about {{convert|8|mi|km}} southwest of [[Paris]].

==Units==
The base is the home station for the following units:
*[[Escadron de transport, d'entrainement et de calibration]] 00.065 (ETEC 65 - VIP transport) 
*Staffs of the northern area, the command of the air force of projection (COFOG) and of the command air of the monitoring systems, of information and communications (CASSIC).
* Helicopter Squadron 03/067
* Commando Parachute Unit N20

* 6 [[SOCATA TBM|TBM700]]

==History==
Villacoublay Air Base was built prior to [[World War II]] as a [[French Air Force]] facility.

===German use during World War II===
Seized by the Germans in June 1940 during the [[Battle of France]], Villacoublay was used as a [[Luftwaffe]] military airfield during the occupation.  Known units assigned (all from Luftflotte 3, Fliegerkorps IV):&lt;ref name="ren1"&gt;[http://www.ww2.dk  The Luftwaffe, 1933-45]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rlm.at/cont/archiv02_e.htm Identification codes of units of the Luftwaffe 1939 - 1945]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Kampfgeschwader 55]] (KG 55)	21 June 1940 – 16 June 1941  [[Heinkel He 111]]P/H (Fusalage Code: G1+)
* [[Kampfgeschwader 27]] (KG 27)	Jun-July 1940	[[Heinkel He 111]]P  (Fusalage Code: 1G+)
* Aufklärungsgruppe 14 (AFG 14)	Nov 1940-May 1941 [[Junkers Ju 88]]
* [[Jagdfliegerschule]] 5  (JFS 5)	Jun 1941-24 February 1943 	[[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]
* Jagdgeschwader 105 (JG 105) 	25 February-31 August 1943  	[[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]
* [[Jagdgeschwader 54]] (JG 54)	7 June-5 September 1944  [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]A

KG 55 and KG 27 took part in the  [[Battle of Britain]]; AFG 14 was a photoreconnaissance organization;  JFS 5 was a training unit for Bf 109 pilots; JG 105 and JG 54 were day interceptor units against [[Eighth Air Force]] heavy bombers.

It was attacked on several occasions by heavy bombers of both the [[United States Army Air Force]] [[Eighth Air Force|Eighth]] and [[Fifteenth Air Force]]s during 1943 and early 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/209/390.xml USAFHRA Document 00209390]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/247/583.xml USAFHRA Document 00247583]&lt;/ref&gt;  Largely due to its use as a base for Bf 109 and Fw 190 interceptors, Villacoublay was attacked by USAAF [[Ninth Air Force]] [[B-26 Marauder]] medium bombers and [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s mostly with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps when [[Eighth Air Force]] heavy bombers ([[B-17]]s, [[B-24]]s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers.   Also the [[P-51 Mustang]] fighter-escort groups of [[Eighth Air Force]] would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.&lt;ref&gt;Derived from information in USAAF Film "Target For Today" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4)&lt;/ref&gt;

===American use===
It was liberated by Allied ground forces about 27 August 1944 during the Northern France Campaign. Almost immediately, the USAAF IX Engineer Command [http://ixengineercommand.com/units/818th.php 818th  Engineer Aviation Battalion] began clearing the base of mines and destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft; filling bomb craters in the runway with rubble and an asphalt patch along with repairing operational facilities for use by American aircraft. Subsequently, Villacoublay became a USAAF [[Ninth Air Force]] combat airfield, designated as "A-42" about 30 August, only a few days after its capture from German forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ixengineercommand.com/airfields/general.php IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields General Construction Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately, the [[48th Fighter Group]] moved into the repaired air base, flying [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s from 29 August until 15 September 1944.    The combat unit moved east along with the advancing Allied forces and Villacoublay became a supply and maintenance base for combat aircraft, becoming the home of the 370th Air Service Group and several Air Materiel squadrons from [[Air Technical Service Command]].  It was also given the designation of '''AAF-180'''.   In addition, numerous [[C-47 Skytrain]] squadrons moved in and out, supporting airborne operations, including [[Operation Varsity]], and Allied airborne crossing of the Rhine in March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. {{ISBN|0-89201-092-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Zeller of Zeller-Hoff-Zeller was stationed there from 1945 to 1946 during World War 2.

After the war ended, Villacoublay remained under American control, designated as '''AAF Station Villacoublay'''.  It was assigned to the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] as a transport base by the [[C-47 Skytrain]]-equipped [[314th Operations Group|314th Troop Carrier Group]].   It remained under USAFE control until 31 August 1946 when it was returned to the French Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/240/855.xml USAFHRA Document 00240855]&lt;/ref&gt;

===From 1945===
The base has been totally rebuilt since with war.  The prewar/wartime runway, 11/29 is now closed and a new east-west 6000' (1800m) runway 09/27 laid down along with expanded aircraft parking areas and multiple hangars as part of an operational [[NATO]] air base.
