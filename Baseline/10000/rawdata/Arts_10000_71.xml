'''''After the Deluge''''', also known as '''''The Forty-First Day''''',{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=233}} is a [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] [[oil painting]] by English artist [[George Frederic Watts]], first exhibited as '''''The Sun''''' in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows a scene from the story of [[Genesis flood narrative|Noah's Flood]], in which after 40 days of rain [[Noah]] opens the window of [[Noah's Ark|his Ark]] to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting takes the form of a stylised [[seascape]], dominated by a bright [[sunburst]] breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in ''The Genius of Greek Poetry'' in 1878, ''After the Deluge'' took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.

The unfinished painting was exhibited in [[Whitechapel]] in 1886, under the intentionally simplified title of ''The Sun''. Watts worked on the painting for a further five years, and the completed version was exhibited for the first time at the [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]] in 1891. Between 1902 and 1906 the painting was exhibited around the United Kingdom, and it is now in the collection of the [[Watts Gallery]] in [[Compton, Guildford|Compton]], Surrey. As Watts did not include ''After the Deluge'' in his gift to the nation of what he considered his most significant works, it is not among his better-known paintings. However, it was greatly admired by many of Watts's fellow artists, and has been cited as an influence on numerous other painters who worked in the two decades following its initial exhibition.

==Background==
[[File:George Frederic Watts by George Frederic Watts.jpg|right|thumb|upright|George Frederic Watts, c.&amp;nbsp;1879|alt=elderly bearded man]]
[[George Frederic Watts]] was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=20}} His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=20}} Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=21}} At the age of 18 he gained admission to the [[Royal Academy schools]], although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=22}} From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=23}}

In 1843 he travelled to Italy where he remained for four years.{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}} On his return to London he suffered from [[melancholia]], and painted many notably gloomy works.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=29}} His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=33}} His portraits were extremely highly regarded,{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=33}} and in 1867 he was elected to the [[Royal Academy]], at the time the highest honour available to an artist,{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}}{{efn-ua|In Watts's time, honours such as knighthoods were only bestowed on presidents of major institutions, not otherwise on even the most well respected artists.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=135}} In 1885 serious consideration was given to raising Watts to the peerage; had this happened, he would have been the first artist thus honoured.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=69}} In the same year, he refused the offer of a [[baronetcy]].{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}}}} although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=40}} From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects;{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}} by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=xi}} In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at [[Little Holland House]], which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=42}}

[[File:Assistants and George Frederic Watts - Chaos - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|''Chaos'' by George Frederic Watts (exhibited 1882).{{efn-ua|''Chaos'' was based on an 1845 watercolour by Watts of the view of the [[Apuan Alps]] at [[Carrara]] from the top of the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]].{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=19}}{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=31}} The right-hand section of ''Chaos'', depicting resting giants and dancing women, was originally a separate painting called ''The Titans'' (exhibited 1875).{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=190}}}}|alt=Sun rising over a stormy sea, with multiple human figures in the foreground]]
''After the Deluge'' depicts a scene from the story of [[Genesis flood narrative|Noah's Flood]], in which [[Noah]] opens the window of [[Noah's Ark|the Ark]] to see that after forty days the rain has ended, but that the floodwaters have not yet subsided.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}} Although his father's strict [[evangelical Christianity]] had instilled in Watts a strong dislike of organised religion, he had a deep knowledge of the Bible,{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=20}} and Noah and the Flood were both themes he regularly depicted throughout his career.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}} 

Watts had a strong belief in the idea that modern society was prioritising wealth over social values, and that this attitude, which he described as "the hypocritical veiling of the daily sacrifice made to this deity",{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}} was leading to the decline of society.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=230}} Hilary Underwood of the [[University of Surrey]] writes that Watts likely painted so many works on the theme of Noah as he saw modern parallels with the notion of the cleaning of a degenerate society while preserving those who still adhered to moral standards.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}} Watts chose to depict the moment at which the sun became visible for the first time, after 40 days obscured by clouds.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}
{{Quote|text=And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.|source={{Bibleverse|Genesis|8:5–6|KJV}}}}

==Composition==
[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner - The Morning after the Deluge - WGA23180.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory) – The Morning after the Deluge – Moses Writing the Book of Genesis|Light and Colour]]'' by [[J. M. W. Turner]], 1843|alt=hazy circle containing multiple human figures]]
Watts illustrated the scene with a highly stylised [[seascape]]. Above the sea is a bright [[sunburst]], with the light of the sun illuminating the surrounding clouds and bright rays projecting beyond the edges of the canvas.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}
Watts's composition echoes [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s 1843 treatment of the same topic, ''[[Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory) – The Morning after the Deluge – Moses Writing the Book of Genesis|Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory)—The Morning after the Deluge—Moses Writing the Book of Genesis]]'', in primarily depicting a circle of bright light. However, Turner's painting depicts recognisable human figures, and no work by Turner ever came as close to pure [[abstract art]] as Watts's composition.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}}

In this stage of his career Watts regularly painted images linking awe-inspiring natural events and the will of God.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}} His focus on the sun reflects his longstanding interest in it as a divine symbol; ''The Sacrifice of Noah'', painted {{circa}} 1865, showed Noah sacrificing to the sun in thanks for his family's salvation.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}} This interest in the sun possibly came from Watts's acquaintance [[Max Müller]], who had written extensively on [[solar theory|solar theories of mythology]] (the belief that the religions of Europe, the Middle East and southern Asia were all ultimately derived from [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] worship of the sun).{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}} Writing after Watts's death, his widow [[Mary Seton Watts]] wrote that:
{{quote|text=A visitor looking at ''After the Deluge'' remarked that into such a scheme of colour he felt it would not have been impossible to introduce the figure of the Creator. 'Ah no,' Mr Watts replied. 'But that is exactly what I could wish to make those who look at the picture conceive for themselves. The hand of the Creator moving by light and by heat to re-create. I have not tried to paint a portrait of the sun—such a thing is unpaintable—but I wanted to impress you with the idea of its enormous power.'|source=Mary Seton Watts, writing {{circa}} 1910.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}}}

[[File:Watts – The Genius of Greek Poetry.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''The Genius of Greek Poetry'' by George Frederic Watts, 1878|alt=naked man sitting on a rock, in front of some more naked people and lots of water]]
Watts had previously depicted an orange sun above a flat sea in his 1878 work ''The Genius of Greek Poetry'',{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=198}}{{efn-ua|Watts began work on ''The Genius of Greek Poetry'' in 1856 following a visit to [[Halicarnassus]], but did not complete it until 1878.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=196}}}} but the theme and composition of ''After the Deluge'' was radically different.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}} ''The Genius of Greek Poetry'' was intended to evoke [[pantheism]], with figures representing the forces of nature in human form working and playing, while being watched by the large central figure of the Genius.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=198}} ''After the Deluge'' was explicitly intended as a [[monotheistic]] image, evoking both the magnificence and the redemptive mercy of a single all-powerful God engaging in the act of creation.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}} 

''After the Deluge'' was exhibited in unfinished form in 1886 as ''The Sun'' at [[St Jude's Church, Whitechapel]];{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}}{{efn-ua|Samuel and Henrietta Barnett considered themselves 'missionaries of civilisation',{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=24}} and the exhibitions they organised in Whitechapel were specifically aimed at the uneducated.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=23}} Watts often gave his works simplified titles when exhibiting them at these exhibitions.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}}} [[Samuel Barnett (reformer)|Samuel Barnett]], vicar of St Jude's, organised annual art exhibitions in east London in an effort to bring beauty into the lives of the poor;{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=23}} he had a close relationship with Watts, and regularly borrowed his works to display them to local residents.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=23}}{{efn-ua|Barnett decorated the front of St Jude's with a large mosaic of Watts's ''Time, Death and Judgement.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|pp=23–24}}}} Following this exhibition Watts continued to work on the painting for a further five years.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}

[[Image:Giuseppe Pelizza - Il Sole.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=Bright sun rising over a landscape|''The Rising Sun'' by [[Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo]], 1904]]
The completed version of ''After the Deluge'' was exhibited at the [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]] in 1891.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=44}} On the occasion of its 1891 exhibition and at a later exhibition in 1897, also at the New Gallery, it was accompanied by an explanatory note (thought to have been written by Watts) explaining the image:{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=234}}

Although Watts painted landscapes throughout his life, he did not consider such paintings to be major works, and when between 1886 and 1902 he donated what he felt to be his 23 most significant non-portrait works to the nation for public display, no landscape paintings were included.{{sfn|Bills|2011|p=44}}{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|pp=12–13}}{{efn-ua|From 1883 onwards, Watts donated his significant portrait paintings to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]].{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=42}} In 1886, he donated what he felt at the time were his nine most significant paintings to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]] (now the Victoria and Albert Museum).{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=22}} The latter nine paintings along with nine others were given to the newly formed [[National Gallery of British Art]] (later the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain) on its formation in 1897, with five more works later donated by Watts during his lifetime.{{sfn|Bills|2011|p=44}} The 23 works Watts donated to the Tate Gallery were ''[[The All Pervading]]'', ''Chaos'', ''Clytie'', ''The Court of Death'', ''Death Crowning Innocence'', ''Dray Horses'', ''Dweller in the Basement'', ''Eve Repentant'', ''Eve Tempted'', ''Faith'', ''For He Had Great Possessions'', ''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'', ''Jonah'', ''Love and Death'', ''Love and Life'', ''Love Triumphant'', ''[[Mammon (painting)|Mammon]]'', ''The Messenger'', ''The Minotaur'', ''She Shall Be Called Woman'', ''Sic Transit'', ''Spirit of Christianity'' and ''Time, Death and Judgement''.{{sfn|Bills|2011|p=44}}}} As a consequence of its omission from these gifts to the nation, ''After the Deluge'' is not among his better-known works, although it was greatly admired by many of Watts's fellow artists.{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=13}} [[Walter Bayes]] wrote in 1907 that ''After the Deluge'' was "the sort of landscape that we connect with the name of Mr Watts, a landscape from which all that is coarse and material has been eliminated, and which offers a residuum that is a kind of sublimation of all the most poetic elements in nature".{{sfn|Bayes|1907|p=xi}} It has been cited as an influence on many works painted in the two decades following its completion, including paintings of the sun by [[Maurice Chabas]], [[Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo]] and [[Edvard Munch]].{{sfn|Staley|Underwood|2006|p=13}}  ''After the Deluge'' remains in the collection of the Watts Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/after-the-deluge-13387|title=After the Deluge|publisher=Art UK|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Arabic cinema is dominated by [[Cinema of Egypt|Egyptian movies]]. Three quarters of all Arab movies are produced in Egypt.

There is increased interest in films originating in the Arab world. For example, films from [[Algeria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Morocco]], the [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Syria]] and [[Tunisia]] are making wider and more frequent rounds than ever before in local film festivals and repertoire theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2501/is_1-2_27/ai_n15694703|title=FindArticles.com {{!}} CBSi|website=findarticles.com|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
There are numerous film festivals that have historically been and are held in various parts of the Arab world to both honor and showcase films from the Arab regions, as well as international standouts.

Since 1976, [[Cairo]] has held the annual [[Cairo International Film Festival]], which has been accredited by the [[International Federation of Film Producers Associations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukhotmovies.com/film-festivals/cairo-film-festival/information.html Cairo Film Festival information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208183113/http://www.ukhotmovies.com/film-festivals/cairo-film-festival/information.html |date=2011-12-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also another festival held in [[Alexandria]]. Of the more than 4,000 short- and feature-length films made in Arabic-speaking countries since 1908, more than three-quarters were Egyptian.

In 1987, the inaugural Mogadishu Pan-African and Arab Film Symposium (Mogpaafis) was held, bringing together an array of prominent filmmakers and movie experts from across the globe, including other parts of Northeast Africa and the Arab world, as well as [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. Held annually in [[Mogadishu]], the capital of [[Somalia]], the film festival was organized by the [[Somali Film Agency]], the nation's film regulatory body.&lt;ref name="CEC"&gt;Commission of the European Communities, ''The Courier'', Issue 101, (Commission of the European Communities: 1987), p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Film Festival of Marrakech]] (FIFM) is an international [[film festival]] held annually in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]]. Since its inaugural year in 2000, the FIFM has been one of the biggest events devoted to [[Cinema of Morocco|Moroccan cinema]]. It is also the site of the [[principal photography]] of many international productions. The festival's jury gathers international writers, actors and personalities, and endeavors to reward the best Moroccan and foreign [[Feature film|feature]] and [[short film]]s. The FIFM is chaired by [[Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco]].

[[File:Dubai-Filmfestival-2010.jpg|thumb|20m wide [[Inflatable movie screen|inflatable projection screen]] at the 2010 [[Dubai International Film Festival]].]]
The [[Dubai International Film Festival]] (DIFF) is an international [[film festival]] based in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. Launched in 2004, it aims to foster the growth of filmmaking in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="DIFFa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaifilmfest.com/index.php/en/about/intro/|title=Dubai International Film Festival|work=Dubai International Film Festival|access-date=2011-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525111646/http://www.dubaifilmfest.com/index.php/en/about/intro|archive-date=2011-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DIFF is held under the honorary Chairmanship of [[Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum]]. It is a not-for-profit cultural event, presented and organised by the [[Dubai Internet City|Dubai Technology, Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority]].

The DIFF presents cinematic excellence from around the world and offers a high-profile platform for aspiring home-grown talent. The Muhr Award for Excellence in Arab Cinema was launched in 2006, with the aim of recognizing Arab filmmakers both regionally and internationally. In 2008, the Muhr Awards for Excellence were expanded to include two separate competitions, the Arab Muhr Award, and the AsiaAfrica Muhr Award. It also introduced a new program segment dedicated exclusively to Animation.

The [[Abu Dhabi Film Festival]] (ADFF) is another key international film festival in the larger Arab region. Created in 2007, the ceremony is held annually in October in [[Abu Dhabi]], UAE by the [[Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage]] (ADACH), under the patronage of Sheikh Sultan Bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, Chairman of the ADACH. The ADFF aims to encourage and foster the growth of filmmaking in the [[Arab world]] by showcasing movies from the region alongside standout productions from prominent international filmmakers.&lt;ref name="Adff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abudhabifilmfestival.ae/en/about|title=About - Sanad Abu Dhabi Film Fund|work=Abu Dhabi Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first festival debuted with 152 movies and 186 screenings shown in five Abu Dhabi venues. A total of 76 feature films and 34 short films from over 35 countries competed for the Black Pearl Awards.

The [[Doha Tribeca Film Festival]] (DTFF) is an annual five-day [[film festival]] founded in 2009 to promote [[Arab]] and international film, and to develop a sustainable [[film industry]] in [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=412351&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16 Article in Gulf Times January 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128162702/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=412351&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16 |date=2011-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival is one of Qatar's largest entertainment events attracting over 50,000 guests in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dohafilminstitute.com/filmfestival/festival|title=About — Ajyal Youth Film Festival - Doha Film Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DTFF is the annual film festival of the [[Doha Film Institute]], an organisation founded by [[Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani|H.E. Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/MEDIA_179834.html|title=Qatar launches new film institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which implements, consolidates and oversees film initiatives in Qatar.

The 3rd annual DTFF is scheduled to take place from October 25–29, 2011 at Katara Cultural Village, [[Doha]]. Approximately 40 films will screen at the festival, within various themed sections, showcasing World and Middle Eastern Cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/32/18816/Arts--Culture/Film/El-Shouq-to-participate-in-Doha-Tribeca-Film-Festi.aspx|title=El Shouq to participate in Doha Tribeca Film Festival|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support initiatives==
In conjunction with the European Audiovisual Entrepreneurs (EAVE) professional training, networking and project development organization, the Dubai International Film Festival in 2010 also began offering to filmmakers the Interchange group of development and co-production workshops earmarked for directors, screenwriters and producers from the larger Arab region.&lt;ref name="DIFF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaifilmfest.com/index.php/en/dubai_film_market/film-forum/interchange/|title=Dubai International Film Festival|work=Dubai International Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Abu Dhabi Film Festival launched the SANAD development and post-production fund for cineastes from the Arab world. With the goal of encouraging independent and [[Auteur theory|auteur]]-based cinema, eligible filmmakers now have access to financial grants, screenwriting and pitch workshops, and personal meetings with industry mentors and experts.&lt;ref name="Afacadff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abudhabifilmfestival.ae/sites/default/files/press_releases/PR_AFACSANADLab_En.pdf |format=PDF |title=AFAC and Abu Dhabi Film Festival Partner to Support Arab Documentaries Through the SANAD FilmLab |website=abudhabifilmfestival.ae |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903044458/http://www.abudhabifilmfestival.ae/sites/default/files/press_releases/PR_AFACSANADLab_En.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was later imprisoned and eventually drafted into penal military service, where he was killed in action; Eckler was sent to a [[concentration camp]] where it is presumed she was killed.

==Biography==
August Landmesser was the only child of August Franz Landmesser and Wilhelmine Magdalene (née Schmidtpott). In 1931, hoping it would help him get a job, he joined the [[Nazi Party]]. In 1935, when he became engaged to Irma Eckler (a [[German Jews|Jewish]] woman), he was expelled from the party.&lt;ref name="Roux"&gt;{{cite book |last=Roux |first=François |date= 2013-06-06|title=Comprendre Hitler et les allemands |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YZDlPnzTWU4C&amp;pg=PT24&amp;q=%22august%20landmesser%22 |location=[[Paris, France]] |publisher=''[[Éditions Max Milo]]'' |isbn=9782315004614 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They registered to be married in Hamburg, but the [[Nuremberg Laws]] enacted a month later prevented it. On 29 October 1935, Landmesser and Eckler's first daughter, Ingrid, was born.&lt;ref name="Roux"/&gt;

A now-famous photograph, in which a man identified as Landmesser refuses to give the Nazi salute, was taken on 13 June 1936.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news |last=Flock |first=Elizabeth |date=7 February 2012 |title=August Landmesser, shipyard worker in Hamburg, refused to perform Nazi salute (photo) |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/august-landmesser-shipyard-worker-in-hamburg-refused-to-perform-nazi-salute-photo/2012/02/07/gIQA1ZzExQ_blog.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |publisher=[[Katharine Weymouth|Washington Post Media]] |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Landmesser and Eckler tried to flee to Denmark but were apprehended. She was again pregnant, and he was charged and found guilty in July 1937 of "[[Rassenschande|dishonoring the race]]" under Nazi racial laws. He argued that neither he nor Eckler knew that she was fully Jewish, and was acquitted on 27 May 1938 for lack of evidence, with the warning that a repeat offense would result in a multi-year prison sentence. The couple publicly continued their relationship, and on 15 July 1938 he was arrested again and sentenced to two and a half years in the [[Börgermoor]] [[concentration camp]].

Eckler was detained by the [[Gestapo]] and held at the prison [[Fuhlsbüttel]], where she gave birth to a second daughter, Irene.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt; From there she was sent to the [[Oranienburg concentration camp]], the [[Lichtenburg concentration camp]] for women, and then the women's concentration camp at [[Ravensbrück]]. A few letters came from Irma Eckler until January 1942. It is believed that she was taken to the [[Bernburg Euthanasia Centre]] in February 1942, where she was among the 14,000 killed; in the course of post-war documentation, in 1949 she was pronounced legally dead, with a date of 28 April 1942.

Meanwhile, Landmesser was discharged from prison on 19 January 1941.&lt;ref name="Roux"/&gt; He worked as a foreman for the [[haulage]] company Püst. The company had a branch at the Heinkel-Werke (factory) in [[Warnemünde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fasena.de/courage/english/10.htm |title=Father reported missing |first1=Amanda |last1=Straße |date= |website=Fasena.de |publisher=[[1&amp;1 Internet]] |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1944 he was drafted into a [[Strafbattalion|penal battalion]], the [[999th Light Afrika Division (Wehrmacht)|999th Fort Infantry Battalion]]. He was declared [[killed in action]], after being killed during fighting in [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] on 17 October 1944.&lt;ref name="Bartrop"&gt;{{cite book | title=Resisting the Holocaust: Upstanders, Partisans, and Survivors | last=Bartrop | first=Paul R. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXgiDAAAQBAJ | year=2016 | page=152 | publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] | location=| isbn=9781610698795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Eckler, he was legally declared dead in 1949.&lt;ref name="Bartrop"/&gt;

Their children were initially taken to the city orphanage. Ingrid was later allowed to live with her maternal grandmother while Irene went to the home of foster parents in 1941. Ingrid was also placed with foster parents after her grandmother's death in 1953.

The marriage of August Landmesser and Irma Eckler was recognized retroactively by the [[Senate of Hamburg]] in the summer of 1951, and in the autumn of that year Ingrid assumed the surname ''Landmesser''. Irene continued to use the surname ''Eckler''.

==Recognition==
In 1996, Irene Eckler published the book ''Die Vormundschaftsakte 1935–1958: Verfolgung einer Familie wegen "Rassenschande"'' (''The Guardianship Documents 1935–1958: Persecution of a Family for "Racial Disgrace"''). The book tells the story of her family, and includes a large number of original documents from the time in question, including letters from her mother and documents from state institutions.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;

A figure identified by Irene Eckler as August Landmesser is featured in a photograph taken on 13 June 1936, published on 22 March 1991 in ''[[Die Zeit]]''. It shows a large gathering of workers at the Blohm+Voss shipyard in Hamburg, for the launching of the navy training ship ''Horst Wessel''.  Almost everyone in the image has raised his arm in the Nazi salute, with the most obvious exception of a man toward the back of the crowd, who grimly stands with his arms crossed over his chest. Several others have also refrained from saluting, but are not so obviously defiant.

Whether the depicted man is Landmesser is not known with certainty. Another family claims the person in the photo is another metalworker at Blohm &amp; Voss, a man called Gustav Wegert.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Paul, Das Jahrhundert der Bilder 1900 bis 1949, Verlag Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht 2009, Seite 494 rechte Spalte Absatz 3), as quoted in [http://wegert-familie.de/home/English.html]. Quote: „In the meantime another Family from Hamburg has identified the man as a relative. It should be Gustav Wegert (1890-1959) who worked as a metalworker at Blohm &amp; Voss. As a believing Christian he generally refused the Nazi Salute. Despite his distance to the Nazi Regime Gustav Wegert did not get in the eye of the Nazi persecution administration. Portraits from Wegert and Landmesser prove in both cases great similarity with the worker on that picture. At this time it has to remain unsettled who the man in the picture is“.&lt;/ref&gt; The content and photos posted by relatives of Wegert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wegert-familie.de/home/English.html|title=1936 - Just one refused the Nazi salute|website=wegert-familie.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recent photographic enhancements make it more likely that the person in the photo refusing to perform the Nazi salute was Gustav Wegert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehistory.net/2014/10/26/german-non-saluter-myth/|title=The German Non-Saluter Myth - Beachcombing's Bizarre History Blog|date=26 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=January 2018}}

==History==
{{see also|Global spread of the printing press#Italy}}

Germans in [[Subiaco, Lazio|Subiaco]], [[Arnold Pannartz]] and [[Konrad Sweynheim]], in 1464 set up a printing press and produced "the earliest book printed in Italy,...a Latin grammar by [[Aelius Donatus|Donatus]]."{{sfn|Peckham|1940}} Printing technology spread in the 1460s to [[Rome]] and [[Venice]]; in the 1470s to places such as [[Bergamo]], [[Bologna]], [[Brescia]], [[Cremona]], [[Ferrara]], [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], [[Lucca]], [[Mantua]], [[Messina]], [[Milan]], [[Modena]], [[Naples]], [[Padua]], [[Palermo]], [[Parma]], [[Pavia]], [[Perugia]], [[Piacenza]], [[Reggio Calabria]], [[Treviso]], [[Turin]], [[Verona]], [[Vicenza]]; and in the 1480s to places such as [[L'Aquila]], [[Pisa]], [[Reggio Emilia]], [[Siena]], and [[Udine]].{{sfn|Proctor|1898}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://data.cerl.org/istc/_index/imprintplace |title= Index: Place of Publication |work=[[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]]: the International Database of 15th-century European Printing |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate= 3 December 2017 }}. (Searchable by town)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of [[Italian unification]] and the creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861, the Biblioteca Magliabechiana in Florence merged with the {{illm|Biblioteca Palatina Lorenese|it}}, and by 1885 became known as the [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze]] (National Central Library). The [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Roma]] formed in 1876. As official [[Legal_deposit#Italy|legal deposit]] libraries, both maintain copies of works published in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Two National Central Libraries of Florence and Rome |author= Franca Arduini |journal= [[Libraries &amp; Culture]] |volume=25 |jstor=25542277 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] named [[Turin]] the 2006 [[World Book Capital]].

[[Silver]] was important in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] society as it was the most precious metal right after [[gold]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cormack|first1=Robin|title=Byzantium Art|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-284211-4|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Byzantine silver''' was prized in both the secular and domestic realms. Aristocratic homes had silver dining ware, and in churches silver was used for crosses, liturgical vessels such as the [[paten]]s and [[chalice]]s required for every [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Silver was also used as a medium in pagan mythological scenes and objects such as the [[Sevso Treasure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Silver pieces, especially [[Household silver|silver]]ware, continued to be rendered in the classical style into the seventh century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
[[File:The_Antioch_Chalice,_first_half_of_6th_century,_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art.jpg|The [[Antioch Chalice]]. Created during the first half of the sixth century.  [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.|frame]]Silver items were also controlled stamped, sometimes up to five times on a single piece, many such pieces are dated between the fourth and eighth centuries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the reign of [[Heraclius]] (r. 610-41 AD), the production of silverware halts, which coincides with the State confiscating valuable metals to help replenish the treasury during the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Silver items began to regularly buried, such as the [[Kaper Koraon Treasure|Stuma Treasure]] of 56 objects found in Syria during 1908, dated between 540 and 640 and attributed to the village church of [[Sergius and Bacchus|St Sergios]] at Kaper Koraon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Sion Treasure from Lycia consists of 71 pieces with 30 pieces stamped between 550 and 565 AD &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; See [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine Coins]] for currency and monetary information.

== Bowls ==

[[File:Byzantine_-_Silver_Cup_-_Walters_57631.jpg|left|thumb|This bowl, which could have been used for hand washing or baptism.  [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore, Maryland.]]
During the nineteenth century two silver bowls were discovered in Estonia that date to the late fifth or early sixth century period of which the Byzantine Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] reigned 491-518 AD.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quast, Tamla|first1=Dieter, Ulle|title=Two Fifth Century Ad Byzantine Silver Bowls from Estonia|journal=Estonian Journal of Archeology|date=2010|volume=14.2|issue=December|pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The silver bowl deemed the “Kriimani” bowl, for the location in which it was found, has a rim of 15.5&amp;nbsp;cm with a height of 9&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Two beaded bands border the rim of the bowl. Silver analysis shows 93-95% Silver, 3.5-5% Copper, and traces of Gold and Platinum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The second bowl, referred to as the “Varnja Bowl,” was discovered in 1895 near the village of Varnja.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Varnja bowl also has two beaded bands that circle the rim, and it is also stamped similar to the Kriimani  bowl.

== Crosses ==

Crosses were also lavishly adorned with precious materials and biblical scenes during the Byzantine period. Scholars refer to a cross called “The Work of Mark,” due to the monks inscriptions on the cross.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hetherington|first1=Paul|title=The Work of Mark|journal=Apollo|date=2010|issue=March|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cross is dated at late tenth or early eleventh century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This cross is 47&amp;nbsp;cm high, 26&amp;nbsp;cm wide, and very ornamented meaning it was probably used in processions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The iron core of the cross is encased in silver. Points projecting from the four arms of the cross would all have had small silver-gilt balls, which can be seen on other such crosses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Traces of gilding where the balls would have been provide further evidence. On one side across the central arm are three roundels forming a deesis, which shows [[Jesus|Christ]] as a central figure holding a book of gospels in his left hand and blessing with his right.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] is shown bowing on Christ’s left while [[St John the Baptist]] bows on his right &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The roundel on the top arm portrays the Archangel Michael, while the bottom roundel portrays a figure titled [[Theodore the Martyr|St Theodore]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This side is heavily embossed with silver-gilt, and has a vine scroll and beaded border.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The reverse side does not have such borders.

The reverse has a black medium used in conjunction with the partial gilding of niello, which is an enamel type substance, in this case mixed with sulphur and silver.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The roundels portray saints with the top of the cross showing the evangelist St John Theologos. The arm roundels show [[St Peter]] on the left and [[St Paul]] on the right.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The fourth roundel shows [[St Basil]] in bishops robes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The middle of the scene has Virgin Mary and her child with a standing portrait of [[St Constantine, Thorpe Constantine|St Constantine]] above them decorated in his robe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Virgin Mary has [[St Demetrius]] on the left, St Procopius on her right, and the last saint shown is St Nikitas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All saints are identified by the engraving of their names above them. An inscription of a semicircular area just 3&amp;nbsp;cm wide and embedded into the front of the cross, before the tang projects, reads “‘The work of the Faithful Mark’” &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
	 
Similar crosses are known of such as the cross of Adrianople. This cross has frontal images of Christ and the Virgin Mary, along with archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] on the cross arms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The reverse side shows church fathers, and the donor’s name is inscribed as [[Sisinnios Triphyllios|Sisinnios]], which dates the cross to the final years of the tenth century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Another cross, in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], is dated to the eleventh century due to its comparison of portraits with imperial portraits on coins and seal of that time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Distribution of silver-gilt relief decoration and niello are the same on both sides.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Chervona Ruta''''' is a 1971 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[musical film]] written by [[Miroslav Skochilyas]] and directed by [[Roman Oleksiv]], starring [[Sofia Rotaru]] and [[Vasyl Zinkevych]] alongside popular Soviet Ukrainian [[musical ensemble|ensemble]]s. One of the first modern Soviet musical films, and the first modern Ukrainian musical filmed in [[Bukovina]] and the [[Carpathian]] mountains in the [[Ukrainian SSR]], Chervona Ruta features short dialogues combined with legendary [[pop-folk]] songs in the [[Ukrainian language]] and characteristic [[Ukraine|Western Ukraine]] dances in modern pop [[choreography]]. The film was released in both a [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and a [[Russian language|Russian]] language version, though in both versions all but one of the songs are in Ukrainian.&lt;ref name="ivasyuk.org.ua"/&gt;

Translated from the {{lang-uk|Червона рута}} — "[[Chervona Ruta]]" literally means "Red [[rue]]". However, the expression became a proper noun in Ukrainian due to popular use. The term derives from the old East [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] legend, according to which a girl who finds a red colored rue (which are normally yellow) on [[Ivan Kupala Day]], will be happy in [[love]].

== Plot ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
Oksana (played by Sofia Rotaru) is a young and beautiful Carpathian girl. On the "[[Donetsk]]-[[Verkhovyna]]" train she becomes acquainted with a young miner from [[Donetsk]] called Boris. The travellers fall in love, but are parted when they arrive at their destination. In the [[Carpathian mountains]] their paths diverge, but Boris (played by [[Vasyl Zinkevych]], soloist of the instrumental band "[[Smerichka]]") discovers where she is staying. The couple meet again and rekindle their love. Their friends invite them to perform in a concert for vacationers at a mountain resort,&lt;ref&gt;The Carpathian mountains are a popular Soviet/Ukrainian vacation resort for [[ski|ski-ing]] in winter and [[rafting]] in summer.&lt;/ref&gt; where they sing about their feelings for each other.&lt;ref name="ivasyuk.org.ua"/&gt;

== Cast ==
* [[Sofia Rotaru]] as a young girl Oksana
* [[Vasyl Zinkevych]] as Boris, a young miner from [[Donetsk]]
* [[Volodymyr Ivasyuk]]
* [[Levko Dutkovsky]]
* [[Nazariy Yaremchuk]]
* [[Anatoliy Yevdokymenko]]
* [[Alla Dutkovska]]
* [[Raisa Koltsa]]

== Production ==

The idea to make a movie about Ukrainian pop-folk culture set in the Carpathian mountains arose from the fame of Smerichka and the popularity of the song "Chervona Ruta" in the Soviet Union. The original idea was to make a movie about Smerichka, using Vasily Zinkevich as the main actor (another soloist from the group, Nazariy Yaremchuk, had also been considered). As there was no female leading actor in Smerichka the scenario was changed to a simple plot about a sudden blaze of love between Boris, an unsophisticated miner, and the Bukovinian beauty Oksana. By 1971 Sofia Rotaru was already a well-known singer in Bukovina both for her pop-folk songs and for her victory at the 1968 International Song Festival in [[Bulgaria]]. She was at that time a teacher at the [[Chernivtsi]] Musical College. When filming of the first Ukrainian musical started in [[Yaremcha|Yaremche]] Rotaru was given the role of Oksana.

In the film Sofia Rotaru performs "Grey-winged Bird" — the Italian hit song {{lang-it|[[L'immensità]]}}, professionally [[translation|translated]] in Ukrainian by [[Roman Kudlyk]], "Draw Me the Night" and "Autumn Is Close", and also (in [[duet]] with Zinkevych) "Vodohray".

The recording of "Vodohray" by the [[tenor]] Vasil and the [[alto]] Sofia was not used in the final version of the film. Instead [[Nazariy Yaremchuk]]'s voice was dubbed in place of Vasyl Zinkevych, and Mariya Isak's voice was dubbed in place of Sofia Rotaru in the song. It appears that the original performance had a defective [[soundtrack]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ivasyuk.org.ua/video.php?l=ru&amp;p=chervona_ruta Chervona Ruta] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112065035/http://ivasyuk.org.ua/video.php?l=ru&amp;p=chervona_ruta |date=12 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film Maria Isak appears fifth in the row of five girls, for a couple of seconds.

The fact that the soundtrack for the song "Vodohray" was recorded by other singers was revealed only thirty years later. After the release of the [[television movie]], the singers became famous in the [[USSR]] and in [[Eastern Europe]].

'''Christopher Vogler''' (born 1949) is a [[Hollywood]] [[development executive]], screenwriter, [[author]] and [[educator]], best known for working with Disney and his screenwriting guide, ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers]]'', from 2007.

==Early life and education==
Born in Missouri, Vogler studied filmmaking at the [[USC School of Cinema-Television]], the alma mater of [[George Lucas]].

==Career==
Vogler has worked for [[Disney]] studios, [[Fox 2000]] pictures,  and [[Warner Bros.]] in the development department. He contributed story material to the [[Disney]] animated feature ''[[The Lion King]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_wr#writers&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also taught in the [[USC School of Cinema-Television]],  [[Division of Animation and Digital Arts]] as well as at [[UCLA]] extension.  He is President of the company ''Storytech Literary Consulting''. It was founded in 1999 and its Vice President, [[Brad Schreiber]], consults on scripts and books, utilizing Vogler's approach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewritersjourney.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campbell and ''Writer's Journey''==
Vogler, like Lucas, was inspired by the writings of mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], particularly ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', which detailed the [[Hero's Journey]] archetype in classical [[mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;https://johnaugust.com/2011/the-writers-journey-mythic-structure-for-writers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theconversation.com/are-you-monomythic-joseph-campbell-and-the-heros-journey-27074&lt;/ref&gt;
Vogler used Campbell's work to create a 7-page company memo for Hollywood screenwriters, ''A Practical Guide to The Hero with a Thousand Faces'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewritersjourney.com/hero's_journey.htm#Memo|title=hero's journey|website=www.thewritersjourney.com|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Vogler later developed into ''The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Storytellers and Screenwriters'' in 1992, and then ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers]]'' ({{ISBN|978-1-932907-36-0}}). Vogler has since spun off his techniques into worldwide Masterclasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1670">The '''conger''' was a system common in [[Bookstore|bookselling]] in 18th and early 19th century England, for financing the printing of a [[book]].  The term referred to a [[syndicate]] of booksellers, mostly in [[London]], who bought shares to finance the [[book]]'s printing. Each member agreed to take so many copies for sale themselves, and the final profit was split in proportion to the members' initial financial input.&lt;ref&gt; F. A. Mumby, ''Publishing and Bookselling,'' rev. ed.1954, p 141&lt;/ref&gt;   Their names all appeared on the title pages as co-[[publisher]]s, though one of the major publishing houses usually took the lead in setting the deal up.

Prior to the [[Statute of Anne]], the Conger (often seen capitalized)  also had an effect on [[copyright]]. After the printing became common, publishers took the position that having purchased a work from an author, the [[History of copyright|right to control]] its publication continued permanently. Courts supported the claim via precedent, until the Statute was passed early in the 18th century, after which it was law that literary works went into the [[public domain]] after a fixed time set by statute. &lt;ref&gt;F. A. Mumby, ''Publishing and Bookselling,'' rev. ed.1954, p 139-40, Based on [[Augustine Birrell]], ''Seven Lectures on the Law and History of Copyright in Books'', 1899 &lt;/ref&gt;

This system seems to have been mostly used in the financing of major projects -- for example, multi-volume works such as [[encyclopedia]]s. Shares were often subdivided and re-sold, so the actual balance of ownership became very convoluted.

==Plot==
Mookie ([[Spike Lee]]) is a 25-year-old delivery man living in [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]] with his sister Jade ([[Joie Lee]]). He and his girlfriend Tina ([[Rosie Perez]]) have a toddler son named Hector (Travell Toulson). He works at the local pizzeria, but lacks ambition. Sal ([[Danny Aiello]]), the pizzeria's [[Italian-American]] owner, has been in the neighborhood for 25 years. His older son Pino ([[John Turturro]]) intensely dislikes blacks, and does not get along with Mookie. Because of this, Pino is at odds with both his father, who refuses to leave the increasingly [[African-American neighborhood]], and his younger brother Vito ([[Richard Edson]]), who is friendly with Mookie.

The neighborhood is full of distinct personalities, including Da Mayor ([[Ossie Davis]]), a friendly drunk; Mother Sister ([[Ruby Dee]]), who watches the neighborhood from her [[brownstone]]; Radio Raheem ([[Bill Nunn]]), who blasts [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] on his [[boombox]] wherever he goes; and Smiley ([[Roger Guenveur Smith]]), a [[mentally disabled]] man, who meanders around the neighborhood trying to sell hand-colored pictures of [[Malcolm X]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]

While at Sal's, Mookie's trouble-making [[Breakdancing|b-boyish]] friend Buggin' Out ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) questions Sal about his "Wall of Fame", a wall decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans. Buggin' Out demands that Sal put up pictures of black celebrities since Sal's pizzeria is in a black neighborhood. Sal replies that it is his business, and that he can have whomever he wants on "The Wall of Fame". Buggin' Out attempts to start a protest over the Wall of Fame. Only Radio Raheem and Smiley support him.

During the day, the heat and tensions begin to rise. The local teenagers open a fire hydrant and douse the street, before police officers intervene. Mookie and Pino begin arguing over race. Mookie confronts Pino about his negative attitudes towards African Americans, even though his favorite celebrities are black. Various characters then spew flowery racial insults into the camera: Mookie against Italians, Pino against African Americans, Latino Stevie ([[Luis Antonio Ramos]]) against Koreans, white police officer Gary Long (Rick Aiello) against Puerto Ricans, and Korean store owner Sonny ([[Steve Park (comedian)|Steve Park]]) against Jews. Pino and Sal talk about the neighborhood, with Pino expressing his contempt for African-Americans, and Sal insisting that he is not leaving. Sal almost fires Mookie, but Jade intervenes, before Mookie confronts her for being too close to Sal.

That night, Buggin' Out, Radio Raheem, and Smiley march into Sal's and demand that Sal change the Wall of Fame. Raheem's boombox is blaring and Sal demands that he turn it off, but he refuses. Buggin' Out calls Sal and sons "guineas", threatening to close down the pizzeria until they change the Wall of Fame. Sal, in a fit of frustration and after being called a guinea bastard, calls him a "[[nigger]]" and destroys the boombox with a [[baseball bat]]. Raheem attacks Sal, leading to a violent fight that spills out into the street, attracting a crowd. While Radio Raheem is choking Sal, the police arrive. They break up the fight and apprehend Radio Raheem and Buggin' Out. Despite the pleas of his fellow officers and the onlookers, one officer refuses to release his chokehold on Raheem, killing him. Realizing that Raheem has been killed in front of onlookers, the officers place his body in the back of a [[Police car|squad car]] and drive off, leaving Sal, Pino, and Vito unprotected.

The onlookers, enraged about Radio Raheem's death, blame Sal and his sons. Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the window of Sal's pizzeria, sparking the crowd to rush into the restaurant and destroy it, with Smiley finally setting it on fire, what actually diverts revenge away from Sal himself. Da Mayor pulls Sal, Pino, and Vito out of the mob's way. Firemen and riot patrols arrive to put out the fire and disperse the crowd. After police issue a warning, the firefighters turn their hoses on the rioters, leading to more fighting and arrests. Mookie and Jade sit on the curb, watching in disbelief. Smiley wanders back into the smoldering building and hangs one of his pictures on what is left of Sal's Wall of Fame.

The next day, after an argument with Tina, Mookie returns to Sal, who feels that Mookie betrayed him. Mookie demands his weekly pay, leading to an argument. They cautiously reconcile, and Sal finally pays Mookie. Mister Señor Love Daddy ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), a local DJ, dedicates a song to Raheem.

The film ends with two quotations expressing different views about violence, one from Martin Luther King and one from Malcolm X, before fading to a photograph of them shaking hands. Prior to the credits, Lee dedicates the film to the families of six victims of police brutality: [[Eleanor Bumpurs]], [[Michael Griffith (manslaughter victim)|Michael Griffith]], Arthur Miller, Jr., [[Edmund Perry]], Yvonne Smallwood, and [[Death of Michael Stewart|Michael Stewart]].

==Production==
Spike Lee first got the idea for the film after watching the ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' episode "Shopping for Death" where the main characters discuss their theory that hot weather increases violent tendencies. He was also inspired by the [[Howard Beach racial incident]] and the [[shooting of Eleanor Bumpurs]].&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staskiewicz|first1=Keith|title=Do the Right Thing: 1989|work=Entertainment Weekly|issue=1282/1283|date=October 25, 2013|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee wrote the screenplay in two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/fight-the-power-spike-lee-on-do-the-right-thing-20140620 |title= Fight the Power: Spike Lee on 'Do the Right Thing' |publisher= ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |author= Gavin Edwards |date= 20 June 2014  |access-date= 29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original script of ''Do the Right Thing'' ends with a stronger reconciliation between Mookie and Sal. Sal's comments to Mookie mirror Da Mayor's earlier comments in the film and hint at some common ground and perhaps Sal's understanding of why Mookie was motivated to destroy his restaurant. It is unclear why Lee changed the ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/do-the-right-thing-script.html |title='Do the Right Thing' Script (Archived) |publisher=Script-O-Rama |date=28 April 2007 |access-date=29 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428033003/http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/do-the-right-thing-script.html |archivedate=April 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===

Spike Lee campaigned for [[Robert De Niro]] as Sal the pizzeria owner, but De Niro had to decline due to prior commitments. Actor Danny Aiello eventually played Sal and his real-life son Rick Aiello played Gary Long, the police officer who kills Radio Raheem. The character of Smiley was not in the original script; he was created by [[Roger Guenveur Smith]], who was pestering Spike Lee for a role in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Do The Right Thing DVD Audio Commentary&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the cast members were stand-up comedians: [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Steve Park (comedian)|Steve Park]], [[Steve White (actor)|Steve White]], and [[Robin Harris]]. Lee originally wanted Bill Nunn to play the role of Mister Señor Love Daddy, but later recast him as Radio Raheem. Real-life husband and wife Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee were friends of Spike Lee's father [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill Lee]] and were cast as Mother Sister and Da Mayor.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Rosie Perez was cast as Mookie's love interest Tina after Lee saw her dancing at a Los Angeles dance club. Perez decided to take the part because her sister lived four blocks from the set; however, she had never been in a film before and grew upset during the filming of Radio Raheem's death scene.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;

===Filming===

The film was shot entirely on Stuyvesant Avenue between Quincy Street and Lexington Avenue in the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]]. The street's color scheme was heavily altered by the production designer, who used a great deal of red and orange paint in order to help convey the sense of a heatwave. The Korean grocery store and Sal's pizzeria were built from scratch on two empty lots. The pizzeria was fully functional and the actors actually cooked pizzas in the ovens. During filming, the neighborhood's crack dealers threatened the film crew for disturbing their business so Lee hired [[Fruit of Islam]] members to provide security.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Samuel L. Jackson later revealed that he spent most of his time on set sleeping as he has no scenes outside.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;

==Controversies==
The film was released to protests from many reviewers, and it was openly stated in several newspapers that the film could incite black audiences to riot.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Joe. "Spiked?" New York June 26, 1989: 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee criticized white reviewers for implying that black audiences were incapable of restraining themselves while watching a fictional motion picture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;'Spike Lee's Last Word', special feature on the [[Criterion Collection]] DVD (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 interview Lee stated "That still bugs the shit out of me," calling the remarks "outrageous, egregious and, I think, racist," and further elaborating, "I don't remember people saying people were going to come out of theatres killing people after they watched Arnold Schwarzenegger films." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Gavin|title=Fight the Power: Spike Lee on 'Do the Right Thing'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/fight-the-power-spike-lee-on-do-the-right-thing-20140620|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of many questions at the end of the film is whether Mookie "does the right thing" when he throws the garbage can through the window, thus inciting the riot that destroys Sal's pizzeria. Critics have seen Mookie's action both as an action that saves Sal's life, by redirecting the crowd's anger away from Sal to his property, and as an "irresponsible encouragement to enact violence".&lt;ref name="Reid1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark A. Reid|title=Spike Lee's Do the right thing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TyQdbk7CGtUC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=September 25, 2010|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55954-6|pages=43–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question is directly raised by the contradictory quotations that end the film, one advocating nonviolence, the other advocating violent self-defense in response to oppression.&lt;ref name="Reid1997" /&gt;

Spike Lee has remarked that he has only ever been asked by white viewers whether Mookie did the right thing; black viewers do not ask the question.&lt;ref&gt;''Do The Right Thing'' DVD, Director's commentary&lt;/ref&gt; Lee believes the key point is that Mookie was angry at the death of Radio Raheem, and that viewers who question the riot's justification are implicitly failing to see the difference between property and the life of a black man.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

In June 2006, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine placed ''Do the Right Thing'' at No. 22 on its list of The 25 Most Controversial Movies Ever.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141009035251/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1202224,00.html "The 25 Most Controversial Movies Ever,"] ''Entertainment Weekly'' (Retrieved 9 Apr 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

Both [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] ranked the film as the best of 1989 and later ranked it as one of the top 10 films of the decade (#6 for Siskel and #4 for Ebert).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjYS8EUakgs |title= Siskel &amp; Ebert 1989-Best of 1989 (2of2) |publisher= [[YouTube]] |date= 17 December 2010 |access-date= 29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert later added the film to his list of ''[[The Great Movies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/great-movies/ |title= The Great Movies |author= Roger Ebert |publisher= rogerebert.com |access-date= 29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to online film resource ''They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?'', ''Do the Right Thing'' is the most acclaimed film of 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The 1,000 Greatest Films (Full List) | url = http://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000_all1000films_table.php | work = They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Early American Industries Association''' ('''EAIA''') was founded in 1933 by a group of people interested in the [[traditional trades]] and crafts of early America.  They met to discuss the rapidly disappearing practitioners of these trades, including those of the shop, farm, sea, and home.  They were concerned about the loss of the skills and knowledge of the tools and practices of those trades and wanted to do something to preserve them.  Their solution was the formation of the EAIA, subsequently incorporated on March 16, 1942,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://appext20.dos.ny.gov/corp_public/CORPSEARCH.ENTITY_INFORMATION?p_nameid=50250&amp;p_corpid=42769&amp;p_entity_name=Early%20American%20Industries%20Association&amp;p_name_type=A&amp;p_search_type=CONTAINS&amp;p_srch_results_page=0 Early American Industries Association]". ''Division of Corporations''. New York State Department of State. Accessed on May 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] educational organization interested in all aspects of the [[mechanical arts]] in America.

The work of the EAIA is funded through support from over 2,000 members across the USA and abroad and revenue earned through sales of publications, merchandise, and programs.  These resources enable the EAIA to preserve and present historic trades, crafts, and tools and to interpret their impact on our lives.

==Activities==
The association immediately commenced publication of a quarterly journal, The Chronicle, which publishes articles on a broad variety of subjects within their fields of interest. Over the years they have issued occasional publications, reprinting important texts and disseminating historical documents and images. Recent publications include the ''Directory of American Toolmakers'', ''A Pattern Book of Tools and Household Goods'', and a CD-ROM comprising the first 60 volumes of The Chronicle.

The EAIA holds an annual meeting, usually held at a major museum with related interests, at which there are programs by members including talks, demonstrations, displays and tool exchanges.  There are also regional meetings around the country providing smaller, more accessible versions of the annual meeting.

Since 1978 the EAIA has made over 100 research grants to support original research, publication, and exhibitions related to their mission.  For more than a decade a week-long program of workshops have taken place in cooperation with Eastfield Village, [[East Nassau, NY]], at which participants are introduced to a number of traditional trades. There is also an annual "Tool Tour" to Europe focused on museums, sites, and collections related to the history of the [[mechanical arts]].

'''Feng shui''' or '''fengshui''' ({{lang-zh|t=風水|s=风水|first=t}}, &lt;small&gt;pronounced&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-cmn|AUD|Zh-feng1shui3.ogg|f|eng|1|.|sh|ui|3}}), also known as '''Chinese [[geomancy]]''', is a [[pseudoscience]] originating from China, which claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt; The term ''feng shui'' literally translates as "wind-water" in English. This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost ''[[Classic of Burial]]'' recorded in [[Guo Pu]]'s [[Book of Burial|commentary]]:&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://fengshuigate.com/zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Feng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as [[physiognomy]] (observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in terms of "invisible forces" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as ''[[qi]]''.

Historically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings—often spiritually significant structures such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures—in an [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local features such as bodies of water, or stars or the compass.

==History==
===Origins===
{{As of | 2013}} the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Hongshan culture]]s provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the [[magnetic compass]], feng shui apparently relied on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] to find correlations between humans and the universe.&lt;ref&gt;
Sun, X. (2000) Crossing the Boundaries between Heaven and Man: Astronomy in Ancient China. In H. Selin (ed.), ''Astronomy Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Astronomy.'' 423–54. Kluwer Academic.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In 4000 BC, the doors of [[Banpo]] dwellings aligned with the [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] ''Yingshi'' just after the [[winter solstice]]—this sited the homes for [[solar gain]].&lt;ref&gt;
David W. Pankenier. 'The Political Background of Heaven's Mandate.' ''Early China'' 20 (1995): 121-76.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era, ''Yingshi'' was known as ''Ding'' and used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the ''[[Shijing]]''. The late Yangshao site at [[Dadiwan]] (c. 3500–3000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at the center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza.

suggests that ''gaitian'' cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square) existed in Chinese society long before it appeared in the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock and Robert E. Stencel. (2006) ''Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang''. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cosmography]] that bears a striking resemblance to modern feng shui devices and formulas appears on a piece of jade unearthed at Hanshan and dated around 3000 BC.

&lt;/ref&gt;
all capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the ''Kaogong ji'' ({{lang-zh|t=考工記|s=考工记}}; "Manual of Crafts") codified these rules. The carpenter's manual ''Lu ban jing'' ({{lang-zh|t=魯班經|s=鲁班经}}; "Lu ban's manuscript") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui, from [[Puyang]] to [[Mawangdui]] and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.

===Early instruments and techniques===
[[File:La-chinatown-spiral.jpg|thumb|A feng shui [[spiral]] at [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|LA Chinatown]]'s [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Metro]] station]]
The history of feng shui covers 3,500+ years&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 55&lt;/ref&gt; before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in [[Chinese astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Feng Shi. Zhongguo zhaoqi xingxiangtu yanjiu. ''Zhiran kexueshi yanjiu,'' 2 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Some current techniques can be traced to [[Neolithic]] China,&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; while others were added later (most notably the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasty, the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass: Step by Step Guide.'' 1998: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the ''Zhouli'', the original feng shui instrument may have been a ''[[gnomon]]''. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north-south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at [[Yinxu|Xiaotun]] lie 10° east of due north. In some of the cases, as [[Paul Wheatley (geographer)|Paul Wheatley]] observed,&lt;ref&gt;''The Pivot of the Four Quarters'' (1971: 46)&lt;/ref&gt; they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north. This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at [[Yanshi]] and [[Zhengzhou]]. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edward Lewis (2006).'' The Construction of Space in Early China.'' p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are ''liuren'' astrolabes, also known as ''shi''. These consist of a [[lacquer]]ed, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for [[Da Liu Ren]]&lt;ref&gt;Marc Kalinowski (1996). "The Use of the Twenty-eight Xiu as a Day-Count in Early China." Chinese Science 13 (1996): 55-81.&lt;/ref&gt; the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of [[Pole star|Taiyi]] through the nine palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Yin Difei. "Xi-Han Ruyinhou mu chutu de zhanpan he tianwen yiqi." ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 338-43; Yan Dunjie, "Guanyu Xi-Han chuqi de shipan he zhanpan." ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 334-37.&lt;/ref&gt; The markings on a ''liuren/shi'' and the first magnetic compasses are virtually identical.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Kalinowski. 'The ''Xingde'' Texts from [[Mawangdui]].' ''Early China.'' 23–24 (1998–99):125–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[compass|magnetic compass]] was invented for feng shui&lt;ref&gt;Wallace H. Campbell. ''Earth Magnetism: A Guided Tour Through Magnetic Fields.'' Academic Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been in use since its invention. Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the [[loupan|Luopan]] or the earlier south-pointing spoon (指南針 ''zhinan zhen'')—though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed.

==Foundational concepts==

=== Definition and classification ===
The goal of feng shui as practiced today is to situate the human-built environment on spots with good ''qi'', an imagined form of "energy". The "perfect spot" is a location and an axis in time.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"&gt;Field, Stephen L. (1998). [http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223065625/http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html |date=2017-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett, Steven J. 1978"&gt;Bennett, Steven J. (1978) "Patterns of the Sky and Earth: A Chinese Science of Applied Cosmology." ''Journal of Chinese Science.'' 3:1–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui is not a science, but is classified as a [[pseudoscience]] since it exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects such as making claims about the functioning of the world which are not amenable to testing with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=matthews&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael R. Matthews|title=History, Philosophy and Science Teaching: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3IzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=30 August 2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-62616-1|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Qi'' (''ch'i'')===
[[File:Lingshan Islamic Cemetery - turtle tomb - DSCF8492.JPG|thumb|A traditional [[turtle-back tombs|turtle-back tomb]] of southern [[Fujian]], surrounded by an [[omega]]-shaped ridge protecting it from the "noxious winds" from the three sides&lt;ref name=deGroot941&gt;{{citation

''[[Qi]]''（氣）(pronounced "chee" in English) is a movable positive or negative life force which plays an essential role in feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |title=Feng Shui |publisher=Institute of Feng Shui |date= |accessdate=2011-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713043801/http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In feng shui as in [[Chinese martial arts]], it refers to 'energy', in the sense of 'life force' or ''[[élan vital]]''. A traditional explanation of ''qi'' as it relates to feng shui would include the orientation of a structure, its age, and its interaction with the surrounding environment, including the local [[microclimate]]s, the slope of the land, vegetation, and soil quality.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The ''Book of Burial'' says that burial takes advantage of "vital'' qi''". Wu Yuanyin&lt;ref&gt;''Tsang ching chien chu (Tse ku chai chung ch'ao'', volume 76), p. 1a.&lt;/ref&gt; (Qing dynasty) said that vital ''qi'' was "congealed ''qi''", which is the state of ''qi'' that engenders life. The goal of feng shui is to take advantage of vital'' qi'' by appropriate siting of graves and structures.&lt;ref name="Bennett, Steven J. 1978"/&gt; Some people destroyed graveyards of their enemies to weaken their qi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stnn.cc/arts/200908/t20090810_1079619.html|title=新闻_星岛环球网|work=stnn.cc}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.blshe.com/blog.php?uid=326&amp;id=90529 房山金陵探寻_秦关汉土征未还_洪峰_博联社] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212181644/http://home.blshe.com/blog.php?uid=326&amp;id=90529 |date=2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://book.ifeng.com/lianzai/detail_2010_01/11/293453_77.shtml|title=凤凰网读书频道|work=ifeng.com}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaiyun.china.com/zh_cn/geomancy/mr/11063443/20100613/15979672.html 蒋介石挖毛泽东祖坟的玄机] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620232203/http://kaiyun.china.com/zh_cn/geomancy/mr/11063443/20100613/15979672.html |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://culture.china.com/zh_cn/history/kaogu/11022843/20070717/14225498_4.html |title=丧心病狂中国历史上六宗罕见的辱尸事 |access-date=2013-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817061329/http://culture.china.com/zh_cn/history/kaogu/11022843/20070717/14225498_4.html |archive-date=2007-08-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polarity===
[[wikt:polarity|Polarity]] is expressed in feng shui as [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']] theory. Polarity expressed through ''yin'' and ''yang'' is similar to a [[magnetic dipole]]. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. ''Yang'' acting and ''yin'' receiving could be considered an early understanding of [[Handedness|chirality]].{{clarify|date=October 2011}} The development of this theory and its corollary, [[Wu Xing|five phase theory (five element theory)]], have also been linked with astronomical observations of [[sunspot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Allan. ''The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art and Cosmos in Early China''. 1991:31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Elements or Forces (''wu xing'') – which, according to the Chinese, are metal, earth, fire, water, and wood – are first mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic ''Book of History''. They play a very important part in Chinese thought: ‘elements’ meaning generally not so much the actual substances as the forces essential to human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Werner|first=E. T. C.|title=Myths and Legends of China|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London Bombay Sydney|page=84|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15250/15250-h/15250-h.htm|accessdate=2010-03-23|isbn=0-486-28092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth is a buffer, or an equilibrium achieved when the polarities cancel each other.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} While the goal of Chinese medicine is to balance yin and yang in the body, the goal of feng shui has been described as aligning a city, site, building, or object with yin-yang force fields.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''The Legacy of the Luoshu.'' pp. 31, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bagua (eight trigrams)===
Eight diagrams known as [[Ba gua|''bagua'']] (or ''pa kua'') loom large in feng shui, and both predate their mentions in the ''[[Yijing]]'' (or ''[[I Ching]]'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''Lo (River) Chart'' (''[[Luoshu]]'') was developed first,&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''Legacy of the Luoshu''. p. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes associated with ''Later Heaven'' arrangement of the bagua. This and the ''[[Yellow River Map|Yellow River Chart]]'' (''Hetu'', sometimes associated with the ''Earlier Heaven bagua'') are linked to astronomical events of the sixth millennium BC, and with the Turtle Calendar from the time of Yao.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lynn Porter. ''From Deluge to Discourse.'' 1996:35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turtle Calendar of Yao (found in the ''Yaodian'' section of the ''Shangshu'' or ''Book of Documents'') dates to 2300 BC, plus or minus 250 years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sun and Kistemaker. ''The Chinese Sky During the Han.'' 1997:15–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Yaodian'', the cardinal directions are determined by the marker-stars of the mega-constellations known as the Four Celestial Animals:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*East: The [[Azure Dragon]] (Spring equinox)—''Niao'' (Bird 鳥), [[Antares|α Scorpionis]]
*South: The [[Vermilion Bird]] (Summer solstice)—''Huo'' (Fire 火), [[Alpha Hydrae|α Hydrae]]
*West: The [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger]] (Autumn equinox)—''Mǎo'' (Hair 毛), η Tauri (the [[Pleiades]])
*North: The [[Black Tortoise]] (Winter solstice)—''Xū'' (Emptiness, Void 虛), [[Alpha Aquarii|α Aquarii]], [[Beta Aquarii|β Aquarii]]

The diagrams are also linked with the ''sifang'' (four directions) method of divination used during the Shang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Structure in Early China.'' 2000: 107–28&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sifang'' is much older, however. It was used at Niuheliang, and figured large in [[Hongshan culture]]'s astronomy. And it is this area of China that is linked to [[Yellow Emperor]] (Huangdi) who allegedly invented the south-pointing spoon (see [[Compass#China|compass]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock, and Robert E. Stencel. ''[https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923142811/https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 |date=2006-09-23 }}.'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional feng shui==
Traditional feng shui is an ancient system based upon the observation of heavenly time and earthly space. The literature of ancient China, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of the original feng shui techniques.

===Form School===
The Form School is the oldest school of feng shui. [[Qing Wuzi]] in the [[Han dynasty]] describes it in the "Book of the Tomb" [https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV09cvO8sYC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;f=false] and [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] follows up with a more complete description in ''[[The Book of Burial]]''.

The Form School was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs ([[Yin House feng shui]]), which was of great importance.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"/&gt; The school then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings ([[Yang House feng shui]]).

The "form" in Form School refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (phoenix, green dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the [[yin-yang]] concept and the traditional five elements ([[Wu Xing]]: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).

The Form School analyses the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal [[qi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui|authors=Moran, Yu, Biktashev|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.

===Compass School===
The Compass School is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the eight [[cardinal directions]], each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the [[Luopan]], a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.&lt;ref name="fengshuinatural1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools|url=http://www.fengshuinatural.com/en/schools.html|publisher=Feng Shui Natural|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass Step by Step Guide.'' 1998:46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MoonChin. ''Chinese Metaphysics: Essential Feng Shui Basics.'' {{ISBN|978-983-43773-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Compass School includes techniques such as [[Flying Star (feng shui technique)|Flying Star]] and [[Eight Mansions]].

===Transmission of traditional feng shui techniques===
Aside from the books written throughout history by feng shui masters and students, there is also a strong oral history. In many cases, masters have passed on their techniques only to selected students or relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cheung Ngam Fung | first =Jacky | title =History of Feng Shui| publisher = | year =2007 | url =http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html| accessdate = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122452/http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current usage of traditional schools===
There is no contemporary agreement that one of the traditional schools is most correct. Therefore, modern practitioners of feng shui generally draw from multiple schools in their own practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools |url=http://interiordesigncoursesdelhiinstitutes.in/2018/10/26/feng-shui-schools-delhi/|publisher=Feng Shui Natural |accessdate=6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western forms of feng shui==
More recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional schools, and focus mainly on the use of the [[bagua]].

===Aspirations Method===
The [[Eight Life Aspirations]] style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the [[Ba gua#Bagua of the eight aspirations|Bagua government of the eight aspirations]]. Life Aspirations is not otherwise a geomantic system.

===Traditional feng shui===
Traditional feng shui relies upon the compass to give accurate readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide to the Feng Shui Compass: A Compendium of Classical Feng Shui|first=Stephen|last=Skinner|publisher=[[Golden Hoard]]|year=2008|isbn=9780954763992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqU2uQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UCNAAAAQBAJ|p=185|title=Feng Shui for the Curious and Serious|volume=1|first=Phil N.|last=Nguyen|publisher=[[Xlibris Corporation]]|year=2008|isbn=9781469118826}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics point out that the compass degrees are often inaccurate as fluctuations caused by solar winds have the ability to greatly disturb the electromagnetic field of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|p=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4xDhVCxAQIC|title=The Cambridge Guide to the Solar System|first=Kenneth R.|last=Lang|edition=2|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2011|isbn=9781139494175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining a property or site location based upon Magnetic North will result in inaccuracies because true magnetic north fluctuates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth's Inconstant Magnetic Field|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/29dec_magneticfield|publisher=NASA Science|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610), one of the founding fathers of [[Jesuit China missions]], may have been the first European to write about feng shui practices. His account in ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]...'' tells about feng shui masters (''geologi'', in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites "with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot". As a Catholic missionary, Ricci strongly criticized the "recondite science" of geomancy along with [[astrology]] as yet another ''superstitio absurdissima'' of the heathens: "What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?".&lt;ref&gt;"China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci", Random House, New York, 1953. Book One, Chapter 9, pp. 84–85. This text appears in pp. 103–04 of Book One of the original Latin text by Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ&amp;lr=&amp;pg=RA1-PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian-era commentators on feng shui were generally ethnocentric, and as such skeptical and derogatory of what they knew of feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. March. 'An Appreciation of Chinese Geomancy' in ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 2. (February 1968), pp. 253–67.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, at a meeting of the Educational Association of China, Rev. P.W. Pitcher railed at the "rottenness of the whole scheme of Chinese architecture," and urged fellow missionaries "to erect unabashedly Western edifices of several stories and with towering spires in order to destroy nonsense about ''fung-shuy''".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey W. Cody. Striking a Harmonious Chord: Foreign Missionaries and Chinese-style Buildings, 1911–1949. ''Architronic''. 5:3 (ISSN 1066-6516)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, feng shui was officially considered a "feudalistic superstitious practice" and a "social evil" according to the state's ideology and was discouraged and even banned outright at times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |title=Chang Liang (pseudoym), 14 January 2005, ''What Does Superstitious Belief of 'Feng Shui' Among School Students Reveal?'' |publisher=Zjc.zjol.com.cn |date=2005-01-31 |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306142756/http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.csdn.net/taoshilong/archive/2006/04/03/649650.aspx Tao Shilong, 3 April 2006, ''The Crooked Evil of 'Feng Shui' Is Corrupting The Minds of Chinese People'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feng shui remained popular in Hong Kong, and also in the [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]], where traditional culture was not suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/hongkong/8206601/Hong-Kong-government-spends-millions-on-feng-shui.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | title=Hong Kong government spends millions on feng shui | date=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution was the most severe during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when feng shui was classified as a custom under the so-called [[Four Olds]] to be wiped out. Feng shui practitioners were beaten and abused by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] and their works burned. After the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], the official attitude became more tolerant but restrictions on feng shui practice are still in place in today's [[China]]. It is illegal in the PRC today to register feng shui consultation as a business and similarly advertising feng shui practice is banned. There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of "promoting feudalistic superstitions" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city's business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html Chen Xintang ''Art Gallery Shut by the Municipality's Business and Industrial Department After Converting to 'Feng Shui' Consultation Office'' Banduo Daoxi Bao, Qingdao, January 19, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426162415/http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html |date=April 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some communist officials who had previously consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/chinese/news/newsid_1210000/12108792.stm |title="風水迷信"困擾中國當局 – Feng Shui Superstitions Troubles Chinese Authorities|publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2001|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly because of the [[Cultural Revolution]], in today's mainland China less than one-third of the population believe in feng shui, and the proportion of believers among young urban Chinese is said to be much lower&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 ''Debate on Feng Shui''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215232943/http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 |date=2008-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning feng shui is still somewhat considered taboo in today's China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com/58913151.html |title=Beware of Scams Among the Genuine Feng Shui Practitioners |publisher=Jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/27296/3941393.html|title=ˮȨɽ--Ļ--|work=people.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|title=方术之国|work=newmind40.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040204/http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is reported that feng shui has gained adherents among Communist Party officials according to a BBC Chinese news commentary in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jiang Xun |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_4870000/newsid_4872500/4872542.stm |title=Focus on China ''From Voodoo Dolls to Feng Shui Superstitions''|language=Chinese|publisher=BBC Chinese service|date=11 April 2006 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since the beginning of Chinese economic reforms the number of feng shui practitioners is increasing. A number of Chinese academics permitted to research on the subject of feng shui are anthropologists or architects by profession, studying the history of feng shui or historical feng shui theories behind the design of heritage buildings, such as Cao Dafeng, the Vice-President of [[Fudan University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |title=蔡达峰 – Cao Dafeng |publisher=Fudan.edu.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509032825/http://fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |archivedate=2012-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Liu Shenghuan of [[Tongji University]].

===Contemporary feng shui===
Westerners were criticized at the start of the anti-Western [[Boxer Rebellion]] for violating the basic principles of feng shui in the construction of railroads and other conspicuous public structures throughout China. However, today, feng shui is practiced not only by the Chinese, but also by Westerners and still criticized by Christians around the world. Many modern Christians have an opinion of feng shui similar to that of their predecessors:&lt;ref&gt;Mah, Y.-B. Living in Harmony with One's Environment: A Christian Response to Feng Shui. ''Asia Journal of Theology.'' 2004, 18; Part 2, pp 340–361.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Montenegro. Feng Shui" New Dimensions in Design. ''Christian Research Journal.'' 26:1 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Still others are simply skeptical of feng shui. Evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners. Feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different schools of thought. Critical analysts have described it thus: "Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork".&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Joshua Dukes, The Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, T &amp; T Clark, Edinburgh, 1971, p 834&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monty Vierra. Harried by "Hellions" in Taiwan. ''Sceptical Briefs'' newsletter, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are skeptical of feng shui's lasting impact.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mulcock. Creativity and Politics in the Cultural Supermarket: synthesizing indigenous identities for the r-evolution of spirit. ''Continuum''. 15:2. July 2001, 169–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Johnson:&lt;ref&gt;"Reality Testing in Feng Shui." ''Qi'' Journal. Spring 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This present state of affairs is ludicrous and confusing. Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people's tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way? ... There is a lot of investigation that needs to be done or we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nonetheless, after [[Richard Nixon]] journeyed to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972, feng shui became marketable in the [[United States]] and has since been reinvented by New Age [[entrepreneur]]s for Western consumption. Critics of contemporary feng shui are concerned that with the passage of time much of the theory behind it has been lost in translation, not paid proper consideration, frowned upon, or even scorned. Robert T. Carroll sums up what feng shui has become in some instances:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as [[Donald Trump]] which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age "energy" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.&lt;ref name="The Skeptic's Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/fengshui.html |title=feng shui|first= Robert T. |last=Carroll |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others have noted how, when feng shui is not applied properly, it can even harm the environment, such as was the case of people planting "lucky bamboo" in ecosystems that could not handle them.&lt;ref name="Fabulous Feng Shui"&gt;Elizabeth Hilts, [http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= "Fabulous Feng Shui: It's Certainly Popular, But is it Eco-Friendly?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227193557/http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= |date=2005-02-27 }} ''E'' Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui practitioners in China find superstitious and corrupt officials easy prey, despite official disapproval. In one instance, in 2009, county officials in [[Gansu]], on the advice of feng shui practitioners, spent $732,000 to haul a 369-ton "spirit rock" to the county seat to ward off "bad luck."&lt;ref name=NYT51013&gt;{{cite news|title=China Officials Seek Career Shortcut With Feng Shui|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/asia/feng-shui-grows-in-china-as-officials-seek-success.html|accessdate=May 11, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 10, 2013|author=Dan Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage magician duo [[Penn and Teller]] dedicated an episode of their ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' television show to criticise the construal of contemporary practice of Feng Shui in the Western World as [[science]]. In this episode, they devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different Feng Shui consultants, all five producing different opinions about said dwelling, by which means it was attempted to show there is no consistency in the professional practice of Feng Shui.

==Contemporary practice ==

Many Asians, especially people of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent, believe it{{clarify|date=February 2014}}&lt;!-- I hope this "it" refers to feng shui, and not just states the importance of living such life. --&gt; is important to live a prosperous and healthy life as evident by the popularity of [[Fu Lu Shou]] in the Chinese communities. Many of the higher-level forms of feng shui are not easily practiced without having connections in the community or a certain amount of wealth because hiring an expert, altering architecture or design, and moving from place to place requires a significant financial outlay. This leads some people of the lower classes to lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is only a game for the wealthy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''1"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''2"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years,{{when|date=January 2013}} a new brand of easier-to-implement [[Do it yourself|DIY]] Feng Shui known as ''Symbolic Feng Shui'', which is popularized by best-selling author [[Lillian Too]], is being practised by Feng Shui [[enthusiast]]s. It entails placements of auspicious (and preferably aesthetically pleasing) [[Wu Xing|Five Element]] objects, such as ''Money God'' and ''tortoise'', at various locations of the house so as to achieve a pleasing and substitute-alternative ''Productive-Cycle'' environment if a good natural environment is not already present or is too expensive to build and implement.

Feng shui is so important to some strong believers, that they use it for healing purposes (although there is no empirical evidence that this practice is in any way effective) in addition to guide their businesses and create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes,&lt;ref name="Journal of Popular Culture''3"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in the bedroom where a number of techniques involving colours and arrangement are used to achieve enhanced comfort and more peaceful sleep.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2005, even Disney acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate to [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] by twelve degrees in their building plans, among many other actions suggested by the master planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, [[Wing Chao]], in an effort to incorporate local culture into the theme park.&lt;ref name="Feng Shui Kingdom"&gt;Laura M. Holson, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/25/business/worldbusiness/the-feng-shui-kingdom.html "The Feng Shui Kingdom"]''&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Singapore polytechnic|Singapore Polytechnic]] and other institutions, many working professionals from various disciplines (including engineers, architects, property agents and [[interior design]]ers) take courses on feng shui and divination every year with a number of them becoming part-time or full-time feng shui (or [[geomancy]]) consultants eventually.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090206-119946.html |title=Feng Shui course gains popularity |publisher=Asiaone.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studia Geophysica Et Geodaetica, 55(1), 159–74. {{doi|10.1007/s11200-011-0009-2}}. Abstract: "Extant written records indicate that knowledge of an ancient type of compass in China is very old – dating back to before the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) to at least the 4th century BC. Geomancy (feng shui) was practised for a long time (for millennia) and had a profound influence on the face of China's landscape and city plans. The tombs (pyramids) near the former Chinese capital cities of Xi'an and Luoyang (together with their suburban fields and roads) show strong spatial orientations, sometimes along a basic South-North axis (relative to the geographic pole), but usually with deviations of several degrees to the East or West. The use of the compass means that the needle was directed towards the actual magnetic pole at the time of construction, or last reconstruction, of the respective tomb. However the magnetic pole, relative to the nearly 'fixed' geographic pole, shifts significantly over time. By matching paleomagnetic observations with modeled paleomagnetic history we have identified the date of pyramid construction in central China with the orientation relative to the magnetic pole positions at the respective time of construction. As in Mesoamerica, where according to the Fuson hypothesis the Olmecs and Maya oriented their ceremonial buildings and pyramids using a compass even before the Chinese, here in central China the same technique may have been used. We found a good agreement of trends between the paleodeclinations observed from tomb alignments and the available global geomagnetic field model CALS7K.2."

The '''flag of Pembrokeshire''' ({{lang-cy|Baner Sir Benfro}}) is the flag of the [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Pembrokeshire|county of Pembrokeshire]].

The flag was designed by Councillors Peter Stock, Dewi Pritchard, Jim Brock and Marjorie Jacobs in the 1970s after the abolition of Pembrokeshire County Council. A statement by Peter Stock, 'The flag was dedicated as the official flag of Pembrokeshire, at Pembroke Castle at a ceremony on 28 July 1988 with a march past by the band of The Queen's Dragoons Guards.' The ceremony was recorded for posterity.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Flag Institute|Pembrokeshire}} Flag Institute registration particulars]&lt;/ref&gt;

Joffre Swales, founder and conductor of the Haverfordwest Town Band wrote a march entitled "The Pembrokeshire Flag"  for the band to perform on marches around the county.

==Flag design==

The Pembrokeshire Flag is based on the flag of [[St David]]. (The saint's birthplace, the city of [[St David's]], is in Pembrokeshire.)  The blue is also considered to be reminiscent of the sea, and the yellow of summer sunshine. The central rose represents the red [[Tudor Rose]], a symbol used by King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], who founded the Tudor dynasty; a man of both [[Principality of Wales|Welsh]] and [[Kingdom of England|English]] descent who was born in Pembroke Castle. The green pentagon around the rose symbolises the green fields and cliff-tops of Pembrokeshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pembrokeshire-flag.co.uk/ Pembrokeshire Flag site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409131127/http://www.pembrokeshire-flag.co.uk/ |date=9 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4948">[[File:Pope-peter pprubens.jpg|thumb|right|Saint Peter by Rubens]]
The '''Guild of Romanists''' or '''Confrérie van romanisten''' was a society which was active in [[Antwerp]] from the late 16th to the late 18th century. It was made up of notables and [[artist]]s of Antwerp who had visited [[Rome]] and offered artists access to the networks of Antwerp's urban elites.&lt;ref name=lux&gt;Rengenier C. Rittersma, ''Luxury in the Low Countries: Miscellaneous Reflections on Netherlandish Material Culture, 1500 to the Present'', Asp / Vubpress / Upa, 2010, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Confrérie was established in 1572 in Antwerp's [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]] under the patronage of [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] and [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]] and was therefore also known as the 'Broederschap van de HH. Petrus en Paulus' (Confrérie of St. Peter and Paul).  It was a condition of membership to have visited [[Rome]].  The condition of having visited Rome to enjoy membership appears to have been strictly enforced and art historians accept membership of the Confrérie as evidence of visits to Rome that are (in the case of Fyt etc.) otherwise undocumented.

The membership included [[Canon (priest)|canons]], prosperous merchants, members of the local nobility, aldermen and leading artists.  Total membership was capped at 25 members, which accentuated the exclusive character of the society.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;  Deans of the Confrérie were appointed annually. 
[[File:Rubens apostel paulus grt.jpg|thumb|Saint Paul by Rubens]]

After 1680 the Confrérie went into decline.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;  The Confrérie moved in 1681 for financial reasons to Antwerp's St George's Church and remained dormant for a few decades.  It was revived in 1716 when the 'true and approved' relics of St. Peter and Paul were delivered to St George's Church by a Roman cardinal.  The Confrérie was finally abolished in 1785 under the rule of the Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]].

A Magistrate Book (1576), the "LIBER CONFRATERNITATIS SANCTORUM PETRI ET PAULI EN ROMA' is kept in the State Archives.&lt;ref&gt;Antwerpen, Sint-Joriskerk – De broederschappen actief in de kerk
Centrum - Mechels Plein, 2000 Antwerpen, at the site of topa.be {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The diversity of the membership offered artists a good opportunity to meet with potential patrons.&lt;ref name=Tim&gt;Bert Timmermans. ''Patronen van patronage in het zeventiende-eeuwse Antwerpen: een elite als actor binnen een kunstwereld'', Amsterdam University Press, Antwerp, 2008, pp. 243-245&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar social mediation role was played by the [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] and in particular the [[Violieren]], which was the chamber of rhetoric of the Antwerp [[Guild of Saint Luke]].   Membership assisted artists further in raising their profile and prestige in society at large as well as among their fellow artists since only renowned artists were invited to join.

The non-artist members relied on membership of the Confrérie to consolidate their social standing since many of the artist members enjoyed an international reputation.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;

The social role of the Confrérie was facilitated through the institution of an annual gastronomic dinner (the '(h)eerlyck maeltyt'), with excellent wines and copious servings of food.  The dinner was hosted at different locations.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;

The Confrérie further allowed "'art-pilgrims' to keep themselves up to date on news from Rome, whether it be on new painters or paintings, or newly discovered antiquities".&lt;ref&gt;David Jaffé (ed), ''Rubens, A Master in the Making'', The National Gallery Company/Yale, p. 11 London 2005, {{ISBN|1-85709-326-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subject ==
''Harbour Cone from Peggy's Hill'' is one of McCahon's earliest explorations of the [[Otago]] region. It depicts an elevated stance from the mountain tops, looking down towards Harbour Cone in the [[Otago Peninsula]]. This work is one of his more realistic creations - showing a clear landscape theme.
[[File:Harbour Cone Otago Peninsula.jpg|thumb|Harbour Cone, Otago Peninsula]]

In addition to this exoteric representation, ''Harbour Cone from Peggy's Hill'' also contains more esoteric meanings. McCahon wanted this artwork to express "the concept of nature as a spiritual and redeeming
force."&lt;ref name="Spirit"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alderton|first1=Zoe|title=The Spirit of Colin McCahon|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=1-4438-7232-6|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to his friend [[Toss Woollaston]] he explained:

{{Quote|text=I imagined people looking at it then looking at the landscape and for once
really seeing it &amp; being happier for it &amp; believing in God &amp; then the
brotherhood of men &amp; the futility of war. |author=Colin McCahon to Toss Woollaston (1939)|source=&lt;ref name="Elements of Modernism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Gordon H.|title=Elements of Modernism in Colin McCahon’s Early Work|date=2003|publisher=Victoria University of Wellington School of Art History, Classics and Religious Studies|location=Wellington|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of comments such as these, the painting has been read as an evangelical statement designed to connect together God, peace, and the landscape.&lt;ref name="Spirit" /&gt;

== Reception ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2016}}
=== Early Controversy ===
'' Harbour Cone from Peggy's Hill '' was behind one of the earliest controversies in McCahon's long career. It was excluded from the 1939 [[Otago Art Society]] exhibition, despite the fact that each member (including McCahon) was entitled to display one work. Linda Tyler believes that this rejection was due to the absence of support "from an interested and informed public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tyler, Linda|chapter=A Matter of Taste: Charles Brasch as Art Collector|editor1-last=Kerr|editor1-first=Donald|title=Enduring Legacy: Charles Brasch, Patron, Poet &amp; Collector|date=2003|publisher=University of Otago Press|location=New Zealand|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Iqaluit''''' is a 2016 Canadian drama film directed and written by [[Benoît Pilon]] and starring [[Marie-Josée Croze]], [[François Papineau]] and [[Natar Ungalaaq]]. The film was shot in [[Iqaluit]], [[Nunavut]], which provided its title. It is about a Quebec woman (Croze) who travels to [[Northern Canada]] after her husband (Papineau) is seriously injured. She uncovers the secret relationships he had with the [[Inuit]] community, and becomes acquainted with an Inuit man (Ungalaaq) struggling with a related family crisis.

Pilon conceived of the story and planned the execution for years, though the travel and shooting conditions provided challenges. The film screened in a few film festivals before a general release. ''Iqaluit'' received some positive coverage in the Quebec press and favorable reactions from Nunavut viewers.

==Plot==
Gilles is a [[French Canadian]] working in Nunavut while his wife, Carmen, lives in Montreal and leads a career in marketing. Word reaches Carmen that Gilles has suffered a head injury, and she travels north to see him. At the hospital, she sees him die, and the authorities plan an autopsy since the cause of death is uncertain. While in Iqaluit, Carmen meets an [[Inuit]] man, Noah, who worked with Gilles and regarded him as a good friend, and learns Gilles had accumulated a collection of [[Inuit art|carvings]].

Carmen notices Noah's 20-year-old niece Ani, and his grown son Dany, and discovers Gilles had an [[adultery|affair]] with Ani. They had a son, Simigaq, though Carmen and Gilles never had any children. The affair ended after the birth of the child, with Gilles offering financial support and buying carvings to help the family. Carmen confides in Noah at the local bar, with Noah explaining he adopted Ani to rescue her from her abusive father. Carmen expresses her sorrow and anger at Gilles, after which Noah takes her to a remote location. There, he sets up a tent and fishes, but admits he has little knowledge of Inuit custom, as he was placed in a [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] as a boy. Noah's family arrive at the site in a state of panic, telling him Dany has abducted Ani and Simigaq into the wilderness, armed with a rifle. Weary of involving the [[RCMP]], Noah believes he can reason with Dany, and Carmen insists on accompanying him.

When Noah and Carmen find Dany and Ani, Dany asserts he can live on the land and evade the authorities. Carmen asks him what he did to Gilles, with Dany replying Gilles' death was an accident, but the police would never believe him. As the situation begins to de-escalate, Carmen speaks to Ani, who witnessed Gilles' death. Dany was pressing Gilles for money before accusing him and other whites of coming to the Arctic and seducing local women, including Ani. The argument led to shoving, during which Gilles tripped and fell over a cliff. After Dany is defused, the group takes boats back to the mainland, with Carmen asking Ani if Simigaq will ever know about Gilles. Ani replies she and everyone in the community will tell Simigaq about Gilles.

Pilon announced the casting of [[Marie-Josée Croze]] in summer 2015, with the cast also featuring Inuit actor [[Natar Ungalaaq]], whom Pilon had previously worked with on ''The Necessities of Life''.&lt;ref name="Duchesne"/&gt; Ungalaaq accepted the role, saying "the director ... really believed I could play that role and I accepted that as a fact".&lt;ref name="Frizzell"/&gt; Christine Tootoo was a novice actress from [[Rankin Inlet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674shooting_begins_for_iqaluit_the_movie/ |title=Shooting begins next week for Iqaluit, the movie |last= |first= |date=14 August 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2017 |work=[[The Nunatsiaq News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During production, Daniel Justice, leader of First Nations and Indigenous Studies in the [[University of British Columbia]], complained about a [[Facebook]] post from Iqaluit resident and crew member Pascale Arpin, seeking fellow-Iqaluit residents to eat a [[Pinniped|seal]] for the film.

== Personal life ==

VanderMeer was born in [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania]] in 1968, and spent much of his childhood in the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]], where his parents worked for the [[Peace Corps]].&lt;ref name=LocusInterview&gt;"[http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2014/07/jeff-vandermeer-south-of-reality/ Jeff VanderMeer: South of Reality,]" Locus Magazine, July 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to the United States, he spent time in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], New York, and [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], Florida. He attended the [[University of Florida]] for three years and, in 1992, took part in the [[Clarion Writers Workshop]].&lt;ref name=LocusInterview/&gt;

When VanderMeer was 20, he read [[Angela Carter]]'s novel ''[[The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman]]'', which he has said "blew the back of my head off, rewired my brain: I had never encountered prose like that before, never such passion and boldness on the page."&lt;ref name=Atlantic1&gt;"[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/04/the-invention-of-angela-carter-review/523326/ The Thrill and Pain of Inventing Angela Carter]" by Jeff VanderMeer, The Atlantic, April 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's fiction inspired VanderMeer to both improve and be fearless with his own writing.&lt;ref name=Atlantic1/&gt;

In 2003, VanderMeer married [[Ann VanderMeer|Ann Kennedy]], then editor for the small Buzzcity Press and magazine the ''Silver Web''. {{As of|2018|alt=The couple lives in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].}} They have two cats.&lt;ref name="Tallahassee Democrat staff 2017"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tallahassee Democrat staff|title=Meet Author Jeff VanderMeer|url=https://www.tallahassee.com/insider/events/2017/05/08/meet-author-jeff-vandermeer/101438014/|work=[[Tallahassee Democrat]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=8 May 2017|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One is named Neo.&lt;ref name="Harvilla 2017"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvilla|first=Robert|title=The Darkest (and Coolest) Timeline of Jeff VanderMeer|url=https://www.theringer.com/2017/5/30/16040198/jeff-vandermeer-new-book-borne-95e6ac07bea1|work=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]|publisher=SBNation.com|date=30 May 2017|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tallahassee Democrat staff 2017" /&gt;

== Writing ==

=== Early career ===

VanderMeer began writing in the late 1980s while still in high school and quickly became a prolific contributor to small-press magazines.&lt;ref name=StJames&gt;St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost &amp; Gothic Writers by David Pringle, St. James Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time VanderMeer wrote a number of [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] short stories, some of which were collected in his 1989 self-published book ''The Book of Frog'' and in the 1996 collection ''The Book of Lost Places''.&lt;ref name=StJames/&gt; He also wrote poetry—his poem "Flight Is for Those Who Have Not Yet Crossed Over" was a co-winner of the 1994 [[Rhysling Award]]—and edited two issues of the self-published [[zine]] ''Jabberwocky''.&lt;ref name=StJames/&gt;&lt;ref name=LocusInterview/&gt;

One of VanderMeer's early successes was his 2001 short-story collection ''[[City of Saints and Madmen]],'' set in the imaginary city of Ambergris. Several of VanderMeer's novels were subsequently set in the same place, including ''[[Shriek: An Afterword]]'' (2006) and ''[[Finch (novel)|Finch]]'' (2009), the latter of which was a finalist for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfwa.org/2010/02/2009-nebula-awards-final-ballot/|title=2009 Nebula Awards Final Ballot – SFWA|work=SFWA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, his novella ''The Transformation of Martin Lake'' won the [[World Fantasy Award—Long Fiction|World Fantasy Award]].

VanderMeer has also worked in other media, including on a movie based on his novel ''Shriek'' that featured an original soundtrack by rock band [[The Church (band)|The Church]]. The band [[Murder By Death (band)|Murder By Death]] likewise recorded a soundtrack for ''[[Finch (Murder By Death album)|Finch]]'', which was released alongside a limited edition of the book. VanderMeer also wrote a ''[[Predator (novel series)|Predator]]'' tie-in novel for ''[[Dark Horse Comics]]'' called ''Predator: South China Seas'' and worked with animator [[Joel Veitch]] on a Play Station Europe animation of his story "A New Face in Hell".

=== The Southern Reach Trilogy ===
{{Main|Southern Reach Trilogy}}

In 2014, [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] published VanderMeer's [[Southern Reach Trilogy]], consisting of the novels ''[[Annihilation (VanderMeer novel)|Annihilation]], [[Authority (novel)|Authority]],'' and ''[[Acceptance (novel)|Acceptance]]''. The story focuses on a secret agency that manages expeditions into a location known as Area X. The area is an uninhabited and abandoned part of the United States that nature has begun to reclaim after a mysterious world-changing event.&lt;ref name="IS inspired"&gt;{{cite web|first=Ian |last= Spiegelman| date= 28 February 2014 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2014/02/28/jeff-vandermeer-annihilation/5902023/ |title=Jeff VanderMeer: 'Power of Nature' Inspired New Sci-Fi Novel 'Annihilation' |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VanderMeer has said that the main inspiration for Area X and the series was his hike through [[St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schardl|first1=Kati|title=Exploring ‘Area X’: Local author has hit with book series based on St. Marks Wildlife Refuge|url=http://www.tallahassee.com/story/life/2014/03/29/exploring-area-x-local-author-has-hit-with-book-series-based-on-st-marks-wildlife-refuge/7055811/|work= Tallahassee Democrat| publisher= Gannett | accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Other Side of the Mountain'' by [[Michel Bernanos]] is among the books VanderMeer has cited as also having had an influence.&lt;ref name="IS inspired" /&gt;

The trilogy was released in quick succession over an 8-month period, in what has been called an innovative "[[Netflix]]-inspired strategy."&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;"[http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-mcd-imprint-20170728-story.html The boundary-pushing fiction of Sean McDonald and his new FSG imprint, MCD,]" by Margaret Wappler, The Los Angeles Times, July 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy helped the second and third books reach the [[New York Times Bestseller list|''New York Times'' Bestseller list]], and established VanderMeer as "one of the most forward-thinking authors of the decade."&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 25, 2014 |title=Paperback Trade Fiction |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-05-25/trade-fiction-paperback/list.html?date=2014-05-25&amp;category=trade-fiction-paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Best Sellers – Paperback Trade Fiction |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 25, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-09-21/trade-fiction-paperback/list.html|accessdate=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series ended up being highly honored, with ''Annihilation'' winning the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Nebula]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; and [[Shirley Jackson Award|Shirley Jackson]] Awards for Best Novel.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; The entire trilogy was also named a finalist for the 2015 [[World Fantasy Award—Novel|World Fantasy Award]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.locusmag.com/News/2015/11/world-fantasy-awards-winners-2015/ World Fantasy Awards Winners 2015]," Locus Magazine, November 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2016 [[Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://file770.com/?p=28642 2016 Kurd Laßwitz Preis Nominees,]" File 770, April 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Annihilation'' was also adapted into [[Annihilation (film)|a film of the same name]] by writer-director [[Alex Garland]].&lt;ref name="variety.com"/&gt; The film stars [[Natalie Portman]], [[Gina Rodriguez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alex Garland Sets Natalie Portman and Frances McDormand for ‘Annihilation’; Neill Blomkamp Lines Up Next Project|url=http://thefilmstage.com/news/alex-garland-sets-natalie-portman-and-frances-mcdormand-for-annihilation-neill-blomkamp-lines-up-next-project/|work=thefilmstage.com|date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tessa Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|title='Creed's' Tessa Thompson Eyed to Join Natalie Portman, Gina Rodriguez in 'Annihilation' (Exclusive)|url=http://www.thewrap.com/creeds-tessa-thompson-eyed-to-join-natalie-portman-gina-rodriguez-in-annihilation-exclusive/|accessdate=January 5, 2016|work=TheWrap|date=January 4, 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collider.com/jennifer-jason-leigh-annihilation-movie/|title=Jennifer Jason Leigh Up for Ex Machina Director's Annihilation|date=February 10, 2016|website=Collider|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oscar Isaac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/annihilation/39553/annihilation-oscar-isaac-joins-alex-garland-s-new-film|title=Annihilation: Oscar Isaac joins Alex Garland’s new film|website=Den of Geek|access-date=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent work ===

In 2017 VanderMeer released ''[[Borne (novel)|Borne]],'' a "biotech apocalypse" novel&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/15/borne-by-jeff-vandermeer-review Borne by Jeff VanderMeer review – after the biotech apocalypse]" by Neel Mukherjee, The Guardian, June 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; about a scavenger named Rachel trying to survive both a city "plunged into a primordial realm of myth, fable, and fairy tale"&lt;ref name=NewYorker1/&gt; and a five-story-tall flying bear named Mord. As with the Southern Reach trilogy, the novel was highly praised, with ''[[The Guardian]]'' saying, "VanderMeer’s recent work has been [[Ovid]]ian in its underpinnings, exploring the radical transformation of life forms and the seams between them."&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly|Publisher's Weekly]]'' said the novel reads "like a dispatch from a world lodged somewhere between science fiction, myth, and a video game" and that with ''Borne'' Vandermeer has essentially invented a new literary genre, "weird literature."&lt;ref name=PW1/&gt;

[[Paramount Pictures]] has optioned the film rights to ''Borne''.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://variety.com/2016/film/news/paramount-scott-rudin-borne-jeff-vandermeer-1201893053/ Paramount and Scott Rudin Team on Next Novel From ‘Annihilation’ Author (EXCLUSIVE)]" by Justin Kroll, Variety, October 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 VanderMeer released the novella ''The Strange Bird: A Borne Story''.&lt;ref name=PW4&gt;"[https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/74379-four-questions-for-jeff-vandermeer.html Four Questions for...Jeff VanderMeer]" by John Maher, Publisher's Weekly, August 01, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The stand-alone story is set in the same world as ''Borne'' but features different characters.

VanderMeer's upcoming novels include ''Hummingbird Salamander'', which is set ten seconds into the future and deals with "bioterrorism, ecoterrorism, and climate change," and a [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] series called ''Jonathan Lambshead and the Golden Sphere''.&lt;ref name=PW4/&gt; He's also working on a story called "The Three," based on the dead astronauts mentioned in ''Borne'', along with another Southern Reach story.&lt;ref name=PW4/&gt;

== Critical reputation ==

VanderMeer has been called "one of the most remarkable practitioners of the literary fantastic in America today,"&lt;ref name=Gale/&gt; with ''[[The New Yorker]]'' naming him the "King of Weird Fiction."&lt;ref name=NewYorker2/&gt; VanderMeer's fiction is noted for eluding genre classifications&lt;ref name=PW1/&gt; even as his works bring in themes and elements from genres such as [[Postmodern literature|postmodernism]],&lt;ref name=PW3/&gt; [[ecofiction]],&lt;ref name=NYTBR/&gt; the [[New Weird]] and [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic fiction]].&lt;ref name=NewYorker1/&gt;

VanderMeer's fiction has been described as "evocative (with) intellectual observations both profound and disturbing"&lt;ref name=PW2/&gt; and "lyrical and harrowing,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-borne-vandermeer-20170413-story.html Jeff Vandermeer's new dystopian novel 'Borne' is lyrical and harrowing; Elizabeth Hand reviews]&lt;/ref&gt; with his mixing of genres producing "something unique and unsettling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Brown |authorlink=Eric Brown (writer) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/18/finch-jeff-vandermeer-ambergris-review |title=Finch by Jeff VanderMeer |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 18, 2010 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VanderMeer's writing has been compared with the works of [[Jorge Luis Borges]],&lt;ref name=PW2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borges/&gt; [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], and [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]].&lt;ref name=NewYorker2/&gt;

== Literary criticism and editing ==

VanderMeer is the founding editor and publisher of the ''Ministry of Whimsy Press'', which he set up in the late 1980s while still in high school.&lt;ref name=LocusInterview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vanderworld.blogspot.com/2004/12/ministry-of-whimsy-on-hiatus.html|title=VanderWorld (under occupation)|publisher=vanderworld.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press is currently an imprint of [[Wyrm Publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2007/10/17/ministry-of-whimsy-press-the-resurrection/|title=Ministry of Whimsy Press: The Resurrection|work=The Southern Reach}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Ministry's publications, ''[[The Troika]]'' by [[Stepan Chapman]], won the [[Philip K. Dick Award]] in 1997.

'''''Krishna and Radha in a Pavilion''''' is an 18th-century [[India]]n painting depicting the two [[Hindu]] deities [[Krishna]] and [[Radha]] engaged in [[sexual intercourse]].

The painting is the example of [[Pahari painting]] used in ''[[Gardner's Art Through the Ages]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Gardner's Art Through the Ages: Non-Western Perspectives | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TlVeuxIgjwQC&amp;pg=PA39 | authors = Fred S.

{{quote|"In ''Krishna and Radha in a Pavilion'', the lovers sit naked on a bed beneath a jeweled pavilion in a lush garden of ripe mangoes and flowering shrubs. Krishna gently touches Radha's breast while gazing directly into her face. Radha shyly averts her gaze. It is night, the time of illicit trysts, and the dark monsoon sky momentarily lights up with a lightning flash indicating the moment's electric passion. Lightning is a standard symbol used in [[Rajput]] and [[Pahari people|Pahari]] miniatures to symbolize sexual excitement."}}

'''''Lady Sings the Blues''''' is a 1972 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Sidney J. Furie]] about [[jazz]] singer [[Billie Holiday]], loosely based on her [[Lady Sings the Blues (book)|1956 autobiography]] which, in turn, took its title from [[Lady Sings the Blues (song)|one of Holiday's most popular songs]]. It was produced by [[de Passe Entertainment|Motown Productions]] for [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Diana Ross]] portrayed Holiday, alongside a cast including [[Billy Dee Williams]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[James T. Callahan]], and [[Scatman Crothers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=54377 The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:''Lady Sings the Blues'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1945 New York City, [[Billie Holiday]] is arrested on a drugs charge.

In a flashback to 1928, Billie is working as a housekeeper in a brothel in Baltimore where she is raped. She runs away to her mother, who sets up a job cleaning for another brothel in the Harlem section of New York. The brothel is run by an arrogant, selfish owner who pays Billie very little money.

Eventually, Billie tires of scrubbing floors and becomes a prostitute, but later quits and returns to a nightclub to unsuccessfully audition to become a showgirl. After "Piano Man" accompanies Billie when she sings "[[All of Me (Ruth Etting song)|All of Me]]", club owner Jerry books her as a singer in the show.

Billie's debut begins unsuccessfully until Louis McKay arrives and gives her a fifty dollar tip. Billie takes the money and sings "Them There Eyes". Billie takes a liking to Louis and begins a relationship with him. Eventually she is discovered by Harry and Reg Hanley, who sign her as a soloist for their southern tour in hopes of landing a radio network gig. During the tour, Billie witnesses the aftermath of the [[lynching]] of an African-American man, which presses her to record the controversial song "[[Strange Fruit]]". The harsh experiences on the tour result in Billie taking drugs which Harry supplies. One night when Billie is performing, Louis comes to see Billie. She collapses on stage. In her dressing room, Louis notices her needle marks, knows that she is doing drugs, and tells her she is going home with him. Billie promises to stay off the drugs if Louis stays with her.

In New York, Reg and Louis arrange Billie's radio debut, but the station does not call her to sing; the radio sponsors, a soap company, object to her race. The group heads to Cafe Manhattan to drown their sorrows. Billie has too much to drink and asks Harry for drugs, saying that she does not want her family to know that the radio show upset her. He refuses and she throws her drink in his face. She is ready to leave, but Louis has arranged for her to sing at the Cafe, a club where she once aspired to sing. She obliges with one song but refuses an encore, leaving the club in urgent need of a fix. Louis, suspicious that Billie has broken her promise, takes her back to his home but refuses to allow her access to the bathroom or her kit. She fights Louis for it, pulling a razor on him. Louis leaves her to shoot up, telling her he does not want her there when he returns.

Billie returns to the Harlem nightclub, where her drug use intensifies until she hears of the death of her mother. Billie checks herself into a drug clinic, but because she cannot afford her treatment the hospital secretly calls Louis, who comes to see her and agrees to pay her bills without her knowledge. Impressed with the initiative she has taken to straighten herself out, Louis proposes to her at the hospital. Just as things are looking up, Billie is arrested for possession of narcotics and removed from the clinic.

In prison, Billie goes through crippling withdrawal. Louis brings the doctor from the hospital to treat her, but she is incoherent. He puts a ring on her finger to remind her of his promise to marry her. When she finishes her prison sentence, Billie returns home and tells her friends that she does not want to sing anymore. Billie marries Louis and pledges not to continue her career, but the lure of performing is too strong and she returns to singing with Louis as her manager. Unfortunately, her felony conviction has stripped her of her Cabaret Card, which would allow her to sing in NYC nightclubs. To restore public confidence and regain her license, Billie agrees to a cross-country tour. Billie's career takes off on the nightclub circuit.

Louis leaves for New York to arrange a comeback performance for Billie at [[Carnegie Hall]]. Despondent at Louis' absence and the never-ending stream of venues, Billie asks Piano Man to pawn the ring Louis gave her in exchange for drugs. While they are high that evening, Piano Man's drug connections arrive; he neither pawned the ring nor paid for the drugs. Piano Man is killed by the dealers. Within the hour, Louis and her promoter call Billie with news that they got Carnegie Hall. Louis returns to find a very fragile Billie who is traumatized and has fallen back into drugs. Louis takes her back to New York.

Billie plays to a packed house at Carnegie Hall. Her encore, "God Bless the Child", is overlaid with newspaper clippings highlighting subsequent events: the concert fails to sway the Commission to restore her license; subsequent appeals are denied; she is later re-arrested on drug charges and finally dies when she is 44. Nevertheless, the Carnegie triumph is frozen in time.

==Critical reception==
[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Ross as "an an actress of exceptional beauty and wit, who is very much involved in trying to make a bad movie work ... her only apparent limitations are those imposed on her by a screenplay and direction seemingly designed to turn a legitimate legend into a whopper of a cliché."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |date=October 19, 1972 |title=Screen: Billie Holiday |url= |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that "for the bulk of general audiences, the film serves as a very good screen debut vehicle for Diana Ross, supported strongly by excellent casting, handsome '30s physical values, and a script which is far better in dialog than structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=October 18, 1972 |title=Lady Sings The Blues |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of four, writing that Ross had given "one of the great performances of 1972" and observing that the film "has most of the clichés we expect—but do we really mind clichés in a movie like this? I don't think so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lady-sings-the-blues-1972 |title=Lady Sings The Blues |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=November 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' also awarded three out of four stars, writing, "The fact that 'Lady Sings the Blues' is a failure as a biography of legendary jazz singer Billie Holiday doesn't mean it can't be an entertaining movie. And it is just that—entertaining — because of an old fashioned ''grand dame'' performance by Diana Ross, late of the pop-rock scene, in the title role."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (October 27, 1972). "A nice 'Lady,' but she's no Billie". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that Ross gave "one of the truly fine screen performances, full of power and pathos and enormously engaging and sympathetic."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Champlin|Champlin, Charles]] (October 25, 1972). "Two Ladies Who Sing the Blues". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pauline Kael]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that "when the movie was over I wrote 'I love it' on my pad of paper ... Factually it's a fraud, but emotionally it delivers. It has what makes movies work for a mass audience: easy pleasure, tawdry electricity, personality—great quantities of personality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kael |first=Pauline |authorlink=Pauline Kael |date=November 4, 1972 |title=The Current Cinema |url= |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |page=152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Milne]] of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote that Ross did "a remarkable pastiche job on the tone and timbre of Billie Holiday's voice, [but] misses the elegant, almost literary wit of her phrasing," and found the presentation of Holiday's life story "offensively simplistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milne |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Milne |date=May 1973 |title=Lady Sings the Blues |url= |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=40 |issue=472 |page=99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Literary descriptions of cities''' (also known as '''urban ''descriptiones''''') form a [[literary genre]] that originated in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[epideictic]] [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m2881&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |title=Medieval descriptions of cities |author=[[Kenneth Hyde|JK Hyde]] |journal=[[Bulletin of the John Rylands Library]] |year=1966 |volume=48 |pages=308–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fulton&gt;{{citation |jstor=40732051 |title=The Encomium Urbis in Medieval Welsh Poetry |author=Helen Fulton |journal=Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium |volume=26/27 |pages=54–72 |year=2006–2007 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benson /&gt; They can be prose or poetry. Many take the form of an '''urban eulogy''' (variously referred to as an '''''encomium urbis''''', '''''laudes urbium''''', '''''encomium civis''''', '''''laus civis''''', '''''laudes civitatum'''''; or in English: '''urban''' or '''city encomium''', '''panegyric''', '''laudation''' or '''praise poem''') which praise their subject.&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Faulkner_2011 /&gt; Laments to a city's past glories are sometimes also included in the genre.&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benson /&gt; ''Descriptiones'' often mix [[topography|topographical]] information with abstract material on the spiritual and legal aspects of the town or city, and with social observations on its inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benson /&gt; They generally give a more extended treatment of their urban subject than is found in an encyclopedia or general geographical work. Influential examples include Benedict's ''[[Mirabilia Urbis Romae]]'' of around 1143.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;

The Greek rhetorician [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], in the first century AD, was the first to prescribe the form of a [[eulogy]] to a city in detail. Features he touches on include the city's location, size and beauty; the qualities of its river; its [[temple]]s and [[secular]] buildings; its origin and founder, and the acts of its citizens.&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt; The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rhetorician [[Quintilian]] expounds on the form later in the first century, stressing praise of the city's founder and prominent citizens, as well as the city's site and location, fortifications and public works such as temples.&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Faulkner_2011 /&gt; The third-century rhetorician [[Menander Rhetor|Menander]] expands on the guidelines further, including advice on how to turn a city's bad points into advantages.&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt; These works were probably not directly available to medieval writers,&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt; but the form is outlined in many later grammar primers, including those by [[Aelius Donatus|Donatus]] and [[Priscian]].&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Faulkner_2011&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ycQmDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT93 |author= Mark Faulkner |chapter=The Spatial Hermeneutics of Lucian's ''De Laude Cestrie'' |title=Mapping the Medieval City: Space, Place and Identity in Chester, c. 1200–1600 |editor=Catherine AM Clarke (ed.) |year=2011 |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=1783164611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Priscian's ''Praeexercitamina'', a translation into [[Latin]] of a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] work by [[Hermogenes of Tarsus|Hermogenes]], was a particular influence on [[medieval]] authors.&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;

Surviving late Roman examples of ''descriptiones'' include [[Ausonius]]'s ''[[Ordo urbium nobilium|Ordo Nobilium Urbium]]'', a fourth-century Latin poem that briefly describes thirteen cities including [[Milan]] and [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt; [[Rutilius Claudius Namatianus|Rutilius Namatianus]]'s ''De reditu suo'' is a longer poem dating from the early fifth century that includes a section praising [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;

Numerous medieval examples have survived, mainly but not exclusively in Latin, the earliest dating from the eighth century.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt; They adapt the classical form to [[Christianity|Christian]] theology.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Faulkner_2011 /&gt; The form was popularised by widely circulated guidebooks intended for [[pilgrim]]s.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt; Common topics include the [[defensive wall|city walls]] and gates, markets, churches and local [[saint]]s; ''descriptiones'' were sometimes written as a preface to the biography of a saint.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt; The earliest examples are in verse. The first known prose example was written in around the tenth century, and later medieval examples were more often written in prose.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt; Milan and Rome are the most frequent subjects, and there are also examples describing many other Italian cities.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt; Outside Italy, pre-1400 examples are known for [[Chester]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[London]], [[York]] and perhaps [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in England,&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch&gt;{{citation |jstor=27704714 |author=[[Margaret Schlauch]] |title=An Old English "Encomium Urbis" |journal=[[Journal of English and Germanic Philology]] |year=1941 |volume=40 |pages=14–28 |registration=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abram /&gt; [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]] in Wales,&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt; and [[Angers]], [[Paris]] and [[Senlis]] in France.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gransden /&gt;  The form spread to Germany in the first half of the 15th century, with [[Nuremberg]] being the most commonly described city.&lt;ref name=Blamires_1990 /&gt;

[[Kenneth Hyde|J. K. Hyde]], who surveyed the genre in 1966, considers the evolution of ''descriptiones'' written before 1400 to reflect "the growth of cities and the rising culture and self-confidence of the citizens", rather than any literary progression.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt; Later medieval examples tend to be more detailed and less generic than early ones, and to place an increasing emphasis on secular over religious aspects. For example, [[Bonvesin da la Riva|Bonvesin della Riva]]'s 1288 description of Milan, ''De Magnalibus Urbis Mediolani'', contains a wealth of detailed facts and statistics about such matters as local crops.

{{distinguish|Washington Literary Society and Debating Union}}

The '''Literary Society of Washington''' was formed in 1874 by a group of friends and associates who wished to meet regularly for "literary and artistic improvement and entertainment".&lt;ref name=Nicolay&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolay|first=Helen|title=Sixty Years of the Literary Society|year=1935|publisher=Literary Society of Washington|location=Washington, D.C.|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXLzAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22literary+society+of+washington%22&amp;dq=%22literary+society+of+washington%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mNnhULHDI4690QHN9YGYBw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBQ}} - page 3&lt;/ref&gt; For more than 140 years, this [[literary society]] has convened monthly for discourse and the reading of essays written by members.  The Society consists of approximately 40 Members, plus Honorary Associates and Emeritus Members.&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;{{cite book|last=Literary Society of Washington|title=Constitution of the Literary Society (Revised to May 31, 1993)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many similar social organizations, the Literary Society has included women members since its founding.  The Society has no formal building or address, but meets in member homes or other locations.

"Only in Washington could such a grouping have come to pass," wrote anthropologist [[Alice Cunningham Fletcher|Alice Fletcher]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fletcher|first=Alice C.|title=Dr. Spofford as a Member of the Literary Society|journal=Ainsworth Rand Spofford, 1825-1908; a memorial meeting at the Library of Congress on Thursday, November 12, 1908, at four o'clock, the Librarian of Congress presiding|date=November 12, 1908|volume=Internet Archive|page=40|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924029525163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Not only were its members drawn from different sections of the country, but they represented the varied life of the capital city. Within the charm of the drawing-room, officials of the Government, legislators, writers, artists, scientists and private men and women met together, dropping, for the time being, all titles of distinction and becoming simply companions under the Egis of Learning."

According to a printed history of the Society,&lt;ref&gt;Nicolay, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; members have included three Presidents of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Presidents who were members were James Garfield, Rutherford B. Hayes and Theodore Roosevelt.&lt;/ref&gt; justices of the Supreme Court,&lt;ref&gt;Chief Justice Harlan Stone and Associate Justices David J. Brewer, Stephen J. Field, and George Sutherland.&lt;/ref&gt; the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Attorney General, the Secretary of State,&lt;ref&gt;John W. Foster and John Hay.&lt;/ref&gt; two Secretaries of the [[Smithsonian Institution]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Henry and Leonard Carmichael.&lt;/ref&gt; four Librarians of Congress,&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth Rand Spofford, Archibald MacLeish, Herbert Putnam, and James Billington.&lt;/ref&gt; two Archivists of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Solon Buck and Robert D.W. Connor.&lt;/ref&gt; and over a dozen college and university presidents.&lt;ref&gt;Amherst (Merrill Gates), Gallaudet (Edward M. Gallaudet), George Washington (Benaiah Whitman, Cloyd Heck Marvin, James Clarke Welling, William A. Collier, and William Mather Lewis), Goucher (David Allan Robertson and Sandy Unger), Haverford (Felix Morley), Johns Hopkins (Daniel Coit Gilman), Lafayette ([[John Henry MacCracken]]), Rutgers (Merrill Gates), University of Minnesota (Guy Stanton Ford), and Williams College (Harry A. Garfield and Tyler Dennett).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society remains active. Current members are drawn from public service, publishing, academia, and the arts.  Most are published authors.

==History==
In 1873, [[Olive Risley Seward]] discussed forming a group to hold regular social and literary gatherings meetings with two of her friends, Esmeralda Boyle and Sara Carr Upton. Miss Seward was the adopted daughter of [[William H. Seward]], Lincoln's Secretary of State, and editor of the book ''William H. Seward's Travels Around the World''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/williamhsewardst00sewa ''William H. Seward's Travels Around the World'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 6, 1874, the three friends and 27 other founding members met to sign the Constitution of the Literary Society of Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolay, ''op. cit.'', page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;   The meeting was held "at my mother's house, 723 Twenty-first Street, in our back parlor," wrote Esmeralda Boyle afterwards. Sixteen of the 30 original members were women. Founding members included [[Benjamin Alvord (mathematician)|Brig. Gen. Benjamin Alvord]], musician Signor Antonio Barili, Col. I. Edwards Clarke, [[Elliott Coues]], Col. Edward H. Cummins, Chief Justice of the Court of Claims Charles Daniel Drake, novelist and Madeleine Dahlgren, [[Theodore Gill]], Abraham Lincoln's secretary and biographer [[John George Nicolay]], and Prof. Samuel Tyler.

Many members of the Literary Society were later involved in forming prominent Washington institutions including the [[National Geographic Society]], the [[Cosmos Club]],&lt;ref&gt;Seven of the founders of the Cosmos Club in 1878 who were members of the Literary Society at the time were I. Edwards Clarke, Robert M. Fletcher, [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], Dr. [[Theodore Gill]], [[William Henry Holmes]], [[Garrick Mallery]], and [[John Wesley Powell]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Crossette&gt;{{cite book |last=Crossette|first=George |title=Founders of the Cosmos Club of Washington, 1878: a collection of biographical sketches and likenesses of the sixty founders |year=1966 |publisher=The Cosmos Club |location=Washington, D.C. |page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZ2wAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22cosmos+club%22+washington&amp;dq=%22cosmos+club%22+washington&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wtrhUIDwC6ea0QHgjYDgBg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Anthropological Society of Washington,&lt;ref name="Among the 25 founders of the Anthropological Society were: Garrick Mallery, Dr J. M. Toner, Frank Hamilton Cushing, and Dr Robert Fletcher"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lamb |first=Daniel S.|title=The Story Of The Anthropological Society Of Washington|journal=American Anthropologist |year=1906 |volume=8|pages=564–579, 190|doi=10.1525/aa.1906.8.3.02a00030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Columbia Historical Society (since renamed the Historical Society of Washington and located at the [[City Museum of Washington, D.C.]]).

One member wrote that during the Ulysses S. Grant Administration, the Literary Society "promised a pleasant contrast to the rather dusty, arid and scarcely spiritual atmosphere of official life, whether at the White House or in the local atmosphere."

[[Image:James Garfield After.gif|thumb|U.S. President James Garfield was also President of the Literary Society at the time his assassination in 1881. The Society members published a book of essays&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BmcfAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=james+garfield+respect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DsziUNeLHMPW0gGm0oCYDA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=james%20garfield%20respect&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; in his memory.]]President James A. Garfield "took a leading role in the exclusive 'Literary Society of Washington,'" reported the ''Washington Post'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Furman|first=Bess|title=White House Gay in Grant Regime |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/242428672.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jan+3%2C+1937&amp;author=By+Bess+Furman%2C+A+Staff+Writer.&amp;desc=White+House+Gay+in+Grant+Regime |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 3, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was serving as President of the Society when he was assassinated on July 2, 1881.  At a special meeting of the Society after Garfield died, members presented memorial essays that were compiled into a book, ''A Tribute of Respect from the Literary Society of Washington, to its late President, James Abram Garfield''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BmcfAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=james+garfield+respect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DsziUNeLHMPW0gGm0oCYDA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=james%20garfield%20respect&amp;f=false ''A Tribute of Respect from the Literary Society of Washington, to its late President, James Abram Garfield'']&lt;/ref&gt; Garfield's widow, Lucretia Garfield, remained active with the Society for many years and his son, James R. Garfield, Secretary of the Interior during Theodore Roosevelt's administration, was a member.

Inventor [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was a member of the Society from 1889 to 1922, overlapping for 33 years with his longtime rival, [[Edward M. Gallaudet]], founder of [[Gallaudet University]], who was a member from 1878 to 1917.  Gallaudet was an ardent proponent of the use of [[sign language]] by deaf individuals, while Bell advocated lip reading, speech therapy, and greater integration of deaf and hard-of-hearing people into hearing society. Their long-running debate continues to resonate in the deaf community today. See [[History of deaf education in the United States]].

Many of the Society's members were among the first generation of anthropologists and ethnographers in the U.S. during the 1880s and 1890s.  [[John Wesley Powell]] (member from 1883 to 1902) was director of the [[Bureau of American Ethnology|Bureau of Ethnology]] at the Smithsonian Institution, where he led a team that seriously documented the culture of Native Americans for the first time.  Among Powell's fellow Society members and associates at the Bureau were [[William Henry Holmes]] (member from 1886 to 1933), later Chief of the Bureau of Ethnology and director of Smithsonian American Art Museum; Col. [[Garrick Mallery]] (member from 1876 to 1894), the "father" of the study of Indian sign language and pictographs; [[Alice Cunningham Fletcher]] (member from 1889 to 1923), the first prominent female American anthropologist who visited numerous North American Indian tribes and transcribed hundreds of their songs before they were lost; [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], an ethnologist who documented the Pueblo Indians; and [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]] (member from 1890 to 1900), who "went native" and lived with the Zuni Pueblo Indians from 1879 to 1884 to learn about their culture, becoming the first anthropologist to use participant observation as a research strategy.

On the Society's 25th Anniversary in 1899, a longtime member, [[Ainsworth Rand Spofford]], the sixth Librarian of Congress, read a paper before the Society reflecting on the group's experiences in which he recalled,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In our evening exercises there has prevailed a varied range and compass of topics, fitted to bring out earnest thought and many-sided comments. Essays, criticism, poems, short stories, reviews of noted books, characterizations of great writers, social studies, descriptive sketches and brief discussions, occupy the hour.  The only topics excluded... are those which touch the realm of politics or the domain of religion.  In our literary symposia controversy has no place. With all our freedom and variety of opinion, my colleagues will bear me witness, our discussions have never degenerated into personality or rancor.  Catholics and Protestants, Democrats and Republicans, we have met upon the common ground of literary and social good fellowship."&lt;ref&gt;Nicolay, ''op. cit.'', page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Anna_Eleanor_Roosevelt.png|thumb|Eleanor Roosevelt was a member for five years and entertained the Literary Society at the White House.]][[Eleanor Roosevelt]] entertained the Society at the White House in 1936 and later became a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Notes of Society|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 23, 1936|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/249188232.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jan+23%2C+1936&amp;author=&amp;desc=NOTES+OF+SOCIETY}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article on "this grand old organization" in the ''Washington Post'' on April 1, 1937, Marilyn Lukens Beall wrote that, "Both President Garfield and President Theodore Roosevelt were enthusiastic members of the L.S. of W. and insisted upon the meetings being held at the White House. History repeated itself last year, when our present First Lady was introduced to the club, and in her usual cordial, thoughtful way, entertained the members at 1600 Pennsylvania avenue."&lt;ref name=Beall&gt;{{cite news |last=Beall|first=Marilyn Lukens|title=The Merry Whirl|newspaper=The Washington Post |date=April 1, 1937 |page=16 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/offers.html?url=%2Fwashingtonpost_historical%2Faccess%2F120837141.html%3FFMT%3DAI%26FMTS%3DABS%3AAI%26date%3DApr%2B1%252C%2B1937%26author%3DBy%2BMarylyn.%26desc%3DTHE%2BMERRY%2BWHIRL}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mrs. Roosevelt later became a member from 1937 to 1942.

'''Maya Deren''' (April 29, 1917 – October 13, 1961), born '''Eleonora Derenkowska''' ({{lang-ua|Елеоно́ра Деренко́вська|links=no}}), was a Ukrainian-born American filmmaker and one of the most important American experimental filmmakers and entrepreneurial promoters of the avant-garde in the 1940s and 1950s. Deren was also a choreographer, dancer, film theorist, poet, lecturer, writer, and photographer.

The function of film, Deren believed, like most art forms, was to create an experience; each one of her films would evoke new conclusions, rendering her oeuvre dynamic and always-evolving.&lt;ref name=anagram /&gt; She combined her interests in dance, Haitian Vodou and subjective psychology in a series of surreal, perceptual, black-and-white short films. Using editing, multiple exposures, jump cutting, superimposition, slow-motion, and other camera techniques to her fullest advantage, Deren created continued motion through discontinued space, while abandoning the established notions of physical space and time, with the ability to turn her vision into a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]].

One of the most influential experimental films in American cinema was ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (1943), her collaboration with [[Alexander Hammid]]. She went on to make several films of her own, including ''[[At Land]]'' (1944), ''A Study in Choreography for Camera'' (1945), and ''Ritual in Transfigured Time'' (1946), writing, producing, directing, editing, and photographing them with help from only one other person, Hella Heyman, her camerawoman.

==Early life==
Deren was born in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] (then [[Russian Republic]]&lt;!--in April 1917 Kiev was part of the Russian Republic--&gt;), into a Jewish family, to psychologist Solomon Derenkowsky and Marie Fiedler, who supposedly named her after Italian actress [[Eleonora Duse]].

In 1922, the family fled the [[USSR]] because of anti-Semitic [[Kiev pogroms (1919)|pogroms]] perpetrated by the [[White movement|White Volunteer Army]]  and moved to [[Syracuse, New York]]. Her father shortened the family name to "Deren" shortly after they arrived in New York.&lt;ref name=Nichols&gt;{{Cite book |title=Maya Deren and the American Avant-Garde: Includes the complete text of An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form, and Film |editor-first=Bill |editor-last=Nichols |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2001 |pages=3–10, 268}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the staff psychiatrist at the [[Syracuse State School|State Institute for the Feeble-Minded]] in Syracuse.

In 1928, she became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. Her mother moved to [[Paris, France]] to be with her daughter while she attended the [[League of Nations]] [[International School of Geneva]] in Switzerland from 1930 to 1933.

Deren began college at [[Syracuse University]], where she studied journalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/maya-deren |title=Maya Deren |website=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=August 28, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504210211/http://www.answers.com/topic/maya-deren |archivedate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political science, and also became a highly active socialist leader during the Trotskyist movement.&lt;ref name=Legend&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Legend of Maya Deren: a documentary biography and collected works.

She finished school at New York University with a bachelor's degree in literature in June 1936 then returned to Syracuse in the Fall. She and her husband became active in various [[socialist]] causes in New York City. She graduated from [[New York University]] with a bachelor's degree in literature&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; and separated from Bardacke. The divorce was finalized in 1939. She attended the [[New School for Social Research]] and received a master's degree in English literature at [[Smith College]]. Her [[thesis|master's thesis]] was titled ''The Influence of the French Symbolist School on Anglo-American Poetry'' (1939).

==Early career==
After graduation from Smith, Deren returned to New York's [[Greenwich Village]], where she joined the European [[émigré]] art scene. The following years from 1937–1939 were very formative of career as Deren supported herself by free-lance writing for radio shows and foreign language newspapers. During that time she also worked as an editorial assistant to famous American writers, [[Eda Lou Walton]], [[Max Eastman]], and then [[William Seabrook]].&lt;ref name="Legend" /&gt; She became known for her European-style handmade clothes, wild, curly hair, and fierce convictions.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; In 1940, Deren moved to Los Angeles to focus on her poetry and free-lance photography. In 1941, Deren wrote and suggested a children's book on dance to African American dancer, choreographer, and anthropologist of Caribbean culture and dance [[Katherine Dunham]] and later became her assistant and publicist. Dunham's fieldwork influenced Deren's studies of Haitian culture and Voudoun mythology.&lt;ref name="Modern Women"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sally |last=Berger |title=Maya Deren's Legacy |editor1-last=Butler |editor1-first=Connie |journal=Modern Women |date=2010 |publisher=Museum of Modern Art |location=New York |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of touring a new musical ''[[Cabin in the Sky (musical)|Cabin in the Sky]]'', the [[Katherine Dunham Company|Dunham dance company]] stopped in Los Angeles for several months to work in [[Hollywood]]. It was there that Deren met [[Alexandr Hackenschmied]] (later Hammid), a celebrated Czech-born photographer and cameraman who would become her second husband in 1942. Hackenschmied had fled from Czechoslovakia in 1938 after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s advance. They lived together in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] where he helped her with her still photography which focused on local fruit pickers in Los Angeles.,&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt;

==Cinema==

===''Meshes of the Afternoon''===
In 1943, Deren purchased a used [[16 mm]] [[Bolex]] camera with some of the inheritance money after her father's death from a heart attack. This camera captured her first and best-known film, ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (1943), made in their Los Angeles home on a budget of $250&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=VeVe A.|last2=Hudson|first2=Millicent|last3=Neiman|first3=Catrina|editor1-last=Melton|editor1-first=Hollis|title=The Legend of Maya Deren: A Documentary Biography and Collected Works|date=1988|publisher=Athology Film Archive/Film Culture|location=New York City|isbn=0-911689-17-6|edition=Volume 1 Part Two}}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with Hammid. ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' is recognized as a seminal American avant-garde film. It is the first example of a narrative work in avant-garde American film; critics have seen autobiographical elements in the film, as well as thoughts about women and the individual. Originally a silent film with no dialogue, music for the film was composed by Deren's third husband [[Teiji Itō]] in 1952. The film can be described as an expressionistic "trance film," full of dramatic angles and innovative editing. It seems to investigate the ephemeral ways in which the protagonist's unconscious mind works and makes connections between objects and situations. A woman, played by Maya Deren, walks to her friend's house in Los Angeles, falls asleep and has a dream. The sequence of walking up to the gate on the partially shaded road restarts numerous times, resisting conventional narrative expectations, and ends in various situations inside the house. Movement from the wind, shadows and the music sustain the heartbeat of the dream. Certain symbols recur on the screen, including a cloaked, mirror-faced figure, and a key, which becomes twinned with a knife.

The loose repetition and rhythm cut short any expectation of a conventional narrative, heightening the dream-like qualities. The camera initially avoids her face, which precludes identification with a particular woman. Multiple selves appear, shifting between the first and third person, suggesting that the [[Id, ego and super-ego|super-ego]] is at play, which is in line with the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] staircase and flower motifs. This kind of Freudian interpretation, which she disagreed with, led Deren to add sound to the film composed by Teji Ito. Another interpretation is that each film is an example of a "personal film". Her first piece explores a woman's subjectivity and her relation to the external world. [[Georges Sadoul]] said Deren may have been "the most important figure in the post-war development of the personal, independent film in the U.S.A."&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women and the Cinema: A Critical Anthology |editor-first1=Karyn |editor-last1=Kay |editor-first2=Gerald |editor-last2=Peary |chapter=A Letter to James Card by Maya Deren |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-52547-459-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In featuring the filmmaker as the woman whose subjectivity in the domestic space is explored, the feminist dictum "the personal is political" is foregrounded. As with her other films on self-representation, Deren navigates conflicting tendencies of the self and the "other," through doubling, multiplication and merging of the woman in the film. Following a dreamlike quest with allegorical complexity, ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' has an enigmatic structure and a loose affinity with both film noir and domestic melodrama.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; The film is famous for how it resonated with Deren's own life and anxieties. According to a review in ''The Moving Image, "'' this film emerges from a set of concerns and passionate commitments that are native to Deren's life and her trajectory. The first of these trajectories is Deren's interest in socialism during her youth and university years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gadassik|first=Alla|date=2012-07-11|title=Meshes of the Afternoon (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480559|journal=The Moving Image|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=139–142|doi=10.1353/mov.2012.0015|issn=1542-4235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Director's Notes ====
There is no concrete information about the conception of ''Meshes of the Afternoon, ''just that Deren offered the poetic ideas and Hammid was able to turn them into visuals. Deren's initial concept began on the terms of a subjective camera, one that would show the point of view of herself without the aid of mirrors and would move as her eyes through spaces. According to the earliest program note, she describes ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' as'':''

&lt;blockquote&gt;This film is concerned with the interior experiences of an individual. It does not record an event which could be witnessed by other persons. Rather, it reproduces the way in which the subconscious of an individual will develop, interpret, and elaborate an apparently simple and casual incident into a critical emotional experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Influences ====
===== Jean Cocteau =====
''Meshes of the Afternoon'' resembles a French film called ''Blood of a Poet'' (1930) by Jean Cocteau. The film is a representation of the subjective point of view of the Cocteau's mind in which he grapples with the concepts of inner and outer reality. ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' and Cocteau's film share the same imagery in many instances, however, Deren repeatedly claimed to have never seen the film and denied any influence by Cocteau. After seeing Blood of a Poet for the first time, she actually became fond of Cocteau.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

In the fall of 1945, Deren wrote to Victor Animatograph Corp. that she had seen the film multiple times now and expressed interest in publishing a commentary on it. The article was never written.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

===== Dali and Buñuel =====
The surrealist background of Dali and Bunuel is a question of influence because of the surreal nature of ''Meshes of the Afternoon''. Bunuel's ''Un Chien Andalou'' (1928) is on the premier examples of film representing the structure of the subconscious.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

Deren detested this comparison because of the surrealist movement's interest in the entertainment value of its subject more than its meaning. The form of ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' does not compare to Un Chien Andalou either.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

=====Freud and Jung =====
Psychoanalysis of ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' from a Freudian viewer or Jungian viewer attempted to decode the symbolism in the film to uncover what Deren was saying about identity and sexuality. Deren adamantly objected her film undergoing analysis for its symbolism because for Deren, the objects in the film were just that, objects "whose value and meaning ids defined and confirmed by their actual function in the context of the film as a whole". Deren wanted her audiences to appreciate the art for its conscious value and spent a lot of her later career delivering lectures and writing essays on her film theory.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

===== Alexander Hamid =====
Alexander Hamid's role in the creation of ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' is as cameraperson. Maya Deren made extensive storyboards for all of her films including camera movements and camera effects. She wrote about these techniques in professional filmmaking magazines. The ideas and execution of the film are fully attributable to Deren. Hamid also acknowledged Deren as the sole creator of Meshes of the Afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=VeVe A.|last2=Hudson|first2=Millicent|last3=Neiman|first3=Catrina|editor1-last=Melton|editor1-first=Hollis|title=The Legend of Maya Deren: A Documentary Biography and Collected Works|date=1988|publisher=Anthology Film Archive/Film Culture|location=New York City|isbn=0-911689-17-6|edition=Volume 1 Part Two}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''At Land''===
Deren filmed ''[[At Land]]'' in [[Port Jefferson, New York|Port Jefferson]] and [[Amagansett, New York]] in the summer of 1944. Taking on more of an environmental psychologist's perspective, Deren "externalizes the hidden dynamic of the external world...as if I had moved from a concern with the life of the fish, to a concern with the sea which accounts for the character of the fish and its life."&lt;ref name=letter /&gt; Maya Deren washes up on the shore of the beach, and climbs up a piece of driftwood that leads to a room lit by chandeliers, and one long table filled with men and women smoking. She seems to be invisible to the people as she crawls across the table, uninhibited; her body continues seamlessly again onto a new frame, crawling through foliage; following the flowing pattern of water on rocks; following a man across a farm, to a sick man in bed, through a series of doors, and finally popping up outside on a cliff. She shrinks in the wide frame as she walks farther away from the camera, up and down sand dunes, then frantically collecting rocks back on the shore. Her expression seems confused when she sees two women playing chess in the sand. She runs back through the entire sequence, and because of the jump-cuts, it seems as though she is a double or "doppelganger," where her earlier self sees her other self running through the scene. Some of her movements are controlled, suggesting a theatrical, dancer-like quality, while some have an almost animalistic sensibility as she crawls through the seemingly foreign environments. This is one of Deren's films in which the focus is on the character's exploration of her own subjectivity in her physical environment, inside as well as outside her subconscious, although it has a similar amorphous quality compared to her other films.

===''A Study in Choreography for Camera''===
In the spring of 1945 she made ''[[A Study in Choreography for Camera]],'' which Deren said was "an effort to isolate and celebrate the principle of the power of movement."&lt;ref name=letter /&gt; The compositions and varying speeds of movement within the frame inform and interact with Deren's meticulous edits and varying film speeds and motions to create a dance that Deren said could only exist on film. Excited by the way the dynamic of movement is greater than anything else within the film, Maya established a completely new sense of the word "geography" as the movement of the dancer transcends and manipulates the ideas of both time and space.&lt;ref name=letter /&gt; Running at just under 3 minutes long, ''A Study in Choreography for Camera'' is a fragment but also a carefully constructed exploration of a man who dances in a forest, and then seems to teleport to the inside of a house because of how continuous his movements are from one place to the next. The choreography is perfectly synched as he seamlessly appears in an outdoor courtyard and then returns to an open, natural space. It shows a progression from nature to the confines of society, and back to nature. The figure belongs to dancer and choreographer [[Talley Beatty]], whose last movement is a leap across the screen back to the natural world. The edit its broken, choppy, showing different angles and compositions, and even with parts in slow-motion, Deren is able to keep the quality of the leap smooth and seemingly uninterrupted.

===''Ritual in Transfigured Time''===
By her fourth film, Deren discussed in ''An Anagram'' that she felt special attention should be given to unique possibilities of time and that the form should be ritualistic as a whole. ''Ritual in Transfigured Time'' began in August and was completed in 1946. It explored the fear of rejection and the freedom of expression in abandoning ritual, looking at the details as well as the bigger ideas of the nature and process of change. The main roles were played by Deren and the dancers [[Rita Christiani]] and Frank Westbrook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maya Deren and the American Avant-Garde |editor-last=Nichols |editor-first=Bill |publisher=University of California Press |date=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NA8a2jbCUTcC&amp;pg=PP12&amp;lpg=PP12&amp;dq=Rita+Christiani+%2B+Nichols&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cO22FS6JPH&amp;sig=pcRGbPlP9kb3AEfKu5cSd2Q4P7Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV4eam_K7WAhUHqFQKHb5UBeEQ6AEIRjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Rita%20Christiani%20%2B%20Nichols&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-52022-732-3 |page=141 |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Meditation on Violence''===
Deren's ''Meditation on Violence'' was made in 1948. [[Chao-Li Chi]]'s performance obscures the distinction between violence and beauty. It was an attempt to "abstract the principle of ongoing metamorphosis," found in ''Ritual in Transfigured Time,'' though Deren felt it was not as successful in the clarity of that idea, brought down by its philosophical weight.&lt;ref name=letter /&gt; Halfway through the film, the sequence is rewound, producing a film loop.

==Film career==
Deren defined cinema as an art, provided an intellectual context for film viewing, and filled a theoretical gap for the kinds of independent films societies were featuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Points of Resistance: Women, Power &amp; Politics in the New York Avant-garde Cinema, 1934-1971|last=Rabinowitz|first=Lauren|publisher=Urbana: University of Illinois Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Urbana|pages=49–91|chapter=Maya Deren and an American Avant-garde Cinema}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her entrepreneurial spirit became evident as she began to screen and distribute her films in the United States, Canada, and Cuba, lecturing and writing on avant-garde film theory, and [[Haitian Vodou|Vodoun]] as well. In February 1946 she booked the Village's Provincetown Playhouse for a major public exhibition, titled ''Three Abandoned Films'', in which she showed ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]],'' ''[[At Land]],'' and ''A Study in Choreography for the Camera.'' The event was completely sold out, inspiring [[Amos Vogel]]'s formation of [[Cinema 16]], the most successful film society of the 1950s.

In 1946, she was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for "Creative Work in the Field of Motion Pictures," and won the Grand Prix Internationale for 16mm [[experimental film]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]].'' She then created a scholarship for experimental filmmakers, the Creative Film Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/158493/Maya-Deren |title=Maya Deren &amp;#124; biography - American director and actress |website=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Deren collaborated with the [[Metropolitan Opera]] Ballet School and [[Antony Tudor]] to create ''The Very Eye of Night''.

Deren was a muse and inspiration to such up-and-coming avant-garde filmmakers as [[Curtis Harrington]], [[Stan Brakhage]], and [[Kenneth Anger]], who emulated her independent, entrepreneurial spirit. Her influence can also be seen in films by [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Barbara Hammer]], and [[Su Friedrich]].&lt;ref name="Modern Women"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1943, she moved to a bungalow on Kings Road in Hollywood&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt; and adopted the name Maya, a pet name her husband Hammid coined. Maya is the name of the mother of the historical [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] as well as the [[dharmic]] concept of the illusory nature of reality. In Greek myth, [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] is the mother of [[Hermes]] and a goddess of mountains and fields.

In 1944, back in New York City, her social circle included [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[André Breton]], [[John Cage]], and [[Anaïs Nin]]. In 1944, Deren filmed ''[[The Witch's Cradle]]'' in [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s [[Art of This Century gallery]] with Duchamp featured in the film, and possibly assisting her in the direction of the film.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Many friends described her look as that of an exotic Russian Jew,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} contributing a part of her attractiveness to her [[bohemian]], Greenwich Village lifestyle. In the December 1946 issue of ''Esquire'' magazine, a caption for her photograph teased that she "experiments with motion pictures of the subconscious, but here is finite evidence that the lady herself is infinitely photogenic."&lt;ref name=persona&gt;{{cite journal |title=Performance and Persona in the U.S. Avant-Garde: The Case of Maya Deren |first=Maria |last=Pramaggiore |journal=Cinema Journal |volume=36 |number=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=17–40 |publisher=University of Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her third husband, [[Teiji Ito]] said "Maya was always a Russian. In [[Haiti]] she was a Russian. She was always dressed up, talking, speaking many languages and being a Russian."&lt;ref name=persona /&gt;

==Criticism of Hollywood==
Throughout the 1940s and 50s, Deren attacked Hollywood for its artistic, political and economic monopoly over American cinema. She stated, "I make my pictures for what Hollywood spends on lipstick," and observed that Hollywood "has been a major obstacle to the definition and development of motion pictures as a creative fine-art form." She set herself in opposition to the Hollywood film industry's standards and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Timeline at 2010 MoMA exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt;
Deren talks about the freedoms of independent cinema:

{{Quote|text=Artistic freedom means that the amateur filmmaker is never forced to sacrifice visual drama and beauty to a stream of words...to the relentless activity and explanations of a plot...nor is the amateur production expected to return profit on a huge investment by holding the attention of a massive and motley audience for 90 minutes...Instead of trying to invent a plot that moves, use the movement of wind, or water, children, people, elevators, balls, etc. as a poem might celebrate these. And use your freedom to experiment with visual ideas; your mistakes will not get you fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Maya |last=Deren |title=Amateur Versus Professional |journal=Film Culture |number=39 |year=1965 |pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Haiti and Vodou==
When Maya Deren decided to make an ethnographic film in [[Haiti]], she was criticized for abandoning avant-garde film where she had made her name, but she was ready to expand to a new level as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PHliJESxjYC&amp;dq=maya+deren+and+the+american+avantgarde&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Panq5wgSrf&amp;sig=-_doFxuxSE8d4f8nGLp3ICAVQLM&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=gbHhSpiSDoGL-QbxrJjZAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=moira%20sullivan&amp;f=false |chapter=Maya Deren's Ethnographic Representation of Ritual and Magic in Haiti |first=Moira |last=Sullivan |pages=207–229 |title=Maya Deren and the American Avantgarde |editor-last=Nichols |editor-first=Bill |publisher=University of California Press |year=2001 |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (2001), page 18. According to Nichols, "Taking up another neglected dimension of Maya Deren's work, Moira Sullivan's "Maya Deren's Ethnographic Representation of Ritual and Magic in Haiti" relies on primary source material in the Maya Deren Archive in Boston and Anthology Film Archives in New York."&lt;/ref&gt; She had studied ethnographic footage by [[Gregory Bateson]] in [[Bali]] in 1947, and was interested in including it in her next film.&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt; In September she divorced Hammid and left for a nine-month stay in Haiti. The [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] grant in 1947 enabled Deren to finance her travel and complete her film ''Meditation on Violence.'' She went on three additional trips through 1954 to document and record the rituals of [[Haitian Vodou]].

A source of inspiration for ritual dance was [[Katherine Dunham]] who wrote her master's thesis on Haitian dances in 1939, which Deren edited. Afterwards Deren wrote several articles on religious possession in dancing before her first trip to Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;A list of these articles are found in : Sullivan, 1997, pp.199-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Deren not only filmed, recorded and photographed many hours of Vodou [[ritual]], but also participated in the ceremonies. She documented her knowledge and experience of Vodou in ''Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti'' (New York: Vanguard Press, 1953), edited by [[Joseph Campbell]], which is considered a definitive source on the subject. She described her attraction to Vodou possession ceremonies, transformation, dance, play, games and especially ritual came from her strong feeling on the need to decenter our thoughts of self, ego and personality.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; In her book ''An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form, and Film'' she wrote:

{{Quote|text=The ritualistic form treats the human being not as the source of the dramatic action, but as a somewhat depersonalized element in a dramatic whole. The intent of such depersonalization is not the deconstruction of the individual; on the contrary, it enlarges him beyond the personal dimension and frees him from the specializations and confines of personality. He becomes part of a dynamic whole which, like all such creative relationships, in turn, endow its parts with a measure of its larger meaning.&lt;ref name=anagram&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form and Film |first=Maya |last=Deren |publisher=The Alicat Bookshop Press |year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Deren filmed 18,000 feet of Vodou rituals and people she met in Haiti. The footage was incorporated into a posthumous documentary film ''[[Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti (film)|Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti]]'', edited and produced in 1977 (with funding from Deren's friend [[James Merrill]]) by Teiji Itō (1935-1982) and his wife Cherel Winett Itō (1947–1999).&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan in Nichols (2001), pp.207-229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Program notes" from screening at [[Pacific Film Archive]] at UC Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paganopoulos |first=M. |chapter=The Archetype of Transformation in Maya Deren's Film Rituals |title=Jung and Film II |editor1-first=Christopher |editor1-last=Hauke |editor2-first=Luke |editor2-last=Hockley |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge |pages=253–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the original wire recordings, photographs and notes are held in the Maya Deren Collection at the [[Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center]] at [[Boston University]]. The film footage is housed at [[Anthology Film Archives]] in New York City.

An [[LP record|LP]] of some of Deren's wire recordings was published by the newly formed [[Elektra Records]] in 1953 entitled ''Voices of Haiti''. The cover art for the album was by Teiji Ito.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.atsf.co.uk/elektra/discography.php?from=10&amp;to=340 |title=Master Discography |website=Elektra Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists Melville Herkovitz and Harold Courlander acknowledged the importance of ''Divine Horsemen,'' and in contemporary studies it is often cited as an authoritative voice, where Deren's methodology has been especially praised because "Vodou has resisted all orthodoxies, never mistaking surface representations for inner realities." &lt;ref&gt;Cosentino, ed., ''Sacred Arts of Vodou'', p.xii. Cited by Sullivan in Nichols (2001), p.225.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book of the same name,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Deren |first=M. |title=The Voodoo Gods |year=1975 |publisher=Paladin |pages=26 &amp; 305}} (A reprint of ''Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti.'')&lt;/ref&gt; Deren uses the spelling,'Voudoun,' explaining: "Voudoun terminology, titles and ceremonies still make use of the original African words and in this book they have been spelled out according to usual English phonetics and so as to render, as closely as possible, the Haitian pronunciation. Most of the songs, sayings and even some of the religious terms, however, are in [[Haitian Creole|Creole]], which is primarily French in derivation (although it also contains African, Spanish and Indian words). Where the Creole word retains its French meaning, it has been written out so as to indicate both the original French word and the distinctive Creole pronunciation." In her Glossary of Creole Words, Deren includes 'Voudoun' while the ''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary |edition=3rd |year=1973}} See also: [[Haitian Vodou]].&lt;/ref&gt; draws attention to the similar French word, ''Vaudoux.''

==Death==
Deren died in 1961, at the age of 44, from a [[brain hemorrhage]] brought on by extreme malnutrition. Her condition may have also been weakened by her long-term dependence on [[amphetamines]] and sleeping pills prescribed by Dr. [[Max Jacobson]], an arts scene doctor notorious for his liberal prescription of drugs,&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; who later became famous as one of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]'s physicians. Her father suffered from [[hypertension]], which she may also have had.

Her ashes were scattered in Japan at [[Mount Fuji]].

==Legacy==
&lt;!--Maya Deren had a passionate sense of social commitment and moral purpose that distinguished her from the less favorable values of the entertainment industry; from the indifferent, ironic attitudes of her surrealist and dada predecessors; from the cool, hip attitudes of her Beat successors; from the passive aesthetic of stylized filmmakers; and from the pretentious attitudes of contemporary film theorists.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; Early political Socialist activism served as the base for Deren's organizational and creative endeavors; her pursuit of art was grounded in her strong ethical, moral and social convictions.&lt;ref name=anagram /&gt;
--&gt;
Deren was a key figure in the creation of a New American Cinema, highlighting personal, experimental, underground film. In 1986, the [[American Film Institute]] created the [[Maya Deren Award]] to honor independent filmmakers.

''The Legend of Maya Deren, Vol. 1 Part 2'' consists of hundreds of documents, interviews, oral histories, letters, and autobiographical memoirs.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt;

Works about Deren and her works have been produced in various media:
* In 1987, Jo Ann Kaplan directed a biographical documentary about Deren, titled ''Invocation: Maya Deren'' (65 min)
* In 1994, the UK-based [[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]] created and toured ''Dance of White Darkness'' throughout Europe—the story of Deren's visits to Haiti.
* In 2002, Martina Kudlacek directed a feature-length documentary about Deren, titled ''[[In the Mirror of Maya Deren]]'' (''Im Spiegel der Maya Deren''), which featured music by [[John Zorn]].

Deren's films have also been shown with newly written alternative soundtracks:
* In 2004, the British rock group [[Subterraneans (band)|Subterraneans]] produced new soundtracks for six of Deren's short films as part of a commission from [[Queens University Belfast|Queen's University Belfast]]'s annual [[Belfast Film Festival|film festival]]. ''At Land'' won the festival prize for sound design.
* In 2008, the Portuguese rock group [[Mão Morta]] produced new soundtracks for four of Deren's short films as part of a commission from Curtas Vila do Conde's annual film festival.

== Written works ==
Deren was also an important film theorist. 
* Her most widely read essay on film theory is probably ''An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form and Film'', Deren's seminal treatise that laid the groundwork for many of her ideas on film as an art form (Yonkers, NY: Alicat Book Shop Press, 1946).
* Her collected essays were published&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mcphersonco.com/cs.php?f[0]=shh&amp;sl[br][NR]=9&amp;sl[br][SR]=2&amp;sl[br][cgID]=5&amp;pdID=142 |title=Essential Deren: Collected Writings on Film |publisher=McPherson &amp; Co |year=2005 |isbn=0-929701-65-8 |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 and arranged in three sections:
# ''Film Poetics'', including: Amateur versus Professional, Cinema as an Art Form, An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form and Film, Cinematography: The Creative Use of Reality
# ''Film Production'', including: Creating Movies with a New Dimension: Time, Creative Cutting, Planning by Eye, Adventures in Creative Film-Making
# ''Film in Medias Res'', including: A Letter, Magic is New, New Directions in Film Art, Choreography for the Camera, Ritual in Transfigured Time, Meditation on Violence, The Very Eye of Night.
* ''Divine Horsemen: Living Gods of Haiti'' was published in 1953 by Vanguard Press (New York City) and Thames &amp; Hudson (London), republished under the title of ''The Voodoo Gods'' by Paladin in 1975, and again under its original title by McPherson &amp; Company in 1998.

'''Minjung art''' was a [[South Korea]]n [[political]] and [[populism|populist]] [[art]] movement, born in 1980.

== Background ==
The [[Minjung]] ("people's") cultural movement came as the popular and artistic response to the [[Gwangju Massacre]] by South Korean dictator General [[Chun Doo-hwan]] in May 1980. Minjung artists used visual arts, especially painting and woodblocks, to call for democratization and [[Korean reunification]]. Their artworks glorified nature, laborers, and peasants, and criticized [[imperialism]], [[Americanization]], and the authoritarian South Korean government. In the 1980s, many Minjung artists were accused of sympathizing with [[communism]] and [[North Korea]], and tortured or imprisoned like other democratization activists.

== History ==
The organization of [[Hyun-sil and Bal-un Group]] in 1979 inspired several artists to line up against the government and 70's art. That was the time when Minjung art started. Notable Minjung artists included [[Kim Pong-jun]] (b. 1954), who led the [[Du-Rong Group]], [[Kim Jeong-heon]] (b. 1946), [[Im Ok-sang]] (b. 1950), [[Sin Hak-ch’ol]], [[O Yun]] (1946–1986), and [[Hong Song-dam]].

With the democratization of the 1990s, Minjung art started losing their concrete aim and became part of the mainstream - post modernism. In 1994, the [[Kim Young Sam]] government allowed a large-scale exhibition entitled "Fifteen Years of Minjung Art: 1980-1994" in the National Museum of Contemporary Art in [[Gwacheon]], and in 1996, the government even commissioned [[Hong Song-dam]], one of the most acclaimed and radical Minjung artists, to create a 42-meter Minjung mural for a wall of [[Chonnam National University]] in [[Kwangju]] itself. Possibly as a result of this greater acceptance, while earlier Minjung artwork has become sought after, little new art in the Minjung style is being created. Later Korean artists tend towards [[post-modern]] and [[avant-garde]] styles.

'''Morris Weitz''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|iː|t|s}}; July 24, 1916 – February 1, 1981)  "was an American philosopher of aesthetics who focused primarily on ontology, interpretation, and literary criticism".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecommons.udayton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.co.uk/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1005&amp;context=phl_fac_pub|title=Morris Weitz|last=Bresnahan|first=Aili W.|date=2014|website=(University of Dayton) History of Philosophy Commons|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1972 until his death he was Richard Koret Professor of Philosophy at [[Brandeis University|Brandels University]].

== Biography ==

=== Personal life ===
Morris Weitz was born on July 24, 1916 in Detroit, his parents having emigrated from Europe (and his father having worked as a painting contractor).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was husband to [[Margaret Weitz|Margaret (née) Collins]] ("an author and renowned scholar of French women, French culture and the French Resistance"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.suffolk.edu/files/Archives/MS109_findingaid.pdf|title=Margaret Collins Weitz Papers (MS109): A Finding Aid|last=Moakley Archive and Institute|first=|date=|website=Suffolk University  [Boston MA]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the father of three children, [[Richard Weitz|Richard]], David, and Catherine (the former being a director of the Center for Political-Military Analysis and a Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute). Morris Weitz died on February the 1st of 1981, in hospital in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] after a long illness aged 64 having lived latterly in [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/04/obituaries/dr-morris-weitz-64-a-professor-who-wrote-books-on-philosophy.html|title=Dr. Morris Weitz, 64, a Professor Who Wrote Books on Philosophy|date=1981-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Tertiary Education and Academic Career ===
Weitz obtained his BA in 1938 from [[Wayne State University]]. While doing graduate work in French history at the [[University of Chicago]] he met [[Bertrand Russell]], which directed Weitz's interests towards philosophy. He received his Masters and, in 1943, his Phd in philosophy from the [[University of Michigan]] with a dissertation titled ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/THE_METHOD_OF_ANALYSIS_IN_THE_PHILOSOPHY.html?id=UO_jrQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y The Method of Analysis in the Philosophy of Bertrand Russell]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ijpj1tB3Qr0C&amp;pg=PA2550&amp;lpg=PA2550&amp;dq=Morris+Weitz+was+born+on+28+July+1916+in+Detroit,+Michigan.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8DbQ9PovGw&amp;sig=6oWfLCCZp_sGbOywJbbqzBIEC3k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjeyPzRiIXZAhWJK8AKHfUhDIoQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=WEITZ, Morris (1916–81)|last=Meskin|first=Aaron|work=The Dictionary Of Modern American Philosophers|publisher=Thoemmes Continuum|year=2005|isbn=1843710374|editor-last=Shook|editor-first=John R.|location=Bristol|pages=2550–2554|oclc=276357640}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of his career he taught philosophy at the [[University of Washington]] (1944–5), [[Vassar College]] (1945–8), and [[Ohio State University]] (1954–69).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1969 Weitz moved to [[Brandeis University]] where, in 1972, he was named Richard Koret Professor of Philosophy in 1972, a position he retained until his death. He was also a visiting professor at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], and [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. He was recognised with a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/morris-weitz/|title=MORRIS WEITZ|last=|first=|date=|website=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also honored as a [[Fulbright Senior Scholar]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Philosophical Thought, Influence, and Criticisms ==
Weitz spent a year in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] which led to lifelong friendships with Oxford philosophers such as [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[H. L. A. Hart|H.L.A. Hart]], and [[Isaiah Berlin]] and, in 1953, the publication in ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'' of ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2182793 Oxford Philosophy]'' (1953). In the same, according to [https://aaron-meskin.org/ Aaron W. Meskin] writing in ''[[Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers|The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers]],"''Weitz argued that postwar Oxford philosophy was not unified by any general meta-philosophical position but rather by a commitment to investigating the logic of concepts". Meskin notes that this "was a significant publication in the United States as it served for many as an introduction to postwar Oxford philosophy".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meskin suggests the work also "illuminates the course of Weitz’s career" - the "task of elucidating both ordinary and technical concepts" becoming central to his philosophical pursuits and his philosophical method becoming  "one of conceptual analysis, so long as this pursuit is not understood to be predicated on the goal of providing necessary and sufficient conditions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Weitz is perhaps best known for his "influential and frequently anthologized"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mandelbaum|first=Maurice|date=1965|title=Family Resemblances and Generalization concerning the Arts|jstor=20009169|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|volume=2|issue=3|pages=219–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1956 paper [http://louisdoulas.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/The-Role-of-Theory-in-Aesthetics.pdf ''The Role of Theory in Aesthetics''] which was to win him a 1955 Matchette Prize&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (an award now replaced by the [[American Philosophical Association]] book and article prizes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/page/article|title=Article Prize - The American Philosophical Association|website=www.apaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This essay explicitly modified the theory of art initially provided in his 1950 book ''Philosophy of the Arts''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which had been "[s]ubject to devastating criticisms from [[Margaret MacDonald (philosopher)|Margaret McDonald]] among others".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In ''The Role of Theory in Aesthetics'' Weitz "overturned his original claim.. that his empirical and organic theory could produce a closed or real definition of art" according to [http://www.artistsmatter.com/ Aili Bresnahan] and it is "this revised version that many philosophers have considered the ''sine qua non'' in support of the position that theories of art should be 'open'".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Supporters of Weitz's later view "for similar but non-identical reasons" include [[W. B. Gallie|W.B. Gallie]], W. E. Kennick and Benjamin R. Tilghman and detractors include [[M. H. Abrams|M.H. Abrams]], M.W. Beal, Lee Brown, [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]], and [[Maurice Mandelbaum]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mandelbaum in his 1965 paper ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20009169 Family Resemblances and Generalizations Concerning the Arts]''  refers to Weitz's paper and includes its author amongst those who, in support of the contention "that it is a mistake to attempt to discuss what art, or beauty, or the aesthetic, or a poem, essentially is... have made "explicit use of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s doctrine of [[family resemblance]]s". Mandelbaum claims that though he has "placed this at the forefront of his discussion.. Professor Weitz [has] made no attempt to analyze, clarify, or defend the doctrine itself".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Weitz's 1956 paper has been, as Meskin notes, "one of the most influential works in contemporary philosophy of art, and.. continues to generate debate and discussion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Multimedia'''  is [[content (media)|content]] that uses a combination of different [[content format|content forms]] such as text, audio, images, animations, video and [[interactive]] content. Multimedia contrasts with [[Media (communication)|media]] that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material.

Multimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with or accessed by [[information]] content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance.  Multimedia devices are [[electronic media]] devices used to store and experience multimedia content. Multimedia is distinguished from [[mixed media]] in [[fine art]]; for example, by including audio it has a broader scope. In the early years of multimedia the term "rich media" was synonymous with [[interactive media|interactive multimedia]], and "hypermedia" was an application of multimedia.

== Terminology ==
The term ''multimedia'' was coined by singer and artist Bob Goldstein (later '[[Bobb Goldsteinn]]') to promote the July 1966 opening of his "LightWorks at L'Oursin" show at [[Southampton]], Long Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Badii|first=Atta|last2=Fuschi|first2=David|last3=Khan|first3=Ali|last4=Adetoye|first4=Adedayo|date=2009-11-09|title=Accessibility-by-Design: A Framework for Delivery-Context-Aware Personalised Media Content Re-purposing|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-10308-7_14|journal=HCI and Usability for e-Inclusion|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=209–226|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-10308-7_14|isbn=9783642103070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein was perhaps aware of an American artist named Dick Higgins, who had two years previously discussed a new approach to art-making he called "intermedia".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.switched.com/2010/06/03/tech-art-history-part-2/|title=Tech Art History, Part| author= Matthew Zuras| publisher= Switched| date=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 1966, Richard Albarino of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' borrowed the terminology, reporting: "Brainchild of songscribe-comic Bob ('[[Washington Square (composition)|Washington Square]]') Goldstein, the 'Lightworks' is the latest ''multi-media'' music-cum-visuals to debut as discothèque fare."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Albarino, "Goldstein's LightWorks at Southhampton," ''Variety'', August 10, 1966. Vol. 213, No. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1968, the term "multimedia" was re-appropriated to describe the work of a political consultant, David Sawyer, the husband of Iris Sawyer—one of Goldstein's producers at L'Oursin.

[[File:Ford Show 1987.jpg|thumb|left|Multimedia (multi-image) setup for the 1988 Ford New Car Announcement Show, August 1987, Detroit, MI]] In the intervening forty years, the word has taken on different meanings. In the late 1970s, the term referred to presentations consisting of [[Multi-Image|multi-projector slide shows]] timed to an audio track. However, by the 1990s 'multimedia' took on its current meaning.

In the 1993 first edition of ''Multimedia: Making It Work'', Tay Vaughan declared "Multimedia is any combination of text, graphic art, sound, animation, and video that is delivered by computer. When you allow the user – the viewer of the project – to control what and when these elements are delivered, it is ''interactive multimedia''. When you provide a structure of linked elements through which the user can navigate, interactive multimedia becomes ''hypermedia''."&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Tay, 1993, Multimedia: Making It Work (first edition, {{ISBN|0-07-881869-9}}), Osborne/McGraw-Hill, Berkeley, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German language society [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]] recognized the word's significance and ubiquitousness in the 1990s by awarding it the title of [[Word of the year (Germany)|German 'Word of the Year']] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l23/l0/F.html#featuredEntry ''Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort!''] (in German) [[Spiegel Online]]&lt;/ref&gt; The institute summed up its rationale by stating "[Multimedia] has become a central word in the wonderful new media world".&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', January 1–7, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, ''multimedia'' refers to an electronically delivered combination of media including video, still images, audio, and text in such a way that can be accessed interactively. Much of the content on the web today falls within this definition as understood by millions. Some computers which were marketed in the 1990s were called "multimedia" computers because they incorporated a CD-ROM drive, which allowed for the delivery of several hundred megabytes of video, picture, and audio data. That era saw also a boost in the production of [[education software|educational]] multimedia [[CD-ROM]]s.

The term "video", if not used exclusively to describe motion photography, is ambiguous in multimedia terminology. ''[[Video]]'' is often used to describe the file format, delivery format, or presentation format instead of ''"[[footage]]"''  which is used to distinguish motion [[photography]] from ''"[[animation]]"'' of [[Artistic rendering|rendered]] motion imagery. Multiple forms of information content are often not considered modern forms of presentation such as audio or video. Likewise, single forms of information content with single methods of information processing (e.g. non-interactive audio) are often called multimedia, perhaps to distinguish [[:wiktionary:static|static]] media from [[:wiktionary:active|active]] media. In the [[fine arts]], for example, [[Leda Luss Luyken]]'s [[ModulArt]] brings two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting: variation of a theme and movement of and within a picture, making ''ModulArt'' an [[interactive]] multimedia form of art. [[Performing arts]] may also be considered multimedia considering that performers and [[theatrical property|props]] are multiple forms of both content and media.

== Major characteristics ==
'''Multimedia presentations''' may be viewed by person on [[Stage (theatre)|stage]], [[Image projector|projected]], [[transmitted]], or played locally with a [[Media player (application software)|media player]].  A broadcast may be a live or recorded multimedia presentation. Broadcasts and recordings can be either [[Analogue electronics|analog]] or [[Digital circuit|digital]] electronic media technology. Digital [[online]] multimedia may be downloaded or [[Streaming media|streamed]]. Streaming multimedia may be live or on-demand.

'''Multimedia games and simulations''' may be used in a physical environment with special effects, with multiple users in an online [[Computer networking|network]], or locally with an offline computer, [[game console|game system]], or [[simulator]].

The various formats of technological or digital multimedia may be intended to enhance the users' experience, for example to make it easier and faster to convey information. Or in entertainment or art, to transcend everyday experience.

[[File:Classical spectacular laser effects.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A [[Laser lighting display|lasershow]] is a live multimedia performance.]]
Enhanced levels of interactivity are made possible by combining multiple forms of media content. [[Online]] multimedia is increasingly becoming object-oriented and data-driven, enabling applications with [[Collaborative software|collaborative]] [[User innovation|end-user innovation]] and [[personalized|personalization]] on multiple forms of content over time.  Examples of these range from multiple forms of content on Web sites like photo galleries with both images (pictures) and title (text) user-updated, to simulations whose co-efficients, events, illustrations, animations or videos are modifiable, allowing the multimedia "experience" to be altered without reprogramming. In addition to seeing and hearing, [[haptic technology]] enables virtual objects to be felt. Emerging technology involving illusions of [[taste]] and [[odor|smell]] may also enhance the multimedia experience.

== Categorization ==
Multimedia may be broadly divided into '''linear''' and '''non-linear''' categories:
*Linear active content progresses often without any navigational control for the viewer such as a [[movie theater|cinema presentation]];
*Non-linear uses [[interactivity]] to control progress as with a [[video game]] or self-paced [[computer-based training]]. [[Hypermedia]] is an example of non-linear content.

Multimedia [[presentation]]s can be '''live''' or '''recorded''':
*A recorded presentation may allow interactivity via a [[Spatial navigation|navigation system]];
*A live multimedia presentation may allow interactivity via an interaction with the presenter or performer.

== Usage/application ==
[[File:Steven Koonin BP 2005-02-22.jpg|thumb|right|A presentation using [[Microsoft PowerPoint|Powerpoint]]. Corporate presentations may combine all forms of media content.]]
Multimedia finds its application in various areas including, but not limited to, [[Advertising|advertisements]], [[art]], [[education]], [[entertainment]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], [[business]], scientific [[research]] and [[Visual thinking|spatial temporal applications]]. Several examples are as follows:

=== Creative industries ===
[[Creative industries]] use multimedia for a variety of purposes ranging from fine arts, to entertainment, to commercial art, to [[journalism]], to media and software services provided for any of the industries listed below. An individual multimedia designer may cover the spectrum throughout their career. Request for their skills range from technical, to analytical, to creative.

==== Commercial uses ====
Much of the electronic [[old media|old]] and [[new media]] used by commercial artists and graphic designers is multimedia. Exciting presentations are used to grab and keep attention in [[advertising]]. Business to business, and interoffice communications are often developed by [[creative services]] firms for advanced multimedia presentations beyond simple slide shows to sell ideas or liven up training. Commercial multimedia developers may be hired to design for [[governmental services]] and [[Nonprofit|nonprofit services]] applications as well.

==== Entertainment and fine arts ====
Multimedia is heavily used in the entertainment industry, especially to develop [[special effect]]s in movies and animations (VFX, 3D animation, etc.). Multimedia games are a popular pastime and are software programs available either as CD-ROMs or online. Some [[video game]]s also use multimedia features.
Multimedia applications that allow users to actively participate instead of just sitting by as passive recipients of information are called ''interactive multimedia''.
In the [[arts]] there are [[multimedia art]]ists, whose minds are able to blend techniques using different media that in some way incorporates interaction with the viewer. One of the most relevant could be [[Peter Greenaway]] who is melding [[Film|cinema]] with [[opera]] and all sorts of digital media. Another approach entails the creation of multimedia that can be displayed in a traditional fine arts arena, such as an [[art gallery]]. Although multimedia display material may be volatile, the survivability of the content is as strong as any traditional media. Digital recording material may be just as durable and infinitely reproducible with perfect copies every time.

=== Education ===
In [[education]], multimedia is used to produce [[computer-based training]] courses (popularly called CBTs) and reference books like encyclopedia and almanacs. A CBT lets the user go through a series of presentations, text about a particular topic, and associated illustrations in various information formats. [[Edutainment]] is the combination of education with entertainment, especially multimedia entertainment.

Learning theory in the past decade has expanded dramatically because of the introduction of multimedia. Several lines of research have evolved, e.g. [[cognitive load]] and [[multimedia learning]].

From multimedia learning (MML) theory, David Roberts has developed a large group lecture practice using PowerPoint and based on the use of full-slide images in conjunction with a reduction of visible text (all text can be placed in the notes view’ section of PowerPoint).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Visual feasts of the mind: matching how we teach to how we learn {{!}} David Roberts {{!}} TEDxLoughboroughU|date=2016-12-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJyhTg26w-A&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLoI1XyYg-D9WW51FPWUWLi4ZEp_mVZv5c|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method has been applied and evaluated in 9 disciplines. In each experiment, students’ engagement and active learning has been approximately 66% greater, than with the same material being delivered using bullet points, text and speech, corroborating a range of theories presented by multimedia learning scholars like Sweller and Mayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lboro.academia.edu/DRoberts|title=David Roberts {{!}} Loughborough University - Academia.edu|website=lboro.academia.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of media convergence is also becoming a major factor in education, particularly higher education. Defined as separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications) and video that now share resources and interact with each other, media convergence is rapidly changing the curriculum in universities all over the world.

==== Educational technology ====
&lt;p&gt;Multimedia provides students with an alternate means of acquiring knowledge designed to enhance teaching and learning through various mediums and platforms. This technology allows students to learn at their own pace and gives teachers the ability to observe the individual needs of each student. The capacity for multimedia to be used in [[multi-disciplinary]] settings is structured around the idea of creating a hands-on learning environment through the use of technology &lt;ref name=":032"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malik and Agarwal|first=S. and A.|date=October 2012|title=Use of Multimedia as a New Educational Technology
Tool–A Study|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/669a/07732895b025b68f9308560411c55040ade6.pdf|journal=International Journal of Information and Education Technology|volume=2|pages=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Lessons can be tailored to the subject matter as well as be personalized to the students' varying levels of knowledge on the topic. Learning content can be managed through activities that utilize and take advantage of multimedia platforms&lt;ref name=":032" /&gt;. This kind of learning encourages interactive communication between students and teachers and opens feedback channels, introducing an active learning process especially with the prevalence of [[new media]] and [[social media]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andresen and Brink|first=Brent and Katja|date=2013|title=Multimedia in Education Curriculum|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002241/224187e.pdf|journal=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizaiton|volume=|pages=140|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Technology has impacted multimedia as it is largely associated with the use of computers or other electronic devices and [[digital media]] due to its capabilities concerning research, communication, problem-solving through simulations and feedback opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collis|first=Betty|title=Anticipating the Impact of Multimedia in Education: Lessons from the Literature|url=https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/6401710/K26499__.PDF|journal=Computers in Adult Education and Training|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Social work ===
Multimedia is a robust education and research methodology within the social work context. The five different multimedia which supports the education process are narrative media, [[interactive media]], communicative media, adaptive media, and productive media. Contrary to long-standing belief, multimedia technology in social work education existed before the prevalence of the internet. It takes the form of images, audio, and video into the curriculum. 

First introduced to [[social work]] education by Seabury &amp; Maple in 1993, multimedia technology is utilized to teach social work practice skills including interviewing, crisis intervention, and group work. In comparison with conventional teaching method, including face-to-face courses, multimedia education shortens transportation time, increases knowledge and confidence in a richer and more authentic context for learning, generates interaction between online users, and enhances understanding of conceptual materials for novice students. 

In an attempt to examine the impact of multimedia technology on students’ study, A. Elizabeth Cauble &amp; Linda P. Thurston conducted a research in which Building Family Foundations (BFF), an interactive multimedia training platform, was utilized to assess social work students’ reactions to multimedia technology on variables of knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy. The results states that respondents show a substantial increase in academic knowledge, confidence, and attitude. Multimedia also benefits students because it brings expert to students online, fits students’ schedule, allows students to choose courses that suit them. 

Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning suggests, "people learn more from words and pictures than from words alone." According to Mayer and other scholars, multimedia technology stimulates people’s brains by implementing visual and auditory effects, and thereby assists online users to learn efficiently. Researchers suggest that when users establish dual channels while learning, they tend to understand and memorize better. Mixed literature of this theory are still present in the field of multimedia and social work.

=== Language communication ===
With the spread and development of the English language around the world, it has become an important way of communicating between different people and cultures. Multimedia Technology creates a platform where language can be taught. The traditional form of teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) in classrooms have drastically changed with the prevalence of technology, making easier for students to obtain language learning skills. Multimedia motivates students to learn more languages through audio, visual and animation support. It also helps create English contexts since an important aspect of learning a language is developing their grammar, vocabulary and knowledge of pragmatics and genres. In addition, cultural connections in terms of forms, contexts, meanings and ideologies have to be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Weiyan|last2=Fang|first2=Fan|date=November 2008|title=Optimization of Multimedia English Teaching

Revista Electrónica de Investigación Educativa|volume=17|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its effects on learning behavior. Their findings based on [[Howard Gardner|Gardner]]’s theory of the “[[Motivation in second-language learning|socio-educational model]] of learner motivation and attitudes”, the study shows that there is easier access to language learning materials as well as increased motivation with MI along with the use of [[Computer-assisted language learning|Computer-Assisted Language Learning]].

=== Journalism ===
Newspaper companies all over are trying to embrace the new phenomenon by implementing its practices in their work. While some have been slow to come around, other major newspapers like ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' are setting the precedent for the positioning of the newspaper industry in a globalized world.

News reporting is not limited to traditional media outlets. Freelance journalists can make use of different new media to produce multimedia pieces for their news stories. It engages global audiences and tells stories with technology, which develops new communication techniques for both media producers and consumers. The Common Language Project, later renamed to [[The Seattle Globalist]], is an example of this type of multimedia journalism production.

Multimedia reporters who are mobile (usually driving around a community with cameras, audio and video recorders, and laptop computers) are often referred to as [[Mojo (mobile journalist)|mojos]], from ''mo''bile ''jo''urnalist.

=== Engineering ===
[[Software engineer]]s may use multimedia in [[Simulations#Computer simulators|computer simulations]] for anything from entertainment to [[training]] such as military or industrial training. Multimedia for [[Graphical user interface|software interfaces]] are often done as a collaboration between [[creative professional]]s and software engineers.

=== Mathematical and scientific research ===
In [[mathematics|mathematical]] and scientific [[research]], multimedia is mainly used for modeling and simulation. For example, a [[scientist]] can look at a [[Molecular modelling|molecular model]] of a particular substance and manipulate it to arrive at a new substance. Representative research can be found in journals such as the ''[[Journal of Multimedia]]''.

=== Medicine ===
In [[medicine]], [[Physician|doctors]] can get trained by looking at a virtual [[surgery]] or they can simulate how the [[human body]] is affected by [[disease]]s spread by [[virus]]es and [[bacterium|bacteria]] and then develop techniques to prevent it. Multimedia applications such as [[virtual surgery|virtual surgeries]] also help doctors to get practical training.

== Associations and conferences ==
In Europe, the reference organisation for the multimedia industry is the [[European Multimedia Associations Convention]] (EMMAC).

Scholarly conferences about multimedia include:
* [[ACM Multimedia]]
* [[IEEE]] International Conference on Multimedia &amp; Expo (ICME)

[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned edit.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'' in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]]]
[[File:Pietà (Vesperbild).jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Pietà (Southern German, Cloisters)|Pietà'']], German, c. 1375–1400]]
A '''pietà''' ({{IPA-it|pjeˈta}}; meaning "pity", "compassion") is a subject in [[Christian art]] depicting the [[Virgin Mary]] cradling the dead body of [[Jesus]], most often found in [[sculpture]]. As such, it is a particular form of the [[Lamentation of Christ]], a scene from the [[Passion of Christ]] found in cycles of the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]. When Christ and the Virgin are surrounded by other figures from the [[New Testament]], the subject is strictly called a ''lamentation'' in English, although ''pietà'' is often used for this as well, and is the normal term in Italian.

==Context and development==
Pietà is one of the three common artistic representations of a sorrowful Virgin Mary, the other two being [[Mater Dolorosa]] (Mother of Sorrows) and [[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]] (here stands the mother).&lt;ref&gt;Arthur de Bles, 2004 ''How to Distinguish the Saints in Art by Their Costumes, Symbols and Attributes'' {{ISBN|1-4179-0870-X}} page 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Jameson, 2006 ''Legends of the Madonna: as represented in the fine arts'' {{ISBN|1-4286-3499-1}} page 37&lt;/ref&gt; The other two representations are most commonly found in paintings, rather than sculpture, although combined forms exist.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see [[Noël Quillerier]]'s at [[Oratorio della Nunziatella]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Passion of Jesus (sculpture "Crucifixion of Jesus" observing "Virgin Mary cradling the dead body of Jesus").jpg|thumb|250px|Sculpture ''Crucifixion of Jesus'' observing ''Virgin Mary cradling the dead body of Jesus'' (Salzburg work, 1470s), [[National Gallery of Slovenia]].]]

The pietà developed in Germany (where it is called the "Vesperbild") about 1300, reached Italy about 1400, and was especially popular in Central European [[Andachtsbilder]].&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II'',1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, pp. 179-181, figs 622-39, {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many German and Polish 15th-century examples in wood greatly emphasise Christ's wounds. The [[Deposition of Christ]] and the Lamentation or Pietà form the 13th of the [[Stations of the Cross]], as well as one of the [[Seven Sorrows of the Virgin]].

Although the pietà most often shows the Virgin Mary holding Jesus, there are other compositions, including those where [[God the Father]] participates in holding Jesus (see gallery below). In Spain the Virgin often holds up one or both hands, sometimes with Christ's body slumped to the floor. 

=== Michelangelo ===
{{main|Pietà (Michelangelo)}}

A [[Pietà (Michelangelo)|famous example]] by [[Michelangelo]] was carved from a block of marble and is located in [[St. Peter's Basilica|St.&amp;nbsp;Peter's Basilica]] in the [[Vatican City]]. The body of Christ is different from most earlier pietà statues, which were usually smaller and in wood. The Virgin is also unusually youthful, and in repose, rather than the older, sorrowing Mary of most pietàs. She is shown as youthful for two reasons; God is the source of all beauty and she is one of the closest to God, also the exterior is thought as the revelation of the interior (the virgin is morally beautiful). The ''Pietà'' with the Virgin Mary is also unique among Michelangelo's sculptures, because it was the only one he ever signed, upon hearing that visitors thought it had been sculpted by [[Cristoforo Solari]], a competitor.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Wallace, 1995 ''Life and Early Works (Michelangelo: Selected Scholarship in English)'' {{ISBN|0-8153-1823-5}} page 233&lt;/ref&gt; His signature is carved as ''MICHAELA[N]GELUS BONAROTUS FLORENTIN[US] FACIEBA[T]'' "Michelangelo Buonarroti the Florentine did it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michelangelo.net/pieta/|title=Pieta by Michelangelo|author=|date=|website=www.michelangelo.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pieta Bandini Opera Duomo Florence n01.jpg|thumb|''[[The Deposition (Michelangelo)|The Deposition]]'', 1547-1555, [[Michelangelo]], [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]], [[Florence]]]]
In a lesser known Michelangelo pietà, ''[[The Deposition (Michelangelo)|The Deposition]]'', it is not the Virgin Mary who is holding Jesus' body, but rather [[Nicodemus]] (or possibly [[Joseph of Arimathea]]), [[Mary Magdalene]], and the Virgin Mary. There is some indication that the man in the hood is based on a self-portrait of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michelangelo.net/deposition/|title=The Deposition by Michelangelo|author=|date=|website=www.michelangelo.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is housed in the [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]] in [[Florence]] and is also known as the ''Florentine Pietà''.

A generation later, the Spanish painter [[Luis de Morales]] painted a number of highly emotional pietàs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-athenaeum.org/art/list.php?m=a&amp;s=tu&amp;aid=452|title=Luis de Morales - Artworks|author=|date=|website=www.the-athenaeum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with examples in the [[Louvre]] and [[Museo del Prado]].

In January 2008, Internet messages surfaced urging violence against Pokemones (mainly because of borrowing aspects from other subcultures, such as emo hair, [[hip-hop]] clothes, and for using the [[Crip Walk|c-walk]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} People belonging to the subculture increasingly began to be attacked outside discos and pubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Rock Against Sexism''''' (RAS) was a political and cultural movement dedicated to challenging [[sexism]] in the [[rock music]] community, [[popular culture|pop culture]] and in the world at large.  It was primarily a part of the [[punk rock]] music and arts scene.

RAS started in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1978, and by the mid-1980s also had a presence in [[North America]].  It was strongly inspired and influenced by [[Rock Against Racism]] and the two movements had many of the same participants.

In the UK, it began amid controversy when a [[Rock Against Racism]] event hired some [[Rastafarian]] [[reggae]] bands that some participants felt were [[misogynistic]]. This resulted in a discussion of [http://www.punk77.co.uk/graphics/guitarwomensexism16.12.78NME.jpg sexism in music and art]. The bands ([[Aswad (band)|Aswad]] and [[Misty in Roots]]) either responded  by saying it was the will of [[God]], or that they didn't know what sexism was. The UK Rock Against Sexism often gained press coverage in the music press, such as the ''[[NME]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In the US, RAS [[Boston]] sponsored monthly dance parties at a local gay bar, the 1270.  They put out a [[zine]] and promoted art events and gigs by non-sexist bands.  RAS sponsored music workshops on writing, playing and promoting events.

==Legacy==

Rock Against Sexism's musical and political legacy was many more women playing in bands, working as promoters, and an increased awareness of women's and queer perspectives in the punk rock community.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Many trace the [[riot grrrl]] movement in the 1990s to RAS roots. It challenged [[heterosexism]], [[homophobia]], [[sexism]] and [[elitism]], while challenging stereotypes of women, and the way they are represented.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Many later punk bands challenged the machismo of rock'n'roll by diversifying into [[cuddlecore]], as well as the less [[rockist]] side of [[post-punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} It could be argued that RAS may have been the catalyst, as the advent of [[twee pop]] in the mid-1980s lead to rejection of the machismo of [[hardcore punk]] at the time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The '''Scottish Storytelling Centre''', the world's first purpose built modern centre for live storytelling, is located on the High Street in [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Royal Mile]], [[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom]]. It was formally opened on 1 June 2006 by [[Patricia Ferguson]] MSP, [[Minister for Culture]] in the [[Scottish Executive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottisharts.org.uk/1/artsinscotland/literature/projects/archive/storytellingcentre2006.aspx|title=Scottish Arts Council - Archive - Storytelling Centre 2006|website=www.scottisharts.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new building, designed by [[Malcolm Fraser (architect)|Malcolm Fraser Architects]], replaced the former Netherbow Arts Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/city-s-new-storytelling-centre-ready-for-a-happy-beginning-1-983997|title=City's new storytelling centre ready for a happy beginning|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which itself replaced the Moray-Knox Church, demolished in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/115115/edinburgh-43-high-street-netherbow-centre|title=Edinburgh, 43 High Street, Netherbow Centre {{!}} Canmore|website=canmore.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporates [[John Knox House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5094530.stm|title=The word on the Royal Mile|date=2006-06-20|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used as a venue during the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

In June 2016 the Centre celebrated its 10th anniversary, which coincided with a programme of events to mark the 20th anniversary of patron [[George Mackay Brown]]'s death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/news_and_events/news/2016/church_celebrates_storytelling_centres_first_decade|title=Church celebrates Storytelling Centre's first decade|last=Scotland|first=The Church of|date=30 July 2016|website=www.churchofscotland.org.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Centre was nominated for Best Performing Arts Venue in the [[Sunday Herald]] Culture Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15340696.Sunday_Herald_Culture_Awards_2017_shortlist_revealed/|title=Sunday Herald Culture Awards 2017 shortlist revealed|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seattle Fishermen's Memorial''''', or '''''Fisherman's Memorial''''', is an outdoor sculpture by Ronald Petty, installed at [[Fishermen's Terminal]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], in the United States.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|title=Seattle Fishermen's Memorial, (sculpture).|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!317189~!0#focus|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument was designed in 1987 and dedicated in October 1988. It commemorates Seattle fisherman who died since 1900.

==Description==
[[File:Seattle Fishermen's Memorial 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Corner of the memorial's base and the adjacent wall]]

Ronald Petty's ''Seattle Fishermen's Memorial'' is installed at Docks 8 and 9 at Seattle's [[Fishermen's Terminal]]. The monument features a {{Convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} cast stone column supporting a [[Bronze sculpture|bronze]] standing male figure, who holds a fishing line in his proper right hand. A fish is attached to the end of the line. The column's base is a bronze relief depicting 32 "sea creatures", including fish. Adjacent to the column is a concrete wall with bronze plaques displaying the names of around 460 Seattle fishermen who died since 1900.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Seattle Fishermen's Memorial 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Wreath in memory of the dead of the ''Arctic Rose'', 2007]]

The memorial was designed in 1987 to "honor commercial fishermen from the Seattle area who have been lost at sea". It was dedicated on October 8, 1988. The sculpture was surveyed and deemed "well maintained" by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s "[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]" program in January 1994. It is administered by the Seattle Fishermen's Memorial Foundation.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

A '''service record''' is a collection of either electronic or printed material which provides a [[documentary evidence|documentary]] [[history]] of a person's activities and accomplishments while serving as a member of a given [[organization]].  Service records are most often associated with the [[military]], but are commonly found in other groups, such as large [[corporations]] or for use by [[employee]]s of a civilian [[government]].

==Australian armed forces==
Service records for the [[Australian Army]], are available at the National Archives of Australia website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/index.aspx National Archives of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-boer.aspx Boer War records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-wwi.aspx First World War records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-between.aspx inter-World War records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-wwii.aspx Second World War records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-after.aspx Post–Second World War records&lt;/ref&gt; The service records of the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force are also available.

World War I service records provide the dates when the person was "in the field", that is with his unit on active service, if and when they embarked for oversea service, and the names of the units in which the person served. The service record also documents other changes—promotions, transfers, time at base, the date and place of sickness or wounding, and the names of hospital or clearing station where the person was treated.

==Nazi Germany==
The records of [[Nazi Germany]] are extensive and the record keeping ability of the [[Nazi Party]] was generally considered to be extremely meticulous.  Service records of Nazi organizations are maintained at the [[Berlin Document Center]], in [[Berlin, Germany]], with several [[microfiche]] copies of these records available at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] in [[College Park, Maryland]].

Records of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', that is the regular armed forces of Germany during [[World War II]], are maintained at the ''[[Bundesarchiv]]'', also in [[Berlin]].

{{main|Military personnel file (United States)}}
Service records of the [[United States armed forces]] are considered vital documents both for historical reasons and also to help secure [[veteran]] benefits for discharged or retired service members.  In addition, service records of the U.S. military provide a chronology of a service member's career and thus ensure accurate tracking of accomplishments, activities, and promotions.

Active duty U.S. military service records are maintained by the various branches of the U.S. armed forces.  Retired and discharged service records are maintained at the [[Military Personnel Records Center]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

After 2005, most U.S. military service records are retained by the military branch since most such records are electronically stored.

The '''Sheffield Repertory Theatre''' was a [[theatre company]] in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]].

Herbert Prince, a railway clerk, founded the amateur dramatics society in 1919,&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;Frank Long "Sheffield" in Colin Chambers ''Twentieth Century Theatre'', London: Continuum, 2002, p.687&lt;/ref&gt; a first meeting is recorded at the Oxford Street Settlement in Shipton Street that year, which became the Sheffield Repertory Theatre in 1923. A meeting in October 1923 formed an Executive Committee for a professional Company, consisting of Wilfred Vickers, W.C. Landon, C.V. McNally, A. Ballard, H.W. d. Harkcom and [[Herbert M. Prentice]]. The subscription was 3 [[shilling]]s and [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]].

At the first Annual Meeting in January 1924, the aims were formulated:
#To promote and encourage interest in the Drama and kindred Arts.
#To produce Plays
#To arrange lectures, recitals, play-readings and discussions
#To promote social intercourse amongst the members
#To form a library of dramatuc literature for the use of members
#The establishment of a permanent Repertory Theatre in Sheffield

Their first performances took place at the Little Theatre in Shipton Street. Later the Company hired the South Street Schoolroom in Eldon Street. In 1928 the Company gained a permanent venue,&lt;ref name="Long"/&gt; and moved to the former Temperance Hall, in Townhead Street. The seating of this new Repertory Theatre was 319 in the saloon (Stalls) and 222 in the Balcony.

With the outbreak of war in 1939, the theatre was closed, along with nearly all British theatres by a government fearful of German bombing and consequent mass loss of life in such public buildings. This closure led to a most bizarre period. In order to resolve the financial crisis the Company arranged to reform in Southport, a de-restricted area, and carry on the business there. Despite the government allowing the theatre in Sheffield to re-open by 1940, a binding contract had already been signed in Southport. It thus proved impractical to operate in both towns and the decision was taken that the Company should remain in Southport. Over 240 productions took place in the [[Lancashire]] resort by a Yorkshire repertory during the war. The building in Townhead Street was eventually hired out for storage.

At the end of the war, the Company was able to return to its natural home, although it owed a debt to Southport for its survival. The theatre was in a dishevelled condition, following its utilitarian usage during the war, but the Company, helped by willing volunteers successfully renovated the auditorium in 1945, allowing it to re-open to the theatre-going public, with the appropriately titled play, ''The Peaceful Inn''.

By 1951, the theatre was a cultural and financial success. Most patrons bought season tickets, and so would attend every new performance. Sheffield was one of the few regional theatres to adopt a fortnightly cycle of plays. This was generally accepted to provide a much higher quality of performance; most repertory changed weekly. Plays running the gamut from Shakespeare to interpretations of the latest 'West End Smash' would alternate throughout the year. The festive season saw not a '[[Pantomime|Panto]]' but a play designed to appeal to children, that would nonetheless cultivate their minds.

By 1953 the theatre was struggling to cope with its success. The building failed to meet increasing health and safety demands. The management took the decision to completely rebuild it. Stripped back to its bare walls, the interior was entirely renewed as a sleek 'Fifties' auditorium replaced the stippled decor of the out-dated theatre. The Company had become so successful in the ensuing eight years since the war, that £20,000 could be invested in the internal rebuild of the premises.

In March 1954, the theatre re-opened and its success continued unabated, under the leadership of Geoffrey Ost, who had been the director since 1938, a service broken only by his wartime call-up. In 1959 Ost was awarded an honorary Doctorate at the University (a Scholarship still exists under his name). The future acting stars who were members of the Company include [[Peter Sallis]], [[Patrick McGoohan]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Paul Eddington]], [[Keith Barron]] and Sir [[Nigel Hawthorne]]. Actors such as Sir [[Alec Guinness]] and [[Patrick Macnee]] also performed in individually contracted productions and Sir [[Donald Wolfit]] was an assistant stage manager there. However Sheffield Rep. was really all about the local community - it only survived and prospered because many local people gave their labour and support on a voluntary or semi-professional basis, although plenty of local paid work was also provided.

The company was identified as a significant repertory company in the UK by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] during the 1960s, and a trust was formed to oversee the construction of a new building.&lt;ref name="Hartnoll"&gt;Phyllis Hartnoll (ed) ''The Oxford Companion to the Theatre'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Crucible Theatre]] replaced the old theatre in 1971 financed by the Arts Council, Sheffield City Council and public donations.&lt;ref name="Hartnoll"/&gt; Geoffrey Ost was still there, noted as 'General Advisor'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2479">'''Ski-U-Mah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|k|aɪ|juː|ˈ|m|ɑː}} {{respell|SKY|yoo|MAH}}) is a slogan used at the [[University of Minnesota]] since 1884.

U of M Rugby captain John Adams had heard [[Sioux]] boys yell "ski-yoo!" when they won canoe races on [[Lake Pepin]]. He incorrectly interpreted that phrase as the Sioux word for victory, or exultation and suggested it as a cheer for the University rugby team. A co-captain added the "mah" to make it rhyme with "rah" and created "Ski-U-Mah!"  The slogan has been used to cheer on the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers]] athletics teams, and was written into the lyrics of University songs including the "[[Minnesota Rouser]]", "[[Go Gopher Victory]]", "Minnesota Fight" and "[[Minnesota March]]".

[[Dakota language|Dakota]]–[[Lakota language|Lakota]] specialists state that the word "Ski-U" or "Ski-yoo" or "Ski-oo" are not Sioux victory cries or the Sioux word for winning. What Adams heard on Lake Pepin, "sky-yoo," may have just been an interjection, similar to "woo hoo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Croman|first=John|title=I’ve Been Wondering: Ski-U-Mah?|url=http://www.kare11.com/news/investigative/extras/extra_article.aspx?storyid=122027|publisher=KARE 11 News|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Dakota-Lakota words or phrases that have been suggested for what Adams heard include:

* "Schkee ooh poh!" or "Scheee ooh!" 
* Scheeh/scheen-shay, which means "Try Hard"
* Oh-hee-yah, which means "To win"
* Oh-hee-un-yum, oh-hee-oohn-yum, which means "We won"

The slogan has had other uses at the University through the years.  In the mid-20th century, ''[[Ski-U-Mah (magazine)]]'' was a U of M humor magazine.  It is currently used on the football team's helmets and jerseys,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-watch.com/2012/01/28/minnesota-gopher-jersey-collector-shawn-kennedy0128/&lt;/ref&gt; as the name  of a meeting room at the McNamara Alumni Center, a campus tailgate lot/parking lot near [[TCF Bank Stadium]], and as the title of a yearbook-style publication published by the [[Minnesota Daily]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1918">[[Lowell Liebermann]]’s '''Symphony No. 2, Op. 67''' (1999) is a [[symphony]] for large orchestra and [[SATB]] chorus, with texts adapted from the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]].  It is about 40 minutes long, and arranged into four movements to be played without a break.&lt;ref&gt;Kenaston, Karen S. "An Approach to the Critical Evaluation of Settings of the Poetry of Walt Whitman: Lowell Liebermann's ''Symphony No. 2''," page 69.  University of North Texas, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was commissioned by Ford Lacy and Cece Smith for the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]] and Chorus’ centennial celebration.  The work was premiered in 2000, with [[Andrew Litton]] conducting the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.  The Second Symphony was very favorably received at its premiere, with TIME describing it as, “Now brazen and glittering, now radiantly visionary...the work of a composer unafraid of grand gestures and openhearted lyricism.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,39943,00.html?iid=digg_share&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the symphony has since received harsh criticism due to its exceptionally free embrace of [[tonality]] and its distinctly optimistic outlook.  Scott Cantrell in particular has denounced the Second Symphony as "foolhardy" in the "cynical" environment of today.&lt;ref&gt;Kenaston, Karen S. "An Approach to the Critical Evaluation of Settings of the Poetry of Walt Whitman: Lowell Liebermann's ''Symphony No. 2''," pages 112-113.  University of North Texas, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Second Symphony was recorded in 2000 on the Delos International label with Andrew Litton conducting the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.

The '''Symphony in C''' is an early work by the French composer [[Georges Bizet]].  According to ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove's Dictionary]]'', the symphony "reveals an extraordinarily accomplished talent for a 17-year-old student, in melodic invention, thematic handling and orchestration." &lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/51829 |title=Bizet, Georges. |last1=Macdonald |first1=Hugh |date=15 May 2009 |subscription=yes |work=Grove Music Online |publisher=Oxford Music Online |accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bizet started work on the symphony on 29 October 1855, four days after turning 17, and finished it roughly a month later.&lt;ref&gt;"The manuscript of Bizet's symphony is marked: "begun October 29, 1855; finished November [number illegible] 1855."{{Harvnb|Shanet|1958|p=470}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written while he was studying at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]] under the composer [[Charles Gounod]], and was evidently a student assignment. Bizet showed no apparent interest in having it performed or published, and the piece was never played in his lifetime. He used certain material from the symphony in later works, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shanet|1958|pp=461&amp;ndash;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no mention of the work in Bizet's letters, and it was unknown to his earlier biographers. His widow, Geneviève Halévy (1849–1926), gave the manuscript to [[Reynaldo Hahn]], who left it along with other papers to the archives of the conservatory library, where it was found in 1933 by [[Jean Chantavoine]].&lt;ref name="Dean 1975"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dean|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanet 1958 461"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shanet|1958|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, Bizet's first British biographer Douglas Charles Parker (1885–1970) showed the manuscript to the conductor [[Felix Weingartner]], who led the first performance in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], on 26 February 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Bizet: His Life and Works |last=Parker |first=Douglas Charles |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1926 |publisher=K.

The symphony was immediately hailed as a youthful masterpiece on a par with [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s overture to ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', written at about the same age, and quickly became part of the standard [[Romantic music|Romantic repertoire]].&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;{{citation |last1=Klein |first1=John W. |last2=Parker |first2=Douglas Charles |last3=Russell |first3=John F. |date=February 1936 |title="Bizet's Symphony" (Correspondence) |journal=The Musical Times |volume=77 |issue=116 |pages=115 |jstor=919013 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received its first recording on 26 November 1937, by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] under [[Walter Goehr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charm.kcl.ac.uk/ CHARM (Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music).

==History==

===Background===

The symphony is widely assumed to have been a student assignment, written toward the end of Bizet's nine years of study at the Conservatoire de Paris.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; At the Conservatoire, Bizet had come increasingly under the influence of Charles Gounod, whose works in the first half of the 1850s&amp;mdash;including ''[[Sapho (Gounod)|Sapho]]'' (1851), ''Ulysse'' (1852) and the Symphony No. 1 in D major (1855)&amp;mdash;had a strong impact on the young composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|1993|pp=32&amp;ndash;33}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Bizet would later write of this period: "Fifteen years ago &lt;nowiki&gt;[i.e.1855/56]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, when I used to say "Sapho and the choruses from Ulysse are masterpieces", people laughed in my face. I was right...."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Curtiss|Bizet|1950|p=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, with Gounod his principal mentor, Bizet wrote his first three major compositions: the opera ''[[La maison du docteur]]'', an overture, and the Symphony in C.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; A year before Bizet started to compose the Symphony, Gounod had written his own first Symphony (in D), composed at the end of 1854 in the wake of a tepid response to his opera ''[[La nonne sanglante]]''.&lt;ref name="Grove2"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40694 |title=Gounod, Charles-François. |last1=Huebner |first1=Steven |date=15 May 2009 |work=Grove Music Online |publisher=Oxford Music Online |accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gounod's Symphony in D proved a popular work, receiving at least eight performances in Paris alone within the space of a year.&lt;ref name=Grove2/&gt; Bizet was subsequently engaged with writing a transcription of the work for two pianos, one of a number of commissions to transcribe Gounod's work Bizet accepted to earn extra income.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|1993|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proximity to his mentor's work emerges in the close stylistic resemblance of Bizet's symphony with Gounod's; it may also explain why Bizet chose not to publish his symphony.&lt;ref name="Dean 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shanet|1958|pp=473&amp;ndash;476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarities with Gounod's Symphony in D===
[[File:Gounod-Bizet.png|left|thumb|alt=An illustration from Bizet's opening movement of his Symphony in C in which he quotes Gounod's symphony in D|An example of Bizet's quoting Gounod]]
The numerous stylistic, orchestral, melodic and harmonic similarities between the Gounod and Bizet symphonies make it clear that Bizet was emulating and, in certain cases, directly quoting his teacher. As Howard Shanet, who revived Gounod's symphony with the Columbia University Orchestra in 1955, observed, "the first glance at &lt;nowiki&gt;[Gounod's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; score ... made it clear that the young Bizet had copied all its most conspicuous features in his Symphony in C."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shanet|1958|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, in fact, so many references, [[Parody#Music|parodies]] and quotations from Gounod in Bizet's work that it is likely the young composer was consciously paying homage to his celebrated teacher. His close involvement with Gounod's orchestral score in realising the two-piano transcription would have given Bizet the opportunity to explore many of its orchestral nuances and incorporate them into his own work and may explain why Bizet's first full-fledged symphonic work was such an unusually well-polished and well-orchestrated composition. As Bizet would later write to his former teacher "You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you. You are the cause, I am the consequence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|1993|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment permeates the compositional spirit of the Symphony in C.

All four movements of Bizet's symphony employ devices found in the earlier Gounod piece. The two inner movements are strikingly similar in form, rhythm and melodic shape.&lt;ref&gt;Examples are drawn from {{Harvnb|Shanet|1958|pp=463&amp;ndash;470}}, which includes illustrations&lt;/ref&gt;

'''First movement'''&lt;br&gt;
Like Gounod, Bizet bookends the opening movement with an opening [[tutti]] chord and closing [[Coda (music)|codetta]] that are essentially parodic in form. In two passages, at measures 86ff and 141ff Bizet quotes directly from Gounod, measures 119ff and mm. 331ff. (See illustration.)

'''Second movement'''&lt;br&gt;
Bizet draws very closely from Gounod's ''Allegretto moderato'' in the Symphony in D. Like Gounod, Bizet composed a small [[fugue]] as the development section, using an identical scoring in the order of entry. Both start [[Dynamics (music)|sotto voce]] with [[staccato]] [[Articulation (music)|articulation]] and share a closely similar phrase shape. And in both works, the first theme is brought back in the recapitulation over passages in the strings that recall the fugal development.

'''Third movement'''&lt;br&gt;
Although quite different in tempo and character, Bizet's scherzo makes several references to the Gounod's scherzo in the trio section. Both are variants of the opening theme and both are played on the woodwinds over a string pedal-point.

'''Final Movement'''&lt;br&gt;
Beyond a general thematic sympathy between the two finales, Bizet directly imitates Gounod's closing phrase in his own work, drawing on the same rhythmic shape and architecture to create a miniature coda.

Finally, the scoring for both works is identical: a smaller, classical orchestra (omitting, for instance, [[piccolo]], [[harp]] or [[trombone]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shanet|1958|p=471}}. For the general scholarly endorsement of Shanet's conclusions, see {{Harvnb|Flynn|2009|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bizet’s symphony was closely drawing on Gounod's work, critics view it as a much superior composition, showing a precocious and sophisticated grasp of harmonic language and design, as well as originality and melodic inspiration. Since it has resurfaced, Bizet's Symphony in C has far outshone Gounod's work in the repertoire, both in terms of performance and numbers of recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Compare, for instance, the (up-to-date) discography in {{Harvnb|Flynn|2009|p=203ff.}} (Gounod) with the (outdated) one in {{Harvnb|Robert|1981|pp=184ff.}} (Bizet)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suppression===

That the Symphony was never even mentioned in Bizet's extensive correspondence, let alone published in his lifetime, has given rise to speculation as to the composer's motives in suppressing the work. According to a 1938 correspondence from Bizet's publisher, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Antoine de Choudens, founder of the Choudens Publishing House and Bizet's editor, had in his possession Bizet's youthful symphony. If he never published it, this was because Bizet himself was opposed to the idea, having introduced into his work ''[[Don Procopio]]'' an excerpt from the symphony he thought suitable for this theatre piece. This latter was published by Choudens in 1905. Further, the widow of G. Bizet, respecting the wishes of her husband, confirmed her husband's intentions to the publisher. (signed) Chevrier-Choudens&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation |author= Chevrier-Choudens |date=November 1938 |title=A l'occasion de la symphonie en ut de Bizet |journal=Revue de Musicologie |volume=19 |issue=68 |pages=139 |language=French |jstor=924942 |doi= 10.2307/924942 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
This explanation, however, was rejected by Shanet, who instead argued that Bizet was worried that his own work was too similar to Gounod's:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The probable reason for Bizet's unwillingness to publish the Symphony in C was ... &lt;nowiki&gt;[his sensitivity]&lt;/nowiki&gt; about his imitation of certain features of Gounod's Symphony in D. The very success of Gounod's piece, which must have stimulated the young man to copy some of its methods, would later have
deterred him from having his own symphony performed or published. For it must be remembered that the Gounod symphony was then one of the most famous French works of its kind, and that Bizet had borrowed from it precisely those features that everyone else had noticed and admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shanet|1958|p=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since no evidence exists one way or the other, Bizet's motives must remain conjectural. However, the symphonic genre was not a popular one for French composers in the second half of the nineteenth century, who instead concentrated most of their large-scale efforts on theatrical and operatic music. Gounod himself observed "There is only one way for a composer who desires to make a real name - the operatic stage."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{Harvnb|Shanet|1958|p=472}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bias against formal symphonic writing was also entrenched within the culture of the Paris Conservatory, which considered the symphony to be (as in the case of Bizet's own) a mere student exercise on the path toward submissions for the [[Prix de Rome]], the highest prize a young French composer could attain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hart|2006|p=239&amp;nbsp;240}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the noted musicologist [[Julien Tiersot]] observed in 1903:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In &lt;nowiki&gt;[19th-century]&lt;/nowiki&gt; France the symphony was considered a scholastic exercise, so much so that for a long time it appeared only with those competing to be "sent to Rome." It seems that a well-written symphony was the supreme test of the talent of young composers crowned by the Academy. ... But it clearly had no greater importance nor a higher artistic meaning in the eyes of the judges.... Gounod, [[Félicien-César David|Félicien David]], [[Napoléon Henri Reber|Henri Reber]], they too, in their lost moments, wrote symphonies, works that did justice to the purity of their intentions, but none of which has remained alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tiersot|1903|p=393&amp;nbsp;394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Instead, as Tiersot himself noted, French symphonic efforts gravitated toward the [[Suite (music)|symphonic suite]], of which Bizet's misnamed [[Roma Symphony (Bizet)|Roma Symphony]] was a pioneering example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tiersot|1903|p=396}} "Bizet semble être le premier qui ait écrit en ce genre. L'on a encore exécuté de lui cette année, parmi la serie des symphonies françaises, une oeuvre intitulé Roma. Est-ce bien une symphonie? A considérer le seul style, on en peut déjà douter. Le doute se change en certitude négative lorsqu'on examine de près les éléments de la composition."&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, where his youthful Symphony was written in less than a month, the Roma "Symphony" occupied Bizet for years, and he remained at his death unsatisfied with the work. Unlike the Symphony in C, Bizet tried to infuse his Roma Symphony with more gravitas and thematic weight. Of the two works, it is Bizet's student composition which has garnered much more critical praise.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

It may also have been, as hinted at by the 1938 correspondence from Chevrier-Choudens, that Bizet intended to mine his student effort for material in what he saw as more serious compositions (including, possibly, two aborted symphonies written while in Rome).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dean|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; The melodic theme of the slow movement reappears in ''[[Les pêcheurs de perles]]'' as the introduction to Nadir's air "De mon amie." And Bizet recycled the same melody in the trio of the Minuet from ''[[L'Arlésienne (Bizet)|L'Arlésienne]]''. In both cases, Bizet retained his original scoring for [[oboe]].  As noted by Chevrier-Choudens, Bizet also used the second theme of the finale in Act I of ''[[Don Procopio]]''.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Finally, since he was only 36 when he died, it is entirely possible that had he lived, Bizet might have decided later to publish the work. Whatever the case, the work remained unpublished, unplayed, and unknown at Bizet's death, passing into the possession of his widow, Geneviève Halévy.

===Rediscovery and posthumous popularity===

Although Bizet's first biographer, Douglas Charles Parker, is widely credited with bringing the symphony to public attention, it was the French musicologist Jean Chantavoine who first revealed the existence of the work, in an article published in the periodical ''Le Ménestrel'' in 1933. Parker, alerted to its existence, informed the Austrian conductor [[Felix Weingartner]], who gave the highly successful premiere in Basel in 1935. The work was published the same year by [[Universal-Edition]].&lt;ref name="Shanet 1958 461"/&gt;

Within a short time of its publication, the work had been widely performed. The musicologist John W. Klein, who attended its London premiere, found the work "enchanting" and "charming," a view that has been generally echoed since.&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt; Although a student assignment, many musicologists find the symphony shows a precocious grasp of harmonic language and design, a sophistication which has invited comparisons with [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].&lt;ref&gt;By, among others, Jean Chantavoine, Paul Stefan and Martin Cooper&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

[[George Balanchine]] made a ballet to the music, which he originally called ''Le Palais de Cristal'' and later simply ''[[Symphony in C (ballet)|Symphony in C]]'', first presented by the [[Ballet de l'Opéra National de Paris|Paris Opera Ballet]] in 1947.

'''''The Barque of Dante''''' ({{Lang-fr|La Barque de Dante}}), sometimes known as '''''Dante and Virgil in Hell''''' (''Dante et Virgile aux enfers''), is the first major painting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A World History of Art |author1=Hugh Honour  |author2=John Fleming  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher= Macmillan Reference Books |year= 1982 |isbn=0333235835 |page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the French artist [[Eugène Delacroix]], and one of the works signalling a shift in the character of narrative painting from [[Neo-Classicism]] towards the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]]. It was completed for the opening of the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1822 and currently hangs in the [[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]], Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225128&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225128&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500815&amp;bmLocale=en |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120907124208/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225128&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225128&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500815&amp;bmLocale=en |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2012-09-07 |title= Selections |language= French }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is loosely based on fictional events taken from canto eight of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante’s]] ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''. A leaden, smoky mist and the blazing [[Dis (Divine Comedy)|City of the Dead]] form the backdrop against which the poet Dante endures a fearful crossing of the [[Styx|River Styx]]. He is steadied by the learned poet of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] [[Virgil]] as they plough through waters heaving with tormented souls.

The arrangement of figures is for the most part compliant with the tenets of the cool, reflective Neo-Classicism that had dominated French painting for nearly four decades. There is a group of central upright figures, and a rational arrangement of subsidiary figures, all in horizontal [[Plane (geometry)|planes]], and observing studied poses.

== Themes ==
[[File:1822 delacroix debt to gericault.png|thumb|right|330px|Géricault’s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]''&amp;nbsp; was a powerful influence for Delacroix.]]

''The Barque of Dante'' was an artistically ambitious work, and although the composition is conventional, the painting in some important respects broke unmistakably free of the French Neo-Classical tradition.

The smoke to the rear and the fierce movement of the garment in which the oarsman [[Phlegyas]] is wrapped indicate a strong wind, and most of the individuals in the painting are facing into it. The river is choppy and the boat is lifted to the right, a point at which it is twisted toward the viewer. The party is driven to a destination known to be yet more inhospitable, by an oarsman whose sure-footed poise in the storm suggests his familiarity with these wild conditions. The city behind is a gigantic furnace. There is neither comfort nor a place of refuge in the painting’s world of rage, insanity and despair.

[[File:La colere.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Charles Le Brun]]’s, ''La Colère'' of 1668.]]

The painting explores the psychological states of the individuals it depicts, and uses compact, dramatic contrasts to highlight their different responses to their respective predicaments. Virgil’s detachment from the tumult surrounding him, and his concern for Dante’s well-being, is an obvious counterpoint to the latter’s fear, anxiety, and physical state of imbalance. The [[Damnation|damned]] are either rapt in a piercing concentration upon some mad and gainless task, or are else apparently in a state of total helplessness and loss. Their lining of the boat takes an up-and-down wave-like form, echoing the choppy water and making the foot of the painting a region of perilous instability. The souls to the far left and right are like grotesque [[bookend]]s, enclosing the action and adding a [[Claustrophobia|claustrophobic]] touch to the whole.

Delacroix wrote that his best painting of a head in this picture is that of the soul reaching with his forearm from the far side into the boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joubin |first=André |location=8&amp;nbsp;rue Garancière, Paris |title=Entry for December 24, 1853 |journal=Journal de Eugène Delacroix |year=1932 |volume=II (1822–1852) |pages=136–137 |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/dvh.html#y1853_m12_d24 |publisher=Librairie Plon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312103804/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/dvh.html#y1853_m12_d24 |archivedate=March 12, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Charles Le Brun]]’s, ''La Colère'' of 1668, and [[John Flaxman]]’s line engraving ''The Fiery Sepulchres'', appearing as plate&amp;nbsp;11 in ''The Divine Poem of Dante Alighieri'', 1807, are likely sources for this head.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Paintings of Eugène Delacroix, A Critical Catalogue, 1816-1831 |volume= One |author= Lee Johnson |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 1981 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatrical display of bold colours in the figures at the centre of the composition is striking. The red of Dante’s [[cowl]] resonates alarmingly with the fired mass behind him, and vividly contrasts with the billowing blue about Phlegyas. The author [[Charles Blanc]] noted the white linen on Virgil’s mantle, describing it as a ‘great wake up in the middle of the dark, a flash in the tempest’.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Blanc, ‘Grammaire des arts du dessin’, ''GBA'', ⅹⅹ (1866). Page&amp;nbsp;382.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolphe Loève-Veimars commented on the contrast between the colours used in Dante’s head, and in the depiction of the damned, concluding that all this ‘leaves the soul with I know not what fell impression’.&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe de Loëve Veimars, ‘Salon de 1822’, ''Album'', June&amp;nbsp;10, 1822. Page&amp;nbsp;262.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

== Water drops on the damned ==
[[File:Water drops on the damned.png|thumb|right|330px|Juxtaposed white, green, yellow and red pigments.]]

The drops of water running down the bodies of the damned are painted in a manner seldom seen up to and including the early nineteenth century. Four different, unmixed pigments, in discretely applied quantities comprise the image of one drop and its shadow. White is used for highlighting, strokes of yellow and green respectively denote the length of the drop, and the shadow is red.

Delacroix’s pupil and chief assistant of over a decade, Pierre Andrieu, recorded that Delacroix had told him the inspiration for these drops had come in part from the water drops visible on the nereids in Rubens’ ''[[Marie de' Medici cycle#The Disembarkation at Marseilles|The Landing of Marie de’&amp;nbsp;Medici at Marseilles]]'', and that the drops on ''The Barque of Dante'' were Delacroix’s point of departure as a colourist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Les Palettes de Delacroix |author= René Piot |publisher= Librairie de France |location= Paris |year= 1931 |pages= 71–74 |url= http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/dvh.html#andrieu_dante_et_virgile_aux_enfers |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160312103804/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/dvh.html#andrieu_dante_et_virgile_aux_enfers |archivedate= 2016-03-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Johnson (art historian)|Lee Johnson]] discussing these drops comments that “the analytical principle [Delacroix] applies of dividing into pure coloured components an object that to the average eye would appear monochrome or colourless, is of far-reaching significance for the future.”&lt;ref&gt;Delacroix, Lee Johnson, W.W.Norton&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Company,&amp;nbsp;Inc., New&amp;nbsp;York, 1963. Pages&amp;nbsp;18,&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Delacroix head.png|thumb|right|330px|Head of a creature seizing the vessel]]

In a letter to his sister, Madame [[Henriette de Verninac]], written in 1821, Delacroix speaks of his desire to paint for the Salon the following year, and to ‘gain a little recognition’.&lt;ref name="Joubin"&gt;{{Cite book |title= Delacroix’s letter to his sister, Madame Verninac |date= July 26, 1821 |work= Taken from: Correspondance Générale de Eugène Delacroix, Supplément et Tables |author= André Joubin |publisher= Librairie Plon |location= Paris |year= 1938 |page= 91 |url= http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/dvh.html#y1821_m07_d26 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160312103804/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/dvh.html#y1821_m07_d26 |archivedate= March 12, 2016 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1822 he wrote to his friend Charles Soulier that he had been working hard and non-stop for two and a half months to precisely that end. The Salon opened on April&amp;nbsp;24, 1822 and Delacroix’s painting was exhibited under the title ''Dante et Virgile conduits par Phlégias, traversent le lac qui entoure les murailles de la ville infernale de Dité''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Explication des Ouvrages de Peinture, Sculpture, Architecture et Gravure, des Artistes Vivans, Exposés au Musée Royal des Arts. |location=C.

Critics expressed a range of opinions about ''The Barque of Dante''. One of the judges at the Salon, [[Étienne-Jean Delécluze]], was uncomplimentary, calling the work ‘a real daub’ (''une vraie tartouillade''). Another judge, [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], thought highly of it, describing it a ‘chastened [[Rubens]]’.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; An anonymous reviewer in ''Le Miroir'' expected Delacroix to become a ‘distinguished colourist’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Le Miroir des Spectacles, des Lettres, des Mœurs et des Arts |editor= M.M.

Page&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1822, the French State purchased the painting for 2000 Francs, and moved it to the [[Musée du Luxembourg]]. Delacroix was delighted on hearing the news, although he feared the piece would be less admired for being viewed at close quarters. Some two year later he revisited the painting, reporting that it gave him much pleasure, but describing it as being insufficiently vigorous; a deficiency he had identified in the painting he was working on at the time, ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal= Journal de Eugène Delacroix |volume= &amp;#8544 (1822-1852) |author= André Joubin |publisher= Librairie Plon |location= 8&amp;nbsp;rue Garancière, Paris |year= 1932 |title= Entry for September&amp;nbsp;3, 1822 |page= 3 |url= http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/dvh.html#y1822_m09_d03 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160312103804/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/dvh.html#y1822_m09_d03 |archivedate= 2016-03-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Delacroix’s letter to his friend, Félix Guillemardet, September 4th, 1822 |work= Taken from: Eugène Delacroix, Lettres Intimes |author= Alfred Dupont |location= Gallimard, Paris |year= 1954 |pages= 139–142 |url= http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/dvh.html#y1822_m09_d04 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160312103804/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/dvh.html#y1822_m09_d04 |archivedate= 2016-03-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Journal de Eugène Delacroix |volume= &amp;#8544;, 1822-1852 |author= André Joubin |publisher= Librairie Plon |location= 8&amp;nbsp;rue Garancière, Paris |year= 1932 |title= Entry for April&amp;nbsp;11, 1824 |page= 72 |url= http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/dvh.html#y1824_m04_d11 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160312103804/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/dvh.html#y1824_m04_d11 |archivedate= 2016-03-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was moved in 1874&amp;mdash;eleven years after the death of the artist&amp;mdash;to its present location, the [[Musée du Louvre]].&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

[[File:Lambs before Lambs Club 1915.jpg|thumb|400px|The Lambs on June 27, 1915 at 130 West 44th Street]]
'''The Lambs, Inc.''' (aka '''The Lambs Club''') is a social club in [[New York City]] for actors, songwriters, and others involved in the [[theatre]].  It is America's oldest theatrical organization. "The Lambs" is a registered trademark of The Lambs, Inc.; and the club has been commonly referred to as The Lambs Club and The Lambs Theater since 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-lambs.org/disclaimer.htm |title=The Lambs |date= |accessdate=2014-12-31 |quote=The Lambs, Inc., is America's oldest professional theatrical club. ... The Lambs ® is a registered trademark of The Lambs, Inc., and has been known as The Lambs club for over 137 years. ... |publisher=The Lambs |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1868 The Lambs was founded in [[London]] by actors, led by [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]], the first Shepherd, looking to socialize with like-minded people. Several of those, most notably [[Henry James Montague]], came to the [[United States]] and formed The Lambs of New York during Christmas week of 1874. It was incorporated in 1877 in [[New York City]]. Shortly afterward the London Lambs closed.

The club's name honors the essayist [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]] and his sister [[Mary Lamb|Mary]], who during the early 19th century played host to actors and [[Intellectuals|literati]] at their famed [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] in London.&lt;ref name="Hardee"&gt;Hardee, Lewis J., Jr., [https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ujp_4nUEkC ''The Lambs Theatre Club''], Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland Publishing, 2010 [2006]. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-6095-3}}. A book about the history of The Club. The Lambs was recognized on May 9, 2008, by the Mayor of New York City, [[Michael Bloomberg]].([http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6095-3 publisher's summary])&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 they celebrated their [[golden jubilee]] at the [[Earl Carroll Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Fifty Years of The Lambs |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06E3DE163FE733A2575BC0A9609C946595D6CF# |quote=The Lambs, New York's famous actors' club, will celebrate its golden jubilee with a public Gambol at the Earl Carroll Theatre tonight. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=June 8, 1924 |accessdate=2014-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lambs, the [[New York Friars' Club]] and [[The Players (New York City)|The Players in New York]] are often confused. In 1964 long-time syndicated columnist [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] put it this way: "Long ago a New Yorker asked the difference between the Lambs, Friars, and Players, since the membership was, at the time, predominantly from Broadway." It was left to "a wit believed to have been [[George S. Kaufman]]" to draw the distinction: "The Players are gentlemen trying to be actors, the Lambs are actors trying to be gentlemen, and the Friars are neither trying to be both."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Wilson| first =Earl| authorlink =| title =Earl Wilson’s New York| publisher =Simon &amp; Schuster| year =1964| location =New York| pages =49–50| url =| doi =| id =| isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidents==
The president of The Lambs is called "The Shepherd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-lambs.org/board.htm |title=Governance |date= |accessdate=2014-12-31 |quote= |publisher=The Lambs |location= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131220915/http://www.the-lambs.org/board.htm |archivedate=2015-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Club displays the portraits of all its presidents, painted by artists such as [[James Montgomery Flagg]] and [[Everett Raymond Kinstler]].

The Lambs has had many Manhattan homes since 1874, beginning with Delmonico's Restaurant in Union Square. Then in 1875 they met at the Maison Doree on the south side of 14th St. opposite Union Square; 1876–77 next to Wallack's theater at 848 Broadway; 1877–78 at the Union Square Hotel, 6 Union Square; 1879 within a brownstone at 19 East 16th St.; 1880–91 at a Brownstone at 34 West 26th St.; 1891 at the Gilsey House, 1200 Broadway; 1892 at 8 West 29th St.; 1893–96 at 26 West 31st St.; 1897–1905 at 70 West 36th St., what was formerly and thereafter [[Keens Steakhouse|Keen's Chophouse]] remodeled by [[Stanford White]] to be a clubhouse; in 1905 at 128–130 West 44th St., in a house designed by Stanford White, then doubled in size in 1915.

Until 1974 the Club remained at the building at 128 West 44th St. The building was also designed by Stanford White, and was erected in 1904&amp;ndash;1905; it expanded in 1915 to include 132 West 44th St. When the club relocated to its current nine-story quarters at 3 West [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st St.]] adjacent to [[Rockefeller Center]], it sold its own quarters to the [[Church of the Nazarene]] which intended to use the old building as a mission in [[Times Square]].&lt;ref name="NYT2006"&gt;Robertson, Campbell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/02/theater/02lamb.html "Lamb's Theater Company Receives Eviction Notice"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The church leased part of the building for what would become the [[Off Broadway]] [[Lamb's Theatre]] which is not related to the Club except for the name of the building.

The building was designated a New York City Landmark&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/LAMBS-CLUB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in September 1974; and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on June 3, 1982.

In 2006 the Church of the Nazarene sold the building and theatre, which has been renovated by the Chatwal Hotel. They operate a restaurant in the hotel and named it The Lambs Club, although there is no relation between the hotel and The Lambs other than what was left of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Sifton, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html "Retro Glamour Made New: Restaurant Review: The Lambs Club"].  ''[[The New York Times]]''.  October 26, 2010 Accessed January 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activity==
The Lambs, Inc., is still active in its nine-story quarters at 3 West [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st St.]] adjacent to [[Rockefeller Center]]. Its members have been instrumental in the formation of [[ASCAP]], [[Actors' Equity]] and [[Actors’ Fund|The Actors' Fund of America]], Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and in the merger that created [[SAG-AFTRA]]. Of the first 21 Council members of Actors' Equity, 20 were members of The Lambs. The meetings to form Actors' Equity were held at The Players, a club similar to The Lambs, because there were too many producer members of The Lambs.  The Actors' strike of 1919 was settled in The Lambs, which was referred to as "Local One."

Historically, The Lambs has been the spawning ground of plays, friendships and partnerships. ''[[Mark Twain Tonight]]'' (with [[Hal Holbrook]]) and ''[[Stalag 17]]'' were first performed at The Lambs prior to their national successes.

[[Alan J. Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]] first met at The Lambs, often trying works-in-progress on their fellow Lambs. Loewe left a percentage of his share of [[Brigadoon]] royalties to The Lambs' Foundation. Since its founding, there have been more than 6,000 Lambs including [[Spencer Tracy]],&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZxE5CUHIUoC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=lambs+spencer+tracy#v=onepage&amp;q=lambs%20spencer%20tracy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Astaire]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[George M. Cohan]], [[W.C. Fields]], [[Will Rogers]], [[John Philip Sousa]], [[Conrad Nagel]],  [[Fred Waring]] and [[Albert Hague]], and [[Cliff Robertson]], [[Abe Vigoda]] and [[Ken Howard]]. Current members include [[Joyce Randolph]] of "The Honeymooners," [[Jim Dale]], [[Matthew Broderick]] and Tony Award-winning conductor/arranger [[Donald Pippin (Broadway director)|Donald Pippin]]. The Lambs' website contains a listing of its past members.

[[File:Robert Gibb - The Thin Red Line.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Robert Gibb]], ''The Thin Red Line'', 1881, [[National War Museum]], Edinburgh]]

[[File:Battle of Balaclava (map 1).png|thumb|First stage of the [[Battle of Balaklava]]. Ryzhov's cavalry attacked over the [[Causeway Heights]] (with its line of redoubts marked "1" to "6") at approximately 09:15, and were met by the [[Sutherland Highlanders]] at the hill north of [[Kadikoi]] (marked "B").]]

'''''The Thin Red Line''''' is an 1881 oil-on-canvas painting by [[Robert Gibb]] depicting the [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]] on 25 October 1854, during the [[Crimean War]]. In an incident which became known as "[[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|The Thin Red Line]]", a two-deep line of around 500 red-coated Scottish infantry from the [[Highland Brigade (United Kingdom)|Highland Brigade]] – with support from around 1,000 Royal Marines and Turkish infantry along with six guns of field artillery – stood firm against a force of around 2,500 Russian cavalrymen. The incident was a small one, in the context of the battle and the war as a whole, but became the focus for celebrating the stoicism and steadfastness of the British Army after Gibb's painting was exhibited.

==Background==
The Russians were moving to attack the British base of operations at the port of [[Balaklava|Balaclava]]. After the Russians captured defensive redoubts on the Causeway Heights to the north of Balakava from around 6am on 25 October, about 2,500 Russian cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General [[Ivan Ivanovich Ryzhov]] were sent to probe forwards at around 9 am. The small force of British and Turkish infantry was the last line of defence before Balaklava, but was sheltering from Russian artillery fire behind a hill north of [[Kadikoi]], about {{convert|1|mi}} north of Balaclava.

The infantry moved to defend the top of the hill, and around 400 of the cavalry, possibly four squadrons of the [[12th Ingermanland Hussars]], were ordered to charge them. The Turkish infantry fired one ineffective long-distance volley and retreated, but the British infantry remained in place. Their commander Sir [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Colin Campbell]] decided against forming his six companies of Highlanders into [[infantry square|square]], the usual defensive tactic, or even a more robust formation of four ranks: instead, the vulnerable line of infantry fixed bayonets and fired several volleys with their [[Minié rifle]]s. The body of cavalry split into two, swerved aside, and withdrew.

The war correspondent of ''The Times'', [[William Howard Russell|William H. Russell]], observed the scene, later describing the Russian cavalry as charging at a "thin red streak tipped with a line of steel", which later became known as "the thin red line".

Thinking that an unsupported line of infantry could not hold back a cavalry charge, General Ryzhov assumed there was a stronger force out of sight behind the line of Highlanders, and the remainder of its cavalry held its position. Within a few minutes, the Russians were forced to retreat after the [[Charge of the Heavy Brigade]]. The Highlanders remained in their defensive position until the battle concluded a few hours later, after the disastrous [[Charge of the Light Brigade]].

==Painting==
The painting was inspired by Gibb's reading of [[Alexander Kinglake]]'s book ''The Invasion of the Crimea''. It shows the blue-coated Russian cavalry within a few yards of the red-coated British infantry, much closer than was actually the case in the battle: in reality, the cavalry came no closer than {{convert|100|-|200|yds}}.   Gibbs obtained a Highlander's uniform to ensure the accuracy of his depiction, from the [[feather bonnet]]s to the kilts and sporrans (including the large badger head sporran worn by the bearded sergeant at the right end of the line). The painting was one of three by Gibb on Crimean War themes, the others depicting incidents from the [[Battle of Alma]] (''Alma: Advance of the 42nd Highlanders'', 1889) and the [[Battle of Inkerman]] (''Saving the Colours; the Guards at Inkerman'', 1895).

The painting was first exhibited in Edinburgh, at the [[Royal Scottish Academy]]. The painting was on loan from owners [[Diageo]] to the Scottish [[National War Museum]] in [[Edinburgh Castle]] from 2000 until 2016, when it was donated to the national collection.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/b1943bae-acc2-11e6-9cb3-bb8207902122&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Traditional metal working in Mexico''' dates from the [[Mesoamerica]]n period with metals such as gold, silver and copper. Other metals were mined and worked starting in the colonial period. The working of gold and silver, especially for jewelry, initially declined after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]]. However, during the colonial period, the working of metals rose again and took on much of the character traditional goods still have.  Today, important metal products include those from silver, gold, copper, iron, [[tin]] and more made into jewelry, household objects, furniture, pots, decorative objects, toys and more. Important metal working centers include [[Taxco]] for silver, [[Santa Clara del Cobre]] for copper, [[Celaya]] for tin and [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] for [[wrought iron]].

==History==

===Prehispanic period===
[[File:AztecGoldPalacioCV.JPG|thumb|150px|Aztec gold ornament from the 16th century at the [[Palace of Cortés, Cuernavaca]], Mexico]]
Metal working in Mesoamerica, especially of silver, gold and copper was advanced by the time the Spanish arrived, mostly concentrated in the modern states of [[Michoacán]], [[Oaxaca]] and [[Guerrero]].&lt;ref name="fonart"&gt;{{cite book |title= Art popular mexicano al estilo FONART/FONART’s style in Mexican popular art |year=1992 |publisher= Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesanías |location=Mexico City |isbn=968 29 4019 2|pages= V1-V17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aprahamian58"&gt;Aprahamian, p 58&lt;/ref&gt; The mining and working of metals probably came to Mesoamerican cultures from the south. Metal working was principally in gold, silver, tin and lead, with some copper work known in what is now Michoacán.&lt;ref name="jruiz1011"&gt;Ruiz, p.10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz106"&gt;Ruiz, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; Gold was generally obtained in powder or pellet form in rivers and streams from various sites in Guerrero, Oaxaca, Michoacán, the [[Mexican Plateau|Central Highlands]] and the Mayan region.&lt;ref name="jruiz114"&gt;Ruiz, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz12"&gt;Ruiz, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;  As silver rarely appeared on the surface it was almost exclusively mined.&lt;ref name="jruiz12"/&gt;

In the pre Hispanic period, metals were used to create needles, punches, tweezers, weapons and musical instrument but its most important uses, especially gold and silver, was as jewelry for the social elite and as offerings to the gods.&lt;ref name="aprahamian58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz15"&gt;Ruiz, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/la-plateria-como-artesania.html |title=La Plateria |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Silver work |accessdate=December 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209205047/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/la-plateria-como-artesania.html |archivedate=February 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold and silver were worked by hammering, plating and molds the blending of these and some casting was known.&lt;ref name="aprahamian58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo377"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;  One pre Hispanic technique was to hammer metal flat, punch out a design and then layer this design over wood or leather, often used on shields.&lt;ref name="artepueblo377"/&gt;  Silver was less used in the pre Hispanic period as it was less valued as tribute. It did not have the same divine symbolic value that gold did.&lt;ref name="jruiz15"/&gt;  The use of copper was almost exclusive to the [[Purépecha Empire]] in what is now Michoacán when the Spanish arrived. Copper instruments included axes, hoes, scythes, punches, chisels, needles, pins, arrowheads, brooches, canes, handles, helmets, shields and small bells.&lt;ref name="jruiz106"/&gt;

===Colonial period===

According to tradition, one of the first gifts that [[Hernán Cortés]] received from [[Moctezuma II]] was a pair of discs, one in gold and one in silver, which represented the sun and moon respectively.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt; The existence of gold and silver in Mexico was one of the main attractions for the Spanish in the New World, with the conquest of the [[Aztec Empire]] and subsequent exploration with the aim of finding more of these precious metals. Mining and metal working became a main aspect of the economy of colonial Mexico.&lt;ref name="jruiz1522"&gt;Ruiz, p.15, 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the emphasis was on the mining of gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, [[platinum]] and tin with much of the metal, especially gold, shipped to Spain.&lt;ref name="jruiz2154"&gt;Ruiz, p.21, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the working of metals in the new colony was heavily restricted or outright banned for several reasons, including protection of Spanish metal guilds, the fact that the work did not contribute to royal taxes and the fear that the indigenous would make weapons.&lt;ref name="jruiz114"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo409"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aprahamian60"&gt;Aprahamian, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; However, these soon became impractical to enforce with the restrictions then only to the making of objects related to indigenous religion.&lt;ref name="jruiz21105"&gt;Ruiz, p.21, 105&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spanish introduced new metalworking techniques, especially the promoting of copper work by [[Vasco de Quiroga]] in Michoacan and various metals by [[Pedro de Gante]] in [[Mexico City]] .&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz114"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo409"/&gt; and eventually indigenous craftsmen competed with European ones.&lt;ref name="jruiz21105"/&gt; Most of Mexican colonial metal work copied that in Spain, which was Gothic in style and later Renaissance. These styles eventually defined the handcraft work of areas such as Oaxaca, [[Zacatecas]], [[Durango]], [[San Luis Potosí]] and [[Guanajuato]] .&lt;ref name="artepueblo410"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt;    However, after the Conquest, the making of jewelry in Mexico nearly disappeared, with precious metals shipped to Spain. Only after 1551, with the establishment of a Mexican upper class, did this return slowly. At first Spanish craftsmen arrived to work European methods including [[filigree]], [[repoussé and chasing]], engraving and the incrustation of precious stones. But during the colonial period, these craftsmen never reached the level of their contemporaries in Europe. Indigenous craftsmen were relegated in this area to producing cheaper jewelry with lesser metals.&lt;ref name="jruiz114118"&gt;Ruiz, p.114-118&lt;/ref&gt;

One exception to the relative lack of precious metal work was that in silver, which became more important over the colonial period after the start of trade with Asia in the 17th century. Mexico’s abundance made silver an important form of currency and silver working guilds gained prestige and power, mostly in the creation of coins, silverware, religious medallions, crosses and liturgical items.&lt;ref name="artepueblo377"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz120"&gt;Ruiz, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous silver jewelry often became marked by the use of silver coins as decoration. Trade with the Orient introduced elements to silver pieces such as pearls (later augmented by those found in the [[Gulf of California]]), turtle shell  and colored glass from Europe. The last was particularly popular with indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="artepueblo377"/&gt;  One item that was important in the 18th century were cigarette and snuff cases made of both silver and gold, as the habit of using tobacco became very fashionable among the upper classes. The creation of the cases waned in the 19th as lower classes began to use tobacco as well.&lt;ref name="jruiz122"&gt;Ruiz, p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence to the present===
[[File:CombAllende.JPG|thumb|19th century silver comb on display at the Allende House Museum in San Miguel Allende, Guanajuato]]
After the [[Mexican War of Independence]], much of Mexico metalworking continued to follow European trends, with elements added such as Mexican national symbols. Silverwork became less Baroque in nature and more secularized during the 19th century as political antagonism towards the Church grew and became more focused on items such as buttons, cane handles, pocket watches and hair decorations, incrustations as well as jewelry. The indigenous tended to keep more of the colonial era designs especially necklaces with dangling coins, glass and silver figurines, filigree.&lt;ref name="jruiz125"&gt;Ruiz, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

As mines gave out in the 19th and 20th centuries, precious metalworking declined. Traditional utilitarian iron and copper working declined due to industrialization.&lt;ref name="artepueblo410"/&gt;  In the mid 20th century, a revival began in silver working in the town of Taxco, even though the area’s mines had given out. It began with the work of American artisan [[William Spratling]], who took traditional Mexican indigenous and colonial designs and gave them new adaptations, then teaching other artisans in the area. Today, Taxco’s silverwork is one of Mexico’s important exports of finished products.&lt;ref name="aprahamian60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz125"/&gt;  Copper working, mostly for utilitarian items and home décor continues in Santa Clara del Cobre, a tradition that has remained since the early colonial period.  These items include bowls, plates, pitchers, vases and their quality has won awards in both Mexico and abroad.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;

==Jewelry making==
[[File:Artisan assembling pieces in the workshop of Oro de Monte¦ü Alba¦ün.jpg|thumb|left|Artisan assembling silver necklace in Oaxaca]]
[[File:JagNeckMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Silver necklace with ruby, emerald and Mexican opal with two jaguars in confrontation from Guadalajara on display at the Museum of Arte Popular in Mexico City]]
Jewelry making began well before the arrival of the Spanish, with mines providing supplies of metals and stones. The designs of modern Mexican handcrafted jewelry is a mixture of both Spanish and indigenous traditions. Indigenous designs are based on those seen in [[Mesoamerican codices]] and artifacts from archeological sites. Most of Mexico’s fine jewelry is made in silver, with the most important center being Taxco, Guerrero. A lesser known center is [[San Felipe del Progreso]] in the [[State of Mexico]]. Here traditional [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]] jewelry has seen a revival, especially the production of earrings used for Mazahua weddings, but also bracelets and necklaces.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; In Guanajuato, jewelry making focuses on cast silver in colonial style often decorated with images of birds along with glass beads and pearls.&lt;ref name="artepueblo379"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt;   In [[Pátzcuaro]], artisans made necklaces and earrings of smooth or scratched silver, often with small dangling fish, combined with red and black porcelain beads. In [[Yalalag]], Oaxaca they make silver necklaces with colonial era style crosses.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; In [[Huetamo]] and Zitácuaro, they made dangling earrings called arracadas of silver with images of leaves, flowers and birds. In [[Santa María Huazolotitlán|Huazolotitlán]], Oaxaca, they make beaded necklaces with crosses and small animals made of silver.&lt;ref name="artepueblo383"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

While gold jewelry making faded during the colonial period in Mexico, it is still done in a number of places such as Iguala and Taxco in Guerrero. In [[Ometepec]], large and small crosses are made with various metals along with gold necklaces of various colors. Gold filigree is an important trade in [[Chiapas]], often made with local [[amber]] .&lt;ref name="artepueblo379"/&gt;  Fine gold and silver wire is used by craftsmen in Oaxaca, [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], Guerrero and Chiapas to create earrings, necklaces and bracelets with intricate designs.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; In the [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]] region of Michoacán, they make a type of dangling gold earring with the name of “siete lunas” or seven moons.&lt;ref name="artepueblo383"/&gt;  In Yucatán rosaries made with gold or gold plated filigree are popular often made with red and pink coral. Turtle shell jewelry is incrusted with gold and silver.   Soplillos are necklaces de cuentas de oro ochavadas in Yucatán.&lt;ref name="artepueblo387"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; Fine jewelry making in [[Campeche]] tends to focus on the creation of earrings and rings with incrustations of gold and silver. Mayan influence can be seen in the large gold chains.&lt;ref name="artepueblo379"/&gt; In [[Quintana Roo]], a type of dangling earring called an arracadas in gold are popular since the 20th century, which includes men of high social status in Mayan communities.&lt;ref name="artepueblo387"/&gt; The creation of gold and silver jewelry is very varied in Oaxaca mixed with various other materials including coral, coins, colored glass and various stones.&lt;ref name="artepueblo383"/&gt;

==Silver==
[[File:SilverDishesFMayer.jpg|thumb|Display of silver dishes at the Franz Mayer Museum]]
Despite down from its peak in the colonial era, Mexico is still the number one producer of silver in the world.&lt;ref name="artepueblo391"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; Silver pieces made in Mexico include [[candelabra]]s, jars, platters, necklaces and buttons for [[charro]] outfits.&lt;ref name="artepueblo394"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional silver work in Mexico has its origins in the colonial period, as the metal was not particularly prized in the Mesoamerican era.&lt;ref name="artepueblo391"/&gt;&lt;ref name="srlopez"&gt;{{cite news |title= Temen se pierda orfebreria barroca |first= Sergio Raul |last=Lopez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=October 18, 2000 |page=2 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Fear of losing Baroque precious metal work }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican silver from the colonial era to the present can be found in many museum collections around the world.&lt;ref name="artepueblo3896"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; There are still artisans which still make silver pieces in the style of the 17th and 18th centuries. However, these kind of work tends to bring more fame than money.&lt;ref name="srlopez"/&gt; Globalization has affected the design of silver pieces in Mexico as much of it is exported.&lt;ref name="artepueblo3896"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; Most Mexican silver work today is updated designs, a trend that dates from the work of William Spratling in Taxco, making Mexico again a center of export for finished pieces.&lt;ref name="artepueblo391"/&gt; The tradition continues here, with some schools that teach the trade but most smiths learn through a term of apprenticeship, often as a part of the family business.&lt;ref name="artepueblo397"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; Taxco has been designated a [[Pueblo Mágico]] in part because of its silver work, and it is home to the [[William Spratling Museum]], which has a collection of this silver work.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;

The number of artisans who can do traditional Mexican silver work is dwindling.&lt;ref name="srlopez"/&gt; To help preserve the tradition, every two years the Hugo Salinas Price National Silver Prize is awarded to Mexican silversmiths in various categories. It is sponsored by the Fomento Cultural Grupo Salinas, the [[Secretariat of Social Development|Secretaría de Desarrollo Social (SEDESOL)]], the [[National Fund for the Development of Arts and Crafts|Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesanías (FONART)]] and the [[Museo de Arte Popular]]. The purpose is to promote the craft in the country both in Mexico and abroad.&lt;ref name="salinas"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fomentoculturalgruposalinas.com.mx/quehacemos/concursoplata.aspx |title= Importancia del premio |publisher=Fomento Cultural Grupo Salinas|location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Importance of the prize |accessdate=December 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copper==
[[File:TablewareSCCobre.JPG|thumb|Copper products for sale in [[Santa Clara del Cobre]], Michoacán]]
While copper was worked in some parts of Mesoamerica, modern Mexican tradition is Spanish in origin.&lt;ref name="artepueblo416"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; Copper working was initially ignored by the Spanish [[conquistador]]s as they were looking for gold and silver. It was not shipped to Spain as much as the other two. Instead, it eventually became important for the creation of utilitarian items, especially domestic items such as pots and pans.&lt;ref name="artepueblo410"/&gt; Today, the center of traditional copper work in Mexico is the state of Michoacán, especially the municipality of Santa Clara del Cobre.  One traditional hammered copper object is a large vessel in which pork fat is rendered or sugar caramelized for making candies. Every year during the month of August [[Santa Clara del Cobre]] holds a copper festival.&lt;ref name="hossack24"&gt;{{cite book |title= Handmade Style Mexico |last= Hossack |first= Karin |year=1999 |publisher= Chronicle Books |location= San Francisco |isbn=0-8118-2567-1 |page=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iron==
[[File:LagunillaAntiques08.JPG|thumb|Antique iron tools and other items at the [[La Lagunilla Market, Mexico City]] ]]
Iron was not worked in the Mesoamerican period, with its mining and working introduced by the Spanish.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; Exploration of the metal was initially banned to protect the industry in Spain, but as tools made from the metal were essential for exploration and conquest, the prohibition was soon ignored.&lt;ref name="artepueblo409"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo402"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the items were purely utilitarian such as tools, locks, horseshoes and tools.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo414"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the colonial period, iron began to be used in other ways, including decorative elements in churches and mansions such as railings and balconies.&lt;ref name="artepueblo409"/&gt; The height of traditional Mexican ironworking was in the 17 and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401"/&gt;

Initially the main iron working centers were Puebla and Oaxaca.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401"/&gt; Oaxacan iron was exceptionally malleable and light allowing for intricate designs and tools not possible with other types of iron. Most Oaxacan iron objects date from the 17th and 18th centuries and include locks, furniture and scissors, often with intricate designs etched on them.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401402"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 401-402&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:San Cristobal - Templo Caridad - Kreuz.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Iron cross on the Templo de Caridad in San Cristobal de las Casas]]
By the end of the 18th century, there were important iron working centers in Oaxaca, Puebla, Mexico City, Guanajuato and [[Querétaro]], as well as western Mexico such as [[Guadalajara]], Zacatecas and [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes|Aguascalientes]], which eventually developed its own style. Western Mexican ironwork is distinguished by oriental influence due to trade with [[Manila]] as well as the use of iron for decorative purposes on wooden objects.&lt;ref name="artepueblo406"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aleyniers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leyniers |first=A |date=May–August 2008 |title=El hierro forjado artístico en Zacatecas |trans-title=The artistic wrought iron of Zacatecas |journal=XII JORNADAS DE INVESTIGACIÓN Revista Investigación Científica |volume=4 |issue=2 |location=Zacatecas |publisher=Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas |language=Spanish |issn=1870-8196 |accessdate=December 21, 2012 |url=http://www.uaz.edu.mx/cippublicaciones/ricvol4num2tom1/Arte%20y%20cultura/Elhierro.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032831/http://www.uaz.edu.mx/cippublicaciones/ricvol4num2tom1/Arte%20y%20cultura/Elhierro.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handcrafted wrought iron is still important in [[San Miguel de Allende]], [[León, Guanajuato|Leon]], [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|city of Guanajuato]], [[Guadalajara]], [[Teocaltiche]], [[Jalisco]], [[Morelia]], San Felipe de los Herreros, Michoacán, Mexico City, [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] and [[Amozoc de Mota]].  It is used to make garden and home furniture, lamps, chimneys and chimney tools.&lt;ref name="artepueblo414"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aleyniers"/&gt; [[San Cristobal de las Casas]] is known for the creation of intricate crosses made of wrought iron, popular as symbols of divine protection.&lt;ref name="artepueblo414"/&gt;

==Tin==
[[File:Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos votive 1911.jpg|thumb|Traditional votive painting on tin from 1911]]
In the colonial period, tin was worked for its functional rather than aesthetic value. It was created and sold in standard sheets, which were then cut, folded and joined to make various objects. These sheets also became a traditional base for [[Votive paintings of Mexico|folk ex votos]].&lt;ref name="mortiz"&gt;{{cite news |title= Tin exhibit mirrors wit, religion of Mexico |first= Mario G. |last=Ortiz |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|location=Milwaukee, WI |date=Sep 8, 1992 |page=OZWC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, tin and other sheet metals, often from industrial waste, is still used to create decorative and functional objects such as castles, churches, masks, airplane models, saints, nativity scenes, contains, mirror frames, chandeliers, lamps, trays and plates.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo416"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mortiz"/&gt; Another important line is toys, which are painted in bright enamels, especially in Celaya and San Miguel de Allende.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; Other important centers include Oaxaca, [[Irapuato]], Mexico City, Puebla, [[Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala|Tlaxcala]] and [[Tlaquepaque]] .&lt;ref name="artepueblo416"/&gt;

==Other metals==
[[File:BrassFliesMAPDF.JPG|thumb|150px|Necklace with brass insect decoration at the Museo de Arte Popular]]
[[Brass]], tin and iron are used to create old fashioned lamps, decorative items for the home as well as furniture and sculptures.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; The creation of brass and [[bronze]] objects was introduced by the Spanish. Bronze was mostly used for the casting of church bells, some tools and decorative elements on iron railings. The indigenous adapted it to the use of small bells used in ceremonial dances. Brass was used for many different types of implements, mostly for domestic use.&lt;ref name="artepueblo410"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lead]] miniature figures are made for collectors although originally they are created as toys for children. They typically include soldiers, furniture, boats, machines and more in Romantic styles from the 19th century and before.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; Celaya makes a wide variety of miniature for doll houses including figures, furniture, and decorations. Another popular line is toy soldiers. Most pieces are made with molds, some of which date from the 19th century, then painted.&lt;ref name="artepueblo417"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;

The main producer of handcrafted metal eating utensils is the city of Oaxaca, with fine silverware produced in Taxco. Other areas that make this are in [[Cualac, Guerrero|Cualac]], [[Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero|Ciudad Altamirano]], [[Ayutla, Jalisco|Ayutla]], and [[Tecpan de Galeana]] in Guerrero, especially blades such as utility knives and [[machete]]s.&lt;ref name="artepueblo416"/&gt;

The '''''Vision of Saint Jerome'''''  is a painting by the Italian [[Mannerist]] artist [[Parmigianino]], executed in 1526–1527. It is now in the [[National Gallery, London]], [[United Kingdom]].

==History==
The work was commissioned on 3 January 1526 in Rome, by Maria Bufalini, wife of Antonio Caccialupi, to decorate the family chapel in the church of [[San Salvatore in Lauro]]. The contract mentioned "Francesco Mazola de Parma" and one "Pietro" with the same name, perhaps Parmigianino's uncle Piero Ilario Mazzola. The elongated shape derives from its original destination as part of a [[triptych]], whose sides (never painted) should represent the Immaculate Conception (to which the chapel was dedicated) and the saints Joachim and Anna. 

According to late Renaissance art biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]], Parmigianino was working to this painting during the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], and he had to stop when the city was ravaged by the imperial troops. He was able to escape paying a ransom, while his uncle remained in Rome, being able to hide the painting  in the refectory of [[Santa Maria della Pace]].
[[File:Parmigianino, visione di san girolamo 04.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Detail of St. Jerome sleeping.]]
In 1558 the Bufalini family decided to move it in their chapel in Sant'Agostino at [[Città di Castello]], from where it was acquired in 1790 by the English painter [[James Durno]]. In England, it was sold to the Marquess of Albercon for 1,500 [[guinea (coin)|guineas]], then, after a series of changes of hand, to the National Gallery, in 1826.

There are preparatory drawings in the [[Musée Condé]], the [[British Museum]] and other museums, for a total of some twenty. A drawing in the [[Galleria nazionale di Parma]] is the one which is more similar to the final version, although showing a horizontal composition.

==Description==
The painting is divided into two narrative sectors: a lower one, with [[Saint Jerome]] is sleeping near the crucifix (with his traditional symbol, the cardinal hat visible near a skull) and receives the vision of St. [[John the Baptist]], identified by the long cross and the baptismal washbasin which is tied at his belt; St. John indicates the Child, represented in the upper sector between the legs of the Madonna, with a shining background behind them.

Parmigianino's attention to detail is shown by the Baptist's reed cross, the speckled skin which covers him, the undergrowth near the sleeping Jerome, the sheen on Mary's dress, the last perhaps inspired by classical sculptures seen by Parmigianino during his trips.

St. John's raised right arm and upwards-pointing finger are reminiscent of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo's]] painting ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|St. John the Baptist]]''.

A '''wheel chandelier''' is a [[lighting]] installment, in the form of a [[chandelier]] hanging from the ceiling in the form of a spoked wheel. The oldest and most important examples derive from the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] period.

Wheel chandeliers were made for the practical purpose of lighting the [[Architecture of cathedrals and great churches|great]] [[church architecture|churches]] and other public areas, but in religion they also had symbolic significance, depicting the [[Garden of Eden]] or the [[Kingdom of God]]. The wheel, its gates, and its towers, which are usually decorated with [[Prophet#Christianity|Prophet]]s and [[Apostle]]s or inscribed with their names, symbolise the city walls of the [[New Jerusalem]]. The buttresses, towers, and candles number twelve or a multiple of twelve, after the [[numerology]] of the [[Book of Revelation]]. This symbolism is first found on two wheel chandeliers of the [[Hildesheim Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Sedlmayr (Lit.), S. 125-128&lt;/ref&gt; The great wheel chandelier of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulcher]] was an inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Gallistl (Lit.), S. 44-45; 76-79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanesque wheel chandeliers==
In [[Germany]] there are four great Romanesque wheel chandeliers. The fact that they are made from fire-gilt [[copper]] and not from pure [[gold]] has saved them from being melted down. They were decorated with Prophets and angels in silver and with precious gemstones, but for the most part these have been lost.

*The [[Barbarossa chandelier]] in [[Aachen Cathedral]] is attributted to [[Frederick Barbarossa]] (1122 - 1190).
*[[Hartwig's chandelier]] in [[Comburg]], [[Schwäbisch Hall]], with a 5-metre diameter, from the 12th century (also called ''Himmlische Jerusalem''(Heavenly Jerusalem) &lt;!--[http://www.kirchen.de/drs/wochbild/hallkron.html] --&gt; with saints and soldiers in the towers.
*[[Hezilo chandelier]] in [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] with a 6-metre diameter, a donation of Bishop [[Hezilo of Hildesheim]] (1054–79).
*[[Azelin chandelier]] in [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] with a donation inscription of Bishop [[Thietmar of Hildesheim]] (1038–44).

==Gothic wheel chandeliers==
In the [[Minster Church of St. Alexander (Einbeck)|Minster Church of St. Alexander]] in [[Einbeck]], there is a later gothic wheel chandelier of painted brass with a diameter of c. 3.5 metres. The inscription on its bracket dates it to 1420. It was presumably gifted by Degenhard Ree, a Canon of the collegiate church. The composition ought to go back to a lost moder in Pöhlde Cloister.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Franz Hoffmann|Periodical=Grosse Baudenkmäler|Title=St. Alexandri Einbeck |Edition=2|Issue=318|Publisher=Deutscher Kunstverlag|PublicationPlace=München|Year=1981|Date=  1981|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Gothic example is found in:
*The [[Halberstadt Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Stephan and St. Sixtus]], in bronze, in [[Halberstadt]] (1516)

==Neo-Romanesque wheel chandeliers==
[[File:Altarraum St Elisabeth Bonn.jpg|thumb|Electric wheel chandelier in St. Elisabeth Bonn]]
In some neo-Romanesque churches there are large wheel chandeliers too. Some of these were electric even when they were first installed
Some examples:
*[[St. Godehard's Basilica]] in Hildesheim, gifted in 1864 by [[Marie of Saxe-Altenburg]]
*[[St. Cäcilia (Harsum)|St. Cäcilia]] in [[Harsum]] (c.1886)
*[[Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune]] in [[Strasbourg]] (c.1890)
*[[Bethlehemkirche (Hannover)|Bethlehemkirche]] in [[Hannoverd]] (c.1904)
*[[St. Elisabeth (Bonn)|St. Elisabeth]] in [[Bonn]] under contemporary frescoes in the dome (c. 1910) (electrified from installation)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Kirche | url = http://www.st-elisabeth-bonn.de/kirche.html | publisher = Katholische Pfarrgemeinde St. Elisabeth Bonn | accessdate = 2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary wheel chandeliers==
There are also contemporary wheel chandeliers, which continue this tradition:
*[[Herrenhäuser Church]] in [[Hannover]] (c.1990)
*[[Great St. Martin Church, Cologne|Great St. Martin Church]] in [[Cologne]] (before 1993)
*Church of the [[Lippoldsberg Cloister]] (1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klosterkirche.de/raeume/radleuchter/ Webseite der Klosterkirche]; retrieved, 25 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wagon wheel==
Another type is wagon wheel chandelier. As name suggest it is usually made from old wagon wheels. As opposite to most of the wheel chandeliers, wagon wheel chandeliers were usually created as a cheap way to lighten the common spaces of large houses, businesses and public halls. Most of them were made from wood reinforced with steel.
