[[Image:Anaerobic.png|300px|thumb|right|Aerobic and anaerobic [[bacteria]] can be identified by growing them in test tubes of [[thioglycollate broth]]: &lt;br /&gt; 1: [[Obligate aerobe]]s need oxygen because they cannot ferment or respire anaerobically. They gather at the top of the tube where the oxygen concentration is highest. &lt;br /&gt; 2: [[Obligate anaerobe]]s are poisoned by oxygen, so they gather at the bottom of the tube where the oxygen concentration is lowest. &lt;br /&gt; 3: [[Facultative anaerobes]] can grow with or without oxygen because they can metabolise energy aerobically or anaerobically. They gather mostly at the top because aerobic respiration generates more ATP than either fermentation or anaerobic respiration. &lt;br /&gt; 4: [[Microaerophile]]s need oxygen because they cannot ferment or respire anaerobically. However, they are poisoned by high concentrations of oxygen. They gather in the upper part of the test tube but not the very top. &lt;br /&gt; 5: [[Anaerobic organism|Aerotolerant organisms]] do not require oxygen as they metabolise energy anaerobically. Unlike obligate anaerobes however, they are not poisoned by oxygen.  They can be found evenly spread throughout the test tube. ]]

An '''aerobic organism''' or '''aerobe''' is an [[organism]] that can survive and grow in an [[oxygen]]ated environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000002016|aerobe}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, an [[anaerobic organism]] (anaerobe) is any organism that does not require oxygen for growth. Some anaerobes react negatively or even die if oxygen is present.&lt;ref name=Hentges&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Microbiology |edition=4 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7638/ |accessdate=24 July 2016 |author=Hentges DJ |chapter=17: Anaerobes:General Characteristics |editor=Baron S |publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston |location = Galveston, Texas |date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
*'''[[Obligate aerobe]]s''' need oxygen to grow. In a process known as [[cellular respiration]], these organisms use oxygen to [[oxidation|oxidize]] substrates (for example [[sugar]]s and [[fat]]s) and generate [[energy]].&lt;ref name=Todar&gt;{{cite book|url=http://textbookofbacteriology.net/nutgro_4.html |accessdate=24 July 2016 |title=Todar's Online Textbook of Bacteriology |author=Kenneth Todar |chapter=Nutrition and Growth of Bacteria |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Facultative anaerobic organism|Facultative anaerobes]]''' use oxygen if it is available, but also have [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] methods of energy production.&lt;ref name=Hentges/&gt;
*'''[[Microaerophile]]s''' require oxygen for energy production, but are harmed by atmospheric concentrations of oxygen (21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Todar/&gt;
*'''[[Aerotolerant|Aerotolerant anaerobes]]''' do not use oxygen but are not harmed by it.&lt;ref name=Todar/&gt;

When an organism is able to survive in both oxygen and anaerobic environments, the use of the [[Pasteur effect]] can distinguish between facultative anaerobes and aerotolerant organisms. If the organism is using fermentation in an anaerobic environment, the addition of oxygen will cause facultative anaerobes to suspend fermentation and begin using oxygen for respiration. Aerotolerant organisms must continue fermentation in the presence of oxygen.

==Glucose==
A good example is the oxidation of [[glucose]] (a [[monosaccharide]]) in [[aerobic metabolism|aerobic respiration]].
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 38 [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] + 38 phosphate →  6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 38 [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]

Oxygen is used during the oxidation of glucose and [[water]] is produced.&lt;ref name=Hentges/&gt;

This equation is a summary of what happens in three series of biochemical reactions: [[glycolysis]], the [[Krebs cycle]], and [[oxidative phosphorylation]].

The '''Astronomical Calculation Institute''' ({{lang-de|'''Astronomisches Rechen-Institut'''}}; '''ARI''') is a research institute in [[Heidelberg]], Germany, dating from the 1700s.  Beginning in 2005, the ARI became part of the [[Center of Astronomy (University of Heidelberg)|Center for Astronomy]] at [[Heidelberg University]] (''{{lang|de|Zentrum für Astronomie der Universität Heidelberg}}'', {{lang|de|ZAH}}).  Previously, the institute directly belonged to the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]].

== Description ==

The ARI has a rich history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ARI History (- 1968) (German) | publisher = ARI | date =  2014-12-29| url = http://www.zah.uni-heidelberg.de/ari/about-the-ari/history2/ | accessdate = 2014-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded in 1700 in [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Berlin-Dahlem]] by [[Gottfried Kirch]]. It had its origin in a patent application by [[Frederick I of Prussia]], who introduced a monopoly on publishing star catalogs in Prussia. In 1945 the Institute was moved by the Americans nearer to the [[United States Army Garrison Heidelberg]]. On January 1, 2005 the combined Center for Astronomy institute formed by combining ARI, with the [[Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics (University of Heidelberg)|Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics]] (''{{lang|de|Institut für Theoretische Astrophysik}}'', ITA) and the [[Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl]] ("Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory", LSW).

The ARI has been responsible among other things for the [[Star_catalogue#Gl.2C_GJ.2C_Wo|Gliese catalog of nearby stars]], the fundamental catalogs [[Fifth Fundamental Catalogue|FK5]] and [[Sixth Fundamental Catalogue|FK6]], and the annually-published "Apparent Places of Fundamental Stars" (APFS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/publikationen/apf/ Apparent Places of Fundamental Stars]&lt;/ref&gt; stellar ephemerides that provide high-precision mean and [[Apparent places|apparent positions]] of over three thousand stars for each day.

During 1938–1945, whilst based in Berlin, ARI published the academic journal ''[[Astronomical Notes]]'' ({{lang-de|Astronomische Nachrichten}}).
{{As of|2016}}, ARI was not limited to only publishing star catalogs, but has a wider research scope, including [[gravitational lensing]], galaxy evolution, [[stellar dynamics]], and [[cosmology]]. ARI is also involved in space astronomy missions including the [[Gaia mission]].

In 2007 professors [[Eva Grebel|Eva K. Grebel]] and [[Joachim Wambsganß]] ([[:de:Joachim Wambsganß|de]]) became co-directors of the institute.

Other researchers involved with the institute include [[Hartmut Jahreiß]] author of the updated ''[[Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars]]''; [[Eugene Rabe]]; [[Lutz D. Schmadel]], author of the ''Dictionary of Minor Planet Names''; [[Hans Scholl (astronomer)|Hans Scholl]]; and [[Rainer Spurzem]] working with N-body simulations.

==Directors==

Between 1700 and 2007 there was a single director of the institute at a time.  From 2007 onwards there were joint co-directors of the institute:

[[File:Cell polarity.jpg|thumb|right|The grey represents the concentration of a molecule]]
A '''Biomolecular Gradient''' is established by a difference in the concentration of molecules in a biological system such as individual cells, groups of cells, or an entire organism. A biomolecular gradient can exist intracellularly (within a cell) or extracellularly (between groups of cells). The purposes of such gradients in biological systems vary, but include [[chemotaxis]] and functions in development. These types of gradients play a role in many different types of signaling as well as recently being implicated in cancer metastasis.

== Development ==
Cells themselves can create biomolecular gradients by releasing signaling molecules that diffuse outwardly. These gradients are critical for cellular identity and cell relocation. Similarly, the gradients produced by cells may influence cellular fate by their temporal and spatial characteristics. In certain organisms, the choice of cell fate can be determined by a gradient, a binary choice, or through a relay of molecules released by a cell.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt; If cell fate is binary, the identity of the cell is influenced by the presence or absence of a signaling molecule; consequently, these signals can also induce cell fate acting in a relay.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt; The relay functions by the source cell releasing a signaling molecule into the environment.  Adjacent cells possessing similar cell identities respond to these signals and can release different signaling molecules to cells in their surrounding area, promoting additional new cell fates.  This process continues to all cells in the developing organism. In contrast, a signal can act in a gradient, which induces a specific cell fate as a function of the concentration of the molecule in the gradient. These types of molecules are known as [[morphogens]].

An example of this phenomenon is observed in the neural tube with varying concentrations of the Sonic Hedgehog ([[Sonic hedgehog|Shh]]) protein.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt; [[Sonic hedgehog|Shh]] is characterized as a morphogen and possesses spatial and temporal characteristics that make it well suited for study.

== Cancer ==
[[File:Chtx-AttrRep-en.png|thumb|Depicts migration of cells in response to types of molecules in the gradient.]]

Biomolecular gradients have been shown to facilitate the invasion of cancer cells into different types of tissues in the body. Cancer metastasis is thought to be directly coupled to growth factor gradients that facilitate chemotaxis of cancer promoter factors. These chemoattractants promote tumour ''[[angiogenesis]]'', namely increased blood flow to tissues allowing the cancer to thrive in different areas of the body.&lt;ref name="cancer" /&gt; Therefore, this pathway allows for the movement of tumour-promoting molecules toward healthy tissues in the body.&lt;ref name="cancer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="article" /&gt;  Further study is required to quantify pathways involved in the above response and may provide insight into more effective treatment for cancer patients.

== Signaling ==
In a similar way, biomolecular gradients can function as signal antagonists that have the potential to drastically affect the cell's characteristics and in turn, the organism's response. This includes allowing the cell to distinguish its orientation or shift the barrier of cell differentiation in a group of cells. For instance, such mechanisms can be used to help the body defend against infection. Specifically, the afflicted area of the body acts as an attractant through ligand-receptor binding. This can occur through the polarity that is established by signal antagonists. In addition, this type of ligand-receptor interaction can lead to a signal cascade that trigger mitosis. A type of gradient molecule that accomplishes the aforementioned mechanism is ''[[Pom1]]''.&lt;ref name="Pom1" /&gt;

'''Bloviation''' is a style of empty, pompous political speech popularized by United States President [[Warren G. Harding]], who, himself a master of the technique, described it as "the art of speaking for as long as the occasion warrants, and saying nothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The American Past: A Survey of American History |first=Joseph R. | last=Conlin |authorlink = Joseph R.

In terms of its etymology, according to one source, the word is a "compound of blow, in its sense of 'to boast' (also in another typical Americanism, ''blowhard''), with a mock-[[Latin]] ending to give it the self-important stature implicit in its meaning."&lt;ref name="quinion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-blo1.htm|title= Bloviate|authorlink=Michael Quinion|first=Michael |last=Quinion|year=1999|publisher=[[World Wide Words]]|accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Zayka-apache.jpg|thumb|250px|A ceramic knife.]]
A '''ceramic knife''' is a [[knife]] designed with a [[ceramic]] blade typically made from [[zirconium dioxide]] (ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; also known as zirconia).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kyoceraadvancedceramics.com/ceramic-advantage/frequently-asked-questions#q1 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210064529/http://kyoceraadvancedceramics.com/ceramic-advantage/frequently-asked-questions#q1#q1 |archive-date=2015-12-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These knife blades are usually produced through the dry-pressing and firing of powdered zirconia using solid-state [[sintering]]. It is 8.5 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], compared to 4.5 for normal steel and 7.5 to 8 for hardened steel and 10 for [[diamond]]. The resultant blade has a hard edge that stays sharper for longer when compared to conventional steel knives. While the edge is harder than steel knives, it is less tough than steel knives; no surprise that ceramic blades are more brittle than steel blades. The ceramic blade is sharpened by grinding the edges with a diamond-dust-coated [[grinding wheel]].

== Zirconium oxide ==
{{See also|Yttria-stabilized zirconia}}
[[File:Dalstrong Ceramic Knife.png|thumb|A ceramic knife made from blackened zirconia, super heated under pressure.]]
Zirconium oxide is used due to its [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. It exists in three phases: [[Monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]], [[Tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]] and [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]]. Cooling to the monoclinic phase after sintering causes a large volume change, which often causes stress fractures in pure zirconia. Additives such as [[Magnesium oxide|magnesia]], [[Calcium oxide|calcia]] and [[Yttrium oxide|yttria]] are used in the manufacture of the knife material to stabilize the high-temperature phases and minimize this volume change. The highest strength and toughness is produced by the addition of 3&amp;nbsp;mol% yttrium oxide yielding partially stabilized zirconia. This material consists of a mixture of tetragonal and cubic phases with a bending strength of nearly 1,200 MPa. Small cracks allow phase transformations to occur, which essentially close the cracks and prevent catastrophic failure, resulting in a relatively tough ceramic material, sometimes known as TTZ (transformation-toughened zirconia).

== Properties ==
Ceramic knives are substantially harder than steel knives, will not corrode in harsh environments,&lt;ref name="Japan2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=The Ceramic Society of Japan|title=Advanced Ceramic Technologies &amp; Products|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ne_-zaLqI8C&amp;pg=PA529|date=31 July 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-4-431-53913-1|pages=529–}}&lt;/ref&gt; are non-magnetic, and do not conduct electricity at room temperature. Because of their resistance to strong acid and caustic substances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Bee|title=At the cutting edge: ceramic knives|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/9341246/At-the-cutting-edge-ceramic-knives.html|accessdate=27 July 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=22 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their ability to retain a cutting edge longer than forged metal knives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Applied Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zh5VJNseL2AC&amp;pg=PA61|publisher=PediaPress|pages=61–|id=GGKEY:RNQ8YX0N04Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; ceramic knives are better suited for slicing boneless meat, vegetables, fruit and bread. Since ceramics are brittle, blades may break if dropped on a hard surface although improved manufacturing processes have reduced this risk. They are also unsuitable for chopping through bones, or frozen foods, or in other applications which require prying, which may result in chipping. Several brands now offer either a black-coloured or a designed blade made through an additional [[hot isostatic pressing]] step, which increases the toughness.

== Sharpening and general care ==
[[File:Dalstrong Edgelast Sharpener.png|thumb|A diamond dust sharpener with cradle for a ceramic knife.]]
Unlike a traditional steel blade that benefits from regular honing and resharpening in order to keep a sharp edge, a ceramic knife will stay sharp and retain its cutting edge for much longer—up to 10x longer according to some tests.&lt;ref&gt;http://kyoceraadvancedceramics.com/ceramic-advantage/kyocera-technology. "Recent tests show that the life of a Kyocera ceramic blade without resharpening is approximately 10 times that of a typical steel blade." The Cutlery and Allied Trades Research Association (CATRA), an independent testing organization.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The inherent hardness of the ceramic material also makes it more difficult for the consumer to resharpen.&lt;ref name="Puck2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Puck|title=Wolfgang Puck Makes It Easy: Delicious Recipes for Your Home Kitchen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgPAagtOoDUC&amp;pg=PA269|date=8 April 2007|publisher=Thomas Nelson|isbn=978-1-4185-7093-4|pages=269–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a ceramic knife therefore does not need regular sharpening in the same way as steel, its blade edge will eventually degrade or chip and lose its cutting edge, at which point specialized sharpening services are required for the ceramic edge.&lt;ref name="TableJay2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sur La Table|author2=Sarah Jay|title=Knives Cooks Love: Selection.

"'''Coal Miner's Daughter'''" is an autobiographical 1969 [[country music]] song written and performed by [[Loretta Lynn]]. Released in 1970, the song became Lynn's [[signature song]], one of the genre's most widely known songs, and provided the basis for both her autobiography and a movie on her life.

==About the song==
"Coal Miner's Daughter" tells the story of her life growing up "in a cabin on a hill in [[Butcher Hollow, Kentucky|Butcher Holler]]", while her father, Melvin "Ted" Webb, worked all night in the [[Van Lear, Kentucky|Van Lear]] [[Coal mining|coal mine]]. The song depicts the real story of Lynn's life growing up in rural Kentucky, and discusses how she and her seven siblings lived off of a coal miner's salary ("''Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay''"), and that her father always made sure there was love in the Webb household.

Subsequent verses recall Lynn's other childhood experiences and hardships, such as her mother reading the [[Bible]] by a coal-oil light or having bloody fingers from constantly doing the laundry using an abrasive "warsh" board (this pronunciation was reflective of her Appalachian Kentucky roots),&lt;ref name="Montgomery, 1004"&gt;Montgomery, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'', 1004.&lt;/ref&gt; ordering shoes from a mail-order catalog, and working so hard every day that everyone slept because "they were tired."

In the song's final verse, the now-adult Lynn returns to her homestead, which has since been abandoned ("''Not much left but the floor; nothing lives here anymore ...''"). However, she remarks that the "memories of a coal miner's daughter" remain.

"Coal Miner's Daughter" was unlike anything Lynn had ever recorded previously. She had become known for her sassy back-talking songs, including "[[Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind) (song)|Don't Come Home A' Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)]]" (an angry-wife's warning to a hard-drinking husband not to come home drunk and intent on making love) and "[[Fist City]]" (wherein a married woman threatens her husband's would-be temptress). However, fans quickly reacted to the song with praise and turned the song into one of country music's iconic hits.

==Chart performance==
Lynn recorded "Coal Miner's Daughter" in October 1969, but the song's release was delayed until October 1970. The song slowly climbed the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart during the latter half of the year, and reached No. 1 on December 19 for a single week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944-2006, Second edition|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to reaching No. 1 on the Country charts, "Coal Miner's Daughter" also was Lynn's first single to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at No. 83.

An album of the same name was also released in 1970, and despite the fact that the title track was the lone single, ''Coal Miner's Daughter'' became quite successful.

==Legacy==
"Coal Miner's Daughter" served as the name of Lynn's 1976 autobiography, ''Coal Miner's Daughter: The Autobiography'', which Lynn co-wrote. The song title also served as the name of Lynn's 1980 biographical motion picture on her life, ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]''. The movie starred actress [[Sissy Spacek]] as Lynn and [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Lynn's husband. The film's soundtrack featured Spacek singing all of Lynn's hits sung in the movie, including "Coal Miner's Daughter". 

"Coal Miner's Daughter" helped provide a better understanding of Lynn, and led to the widespread fascination with her life story.

The song was listed at No. 185 on RIAA's list of ''[[Songs of the Century]]'' and was also listed in 2003's TV special at No. 13 on ''CMT's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music''.

In 2010 the Library of Congress put "Coal Miner's Daughter" on the National Recording Registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/registry-by-induction-years/2009/|title=2009 - National Recording Preservation Board|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cover versions==
Few singers have released cover versions of Lynn's hit, as it is a biographical song about Lynn's life. However, there have been several karaoke sing-along versions made in the past ten years.

The most famous cover of the song is the version recorded by [[Sissy Spacek]] for the motion picture, which is also featured on the soundtrack. The soundtrack peaked at #2 on the Billboard country album chart and at #40 on the Top 200 chart. In Canada the soundtrack peaked at #1 on the country album chart and #23 on the pop album chart. The single off the soundtrack peaked at #23 on the Billboard country singles chart and at #7 on the Canada country singles chart.

Loretta Lynn re-recorded the song with guest vocals from [[Miranda Lambert]] and [[Sheryl Crow]] in 2010 for ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter: A Tribute To Loretta Lynn]]''. Additionally, this recording was released as a single in September 2010. This version of the song debuted and peaked at #55 on the Hot Country Songs chart for the week dated December 4, 2010. They also recorded a music video of the song and it became a CMT top ten hit. Additionally they were nominated for a Country Music Association, Academy of Country Music and a CMT Video award for the effort.

[[Stella Parton]], little sister of Lynn's good friend [[Dolly Parton]], also recorded the song on her 2010 album, "American Coal."

Lynn re-recorded the song for her 2018 album ''[[Wouldn't It Be Great]]''. The album is composed by songs all written by Lynn. Coal Miners Daughter being the closing song on the album just as Loretta does in her live performances.

==Parodies==

The song was parodied as ''Cow Minder's Daughter'' by Laraine Newman, who portrayed the fictional east Indian singer "Govinda Lynn" in a skit during episode 20 of season 5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/79/79t.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Buck Henry: 05/24/80 |website=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date=1980-05-24 |accessdate=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the US comedy series [[Saturday Night Live]], first broadcast May 24, 1980.

[[File:Statue of Liberty restoration project.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Statue of Liberty restoration project, 1984]]
A centennial '''conservation-restoration of the Statue of Liberty''' (''Liberty Enlightening the World'') occurred between 1984 and 1986. The [[Statue of Liberty]], by French sculptor [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]], is a colossal artwork on [[Liberty Island]] in New York Harbor, and is a part of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]]. Much of the restoration effort was based on unprecedented restorative methods, as metallurgical repair work on such a large scale had never been attempted. Many scientists, engineers, government organizations, and professional consultants evaluated and dealt with the various problems and tasks facing the restoration effort.

The restored statue was reopened during [[Liberty Weekend]], its 100-year anniversary celebration held July 3–6, 1986.

==Pre-restoration documentation efforts==
[[File:Statue of Liberty frontal 2.jpg|220px|right|thumb]]
The preparations for the centennial celebration of the Statue of Liberty began in 1979. Formed by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS), the custodians of the statue since 1933, to investigate possible development alternatives. A report titled "Analysis of Alternatives", published in December 1980, proposed measures to remedy the certain conditions confronting visitors to the Statue of Liberty, such as the long lines and waiting time to enter the crown of the statue. The proposed measures included the instatement of systems for numbered ticketing and early warnings that would allow visitors to estimate any possible waiting times and to be conveniently advised if and when to visit or enter the statue. The report also discussed ways to streamline ferry access both to and from Liberty Island and [[Ellis Island]]. The early report did not address the ever-deteriorating physical condition of the statue, which was already readily apparent.

The '''French American Committee for the Restoration of the Statue of Liberty''' was formed in May 1981.&lt;ref name=blumberg&gt;Blumberg, B., "Celebrating the Immigrant: An administrative History of the Statue of Liberty National Monument," p.139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of the Interior (of which the [[National Park Service]] is a bureau) later that month, on May 26, agreed to a working relationship with the Committee. In June 1981, the Committee was incorporated as a non-profit foundation licensed by the state of New York to raise funds for the restoration effort. The Committee hired four French consultants said to have considerable expertise in their respective fields: an architect-engineer, a [[Metallurgy|metals expert]], a structural engineer and a mechanical engineer who were asked to compose a technical report on the physical condition of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, R.S., and Despont, T., Restoring the Statue of Liberty: Sculpture, Structure, Symbol, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The French consultants visited Liberty Island in May, June, October and December 1981, before presenting a preliminary white paper to the National Park Service on the seventeenth of December in Washington D.C., titled "French Technical Report on Restoring the Statue of Liberty".&lt;ref name=blumberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Cliver, E.B. and Baboian, R., "Corrosion on the Statue of Liberty: an overview". In: The Statue of Liberty Restoration: Proceedings of the Statue of Liberty - Today for Tomorrow Conference, October 20–22, 1986, New York City, New York. [Ed. Baboian, R.; Bellante, E.L; Cliver, E.B.], Houston, Tex.: National Association of Corrosion Engineers, 1990, 149 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-877914-12-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report, written with the assistance of a regional historical architect from the NPS, was an attempt to identify and address the apparent problems associated with the statue. In the report, the consultants took note of what they saw to be the most serious problem affecting the statue: that two predominant sections, the torch-bearing arm and the rest platform at the head level, had corroded significantly. The report also alluded to the corroded girders toward the top of the pedestal and the bottom of the [[Pylon (architecture)|central pylon]]. The report also discussed the serious structural problems associated with the long-ago deteriorated insulating layer between the [[copper]] sheet of the statue and the iron bands of the [[Armature (sculpture)|structural armature]], as it had caused the iron bands to corrode. Alterations over the intervening years (1887–1916) to the torch had created such irreversible damage to the integral stability of that segment, that it was advised in the report that the torch be replaced. In order to more thoroughly assess possible damage that may be hidden beneath the layers of paint on the central pylon, the French consultants also suggested that the layers of paint covering it be removed. Two alternative proposals for modernizing the stairway within the statue were also proposed. From these preliminary observations, a number of preservation and replacement priorities were made. The white paper was further assessed and scrutinized by the NPS and other officials at the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] in the nation's capital on March 5, 1982. The director of the NPS was impressed by the report, but also concerned about the future prospects of the Committee’s fund raising efforts.

Shortly thereafter, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced in May 1982 the creation of a 21-member '''Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Centennial Commission''' (better known as the '''Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation''') which would act as an "umbrella group" overseeing the French American Committee and the Ellis Island Restoration Commission. The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation would try to privately raise funds for the restoration efforts. A report prepared by the NPS in September 1982, titled "General Management Plan", sought to discuss the fundraising aims and objectives of the newly created foundation, but reiterated most of the proposed measures (concerning the statue) of the earlier 1980 report "Analysis of Alternatives" (such as numbered ticketing systems, etc.).

Earlier in 1982, the French American Committee began looking for U.S. consultants to complement the technical work already begun by the four French consultants. They would need to prepare a detailed diagnostic report to investigate the conditions of the Statue in further detail, as many of the French consultants were unfamiliar with the construction procedures and standards, and the design and business practices employed in the United States. The inclusion of American participation was of obvious and pragmatic necessity to the restoration work that lay ahead. Several architects, structural engineers, and representatives from the NPS were brought aboard on the project. Construction work would be assigned to American contractors, and by July 1983, a joint diagnostic report was completed by the newly joint group of consultants and presented to NPS officials. By December 1983, the American group assumed many of the responsibilities concerning the design aspect of the project, and by August 1984, the American team terminated its contract with the French American Committee, owing to the Committee’s considerable fundraising problems and other related matters.

Just prior to the restoration efforts, there were an insufficient number of photographs documenting the initial reassembly of the statue (when it had been given), and too few photographs documenting the condition of the statue since its construction that were relevant to the maintenance of the statue. The NPS vowed to support the historical documentation effort, and a photographer was hired to photograph the entirety of the restoration—before, during, and after. Owing to this decision, an archive of two hundred large format photographs—both black and white, and multicolor—were developed for NPS and the [[Heritage Documentation Programs#Historic American Engineering Record (HAER)|Historic American Engineering Record]] (HAER). According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE) would also be donating a set of three-dimensional computer drawings of the statue, rendered in the [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) program.&lt;ref name="nyt-1985-12-17" &gt;{{cite news |title=Engineers Fix Original Defects in the Statue |first=Calvin |last=Sims |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/17/science/engineers-fix-original-defects-in-the-statue.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 17, 1985 |page=C1 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings were to aid in the future maintenance of the statue. These drawings were later given to the NPS, and were important in analyzing the wind bearing capacity of the structure within the statue.

==Implementation of diagnostic assessments==

===Early beginnings===

From November 7, 1982, public announcements were made by project officials that the [[Statue of Liberty]] would be completely closed to the public for as long as one year beginning in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Statue of Liberty Will Be Closed for Restoration in 1984 for As Long As a Year |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/07/nyregion/statue-of-liberty-will-be-closed-for-restoration-in-1984-for-as-long-as-a-year.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 7, 1982 |page=50 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue had been closed only once before for such an extended period of time, and that was at one point in the late 1930s. Later announcements stated that the erection of the [[scaffolding]] surrounding the outside of the statue would begin in the fall of 1983, and it was still believed in July 1983 that the restoration would begin sometime in the fall.&lt;ref name="nyt-1893-07-05"&gt;{{cite news |title=Statue of Liberty to Be Repaired Starting in Fall |first=Philip |last=Shenon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/05/nyregion/statue-of-liberty-to-be-repaired-starting-in-fall.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 5, 1983 |page=B1 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPS representatives retracted and revised the earlier announcement concerning the closure of the Island to the public; Liberty Island would in fact remain open and closings would be intermittent and only for several days at a time at most.&lt;ref name="nyt-1893-07-05" /&gt; The restoration would not begin until January 23, 1984. An article from ''The [[New York Times]]'' published the day after, indicated that the 30-month project had officially begun the day before, and that visitors would have approximately two weeks remaining before the statue would be completely enshrouded by the tons of extruded aluminum scaffolding that had just been deposited on Liberty Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Renovation Begins on Miss Liberty |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 24, 1984 |page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scaffolding contract was awarded to a company called Universal Builders Supply (UBS) Inc. on December 14, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=UBS Company History | publisher=UBS | url=http://www.ubs1.com/new-site/gallery2/gallery2embedded.php?g2_itemId=47 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205155353/http://www.ubs1.com/new-site/gallery2/gallery2embedded.php?g2_itemId=47 | archivedate=December 5, 2014 | accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract stipulated that the freestanding exterior scaffold was to be completely assembled by April 27, 1984. The {{convert|240|ft|m}} high scaffolding was designed specifically for the statue, and required ingenuity from its designers, as it could only be attached to the granite pedestal and not the statue and had to accommodate the intricate contours of the statue as well. Furthermore, the exterior scaffolding had to maintain a distance of at least 18&amp;nbsp;inches from any exposed section of the [[copper sheathing]]. The 6,000 or so separate components of the scaffold, made of a high load capacity aluminum (alloy 6061 T6), were unloaded onto Liberty Island on January 23, 1984. To prevent possible rust stains from affecting the exterior [[patina]] of the statue, the pretext was adopted of using aluminum. Screw jacks were used to brace the aluminum against the granite pedestal of the statue. More easily an interior scaffolding was developed made of interlocking pipes held together with friction clamps and anchored to the central pylon of the statue for structural support. The twenty UBS workers often resorted to assembling the interior scaffolding when the severe winds and dreadful winter weather conditions prevented them from continuing their work outside.

===Interior coating removal===

Once the interior scaffolding was installed, a thorough evaluative survey of the interior coatings was executed.&lt;ref name="Gale, F. 1984, p. 63-5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gale |first1=F. |last2=Robbins |first2=J. C. |title=Removal of Interior Coatings at the Statue of Liberty |journal=[[Bulletin of the Association for Preservation Technology]] |volume=16 |issue=3-4 |pages=63-5 |doi=10.2307/1494040 |jstor=1494040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acknowledged presumption of most involved in the restoration was that all coatings would be removed from the interior metals, that repairs would be made, that metals would be recoated, and the interior would be adequately weatherproofed. The preexisting interior coatings on both the secondary wrought iron framework and the wrought iron central pylon would be removed along with the multiple layers of coal tar and paint that had been applied to the internal copper sheathing. A ''New York Times'' article from February 8, 1984, mentioned that the interior copper which was at that time painted "government green" would be cleaned to resemble the [[Salmon (color)|salmon]] color of a new [[Penny (United States coin)|penny]]. That outermost "government green" layer was a vinyl paint applied in 1975.
 
Because certain sections that had corroded were hidden beneath the layers of coatings, no attempt was made to salvage any of the seven layers of paint, (consisting of a base coat of [[Lead(II,IV) oxide|red lead primer]] plus six additional coats) and the two layers of [[Asphalt|bituminous paint]] (a coal tar coating) that had been used as a water sealant in the statues interior around 1911. The three available coating removal methods tested, developed (or not) and implemented (or not) were: thermal coating removal, abrasive coating removal and chemical coating removal. The methods contemplated for the removal of the coatings on the interior copper differed from that of the other interior metals. For the preparation of the wrought iron parts of the statue, an abrasive removal method also known as dry sandblasting was implemented in order to prevent against flash rusting, The low dusting abrasive material used in the dry sandblasting technique was aluminum oxide.

Several coating removal methods for the interior copper were ruled out. According to the evaluative research completed, the abrasive removal method (involving aluminum oxide) could damage the underlying layer of the copper substrate. Highly flammable and toxic chemical removal methods were ruled out, as they would have been far too time consuming and could have negatively affected the delicate patina of the exterior (if seepage of the chemicals were to have occurred).

===Alternative removal method adopted===
















Two researchers, an architectural conservator from [[Columbia University]] and a historical architect working for the (North Atlantic Historic Preservation Center) NAHPC sought to address the attendant difficulties of removing the different layers of paint without further damaging the statue. The researchers finally decided upon an innovative cryogenic removal method, in which liquid nitrogen was sprayed on the paint-covered surface. The liquid nitrogen would em-brittle the layers of the paint at {{convert|-320|F|C}}, causing the cracking paint to lose the adherent properties it once possessed. It was estimated that approximately {{convert|3500|USgal|l}} of liquid nitrogen would be needed for the interior coating removal. According to the researchers, "the use of liquid nitrogen in large scale coating removal was somewhat innovative."&lt;ref name="Gale, F. 1984, p. 63-5"/&gt; The moist squirt gun division of the [[Union Carbide]] Corporation of Danbury, Connecticut, which at the time was "the largest producer of liquid atmospheric gases in the United States", donated the liquid nitrogen for the restoration efforts. The company’s researchers also worked with the NPS in fabricating special tools for controlling the application of the liquid nitrogen.

The [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] method was inadequate for the removal of the two final layers of bituminous coating that were below the surface of the seven layers of lead and vinyl based paints. A small yet powerful sandblasting tool that would sandblast and vacuum simultaneously was developed specifically for the removal of the stubborn coating. The tool devised by the Blast and Vac company of [[Bolivar, Ohio]], was "a standard blasting nozzle inside a vacuum cleaner head". A commercial grade bicarbonate of soda (baking soda), manufactured by [[Arm &amp; Hammer (brand)|Arm &amp; Hammer]] was donated and applied as the cleaning agent that would be abrasive yet gentle on the copper sheathing. The baking soda leaked through the holes and crevices in the sheathing, and was affecting the coloration of the patina on the external side of the statue so the workers would rinse the outer surface of the statue, to prevent the baking soda from turning the green patina of the statue blue.

===Coating and sealant application===

Once the layers of paint had been removed from the interior of the statue, the architects and engineers knew that a coating system far more suitable than any of the preexisting applications that had been used, would need to be implemented to protect the iron of the statue’s interior. The coating would have to be able to provide protection against corrosion in a marine environment and have to have a zero level VOC (volatile organic compound) emission rating. A coating was sought for the sandblasted central pylon and the secondary framework, and found.

In 1970, a patent was awarded to [[NASA]] for a [[Hemimorphite|zinc silicate]] primer coating called K-Zinc 531, the name owing to the ratio of silicon/potassium to water being 5:3:1.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, V., “Coating removal from the statue’s Interior” in The Statue of Liberty restoration: Proceedings of the today for tomorrow conference ed. Baboian, R., Bellante, E.L, and Cliver, E.B., p.121.&lt;/ref&gt; The coating had the following characteristics: it was non-toxic, non-flammable, and would dry smoothly on metals within half an hour of surface application. In 1981, NASA granted the license for the coating to Shane Associates of [[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania]]. In 1982 a company called Inorganic Coatings (IC) based in Malvern, a borough in Chester county Pennsylvania, signed an agreement with the former company to become the sole manufacturer and sales agent of the zinc silicate variant. The protective coating was renamed IC 531, but much like the original coating developed by NASA was a high-ratio waterborne zinc silicate. The IC 531 was used in the restoration efforts to provide a number of the structural elements of the statue with superior corrosion resistance.

==Iron armature system==

===Condition of the iron grid system prior to restoration===

Although many of the [[Armature (sculpture)|armature bars]] were replaced in 1937-38, the restoration effort involved the successful attempt to replace nearly every {{convert|2|by|5/8|in|0}} ribbon like armature bar that made up the unique internal structure of the statue (as the bars are not connected to the copper skin, but are held in place by the copper saddles that are riveted into the copper skin). A ''New York Times'' article from December 17, 1985 indicated that the most serious internal problem with the statue was the corrosion that had taken place in the iron armatures which provide the support to the copper sheathing.&lt;ref name="nyt-1985-12-17" /&gt; Eiffel knew that galvanic reaction would immediately pose a problem, owing to the dissimilarity of the metals used in the statue (copper and iron), which unless insulated would corrode rapidly. However, the method used to try and prevent galvanic corrosion of the armature system had proven to be ineffective. 

The original insulating layer implemented between the copper sheathing and the iron bars was an asbestos cloth soaked in shellac. This insulating and isolating system had separated the two metals when it was constructed, but the ingeniously devised system had broken down over time and was compromising the structural stability of many different components. The insulating layer had lost much of its functional isolating capacity due to exposure to interior condensation, leakage and possibly from other variable atmospheric effects of the marine environment. It had deteriorated into a sponge-like material which merely retained the saltwater as a conductive electrolyte. Hastening the decline of the corroded iron, the buildup of corrosive discharge exerted pressure on the riveted copper saddles that had held the iron bars in place. This created buckling and warping, and further caused the rivets to become disjointed. Rainwater would seep into the holes in the copper sheathing which once held the disjointed rivets. Some of the seams and holes were still sealed and coated with a coal tar paint applied in 1911. The streaks of coal tar paint from when it had been applied 74 years earlier were still visible during the restoration efforts. Black tar streaks from these so-called "weep holes" were running down the exterior of the statue and had altered the patina of the external copper sheathing.

An atmospheric research scientist and a technical assistant from [[Bell Labs|AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories]], developed a greenish liquid composed of corroded copper particles roughly matching the statue's exterior in chemical composition, which was then sprayed over the tar streaked exterior. The sprayed on particles were then left to develop and spread over the streaks and stains. Both researchers, specializing in the study of the corrosion on copper and copper alloys became interested in the restoration efforts and proposed to donate their expertise to the restoration effort as it would afford them with an opportunity to study the effects of the atmosphere on the hundred year old copper structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bell Lab Scientists Working as Liberty's 'Dermatologists' |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 29, 1986 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacement of the iron grid system===

[[Copper]] was considered as a possible alternative metal for the replication of the "puddled" iron armatures, but was ruled out. The NPS performed tests to assess the suitability of possible replacement materials for the iron bars. 316L stainless steel was selected to replace the approximately 1800 iron armature bars, and [[Ferralium]], a [[steel]]-[[aluminum]] [[alloy]], was chosen to replace the flat bars that connect the secondary framework to the armature. As the armatures provide the structural support for the copper skin, it was determined that no more than four bars from each of four different sections of the statue (for a total of sixteen bars) be removed at any given time. These were then replicated mostly by eye, and the replacements installed within 36 hours of the removal of the original. An [[art restoration]] company working along with a steel contractor undertook the difficult task.

Replacement bars were annealed and sandblasted to remove iron filings and other contaminants that would or could eventually cause the stainless steel to rust, and then dipped in nitric acid for protection. The "long term service behavior" of 316L [[stainless steel]], according to a professor of metallurgy at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] who had some involvement in the early stages of the restoration effort, was not known.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, K., 2004, "The Case of the Lamed Lady Liberty" Design News, 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement bars of the iron grid system were insulated from the copper with a [[polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] (Teflon) polymer resin tape produced by the [[DuPont]] company.

A ''New York Times'' article from May 31, 1986 reported that inspection crews overseeing the restoration efforts had noticed several months earlier that a five foot long armature bar near one of the arms had been stamped with the forty names of the forty iron workers who had installed the armatures. The bar, which had to be replaced, was paid for by the contractors. Before being replaced, the bar was photographed; the image is in the June 1986 issue of [[Smithsonian (magazine)|''Smithsonian'']] magazine.

===Torch===

The torch was removed from the statue on July 4, 1984. An article in ''The New York Times'' from October 8, 1984, stated that the new torch is to be completed in the same manner that the old torch was made in 14 months by ten craftsmen from Les metalliers Champenois based in Reims, and that a workshop at the statue's base on Liberty Island had been made accessible to the public that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Torch of Liberty to Be Built by French |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/08/nyregion/new-torch-of-liberty-to-be-built-by-french.html |newspaper=The New York Times |agency=United Press International |date=October 8, 1984 |page=B2 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural misalignment issues==

===Initial assessments===

Within the copper body of the statue is the structural support system consisting of a 97-foot (30 m) central pylon, which is the backbone of the statue. The pylon consists of four girders with horizontal and diagonal cross bracing systems, which provide support to the secondary framework and to the armature, and a 40-foot (12 m) long extension that supports the raised arm and torch. It had been a well-documented fact at least since 1932 (when the War Department reinforced the arm-shoulder structure), that the support for the shoulder of the upheld arm had been misaligned. Then, it was discovered that the arch that supports the head of the statue had also been misaligned. The cause(s) of the misalignments are undetermined, but a few hypotheses have been suggested. The first hypothesis proposed was that Viollet le Duc—the engineer who initially worked on the project with Bartholdi and who designed the structural reinforcement of the arm and the head (displayed in 1876 at the Centennial exhibition in Philadelphia)&lt;ref&gt;Howe, J., 2002, "A 'Monster Edifice': Ambivalence, Appropriation, and the Forging of Cultural Identity at the Centennial Exhibition", The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, 126:4 p.648.&lt;/ref&gt; had died after having completed those two sections—and had employed engineering methods that differed significantly from those of the better-known bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel, who had finished the remainder of the work on the statue, and who is generally credited for the statue's remarkable structure. The second hypothesis was that the Americans, after having uncrated the different sections of the statue in 1886, incorrectly reassembled the structural framework. The third hypothesis is that the statue’s creator, Bartholdi, was aesthetically dissatisfied when the statue was fully assembled and displayed in Paris on or just prior to July 4, 1884, and that he must have willingly sacrificed the structural integrity for his aesthetic vision.

One of the main architects of the restoration project was initially convinced that the second hypothesis was correct, but according to a quoted and published statement, recent research had convinced him of the veracity of the third hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, E.V., 1986, "Engineering Miss Liberty's Rescue" Popular Science, 228:6, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant problems were consequences of poor design and construction choices implemented initially, but Eiffel could not have directly been responsible for such glaring mistakes according to the (same) architect.&lt;ref name="nyt-1985-12-17" /&gt; Computer aided design drawings were used to illustrate how the head and the hand wielding the torch had been misaligned, and how the misalignment had caused the spikes of the crown to damage a section of the torch-bearing arm. The "13 trouble spots of the statue" were visually emphasized in a front page ''New York Times'' article from July 20, 1983. The head was {{convert|2|ft|cm}} off center and the upheld arm was {{convert|18|in|cm}}away from where it was designed to be.

With the computer simulations of the CAD program, the architects were able to assess the likelihood of implementing either of the following options to address the misalignment issue: the option of rebuilding the arm-shoulder connection as Eiffel had envisioned it, or they could strengthen the preexisting misalignment by adding new diagonal bracing and steel plates. The latter option would have the intended effect of further reinforcing the repairs that had been made when the problem was initially noticed in 1932 by the War department when it had jurisdiction over the statue. Regardless, the "finite element analysis" of the computer simulation showed that both solutions would work. Additional supports were also added inside the head to improve overall stability. Hence, the positions of the arm and the head would remain as they had been since they were reassembled on [[Bedloe's Island]] in 1886.

===Preservation objectives===

According to the ''New York Times'', the architects on the project assured the reporter that despite the misalignment, "cosmetic changes" to the statue would not take place.&lt;ref name="nyt-1985-12-17" /&gt; Several commentators on the historic restoration project seemed to have reiterated a similar guiding sentiment: that preservation rather than unnecessary replacement would be the objective of the current restoration effort. This was quite reassuring, in the light of proposals put forward early on during the restoration efforts such as the following: "cleaning and polishing of the statue’s exterior; demolition of the statue, selling of the copper and the use of the funds raised to build an exact duplicate in fiberglass; the application of an epoxy coating to the exterior and the construction of a competing monument..."&lt;ref&gt;Bellante, E.l., and Cliver, E.B, 1987 "Restoring the Statue of Liberty: Construction or Conservation?" In: Old cultures in New Worlds 8th ICOMOS General Assembly and International Symposium. Programme report - Compte rendu. US/ICOMOS, Washington, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''New York Times'' article from February 8, 1984 mentioned that the idea to have an elevator that would reach to the crown of the statue had been recently abandoned. A double level hydraulic glass elevator would be installed inside the base of the statue from which visitors would be able to access the crown by ascending a few steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interior Restoration Set at the Statue of Liberty |first=Jane |last=Perlez |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/08/nyregion/interior-restoration-set-at-the-statue-of-liberty.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 8, 1984 |page=B3 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the interior had been reconstructed, with a great deal of emphasis placed on enhancing the visitors experience, as the original structure was not devised with the visitor in mind, poor lighting conditions, no ventilation and a very inadequate and basic heating system were to be changed.

Prior to the restoration, much of the internal structure of the statue was out of sight behind the mesh wire walls of the original helical stairs. It should be noted that the stairs were originally intended for workmen. Neither the architect nor the artist had envisioned that the lady would welcome visitors internally. Elevators were first installed in 1908–9. A ''New York Times'' article published less than a month and a half from the centennial celebration, discussed the changes within the statue as being the most spectacular. The journalist added: that "now that the walls have been removed, what is revealed is an interior that seems to combine the toughness of 19th century industrial construction and the grace of a cathedral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Triumph of Restoration Enters Its Final, Fenzied Weeks - For Miss Liberty, A New Grandeur |first=Paul |last=Goldberger |authorlink=Paul Goldberger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/27/nyregion/triumph-restoration-enters-its-final-frenzied-weeks-for-miss-liberty-new.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 27, 1986 |page=B1 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conservatism''' is a [[Political philosophy|political]] and [[social philosophy]] promoting traditional social institutions in the context of [[culture]] and [[civilization]]. The central tenets of conservatism include tradition, human imperfection, [[organic society]], hierarchy, authority, and [[property rights]].{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=68}} Conservatives seek to preserve a range of institutions such as [[monarchy]], religion, [[parliamentary government]], and property rights, with the aim of emphasizing social stability and continuity.{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=69}} The more extreme elements—[[reactionaries]]—oppose [[modernism]] and seek a return to "the way things were".&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, "Conservatism", ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', Third Edition, "Sometimes it (conservatism) has been outright opposition, based on an existing model of society that is considered right for all time. It can take a 'reactionary' form, harking back to, and attempting to reconstruct, forms of society which existed in an earlier period", Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920516-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133435/conservatism|title=Conservatism (political philosophy)|publisher=Britannica.com}} Retrieved on 1 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first established use of the term in a political context originated in 1818 with [[François-René de Chateaubriand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerry Z. Muller|title=Conservatism: An Anthology of Social and Political Thought from David Hume to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9F7i5u4sOtgC&amp;pg=PA26|year=1997|publisher=Princeton U.P.|page=26|quote=Terms related to 'conservative' first found their way into political discourse in the title of the French weekly journal, ''Le Conservateur'', founded in 1818 by François-René de Chateaubriand with the aid of Louis de Bonald.|isbn=0691037116}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the period of [[Bourbon Restoration]] that sought to roll back the policies of the [[French Revolution]]. Historically associated with [[right-wing politics]], the term has since been used to describe [[#Forms|a wide range of views]]. There is no single set of policies regarded as conservative because the meaning of conservatism depends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time. Thus conservatives from different parts of the world—each upholding their respective traditions—may disagree on a wide range of issues. [[Edmund Burke]], an 18th-century politician who opposed the French Revolution but supported the [[American Revolution]], is credited as one of the main theorists of [[conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservatism in Great Britain in the 1790s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank O'Gorman|title=Edmund Burke: His Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-reNJAnv1oC&amp;pg=PA171|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=171|isbn=9780415326841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], the chairman of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1959: "Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a timeless function in the development of a free society, and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Quintin Hogg Baron Hailsham of St. Marylebone|title=The Conservative Case|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22+attitude,+a+constant+force,+performing+a+timeless+function+in+the+development+of+a+free+society,+and+corresponding+to+a+deep+and+permanent+requirement+of+human+nature+itself%22&amp;num=10|year=1959|publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the tradition-based definition of conservatism, some political theorists such as [[Corey Robin]] define conservatism primarily in terms of a general defense of [[Social inequality|social]] and [[economic inequality]]. From this perspective, conservatism is less an attempt to uphold traditional institutions and more, "a meditation on — and theoretical rendition of — the felt experience of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/what-does-conservatism-stand-for|title=What does conservatism stand for?|last=Rooksby|first=Ed|date=15 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Conservative-Mind/130199/|title=The Conservative Mind|last=Robin|first=Corey|date=8 January 2012|work=|newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberal conservatism ===
{{Main|Liberal conservatism}}
[[Liberal conservatism]] incorporates the [[classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy. Individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} Liberal conservatism is a variant of conservatism that is strongly influenced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGNRRwkZFysC&amp;pg=PA109|title=Analyzing Politics|last=Grigsby|first=Ellen|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-495-50112-1|location=|pages=108–09, 112, 347|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As these latter two terms have had different meanings over time and across countries, liberal conservatism also has a wide variety of meanings. Historically, the term often referred to the combination of [[economic liberalism]], which champions ''[[laissez-faire]]'' markets, with the classical conservatism concern for established [[tradition]], respect for authority and religious values. It contrasted itself with [[classical liberalism]], which supported [[freedom for the individual]] in both the economic and social spheres.

Over time, the general conservative ideology in many countries adopted economic liberal arguments and the term liberal conservatism was replaced with conservatism. This is also the case in countries where liberal economic ideas have been the tradition such as the United States and are thus considered conservative. In other countries where liberal conservative movements have entered the political mainstream, such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], the terms liberal and conservative may be synonymous. The liberal conservative tradition in the United States combines the economic [[individualism]] of the classical liberals with a [[Burkean]] form of conservatism (which has also become part of the [[American conservative]] tradition, such as in the writings of [[Russell Kirk]]).

A secondary meaning for the term liberal conservatism that has developed in [[Europe]] is a combination of more modern conservative (less traditionalist) views with those of [[social liberalism]]. This has developed as an opposition to the more [[collectivist]] views of [[socialism]]. Often this involves stressing what are now conservative views of [[free market]] economics and belief in individual responsibility, with social liberal views on defence of [[civil rights]], [[environmentalism]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. In continental Europe, this is sometimes also translated into English as social conservatism.

=== Conservative liberalism ===
{{Main|Conservative liberalism}}
[[Conservative liberalism]] is a variant of liberalism that combines liberal values and policies with conservative stances, or more simply the right-wing of the liberal movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm Ipolitique.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319053712/http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm |date=March 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.de/contents.html|title=parties-and-elections.de|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mair"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Representative Government in Europe|last=Gallagher|first=M.|last2=Laver|first2=M.|last3=Mair|first3=P.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=221|quote=|author-link=Michael Gallagher (academic)|author-link3=Peter Mair|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of conservative liberalism are found at the beginning of the [[History of liberal thought|history of liberalism]]. Until the two [[World Wars]], in most European countries the political class was formed by conservative liberals, from Germany to Italy. Events after [[World War I]] brought the more radical version of classical liberalism to a more conservative (i.e. more moderate) type of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Liberalism|last=Allen|first=R.T.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=13|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Libertarian conservatism ===
{{Main|Libertarian conservatism}}
[[Libertarian conservatism]] describes certain political ideologies within the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] which combine [[libertarian]] economic issues with aspects of conservatism. Its four main branches are [[constitutionalism]], [[paleolibertarianism]], [[American conservatism|small government conservatism]] and [[Christian libertarianism]]. They generally differ from [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]], in that they are in favor of more [[liberty|personal]] and [[economic freedom]].

[[Agorist]]s such as [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] labeled libertarian conservatism [[right-libertarianism]].&lt;ref name="nlm"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Libertarian Manifesto |url=http://agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223021118/http://www.agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |archivedate=February 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview With Samuel Edward Konkin III|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/software/konkin-interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to paleoconservatives, libertarian conservatives support strict ''laissez-faire'' policies such as [[free trade]], opposition to any national bank and opposition to [[regulations|business regulations]]. They are vehemently opposed to [[environmental regulation]]s, [[corporate welfare]], [[subsidies]] and other areas of economic intervention.

Many conservatives, especially in the United States, believe that the government should not play a major role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose efforts to charge high tax rates and to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work.

=== Fiscal conservatism ===
{{Main|Fiscal conservatism}}
[[File:TeaPartyByFreedomFan.JPG|thumb|[[Taxpayer March on Washington]], as conservative protesters walk down [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], Washington, D.C., in 2009]]
[[Fiscal conservatism]] is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B10JkvO82x8C&amp;pg=PA109|title=Correctional Organization and Management: Public Policy Challenges, Behavior, and Structure|first=Robert M.|last=Freeman|publisher=Elsevier|year=1999|page=109|isbn=978-0-7506-9897-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', Edmund Burke argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer: &lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied...[T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== National and traditional conservatism ===

[[File:Gianfranco Fini 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gianfranco Fini]], former President of the Italian [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]], in 2004]]
[[National conservatism]] is a political term used primarily in Europe to describe a variant of conservatism which concentrates more on national interests than standard conservatism as well as upholding cultural and ethnic identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary Of Public Administration|last=Mandal|first=V.C.|year=2007|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|location=|isbn=978-81-7625-784-8|page=306|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Hs0xJORVIHwC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;cd=8&amp;q=%22National%20conservatism%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while not being outspokenly [[Nationalism|nationalist]] or supporting a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jason (August 23, 2016).

National conservatism is heavily oriented towards the traditional [[family]] and social stability as well as in favour of limiting [[immigration]]. As such, national conservatives can be distinguished from economic conservatives, for whom free market economic policies, [[deregulation]] and fiscal conservatism are the main priorities. Some commentators have identified a growing gap between national and economic conservatism: "[M]ost parties of the Right [today] are run by economic conservatives who, in varying degrees, have marginalized social, cultural, and national conservatives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v49/ai_19559422 National questions – conservatives fragmenting as liberals unite]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}, National Review, June 30, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; National conservatism is also related to [[traditionalist conservatism]].

Traditionalist conservatism is a political philosophy emphasizing the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[tradition]], [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]] as well as the intersecting spheres of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 870–75&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditionalists have embraced the labels "[[reactionary]]" and "[[counterrevolution]]ary", defying the stigma that has attached to these terms since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Having a hierarchical view of society, many traditionalist conservatives, including a few Americans, defend the [[monarchy|monarchical]] political structure as the most natural and beneficial social arrangement.

=== Cultural and social conservatism ===
{{Main|Cultural conservatism|social conservatism}}
[[Cultural conservative]]s support the preservation of the heritage of one nation, or of a shared culture that is not defined by national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbwDNb5jtzUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Cultural Conservatism, Political Liberalism: From Criticism to Cultural Studies |first=James |last=Seaton |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-472-10645-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shared culture may be as divergent as [[Western culture]] or [[Chinese culture]]. In the United States, the term cultural conservative may imply a conservative position in the [[culture war]]. Cultural conservatives hold fast to traditional ways of thinking even in the face of monumental change. They believe strongly in traditional values and traditional politics and often have an urgent sense of nationalism.

[[Social conservatism]] is distinct from cultural conservatism, although there are some overlaps. Social conservatives may believe that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions;{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=69}} and that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or behaviours. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores, often by opposing what they consider radical policies or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]]. Social change is generally regarded as suspect.

A second meaning of the term social conservatism developed in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[continental Europe]], where it refers to liberal conservatives supporting modern [[European welfare state]]s.

Social conservatives (in the first meaning of the word) in many countries generally favour the [[pro-life]] position in the [[abortion controversy]] and oppose human [[embryonic stem cell]] research (particularly if publicly funded); oppose both [[eugenics]] and [[human enhancement]] ([[transhumanism]]) while supporting [[bioconservatism]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utne.com/2005-01-01/TheNextDigitalDivide.aspx?page=2 The Next Digital Divide] (utne article)&lt;/ref&gt; support a traditional definition of marriage as being one man and one woman; view the [[nuclear family]] model as society's foundational unit; oppose expansion of [[civil marriage]] and [[child adoption]] to couples in [[same-sex relationship]]s; promote [[public morality]] and traditional [[family values]]; oppose [[atheism]],&lt;ref&gt;"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God." President George H. W.

Most conservatives in the United States support the [[death penalty]].

=== Religious conservatism {{anchor|Religious conservatism}}===
{{See also|Christian right|Religious fundamentalism}}
[[File:Marche pour la vie 2012 - 6.jpg|thumb|[[March for Life (Paris)|March for Life]] in Paris, France in 2012]]
Religious conservatism principally apply the teachings of particular religions to politics, sometimes by merely proclaiming the value of those teachings, at other times by having those teachings influence laws.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Margaret L., Taylor, Howard Francis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&amp;pg=PA469 ''Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society''] Cengage Learning, 4th Ed. (2005), pp. 469–70.  {{ISBN|978-0-534-61716-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most democracies, political conservatism seeks to uphold traditional family structures and social values. Religious conservatives typically oppose abortion, homosexual behavior, drug use&lt;ref&gt;"So Christians do not approve of the taking of illegal drugs, including most recreational drugs, especially those which can alter the mind and make people incapable of praying or being alert to God." http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/sanctity/chdrugsrev2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and sexual activity outside of marriage. In some cases, conservative values are grounded in religious beliefs and conservatives seek to increase the role of religion in public life.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, David L. (2005). "Genesis and Family Values". ''Journal of Biblical Literature''. '''124''' (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paternalistic conservatism ===
{{Main|Paternalistic conservatism}}
Paternalistic conservatism is a strand in conservatism which reflects the belief that societies exist and develop organically and that members within them have obligations towards each other.{{sfn|Heywood|2013|p=34}} There is particular emphasis on the [[Noblesse oblige|paternalistic obligation]] of those who are [[Social privilege|privileged]] and [[wealth]]y to the [[Poverty|poorer parts of society]]. Since it is consistent with principles such as [[Organic unity|organicism]], [[hierarchy]] and [[duty]], it can be seen an outgrowth of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservatism]]. Paternal conservatives support neither the [[individual]] nor the [[State (polity)|state]] in principle, but are instead prepared to support either or recommend a balance between the two depending on what is most practical.{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=80}}

It stresses the importance of a [[social safety net]] to deal with [[poverty]], support of limited [[redistribution of wealth]] along with government regulation to regulate markets in the interests of both consumers and producers.&lt;ref name="Patrick Dunleavy 2000. pp. 107–08"&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran. ''British Political Science: Fifty Years of Political Studies''. Oxford, England, UK; Malden, Massachusetts, US: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. pp. 107–08&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalistic conservatism first arose as a distinct ideology in the [[United Kingdom]] under Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s "[[One nation conservatism|One Nation]]" [[Toryism]].&lt;ref name="Patrick Dunleavy 2000. pp. 107–08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blake. Disraeli. Second Edition. London, England, UK: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode (Publishers) Ltd, 1967. p. 524&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a variety of one nation conservative governments. In the United Kingdom, the Prime Ministers Disraeli, [[Stanley Baldwin]], [[Neville Chamberlain]], [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Harold Macmillan]]&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Russel. The Tory Party: its policies, divisions and future. Penguin, 1978. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; were one nation conservatives.

In [[Germany]], during the 19th-century [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] adopted policies of state-organized compulsory insurance for workers against sickness, accident, incapacity and old age. Chancellor [[Leo von Caprivi]] promoted a conservative agenda called the "New Course".&lt;ref&gt;John Alden Nichols. ''Germany after Bismarck, the Caprivi era, 1890–1894: Issue 5''. Harvard University Press, 1958. p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the administration of President [[William Howard Taft]] was a progressive conservative and he described himself as "a believer in progressive conservatism"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lurie. William Howard Taft: The Travails of a Progressive Conservative. New York, New York, US: Cambridge University Press, 2012. p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; and President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] declared himself an advocate of "progressive conservatism".&lt;ref&gt;[[Günter Bischof]]. "Eisenhower, the Judiciary, and Desegregation" by Stanley I. Kutler, ''Eisenhower: a centenary assessment''. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Canada]], a variety of conservative governments have been part of the [[Red tory]] tradition, with Canada's former major conservative party being named the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] from 1942 to 2003.&lt;ref name="Hugh Segal 2011. pp. 113–48"&gt;Hugh Segal. The Right Balance. Victoria, British Columbia, Canada: Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2011. pp. 113–48&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the Prime Ministers [[Arthur Meighen]], [[R. B. Bennett]], [[John Diefenbaker]], [[Joe Clark]], [[Brian Mulroney]], and [[Kim Campbell]] led Red tory federal governments.&lt;ref name="Hugh Segal 2011. pp. 113–48"/&gt;

=== Authoritarian conservatism ===
{{Main|Far-right politics}}
[[Authoritarian conservatism]] refers to autocratic regimes that center their ideology around conservative nationalism rather than [[ethnic nationalism]], though certain racial components such as [[antisemitism]] may exist.&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Kater. Never Sang for Hitler: The Life and Times of Lotte Lehmann, 1888–1976. Cambridge University Press, 2008. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian conservative movements show strong devotion towards religion, tradition and culture while also expressing fervent nationalism akin to other far-right nationalist movements. Examples of authoritarian conservative leaders include [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]&lt;ref&gt;Howard J. Wiarda, Margaret MacLeish Mott. Catholic Roots and Democratic Flowers: Political Systems in Spain and Portugal. Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Engelbert Dollfuss]].&lt;ref&gt;Günter J. Bischof, Anton Pelinka, Alexander Lassner. The Dollfuss/Schuschnigg Era in Austria: A Reassessment. Piscataway, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2001. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian conservative movements were prominent in the same era as [[fascism]], with which it sometimes clashed. Although both ideologies shared core values such as nationalism and had common enemies such as [[communism]] and [[materialism]], there was nonetheless a contrast between the traditionalist nature of authoritarian conservatism and the revolutionary, [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|palingenetic]] and populist nature of fascism—thus it was common for authoritarian conservative regimes to suppress rising fascist and [[National Socialism (disambiguation)|National Socialist movements]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The hostility between the two ideologies is highlighted by the struggle for power for the [[Austrian National Socialism|National Socialists]] in Austria, which was marked by the assassination of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]].

Sociologist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] has examined the class basis of right-wing extremist politics in the 1920–1960 era. He reports:
: Conservative or rightist extremist movements have arisen at different periods in modern history, ranging from the [[Miklós Horthy|Horthyites]] in Hungary, the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Christian Social Party of Dollfuss in Austria]], the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]] and other nationalists in pre-Hitler Germany, and [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar in Portugal]], to the pre-1966 Gaullist movements and the monarchists in contemporary France and Italy. The right extremists are conservative, not revolutionary. They seek to change political institutions in order to preserve or restore cultural and economic ones, while extremists of the centre and left seek to use political means for cultural and social revolution. The ideal of the right extremist is not a totalitarian ruler, but a monarch, or a traditionalist who acts like one. Many such movements in Spain,  Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Italy-have been explicitly monarchist....The supporters of these movements differ from those of the centrists, tending to be wealthier, and more religious, which is more important in terms of a potential for mass support.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour M.

{{Toryism|Related}}
In Great Britain, conservative ideas (though not yet called that) emerged in the [[Tory]] movement during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period (1660–1688). Toryism supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]. [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] opposed the idea that sovereignty derived from the people and rejected the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha: or the Natural Power of Kings'' (published posthumously in 1680, but written before the [[English Civil War]] of 1642–1651) became accepted as the statement of their doctrine. However, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 destroyed this principle to some degree by establishing a constitutional government in England, leading to the hegemony of the Tory-opposed [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] ideology. Faced with defeat, the Tories reformed their movement, now holding that sovereignty was vested in the three estates of Crown, Lords and Commons&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=ix, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than solely in the Crown. Toryism became marginalized during the long period of Whig ascendancy in the 18th century.

[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797)]]
Conservatives typically see [[Richard Hooker]] (1554–1600) as the founding father of conservatism, along with the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]] (1633–1695), [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797). Halifax promoted pragmatism in government whilst Hume argued against political rationalism and utopianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Muller|editor1-first=Jerry Z.|title=Conservatism: an anthology of social and political thought from David Hume to the present|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolin|first1=Sheldon S.|title=Hume and Conservatism|journal=American Political Science Review|date=2 September 2013|volume=48|issue=4|pages=999–1016|doi=10.2307/1951007|jstor=1951007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke served as the private secretary to the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquis of Rockingham]] and as official pamphleteer to the [[Rockingham Whigs|Rockingham branch of the Whig party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edmund Burke: selected writings and speeches|last=Stanlis|first=Peter J.|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=18|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the Tories, they were the conservatives in the late 18th century United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Morton Auerbach|title=The Conservative Illusion|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AuerbachMMorton-1959?View=FindIt|publisher=Columbia University Press (1959)|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's views were a mixture of liberal and conservative. He supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1765–1783, but abhorred the violence of the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799). He accepted the liberal ideals of private property and the economics of [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790), but thought that economics should remain subordinate to the conservative social ethic, that capitalism should be subordinate to the medieval social tradition and that the business class should be subordinate to [[aristocracy]]. He insisted on standards of honor derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition and saw the aristocracy as the nation's natural leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=37–40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That meant limits on the powers of the Crown, since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive. He favored an [[established church]], but allowed for a degree of [[religious toleration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=52–54|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke justified the social order on the basis of tradition: tradition represented the wisdom of the species and he valued community and social harmony over social reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|page=41|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was a leading theorist in his day, finding extreme idealism (either Tory or Whig) an endangerment to broader liberties and (like Hume) rejecting abstract reason as an unsound guide for political theory. Despite their influence on future conservative thought, none of these early contributors were explicitly involved in Tory politics. Hooker lived in the 16th century, long before the advent of [[toryism]], whilst Hume was an apolitical philosopher and Halifax similarly politically independent. Burke described himself as a Whig.

===== Revival =====
Shortly after Burke's death in 1797, conservatism revived as a mainstream political force as the Whigs suffered a series of internal divisions. This new generation of conservatives derived their politics not from Burke but from his predecessor, the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Viscount Bolingbroke]] (1678–1751), who was a Jacobite and traditional Tory, lacking Burke's sympathies for Whiggish policies such as [[Catholic emancipation]] and [[American Revolution|American independence]] (famously attacked by [[Samuel Johnson]] in "Taxation No Tyranny"). In the first half of the 19th century, many newspapers, magazines and journals promoted loyalist or right-wing attitudes in religion, politics and international affairs. Burke was seldom mentioned, but [[William Pitt the Younger]] (1759–1806) became a conspicuous hero. The most prominent journals included ''The Quarterly Review'', founded in 1809 as a counterweight to the Whigs' ''Edinburgh Review'' and the even more conservative ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Sack finds that the ''Quarterly Review'' promoted a balanced Canningite toryism as it was neutral on Catholic emancipation and only mildly critical of Nonconformist Dissent; it opposed slavery and supported the current poor laws; and it was "aggressively imperialist". The [[high-church]] clergy of the Church of England read the ''[[Orthodox Churchman's Magazine]]'' which was equally hostile to Jewish, Catholic, [[Jacobin]], [[Methodist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] spokesmen. Anchoring the ultra Tories, ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' stood firmly against Catholic emancipation and favoured slavery, cheap money, mercantilism, the [[Navigation Acts]] and the [[Holy Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sack|first=J.

Conservatism evolved after 1820, embracing free trade in 1846 and a commitment to democracy, especially under Disraeli. The effect was to significantly strengthen conservatism as a grassroots political force. Conservatism no longer was the philosophical defense of the landed aristocracy, but had been refreshed into redefining its commitment to the ideals of order, both secular and religious, expanding imperialism, strengthened monarchy and a more generous vision of the welfare state as opposed to the punitive vision of the Whigs and liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys, "Political Thought," in Chris Williams, ed., ''A Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2006). p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1835, Disraeli attacked the Whigs and utilitarians as slavishly devoted to an industrial oligarchy, while he described his fellow Tories as the only "really democratic party of England" and devoted to the interests of the whole people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Richmond|author2=Paul Smith|title=The Self-Fashioning of Disraeli, 1818–1851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnF3IRJbKR8C&amp;pg=PA162|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=162|isbn=9780521497299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, inside the party there was a tension between the growing numbers of wealthy businessmen on the one side and the aristocracy and rural gentry on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=39–40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocracy gained strength as businessmen discovered they could use their wealth to buy a peerage and a country estate.

Although conservatives opposed attempts to allow greater representation of the middle class in parliament, they conceded that [[electoral reform]] could not be reversed and promised to support further reforms so long as they did not erode the institutions of church and state. These new principles were presented in the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] of 1834, which historians regard as the basic statement of the beliefs of the new Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Peel Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robert Peel]] (1788–1850)]]
Some conservatives lamented the passing of a pastoral world where the ethos of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' had promoted respect from the lower classes. They saw the [[Anglican Church]] and the aristocracy as balances against commercial wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked toward legislation for improved working conditions and urban housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint would later be called [[Tory democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Burke there has always been tension between traditional aristocratic conservatism and the wealthy business class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, Tory [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] in which he pledged to endorse moderate political reform. This marked the beginning of the transformation of British conservatism from [[High Tory]] reactionism towards a more modern form based on "conservation". The party became known as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] as a result, a name it has retained to this day. However, Peel would also be the root of a split in the party between the traditional Tories (led by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]) and the "Peelites" (led first by Peel himself, then by the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]]). The split occurred in 1846 over the issue of [[free trade]], which Peel supported, versus [[protectionism]], supported by Derby. The majority of the party sided with Derby whilst about a third split away, eventually merging with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[radicalism (politics)|radicals]] to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Despite the split, the mainstream Conservative Party accepted the doctrine of free trade in 1852.

In the second half of the 19th century, the Liberal Party faced political schisms, especially over [[History of Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Home Rule]]. Leader [[William Gladstone]] (himself a former Peelite) sought to give Ireland a degree of autonomy, a move that elements in both the left and right-wings of his party opposed. These split off to become the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] (led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]]), forming a coalition with the Conservatives before merging with them in 1912. The Liberal Unionist influence dragged the Conservative Party towards the left as Conservative governments passing a number of progressive reforms at the turn of the 20th century. By the late 19th century, the traditional business supporters of the Liberal Party had joined the Conservatives, making them the party of [[business]] and [[commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=|last=Feuchtwanger|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=273|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of Liberal dominance before the [[First World War]], the Conservatives gradually became more influential in government, regaining full control of the cabinet in 1922. In the interwar period, conservatism was the major ideology in Britain&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Ball, "Baldwin, Stanley, first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1867–1947)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross McKibbin, ''Parties and people: England, 1914–1951'' (Oxford, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garside, W.R.; Greaves, J.I. (1997). "Rationalisation and Britain's industrial Malaise: The interwar years revisited". ''Journal of European Economic History''. '''26''' (1): 37–68.&lt;/ref&gt; as the Liberal Party vied with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] for control of the left. After the [[Second World War]], the first Labour government (1945–1951) under [[Clement Attlee]] embarked on a program of nationalization of industry and the promotion of social welfare. The Conservatives generally accepted those policies until the 1980s.

Other conservative political parties, such as the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP, founded in 1993), [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP, founded in 1971), began to appear, although they have yet to make any significant impact at Westminster ({{as of |2014 |lc = on}}, the DUP comprises the largest political party in the ruling coalition in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]), and since 2017 the DUP has provided support for the Conservative [[Second May ministry|minority government]].

==== France ====
[[File:Jmaistre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph de Maistre]] (1753–1821)]]
Another form of conservatism developed in France in parallel to conservatism in Britain. It was influenced by [[Counter-Enlightenment]] works by men such as [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Louis de Bonald]]. Latin conservatism was less pragmatic and more [[reactionary]] than the conservatism of Burke.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Many continental or traditionalist conservatives do not support [[separation of church and state]], with most supporting state recognition of and cooperation with the [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]], such as had existed in France before the Revolution.

Eventually, conservatives added [[Gaullism]], [[patriotism]], and [[nationalism]] to the list of traditional values they support. Conservatives were the first to embrace nationalism, which was previously associated with [[liberalism]] and the Revolution in France.&lt;ref&gt;ams, Ian Political Ideology Today (2nd edition), Manchester University Press, 2002, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
{{Main|Conservatism in Germany}}
Conservatism developed alongside nationalism in Germany, culminating in Germany's victory over France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the creation of the unified [[German Empire]] in 1871 and the simultaneous rise of [[Otto von Bismarck]] on the European political stage. Bismarck's "balance of power" model maintained peace in Europe for decades at the end of the 19th century. His "revolutionary conservatism" was a conservative state-building strategy designed to make ordinary Germans—not just the Junker elite—more loyal to state and emperor, he created the modern welfare state in Germany in the 1880s. According to Kees van Kersbergen and Barbara Vis, his strategy was: {{Quote|[G]ranting social rights to enhance the integration of a hierarchical society, to forge a bond between workers and the state so as to strengthen the latter, to maintain traditional relations of authority between social and status groups, and to provide a countervailing power against the modernist forces of liberalism and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kersbergen|first1=Kees van|last2=Vis|first2=Barbara|title=Comparative Welfare State Politics: Development, Opportunities, and Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQL3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=38|isbn=9781107652477}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Bismarck also enacted universal male suffrage in the new German Empire in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Robert Laurence|last2=Vaudagna|first2=Maurizio|title=The American Century in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeoqKSxiOu4C&amp;pg=PA226|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=226|isbn=0801440750}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a great hero to German conservatives, who erected many monuments to his memory after he left office in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankel|first=Richard|date=|year=2003|title=From the Beer Halls to the Halls of Power: The Cult of Bismarck and the Legitimization of a New German Right, 1898–1945|url=|journal=German Studies Review|volume=26|issue=3|pages=543–60|doi=10.2307/1432746|jstor=1432746|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of [[Nazism]] in 1933, [[agrarianism|agrarian movements]] faded and was supplanted by a more command-based economy and forced social integration. Though [[Adolf Hitler]] succeeded in garnering the support of many German industrialists, prominent traditionalists openly and secretly opposed his policies of euthanasia, genocide and attacks on organized religion, including [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[Henning von Tresckow]], Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]] and the monarchist [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]].

More recently, the work of conservative [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] leader and Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] helped bring about [[German reunification]], along with the closer integration of Europe in the form of the [[Maastricht Treaty]].

Three conservative leaders in the EPP included [[Prime Minister of Spain]] [[Mariano Rajoy]] (2011-18), [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]] and [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] [[Viktor Orbán]].]]
Today, German conservatism is often associated with politicians such as Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], whose tenure has been marked by attempts to save the common European currency ([[Euro]]) from demise. The German conservatives are divided under Merkel due to the refugee crisis in Germany and many conservatives in the [[CDU/CSU]] oppose the refugee and migrant policies developed under Merkel.

==== United States ====
{{Main|Conservatism in the United States}}
American conservatism is a broad system of political beliefs in the [[United States]] that is characterized by respect for American traditions, support for [[Judeo-Christian ethics|Judeo-Christian]] values, [[economic liberalism]], [[anti-communism]] and a defense of [[Western culture]]. [[Liberty]] within the bounds of conformity to Conservatism is a core value, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the [[free market]], limiting the size and scope of government and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur.

The major conservative party in the United States is the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], also known as the GOP (Grand Old Party). American conservatives consider [[individualism|individual liberty]] as long as it conforms to Conservative values, [[small government]], [[deregulation]] of the government, [[economic liberalism]] and [[free trade]], as the fundamental traits of democracy, which contrasts with [[Modern Liberalism in the United States|modern American liberals]], who generally place a greater value on [[social equality]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory L. Schneider, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IVD3z0PuTRQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Conservative Century: From Reaction to Revolution]'' "The label (conservatism) is in frequent use and has come to stand for a skepticism, at times an outright hostility, toward government social policies; a muscular foreign policy combined with a patriotic nationalism; a defense of traditional Christian religious values; and support for the free market economic system.", "Within the conservative disposition in America there are inherent contradictions between supporters of social order and tradition and supporters of individual freedom.", (2009) pp. 4–9, 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood Thompson, ''Encyclopedia of Diversity and Social Justice''  p. 7: "Historically...social justice became associated with liberalism in which equality is the ideal.", Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1442216044}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic conservatism in different countries ===
{{Further|Right-wing politics|Political spectrum}}
Conservative political parties vary widely from country to country in the goals they wish to achieve. Both conservative and liberal parties tend to favor private ownership of property, in opposition to communist, socialist and green parties, which favor communal ownership or laws requiring social responsibility on the part of property owners. Where conservatives and liberals differ is primarily on social issues. Conservatives tend to reject behavior that does not [[conformity|conform]] to some [[social norm]]. Modern conservative parties often define themselves by their opposition to liberal or labor parties. The United States usage of the term "conservative" is unique to that country.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''.

According to Alan Ware, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom retained viable conservative parties into the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-19-878076-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ware said that Australia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malta, New Zealand, Spain and the United States had no conservative parties, although they had either Christian democrats or liberals as major right-wing parties. Canada, Ireland and Portugal had right-wing political parties that defied categorization: the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]]; [[Fianna Fáil]], [[Fine Gael]] and [[Progressive Democrats]] in Ireland; and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan.

[[Louis Hartz]] explained the absence of conservatism in Australia or the United States as a result of their settlement as radical or liberal fragments of Great Britain. Although he said English Canada had a negligible conservative influence, subsequent writers claimed that [[United Empire Loyalist|loyalists]] opposed to the American Revolution brought a Tory ideology into Canada. Hartz explained conservatism in Quebec and Latin America as a result of their settlement as feudal societies.&lt;ref&gt;Fierlbeck, Katherine. ''Political thought in Canada: an intellectual history''.

Conservative elites have long dominated Latin American nations. Mostly, this has been achieved through control of and support for civil institutions, the church and the armed forces, rather than through party politics. Typically, the church was exempt from taxes and its employees immune from civil prosecution. Where national conservative parties were weak or non-existent, conservatives were more likely to rely on military dictatorship as a preferred form of government. However, in some nations where the elites were able to mobilize popular support for conservative parties, longer periods of political stability were achieved. Chile, Colombia and Venezuela are examples of nations that developed strong conservative parties. Argentina, Brazil, El Salvador and Peru are examples of nations where this did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook, Kevin J. ''Conservative parties, the right, and democracy in Latin America''.

{{Main|Conservatism in Canada}}
Canada's conservatives had their roots in the loyalists Tories who left America after the American Revolution. They developed in the socio-economic and political cleavages that existed during the first three decades of the 19th century and had the support of the business, professional and established Church (Anglican) elites in Ontario and to a lesser extent in Quebec. Holding a monopoly over administrative and judicial offices, they were called the "[[Family Compact]]" in Ontario and the "[[Chateau Clique]]" in Quebec. [[John A. Macdonald]]'s successful leadership of the movement to confederate the provinces and his subsequent tenure as prime minister for most of the late 19th century rested on his ability to bring together the English-speaking Protestant oligarchy and the [[ultramontane]] Catholic hierarchy of Quebec and to keep them united in a conservative coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, Allan and Mishler, William. ''Influence in Parliament, Canada''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1976. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservatives combined [[Economic liberalism|pro-market liberalism]] and [[Toryism]]. They generally supported an activist government and state intervention in the marketplace and their policies were marked by ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', a paternalistic responsibility of the elites for the less well-off.&lt;ref&gt;Schultze, Rainer-Olaf; Sturm, Roland and Eberle, Dagmar.

Germany: VS Verlag, 2003. {{ISBN|978-3-8100-3812-8}} p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; From 1942, the party was known as the Progressive Conservatives until 2003, when the national party merged with the [[Canadian Alliance]] to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Panizza, Francisco.

The conservative [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] governed the province of Quebec in periods from 1936 to 1960 and in a close alliance with English Canadian business elites and the Catholic Church. This period, known as the [[Grande Noirceur|Great Darkness]], ended with the [[Quiet Revolution]] and the party went into terminal decline.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, John Frederick.

The modern [[Conservative Party of Canada]] has rebranded conservatism and under the leadership of [[Stephen Harper]], the Conservative Party add more conservative policies.

==== Colombia ====
{{Main|Conservatism in Colombia}}
The [[Colombian Conservative Party]], founded in 1849, traces its origins to opponents of General [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]'s 1833–1837 administration. While the term "liberal" had been used to describe all political forces in Colombia, the conservatives began describing themselves as "conservative liberals" and their opponents as "red liberals". From the 1860s until the present, the party has supported strong central government; supported the Catholic Church, especially its role as protector of the sanctity of the family; and opposed separation of church and state. Its policies include the legal equality of all men, the citizen's right to own property and opposition to dictatorship. It has usually been Colombia's second largest party, with the [[Colombian Liberal Party]] being the largest.&lt;ref&gt;Osterling, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Denmark ====
Founded in 1915, the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party of Denmark]]. was the successor of ''Højre'' (literally "[[Right-wing politics|Right"]]). The conservative party led the government coalition from 1982 to 1993. The party was a junior partner in coalition with the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberals]] from 2001 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Annesley, Claire. ''A political and economic dictionary of Western Europe''. London: Routledge, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-85743-214-5}}, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The party is preceded by 11 years by the [[Young Conservatives (Denmark)|Young Conservatives (KU)]], today the youth movement of the party. The party suffered a major defeat in the parliamentary elections of September 2011 in which the party lost more than half of its seat and also lost governmental power. A liberal cultural policy dominated during the postwar period. However, by the 1990s disagreements regarding immigrants from entirely different cultures ignited a conservative backlash.&lt;ref&gt;Kasper Støvring,  "The Turn from Cultural Radicalism to National Conservatism: Cultural Policy in Denmark." ''Telos'' 2009.148  (2009) pp. 54–72&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Finland ====
The conservative party in Finland is the [[National Coalition Party]] (in Finnish ''Kansallinen Kokoomus'', ''Kok''). The party was founded in 1918 when several monarchist parties united. Although in the past the party was right-wing, today it is a moderate liberal conservative party. While the party advocates [[economic liberalism]], it is committed to the [[social market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Siaroff, Alan.

==== France ====
{{see also|Gaullism|Conservatism in France}}
Conservatism in France focused on the rejection of the secularism of the French Revolution, support for the role of the Catholic Church and the restoration of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;E.L. Woodward,  ''Three Studies In European Conservatism. Mettenich: Guizot: The Catholic Church In The Nineteenth Century'' (1923) [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.461719 online]&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchist cause was on the verge of victory in the 1870s, but then collapsed because the proposed king refused to fly the tri-colored flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Price|title=A Concise History of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYjB2-RnWUwC&amp;pg=PA225|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=225|isbn=9780521844802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious tensions heightened in the 1890–1910 era, but moderated after the spirit of unity in fighting the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Larkin, ''Religion, politics and preferment in France since 1890: La Belle Epoque and its legacy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; An extreme form of conservatism characterized the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] of 1940–1944 with heightened antisemitism, opposition to individualism, emphasis on family life and national direction of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Hoffmann, "The Vichy Circle of French Conservatives" in Hoffmann, ''Decline or Renewal?

Following the Second World War, conservatives in France supported Gaullist groups and have been nationalistic and emphasized tradition, order and the regeneration of France.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vinen, "The Parti républicain de la Liberté and the Reconstruction of French Conservatism, 1944–1951," ''French History'' (1993) 7#2 pp. 183–204&lt;/ref&gt; Gaullists held divergent views on social issues. The number of conservative groups, their lack of stability and their tendency to be identified with local issues defy simple categorization. Conservatism has been the major political force in France since the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, Peter and Ryn, Claes G. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0576-8}} p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, post-war French conservatism was formed around the personality of a leader, [[Charles de Gaulle]]; and did not draw on traditional French conservatism, but on the [[Bonapartism]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan.

==== Greece ====
The main interwar conservative party was called the [[People's Party (Greece)|People's Party]] (PP), which supported [[Greek monarchy|constitutional monarchy]] and opposed the [[Second Hellenic Republic|republican]] [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]]. Both it and the Liberal party were suppressed by the authoritarian, arch-conservative and royalist [[4th of August Regime]] of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] in 1936–1941. The PP was able to re-group after the Second World War as part of a United Nationalist Front which achieved power campaigning on a simple anticommunist, ultranationalist platform during the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946–1949). However, the vote received by the PP declined during the so-called "Centrist Interlude" in 1950–1952. In 1952, Marshal [[Alexandros Papagos]] created the [[Greek Rally]] as an umbrella for the right-wing forces. The Greek Rally came to power in 1952 and remained the leading party in Greece until 1963—after Papagos' death in 1955 reformed as the [[National Radical Union]] under [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]. Right-wing governments backed by the palace and the army overthrew the [[Centre Union]] government in 1965 and governed the country until the establishment of the far-right [[Regime of the Colonels]] (1967–1974). After the [[metapolitefsi|regime's collapse]] in August 1974, Karamanlis returned from exile to lead the government and founded the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party. The new conservative party had four objectives: to confront [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish expansionism in Cyprus]], to reestablish and solidify democratic rule, to give the country a strong government and to make a powerful moderate party a force in Greek politics.&lt;ref&gt;Penniman, Howard Rae. ''Greece at the polls: the national elections of 1974 and 1977''.  Washington: American Enterprise Institute, 1981. {{ISBN|978-0-8447-3434-7}} pp. 49–59&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Greeks]], a newly formed political party in [[Greece]], has also supported conservatism, particularly [[National conservatism|national]] and [[religious conservatism]]. The Founding Declaration of the Independent Greeks strongly emphasises in the preservation of the Greek state and its [[sovereignty]], the [[Greek people]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://anexartitoiellines.gr/files/idritiki%20diakirixi.pdf Founding Declaration of Independent Greeks]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iceland ====
Founded in 1924 as the [[Conservative Party (Iceland)|Conservative Party]], Iceland's [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] adopted its current name in 1929 after the merger with the [[Liberal Party (Iceland, historical)|Liberal Party]]. From the beginning, they have been the largest vote-winning party, averaging around 40%. They combined liberalism and conservatism, supported nationalization of infrastructure and opposed class conflict. While mostly in opposition during the 1930s, they embraced [[economic liberalism]], but accepted the welfare state after the war and participated in governments supportive of state intervention and protectionism. Unlike other Scandanivian conservative (and liberal) parties, it has always had a large working-class following.&lt;ref&gt;Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors. ''The evolution of electoral and party systems in the Nordic countries''. New York: Agathon Press, 2002. "The Icelandic electoral system 1844–1999" by Olafur Th. Hardarson {{ISBN|978-0-87586-138-8}}, pp. 107–08&lt;/ref&gt; After the financial crisis in 2008, the party has sunk to a lower support level around 20–25%.

==== Italy ====
After World War II, in [[Italy]] the conservative parties were mainly represented by the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC) party, which government form the foundation of the Republic until party's dissolution in 1994. Officially, DC refused the ideology of conservatism, but in many aspects, for example [[family values]], it was a typical [[social conservative]] party.

In 1994, the media tycoon and entrepreneur [[Silvio Berlusconi]] founded the [[liberal conservative]] party [[Forza Italia]] (FI). Berlusconi won three elections in [[Italian general election, 1994|1994]], [[Italian general election, 2001|2001]] and [[Italian general election, 2008|2008]], governing the country for almost ten years as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]]. Forza Italia formed a coalition with right-wing regional party [[Lega Nord]] while in government.

Besides FI, now the conservative ideas are mainly expressed by the [[New Centre-Right]] party led by [[Angelino Alfano]], Berlusconi form a new party, which is the reborn [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] founding a new conservative movement. Alfano was the current [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. After the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 election]], [[Lega Nord]] and the [[Five Star Movement]] formed the [[right-wing populist]] government.

==== Luxembourg ====
Luxembourg's major [[Christian democratic]] conservative party, the [[Christian Social People's Party]] (CSV or PCS), was formed as the Party of the Right in 1914 and adopted its present name in 1945. It was consistently the largest political party in Luxembourg and dominated politics throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, Derek W. ''A Dictionary of European History and Politics, 1945–1995''. London: Pearson UK, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-582-25874-7}} p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Norway ====
The [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party of Norway]] (Norwegian: Høyre, literally "[[Right-wing politics|right"]]) was formed by the old upper class of state officials and wealthy merchants to fight the populist democracy of the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], but lost power in 1884 when parliamentarian government was first practised. It formed its first government under parliamentarism in 1889 and continued to alternate in power with the Liberals until the 1930s, when Labour became the dominant political party. It has elements both of paternalism, stressing the responsibilities of the state and of economic liberalism. It first returned to power in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Knut Heidar|Heidar, Knut]].

==== Sweden ====
Sweden's conservative party, the [[Moderate Party]], was formed in 1904, two years after the founding of the liberal party.&lt;ref&gt;Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors.

==== Switzerland ====
There are a number of conservative parties in Switzerland's parliament, the Federal Assembly. These include the largest, the [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP),&lt;ref name="Hans-Georg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ziebertz|first=Hans-Georg|title=How Teachers in Europe Teach Religion: An International Empirical Study: An International Empirical Study in 16 Countries|year=2011|publisher=Lit Verlag|isbn=978-3-643-10043-6|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party]] (CVP)&lt;ref name=Juravich&gt;{{cite book|last=Juravich|first=Tom|title=Ravenswood: The Steelworkers' Victory and the Revival of American Labor|year=2000|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8666-1|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland]] (BDP),&lt;ref name=Schwok&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwok|first=René|title=Switzerland – European Union: An Impossible Membership?|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-90-5201-576-7|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a splinter of the SVP created in the aftermath to the election of Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf as Federal Council.&lt;ref name="Schwok"/&gt; The right-wing parties have a majority in the Federal Assembly.

The [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP or UDC) was formed from the 1971 merger of the [[Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents|Party of Farmers, Traders and Citizens]], formed in 1917 and the smaller Swiss Democratic Party, formed in 1942. The SVP emphasized agricultural policy and was strong among farmers in German-speaking Protestant areas. As Switzerland considered closer relations with the European Union in the 1990s, the SVP adopted a more militant protectionist and isolationist stance. This stance has allowed it to expand into German-speaking Catholic mountainous areas.&lt;ref&gt;Siaroff, Alan ''Comparative European Party Systems''. New York: Garland, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8153-2930-X}} p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]], a non-Swiss lobby group based in the United States has accused them of manipulating issues such as immigration, Swiss neutrality and welfare benefits, awakening antisemitism and racism.&lt;ref&gt;The Stephen Roth Institute. ''Anti-semitism worldwide'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0-8032-5943-3}} p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Europe]] has called the SVP "extreme right", although some scholars dispute this classification. For instance, Hans-Georg Betz describes it as "populist radical right".&lt;ref&gt;Hainsworth, pp. 44, 74&lt;/ref&gt; The SVP is the largest party since 2003.

==== United Kingdom ====
{{Main|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}
According to historian James Sack, English conservatives celebrate [[Edmund Burke]] as their intellectual father.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Sack, "The Memory of Burke and the Memory of Pitt; English Conservatism Confronts its Past, 1806–1829" (1987) 623–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was affiliated with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]] which eventually became the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], but the modern [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is generally thought to derive from the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory party]] and the MPs of the modern conservative party are still frequently referred to as Tories.

=== Modern conservatism in different countries ===
While conservatism has been seen as an appeal to traditional, hierarchical society, some writers such as [[Samuel P. Huntington]] see it as situational. Under this definition, conservatives are seen as defending the established institutions of their time.&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop and Lovell, pp. 163–66&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia ====
{{Main|Conservatism in Australia}}
The [[Liberal Party of Australia]] adheres to the principles of [[social conservatism]] and [[liberal conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Raphael|title=Tackling Health Inequalities: Lessons from International Experiences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zjh4lQAbPrYC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2012|publisher=Canadian Scholars’ Press|isbn=978-1-55130-412-0|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is liberal in the sense of economics. Other conservative parties are the [[National Party of Australia]], a sister party of the Liberals, [[Family First Party]], [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]], [[Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party]], [[Australian Conservatives]] and the [[Katter's Australian Party]].

The second largest party in the country is the [[Australian Labor Party]] and its dominant faction is [[Labor Right]], a [[socially conservative]] element. Australia undertook significant economic reform under the Labor Party in the mid-1980s. Consequently, issues like protectionism, welfare reform, privatization and deregulation are no longer debated in the political space as they are in Europe or North America. Moser and Catley explain: "In America, 'liberal' means left-of-center, and it is a pejorative term when used by conservatives in adversarial political debate. In Australia, of course, the conservatives are in the Liberal Party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Mosler|author2=Robert Catley|title=America and Americans in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YungugjvIaQC&amp;pg=PA83|year=1998|page=83|isbn=9780275962524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupp points out that, "[the] decline in English influences on Australian reformism and radicalism, and appropriation of the symbols of Empire by conservatives continued under the Liberal Party leadership of Sir [[Robert Menzies]], which lasted until 1966".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Jupp|title=The English in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n63TaXC5TpEC&amp;pg=PA172|year=2004|page=172|isbn=9780521542951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== India ====
In India, [[Narendra Modi]] and his [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) represent conservative politics. The BJP is the largest right-wing conservative party. It promotes [[Hindu nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abhilasha Kumari|author2=Sabina Kidwai|title=Crossing the Sacred Line: Women's Search for Political Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=urvvwXU_ZQkC&amp;pg=PA83|year=1998|publisher=Orient Blackswan|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russia ====
Under [[Vladimir Putin]], the dominant leader since 1999, Russia has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and economic liberalism. Putin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by Aleksandr Prokhanov, stresses Russian nationalism, the restoration of Russia's historical greatness and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.&lt;ref&gt;Marlene Laruelle, "The Izborsky Club, or the New Conservative Avant‐Garde in Russia." ''Russian Review'' 75.4 (2016): 626–44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladislav Surkov]], a senior government official, has been one of the key ideologists during Putin's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Sirke Mäkinen,  "Surkovian narrative on the future of Russia: making Russia a world leader." ''Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics'' 27#2 (2011): 143–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultural and social affairs, Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Mark Woods provides specific examples of how the Church under [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]] has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Woods, "How the Russian Orthodox Church is backing Vladimir Putin's new world order" [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/how.the.russian.orthodox.church.is.backing.vladimir.putins.new.world.order/81108.htm  ''Christian Today'' March 3, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, ''The New York Times'' reports in September 2016 how that Church's policy prescriptions support the Kremlin's appeal to social conservatives:
: A fervent foe of homosexuality and any attempt to put individual rights above those of family, community or nation, the Russian Orthodox Church helps project Russia as the natural ally of all those who pine for a more secure, illiberal world free from the tradition-crushing rush of globalization, multiculturalism and women’s and gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Higgins, "In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower," [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/europe/russia-orthodox-church.html ''New York Times'' Sept 13, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== South Korea ====
{{Main|Conservatism in South Korea}}
[[South Korea]]'s major conservative party, the [[Liberty Korea Party]], has changed its form throughout its history. First it was the Democratic-Republican Party (1963–1980) and its head was [[Park Chung-hee]], who seized power in a 1961 military coup d'état and ruled as an unelected military strongman until his formal election as President in [[South Korean presidential election, 1963|1963]]. He was President for 16 years until his assassination on 26 October 1979. The [[Democratic Justice Party]] inherited the same ideology as the Democratic-Republican Party. Its head, [[Chun Doo-hwan]], also gained power through a coup and his followers called themselves the Hanahae. The Democratic Justice Party changed its form and acted to suppress the opposition party and to follow the people's demand for direct elections. The party's [[Roh Tae-woo]] became the first President who was elected through direct election. The next form of the major conservative party was the Democratic-Liberal Party and again through election its second leader, [[Kim Young-sam]], became the fourteenth President of Korea. When the conservative party was beaten by the opposition party in the general election, it changed its form again to follow the party members' demand for reforms. It became the New Korean Party, but it changed again one year later since the President Kim Young-sam was blamed by the citizen for the [[International Monetary Fund]].{{clarify|date=March 2014}} It changed its name to Grand National Party (GNP). Since the late [[Kim Dae-jung]] assumed the presidency in 1998, GNP had been the opposition party until [[Lee Myung-bak]] won the presidential election of [[South Korean presidential election, 2007|2007]].

The meaning of "conservatism" in the United States has little in common with the way the word is used elsewhere. As Ribuffo (2011) notes, "what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism".&lt;ref&gt;Leo P. Ribuffo, "20 Suggestions for Studying the Right now that Studying the Right is Trendy," ''Historically Speaking'' Jan 2011 v.12#1 pp. 2–6, quote on p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. However, during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] many [[Southern Democrats]] were conservatives and they played a key role in the [[Conservative coalition]] that largely controlled domestic policy in Congress from 1937 to 1963,&lt;ref&gt;Kari Frederickson, ''The Dixicrat Revolt and the End of the Solid South, 1932–1968'', p. 12, "...conservative southern Democrats viewed warily the potential of New Deal programs to threaten the region's economic dependence on cheap labor while stirring the democratic ambitions of the disfranchised and undermining white supremacy.", The University of North Carolina Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8078-4910-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Conservative Democrat]]s continued to have influence in the U.S. politics until 1994's [[Republican Revolution]], when the American South shifted from solid Democrat to solid Republican, while maintaining its conservative values.

Major priorities within American conservatism include support for the [[traditional family]], [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]], the [[right to bear arms]]. [[Christian values]], [[anti-communism]] and a defense of "[[Western civilization]] from the challenges of modernist culture and totalitarian governments".&lt;ref name="GregorySchneider"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Century: From Reaction to Revolution|last=Schneider|first=Gregory|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=|page=xii|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conservatives and libertarians favor [[small government]], low taxes, limited regulation and free enterprise. Some social conservatives see traditional social values threatened by secularism, so they support [[school prayer]] and [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|oppose abortion]] and [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name=Social&gt;{{cite book|title=Texas Politics: Governing the Lone Star State|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fQFZCrbc9mIC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;q=social%20conservatism%20abortion%20marriage|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|accessdate=19 January 2012|author=Cal Jillson|date=22 February 2011|quote=Social conservatives focus on moral or values issues, such as abortion, marriage, school prayer, and judicial appointments.|isbn=9780203829417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neoconservatives]] want to expand American ideals throughout the world and show a strong support for Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Frohnen, ed.

The conservative movement of the 1950s attempted to bring together these divergent strands, stressing the need for unity to prevent the spread of "Godless communism", which Reagan later labeled an "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Edward Gottfried, ''Conservatism in America: Making Sense of the American Right'', p. 9, "Postwar conservatives set about creating their own synthesis of free-market capitalism, Christian morality, and the global struggle against Communism." (2009); Gottfried, ''Theologies and moral concern'' (1995) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Reagan administration]], conservatives also supported the so-called "[[Reagan Doctrine]]" under which the U.S. as part of a Cold War strategy provided military and other support to guerrilla insurgencies that were fighting governments identified as socialist or communist. The Reagan administration also adopted [[Neoliberalism]] and [[trickle-down economics]], as well as [[Reaganomics]], which made for economic growth in the 1980s, fueled by trillion dollar deficits.

Other modern conservative positions include opposition to [[big government]] and [[opposition to environmentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Jacques; Riley E. Dunlap; Mark Freeman, ''The organisation of denial: Conservative think tanks and environmental scepticism'', Environmental Politics. v12 m3 (2008), pp. 349–85&lt;/ref&gt; On average, American conservatives desire tougher foreign policies than liberals do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=23736 Peter Hays Gries, ''The Politics of American Foreign Policy: How Ideology Divides Liberals and Conservatives over Foreign Affairs'' (Stanford, 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic liberalism]], [[deregulation]] and [[social conservatism]] are main principles of the Republican Party.

Most recently, the [[Tea Party movement]], founded in 2009, has proven a large outlet for populist American conservative ideas. Their stated goals include rigorous adherence to the U.S. Constitution, lower taxes and opposition to a growing role for the federal government in health care. Electorally, it was considered a key force in Republicans reclaiming control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson, ''The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism'' (2012) pp. 45–82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-12030-503544.html|title=Katie Couric Interviews Tea Party Leaders|date=25 January 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology ==
{{See also|Biology and political orientation}}
Following the Second World War, psychologists conducted research into the different motives and tendencies that account for ideological differences between left and right. The early studies focused on conservatives, beginning with [[Theodor W. Adorno]]'s ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) based on the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]] personality test. This book has been heavily criticized on theoretical and methodological grounds, but some of its findings have been confirmed by further empirical research.&lt;ref name="Jost, J.J 2003"&gt;Jost, J.J, Glaser, J., Kruglanski, A.A., &amp; Sulloway, F.J. (2003). Political conservatism as motivated social cognition. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 129:(3), pp. 339–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, British psychologist [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]] published an influential book providing evidence that a general factor underlying conservative beliefs is "fear of uncertainty".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G.D. (Ed.)(1973) The Psychology of Conservatism, London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of research literature by Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski and Sulloway in 2003 found that many factors, such as [[Ambiguity tolerance|intolerance of ambiguity]] and need for [[Cognitive closure (psychology)|cognitive closure]], contribute to the degree of one's political conservatism.&lt;ref name="Jost, J.J 2003"/&gt; A study by Kathleen Maclay stated these traits "might be associated with such generally valued characteristics as personal commitment and unwavering loyalty". The research also suggested that while most people are resistant to change, liberals are more tolerant of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml|title=Researchers help define what makes a political conservative|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychologist [[Bob Altemeyer]], individuals who are politically conservative tend to rank high in [[right-wing authoritarianism]] (RWA) on his RWA scale.&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer, B. (1981). Right-wing authoritarianism. Winnipeg, Canada: University of Manitoba Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding was echoed by [[Theodor Adorno]]. A study done on Israeli and Palestinian students in Israel found that RWA scores of right-wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left-wing party supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubinstein|first1=G.|doi=10.1177/0022022196272005|title=Two Peoples in One Land: A Validation Study of Altemeyer's Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale in the Palestinian and Jewish Societies in Israel|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=1996|volume=27|pages=216–230|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2005 study by H. Michael Crowson and colleagues suggested a moderate gap between RWA and other conservative positions: "The results indicated that conservatism is not synonymous with RWA".&lt;ref&gt;Crowson, H. Michael, Stephen J. Thoma, and Nita Hestevold. "Is political conservatism synonymous with authoritarianism?." ''The Journal of Social Psychology'' 145.5 (Oct 2005): 571(22). Expanded Academic ASAP. Gale. Remote Access. 20 May 2009 [http://find.galegroup.com/itx/start.do?prodId=EAIM Galegroup.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Felicia Pratto and her colleagues have found evidence to support the idea that a high [[social dominance orientation]] (SDO) is strongly correlated with conservative political views and opposition to social engineering to promote equality,&lt;ref name="pratto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pratto|first1=Felicia|last2=Sidanius|first2=Jim|last3=Stallworth|first3=Lisa M.|last4=Malle|first4=Bertram F.|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.741|title=Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1994|volume=67|pages=741–763|issue=4|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3207711}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Pratto's findings have been highly controversial{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} as Pratto and her colleagues found that high SDO scores were highly correlated with measures of [[prejudice]]. However, [[David J. Schneider]] argued for a more complex relationships between the three factors, writing "correlations between prejudice and political conservative are reduced virtually to zero when controls for SDO are instituted, suggesting that the conservatism–prejudice link is caused by SDO".&lt;ref&gt;The psychology of stereotyping, David J. Schneider,  Guilford Press, 2005 {{ISBN|978-1-59385-193-4}}  p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Minogue]] criticized Pratto's work, saying: "It is characteristic of the conservative temperament to value established identities, to praise habit and to respect prejudice, not because it is irrational, but because such things anchor the darting impulses of human beings in solidities of custom which we do not often begin to value until we are already losing them. Radicalism often generates youth movements, while conservatism is a condition found among the mature, who have discovered what it is in life they most value".&lt;ref&gt;The Social science encyclopedia, Jessica Kuper, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1985 {{ISBN|978-0-7102-0008-2}} pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 study on the relationship between racism and conservatism found that the correlation was stronger among more educated individuals, though "anti-Black affect had essentially no relationship with political conservatism at any level of educational or intellectual sophistication". They also found that the correlation between racism and conservatism could be entirely accounted for by their mutual relationship with social dominance orientation.&lt;ref name="sidanius96"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.476|last1=Sidanius|first1=J|last2=Pratto|first2=F|last3=Bobo|first3=L|year=1996|title=Racism, conservatism, affirmative action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=70|issue=3|pages=476–490|url=http://www.scholar.harvard.edu/files/bobo/files/1996_racism_conservatism_affirmative_action_and_journal_of_personality_and_social_psychology.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 research report found that conservatives are happier than liberals and that—as income inequality increases—this difference in relative happiness increases because conservatives (more than liberals) possess an ideological buffer against the negative hedonic effects of [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Napier|first1=J.

==Concept==
Briefly, when sheared genomic DNA in solution is heated to near [[Boiling point|boiling temperature]], the [[Molecule|molecular]] forces holding complementary [[base pair]]s together are disrupted, and the two strands of each [[Double helix|double-helix]] [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] or ‘denature.’  If the [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] DNA is then slowly returned to a cooler [[temperature]], sequences will begin to ‘reassociate’ (renature) with complementary strands.  

The temperature at which renaturation occurs can be regulated so that little or no sequence mismatch is tolerated.  The rate at which a sequence finds a complementary strand with which to [[nucleic acid hybridization|hybridize]] is directly related to how common that sequence is in the genome.  In other words, those sequences that are extremely abundant (on average) find complementary strands with which to pair relatively quickly while single-copy sequences take much longer to find complements.  

In CF, genomic DNA is heat-denatured and allowed to renature to a [[Cot value]] (Cot = DNA [[concentration]] x time x a factor based on the [[Ion|cation]] concentration of the buffer) at which the majority of repetitive elements have reassociated but single and low-copy elements remain single stranded.  [[DNA|Double-stranded]], repetitive DNA is separated from single-stranded, low-copy DNA by [[Hydroxylapatite|hydroxyapatite]] [[chromatography]] or other means.

==Application==
CF allows the single/low copy sequences and the repetitive sequences of a genome to be studied independently of each other.  It can also be used to fractionate highly repetitive DNA from moderately repetitive sequences or to further fractionate isolated kinetic components.  CF is most accurately performed if [[fractionation]] is based upon the results of a Cot analysis.

Lanes "GA" and "TC" are Maxam-Gilbert chemical sequencing lanes, see [[DNA sequencing#Maxam-Gilbert sequencing|DNA Sequencing]]. The lane labelled "control" is for quality control purposes and contains the DNA fragment but not treated with [[DNase]]I. ]]

A '''DNase footprinting assay'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0076-6879(86)30011-9 |vauthors=Brenowitz M, Senear DF, Shea MA, Ackers GK |title=Quantitative DNase footprint titration: a method for studying protein-DNA interactions |journal=Methods in Enzymology |volume=130 |issue= |pages=132–81 |year=1986 |pmid=3773731 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[DNA footprinting]] technique from [[molecular biology]]/[[biochemistry]] that detects [[DNA]]-[[protein]] interaction using the fact that a protein bound to DNA will often protect that DNA from enzymatic cleavage. This makes it possible to locate a protein binding site on a particular DNA molecule. The method uses an enzyme, [[deoxyribonuclease]] (DNase, for short), to cut the radioactively end-labeled DNA, followed by [[gel electrophoresis]] to detect the resulting cleavage pattern.

For example, the DNA fragment of interest may be [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] amplified using a &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P 5' labeled primer, with the result being many DNA molecules with a radioactive label on one end of one strand of each double stranded molecule. Cleavage by DNase will produce fragments. The fragments which are smaller with respect to the &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P-labelled end will appear further on the gel than the longer fragments. The gel is then used to expose a special photographic film.

The cleavage pattern of the DNA in the absence of a DNA binding protein, typically referred to as free DNA, is compared to the cleavage pattern of DNA in the presence of a DNA binding protein. If the protein binds DNA, the binding site is protected from enzymatic cleavage. This protection will result in a clear area on the gel which is referred to as the "footprint".

By varying the concentration of the DNA-binding protein, the binding affinity of the protein can be estimated according to the minimum concentration of protein at which a footprint is observed.

This technique was developed by David Galas and Albert Schmitz at Geneva in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Galas DJ, Schmitz A |title=DNAse footprinting: a simple method for the detection of protein-DNA binding specificity |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=3157–70 |date=Sep 1978 |pmid=212715 |pmc=342238 |doi= 10.1093/nar/5.9.3157|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=212715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16996">'''Ecosystem valuation''' is an economic process which assigns a value (either monetary, biophysical, or other) to an [[ecosystem]] and/or its [[ecosystem services]]. By quantifying, for example, the human [[welfare]] benefits of a forest to reduce flooding and [[erosion]] while [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering carbon]], providing habitat for endangered species, and absorbing harmful [[chemicals]], such monetization ideally provides a tool for policy-makers and conservationists to evaluate management impacts and compare a [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analysis]] of potential policies. However, such valuations are estimates, and involve the inherent quantitative uncertainty and philosophical debate of evaluating a range non-market costs and benefits.

==History and Economic Model==

=== History ===
Cost-benefit analyses and the generation of market [[Value (economics)|value]] have existed within the economic literature for centuries. However, in 1997, Robert Costanza, Distinguished University Professor of sustainability at [[Portland State University]], Oregon, was the first to estimate the worldwide worth of ecosystem services—bringing new attention to the field of ecosystem valuation. He and his colleagues calculated that such services were worth $33 trillion annually ($44 trillion present dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Constanza|first=Robert|date=15 May 1997|title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/387253a0|journal=Nature|volume=387|pages=253–260|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Costanza's fanfare, [[the World Bank]], three decades later, that "the benefits provided by natural ecosystems are both widely recognized and poorly understood.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/376691468780627185/pdf/308930PAPER0Ecosytem0worth01public1.pdf|title=How Much is an Ecosystem Worth? Assessing the Economic Value of Conservation|last=|first=|date=October 2004|website=The World Bank|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing the importance of such knowledge to informed policy-making, in 2007, Environmental Ministers from the [[G8+5|G8 + 5]] nations agreed to both publicly call for and begin to undertake the calculation of global ecosystem benefits, conservation costs, and the opportunity costs of developing such ecosystems. The resulting watershed initiative and ongoing project is [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] (TEEB).

In the United States, the President's Council on Science and Technology suggested in 2011 that the “U.S. government should institute and fund a Quadrennial Ecosystems Services Trends (QuEST) Assessment” that studying trends in ecosystem performance, quality, and value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast_sustaining_environmental_capital_report.pdf|title=Report to the President. Sustaining Environmental Capital: Protecting Society and the Economy|last=|first=|date=July 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic Models: Values, Costs, and Value Methodology ===
Ecosystem valuation attempts to capture the range of benefits and costs contained within a complicated natural web with a range of economic methodologies.

Ecological systems provide four general categories of services: '''provisioning''' (e.g. fish to eat, timber to sell), '''regulatory''', '''supporting''', and '''cultural''' (e.g. ecosystems supporting indigenous gathering techniques, or supplies for traditional clothing).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holzman|first=David C.|date=April 2012|title=Accounting for Nature's Benefits: The Dollar Value of Ecosystem Services|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=120|issue=4|pages=a152–a157|doi=10.1289/ehp.120-a152|pmc=3339477|pmid=22469778}}&lt;/ref&gt; See Figure 1. for a mangrove-specific example of this complex subject.
[[File:EnvironmentalServicesPie.jpg|thumb|Figure 1. Example of ecosystem services range for mangrove habitat]]

These four types of services can then provide two basic categories of value: the use and [[Use value|use]] and [[Non-use value|non-use]] categories. Environmental economists have further separated categorizes for which individuals are willing to pay:
* '''''Direct-use value.'''''
** The simplest form of ecosystem valuation for orthodox environmental economists, this translates the direct [[ecological yield]] as it would be on [[commodity market]]s: e.g. the value of water, timber, fish, or other commodities if immediately developed and sold at market price.Thus, an exchange value or 'price' is associated with the objects of value, regarded as [[natural capital]], associated with ecosystems and this may be based on the ability of a system to produce yields each year that are exchangeable in operating markets and have existing exchange prices.
* '''''Indirect use value''''' attributed to indirect utilization of ecosystem services, through the positive [[externalities]] that ecosystems provide.
** The World Bank explains that these values are "derived from ecosystem services that provide benefits outside the ecosystem itself. Examples include natural water filtration which often benefits people far downstream, the storm protection function of mangrove forests which benefits costal properties and infrastructure, and carbon sequestration which benefits the entire global community by abating climate change."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Option value (cost–benefit analysis)|''Option value'']] attributed to preserving the option to utilize ecosystem services in the future.
* ''[[Existence value]]'' attributed to the pure existence of an ecosystem.
* ''[[Altruism|Altruistic]] value'' based on the welfare the ecosystem may give other people.
* ''[[Bequest value]]'' based on the welfare the ecosystem may give future generations.
Given these types of potential ecological values, economists utilize a variety of methods to calculate those market values and measure [[Non-market economics|non-market]] values. Standard environmental economic methods are used to place a monetary value on ecosystem services where there are no market prices. These include "stated preference" methods and "revealed preference" methods. Stated preference methods, such as the [[contingent valuation]] method ask people for their [[willingness to pay]] for a certain ecosystem (service). Revealed preference methods, such as [[hedonic]] pricing and the [[travel cost method]], use a relation with a market good or service to estimate the willingness-to-pay for the service. Applying such preference based approaches has been criticized as a means of deriving the value of ecosystems and biodiversity and for avoiding deliberation, justification and judgment in making choices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spash_Ecosystem_Value_EV_2008.pdf Spash, C.L. 2008. How much is that ecosystem in the window? The one with the bio-diverse trail. Environmental Values, vol. 17, no. 2, 259-284]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuation Results==
While the literature is still emerging, many important studies have resulting in striking valuations.

One academic paper by de Groot et. al., which synthesized more than 300 scholarly works collectively evaluating the 10 main [[biome]]s, "shows that the total value of ecosystem services is considerable and ranges between 490 int$/year for the total bundle of ecosystem services that can potentially be provided by an ‘average’ hectare of open oceans to almost 350,000 int$/year for the potential services of an ‘average’ hectare of [[coral reef]]s."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-07-01|title=Global estimates of the value of ecosystems and their services in monetary units|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041612000101|journal=Ecosystem Services|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=50–61|doi=10.1016/j.ecoser.2012.07.005|issn=2212-0416|last1=De Groot|first1=Rudolf|last2=Brander|first2=Luke|last3=Van Der Ploeg|first3=Sander|last4=Costanza|first4=Robert|last5=Bernard|first5=Florence|last6=Braat|first6=Leon|last7=Christie|first7=Mike|last8=Crossman|first8=Neville|last9=Ghermandi|first9=Andrea|last10=Hein|first10=Lars|last11=Hussain|first11=Salman|last12=Kumar|first12=Pushpam|last13=McVittie|first13=Alistair|last14=Portela|first14=Rosimeiry|last15=Rodriguez|first15=Luis C|last16=Ten Brink|first16=Patrick|last17=Van Beukering|first17=Pieter}}&lt;/ref&gt; This potential benefit can take many forms depending on the degree of exploitation and such exploitation's sustainability, but can result, for example, in large [[Ecotourism|ecotourist]] revenues for local communities, protection from storm destruction, or profit for an international lumber company.

Furthermore, de Groot et. al. find that most of their paper's calculated value is "outside the market and best considered as non-tradable public benefits. The continued over-exploitation of ecosystems thus comes at the expense of the livelihood of the poor and future generations."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] (TEEB), in one of its first large, cumulative reports, also found that ecosystem services start at roughly $100/hectare/year for open ocean, and top off to more than $1,000,000/hectare/year for the most lucrative coral reefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teebweb.org/publication/the-economics-of-ecosystems-and-biodiversity-teeb-for-water-and-wetlands/|title=The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) For Water and Wetlands|last=|first=|date=February 2013|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond biome "price tags," these environmental valuations can explore quite complex policy questions. For example, the [[Copenhagen Consensus Center|Copenhagen Consensus]] [[think tank]] calculated that stemming the loss of coral reefs by 50 percent by 2030 would return more than $24 for every dollar spent. The Consensus' founder, [[Bjørn Lomborg|Bjorn Lomborg]], explains that ''"coral reefs, which both act as fishery hatcheries and fishing resources while storing abundant numbers of species. At the same time, coral reefs possess an amazing beauty, which both shows up in large tourism revenues but also in most individuals saying they are willing to pay a certain amount to make sure they continue to exist for our grand children. … [Programs to preserve 50% more coral reef by 2030] cost about $3 billion per year but the total benefits likely run to at least $72, or about $24 dollars back for every dollar invested."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bjorn-lomborg/biodiversity-whats-worth-_b_6081462.html|title=Biodiversity: What's Worth Saving?|last=Lomborg|first=Bjørn|date=2014-10-31|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As another example, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)]] manages the Integrated Valuation Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) Natural Capital Project. This open-source tool—although geared towards policy-makers, advocates, and scientists—allows anyone to interact with a map quantifying "trade offs between alternative management choices" and identifying "areas where investment in natural capital can enhance human development and conservation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/invest.html|title=Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST)|website=coast.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Payment for Environmental Services (PES) ===
After (and, sometimes, before) evaluating the ecosystem costs and benefits, some programs have attempted to internalize those values with specific programs providing [[Payment for ecosystem services|payments for environmental services]]. Costa Rica paid about $42/hectare for landowners to preserve forests;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sánchez-Azofeifa|first=G. Arturo|last2=Pfaff|first2=Alexander|last3=Robalino|first3=Juan Andres|last4=Boomhower|first4=Judson P.|date=October 2007|title=Costa Rica's payment for environmental services program: intention, implementation, and impact|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=21|issue=5|pages=1165–1173|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00751.x|issn=1523-1739|pmid=17883482|hdl=10161/6955}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010 Norway began paying Indonesia a total of $1 billion to mitigate deforestation;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redd-monitor.org/2017/12/28/after-seven-years-norways-us1-billion-redd-deal-in-indonesia-is-still-not-stopping-deforestation/|title=After seven years, Norway's US$1 billion REDD deal in Indonesia is still not stopping deforestation {{!}} REDD-Monitor|website=www.redd-monitor.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; China responded to 1998 floods with payments targeting deforestation and soil erosion;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and many other programs large and small.

== Controversies with and Limits to Ecosystem Valuations ==
From an academic perspective, although scholarly research is quite rapidly adding to this field of understanding, many knowledge gaps still remain. For example, there is an inherent uncertainty in attempting to quantify non-market goods. As pointed to by de Groot et. al., many environmental goods (such as clean air and biodiversity) are simply not traded in established markets. In addition, many environmental goods may be [[Non-rival good|non-rival]], [[Excludability|non-excludable]], and even inseparable goods with multiple value options further complicating any valuation.

From an ethical and philosophical perspective, too, ecosystem valuation is far from uncontroversial. Arguments about the non-market valuation of ecosystem can be found by referring to [[environmental ethics]] and [[deep ecology]].

Since animals do not put explicit prices on ecosystems they use, but do behave as if they are valuable, e.g. by selecting one territory vs. another, defending their territories, etc., it is mostly a matter of definition whether ecology should include valuation as an issue.  It may be [[anthropocentric]] to do so, since "valuation" more clearly refers to a human perception rather than being an "objective" attribute of the system perceived.  Ecology itself is also human perception, and such related concepts as a [[food chain]] are constructed by humans to help them understand ecosystems.  In many cases by those who hold that markets and pricing exist independently of any individual human observers and "users", and especially those who deem markets to be "out of control", '''ecosystem valuation''' is considered a (marginal, ignored) part of economics.  Others argue that [[natural capital]] is an economic concept that is at least as viable as financial capital, which itself is determined on subjective valuation.  Some even suggest that valuation of ecosystem services is more cogent than financial valuation, as the ecosystem would continue after the collapse of the economy, while the inverse is not valid.

In addition, many fascinating questions about where ecosystem benefits go, and who should pay for those benefits, is an ongoing political debate. In one Washington city, residents now pay a water bill in order for the town to buy and restore land adjacent to the municipal water source; and international examples of evaluating and paying for services is no less a fascinating field of ongoing development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hcn.org/blogs/goat/the-dollar-sign-in-nature|title=How much money is a healthy ecosystem worth?|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fantasy world''' is a human conceived world created in fictional media, such as literature, film or games.  Typical fantasy worlds involve magic or magical abilities, nonexistent technology&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature'', pp. 166–7, {{ISBN|0-253-35665-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes, either a [[historical]] or [[futuristic]] theme. Some worlds may be a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] connected to [[Earth]] via magical portals or items (like [[Narnia]]); a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future (like [[Middle-earth]]); or an entirely independent world set in another part of the universe (like the [[Star Wars]] Galaxy).&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Imaginary lands", pp. 495–5 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, sociology, mythology, and folklore.

==Plot function==
The setting of a fantasy work is often of great importance to the plot and characters of the story. The setting itself can be imperiled by the evil of the story, suffer a calamity, and be restored by the transformation the story brings about.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Land", p. 558 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories that use the setting as merely a backdrop for the story have been criticized for their failure to use it fully.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Fantasyland", p. 341 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the land itself is not in danger, it is often used symbolically, for thematic purposes, and to underscore moods.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy pp. 72–3 {{ISBN|1-932265-07-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early fantasy worlds appeared as fantasy ''lands'', part of the same planet but separated by geographical barriers.  For example, [[Land of Oz|Oz]], though a fantasy world in every way, is described as part of this world.&lt;ref name="John Clute p 739"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Oz", p. 739 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although medieval peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that, for example, an [[ogre]] could live a day's travel away, distant continents were necessary from the [[Renaissance]] onwards for such fantastic speculation to be plausible, until finally, further exploration rendered all such terrestrial fantasy lands implausible.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], "On Science Fiction", ''Of Other Worlds'', p. 68 {{ISBN|0-15-667897-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within the span of mere decades, Oz, which had been situated in a desert in the United States when first written about in 1900,&lt;ref name="John Clute p 739"/&gt; was relocated to a spot in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 99, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the fantasy land/world concept can be seen in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where places of which little was known, but where the occurrence of marvels was thus more credible, had to be set "long ago" or "far away". This is a process that continues, and finally culminates in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places.&lt;ref name="arabianNights2"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Arabian fantasy", p 52 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent example of a fantasy land with definite connections to the actual world is Austin Tappan Wright's [[Islandia (novel)|Islandia]]. Islandia's remoteness and aura of mystery, as well as its preservation of an [[Arcadia (utopia)|arcadian]] society, are explained by means of a law which allows only limited contact with foreigners.

[[Dream world (plot device)|Dream frames]] were also once common for encasing the fantasy world with an explanation of its marvels. Such a dream frame was added to the story of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' for the movie version; in the book, Oz is clearly defined as an actual place.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 96, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.P. Lovecraft]] made active use of the dream frame, creating elaborate geographies accessible to humans only when they were asleep and dreaming. These dream-settings have been criticized,&lt;ref&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories", p. 14, ''The Tolkien Reader'', Ballantine Books, New York 1966&lt;/ref&gt; and are far less frequent today.

This change is part of a general trend toward more self-consistent and substantive fantasy worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p 210 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has also altered the nature of the plots; earlier works often feature a solitary individual whose adventures in the fantasy world are of personal significance, and where the world clearly exists to give scope to these adventures, and later works more often feature characters in a social web, where their actions are to save the world and those in it from peril.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p. 211–2 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common elements==
The most common fantasy world is one based on medieval Europe, and has been since [[William Morris]] used it in his early fantasy works, such as ''[[The Well at the World's End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Waggoner, ''The Hills of Faraway: A Guide to Fantasy'', p 37, {{ISBN|0-689-10846-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly since the 1954 publication of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Such a world is often called "pseudo-medieval"—particularly when the writer has snatched up random elements from the era, which covered a thousand years and a continent, and thrown them together without consideration for their compatibility, or even introduced ideas not so much based on the medieval era as on [[Medievalism|romanticized views]] of it. When these worlds are copied not so much from history as from other fantasy works, there is a heavy tendency to uniformity and lack of realism.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant, "[http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/gulliver.htm Gulliver Unravels: Generic Fantasy and the Loss of Subversion]"&lt;/ref&gt; The full width and breadth of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon. Governments, for instance, tend to be uncompromisingly feudal-based, or evil empires or [[oligarchies]], usually corrupt, while there was far more variety of rule in the actual Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Alec Austin, [http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020624/epic_fantasy.shtml "Quality in Epic Fantasy"]&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasy worlds also tend to be medieval in economy, and disproportionately [[pastoral]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Yolen]], "Introduction" p viii ''After the King: Stories in Honor of J.R.R. Tolkien'', ed, Martin H. Greenberg, {{ISBN|0-312-85175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful world-building plus meticulous attention to detail is often cited as the reason why certain fantasy works are deeply convincing and contain a magical sense of place.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p. 113, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heavy and faithful use of real world setting for inspiration, as in [[Barry Hughart]]'s ''[[Bridge of Birds]]'', clearly derived from China, or [[Lloyd Alexander]]'s use of real world cultures such as Welsh for ''[[The Chronicles of Prydain]]'' or Indian for ''[[The Iron Ring]]'', make the line between fantasy worlds and [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate histories]] fuzzy. The use of cultural elements, and still more history and geography, from actual settings pushes a work toward alternative history.

Conversely, the creation by an author of an imaginary country—such as [[Ruritania]] or [[Graustark]]—does not automatically transform that imaginary country into a fantasy world, even if the location would be impossible in reality owing to a lack of land to contain it; but such [[Ruritanian romance]]s may be pushed toward the category of fantasy worlds by the introduction of, say, witches and wise women, where it is not clear if their magic is effectual.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p. 6 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lin Carter in ''[[Imaginary Worlds – the Art of Fantasy|Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy]]'', fantasy worlds, by their nature, contain some element of [[magic (paranormal)]]. This element may be the creatures in it ([[dragon]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[genie]]s and so on) or the magical abilities of the people inhabiting the world. These are often drawn from [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], frequently that of the historical country also used for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Lin, ''Imaginary Worlds, the Art of Fantasy''. Ballantine, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructed worlds==
{{further|Constructed world}}
[[File:Tolkien The two trees.jpg|right|thumb|The Creation of the Two Trees figured in Tolkien's fantasy world, [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]]]]
Fantasy worlds created through a process called [[world building]] are known as a [[constructed world]]. Constructed worlds elaborate and make self-consistent the setting of a fantasy work. World building often relies on materials and concepts taken from the real world.

Despite the use of magic or other fantastic elements such as dragons, the world is normally presented as one that would function normally, one in which people could actually live, making economic, historical, and ecological sense. It is considered a flaw to have, for example, pirates living in lands far from trade routes, or to assign prices for a night's stay in an inn that would equate to several years’ income.

Furthermore, the fantastic elements should ideally operate according to self-consistent rules of their own; for example, if wizards' spells sap their strength, a wizard who does not appear to suffer this must either be putting up a facade, or have an alternative explanation. This distinguishes fantasy worlds from surrealism and even from such dream worlds as are found in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.

===Examples===
*[[L. Frank Baum]] created the [[Land of Oz]] for his novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and its original sequels. He was one of the few authors before Tolkien to use consistent internal geographies and histories to enrich his world.
*[[C. S. Lewis]], author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', set that series' novels mostly in a magical land called [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]]. Lewis was a colleague of Tolkien, and their fictional worlds share several key elements.
*[[Terry Pratchett]] created [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]], a large disc resting on the backs of four huge elephants, which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle, as it slowly swims through space.
*[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] created [[Middle-earth]], possibly the most famous fantasy world. He introduced several revolutionary concepts to fantasy fiction and popularized the idea of intricately detailed fantasy worlds. He wrote at some length about the process, which he called "sub-creation". Middle-earth is intended to be Earth's [[Old World]] in a fictional ancient era.
*[[George R. R. Martin]] created a [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire|fictional world]] for his novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were deliberately not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were unilluminated about distant places. Most of the story is set in the western continent of Westeros, though some is set in the Eastern continent Essos. The Southern continent of Sothoryos is also shown on maps, with a possible fourth continent, Ulthos, to its East. A map of the world is shown in the [[Game of Thrones title sequence|title sequence]] of the [[HBO]] TV adaptation, ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

==Fairytale and comic fantasy==
[[Fairytale fantasy]] may ignore the normal world-building in order to present a world operating by the same logic as the fairytales from which they are derived, though other works in this subgenre develop their worlds fully.  [[Comic fantasy]] may ignore all possible logic in search of humor, particularly if it is parodying other fantasies' faulty world-building, as in [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s ''[[Dark Lord of Derkholm]]'', or the illogic of the setting is integral to the comedy, as in [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[Solomon's Stone]]'', where the fantasy world is populated by the heroic and glamorous figures that people daydream about being, resulting in a severe shortage of workers in the more mundane, day-to-day industries. Most other [[Fantasy subgenres|subgenres of fantasy]] suffer if the world-building is neglected.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== The retreat of magic ==
Rather than creating their own fantasy world, many authors choose to set their novels in Earth's past. In order to explain the absence of miraculous elements, authors may introduce "a retreat of magic" (sometimes called "thinning") that explains why the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and other fantastic elements no longer appear:&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Thinning", p. 942 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the destruction of the [[One Ring]] defeated Sauron, but also destroyed the power of the [[Three Rings]] of the [[elves]], resulting in them sailing to the West at the end of the story. A [[contemporary fantasy]] necessarily takes place in what purports to be the real world, and not a fantasy world. It may, however, include references to such a retreat. [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' explains that wizards eventually decided to conceal all magic creatures and artifacts from non-magic users.

==Role-playing games==
''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', the first major [[role-playing game]], has created several detailed and commercially successful fantasy worlds (called "[[campaign setting]]s"), with established characters, locations, histories, and sociologies. The [[Forgotten Realms]] is perhaps the most extensively developed of these worlds. These elements of detail can be a large part of what attracts people to RPGs.

Many established fantasy writers have also derided ''Dungeons and Dragons'' and the fantasy fiction it has inspired due to its influencing new writers toward reading the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons [[Monster Manual]]'' instead of studying the original literature and mythology from which modern fantasy literature has sprung.

Due to the fuzzy boundary between fantasy and [[science fiction]], it is similarly difficult to make a hard-and-fast distinction between "fantasy worlds" and [[planets in science fiction]]. For example, the worlds of [[Barsoom]], [[Darkover]], [[Gor]], and the [[Witch World]] combine elements of both genres.

[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disk]]]]
&lt;!-- Note: per [[WP:BOLDTITLE]], topic name should ''not'' be bold because the title of this article is descriptive --&gt;
The formation and evolution of the [[Solar System]] began 4.6 [[bya|billion years ago]] with the [[gravitational collapse]] of a small part of a giant [[molecular cloud]].&lt;ref name="Bouvier" /&gt; Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the [[Sun]], while the rest flattened into a [[protoplanetary disk]] out of which the [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|moons]], [[asteroid]]s, and other [[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]] formed.

This model, known as the [[nebular hypothesis]] was first developed in the 18th century by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[geology]], and [[planetary science]]. Since the dawn of the [[space age]] in the 1950s and the discovery of [[extrasolar planets]] in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.

The Solar System has [[wikt: evolution|evolved]] considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's [[Moon]], may be the result of [[giant impact hypothesis|giant collisions]]. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions.&lt;ref name="Gomes" /&gt; This [[planetary migration]] is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.

In roughly 5&amp;nbsp;billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a [[red giant]]), before casting off its outer layers as a [[planetary nebula]] and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a [[white dwarf]]. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into [[interstellar space]]. Ultimately, over the course of [[Timeline of the far future|tens of billions]] of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.&lt;ref name=dyson /&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of Solar System formation and evolution hypotheses}}
[[File:Pierre-Simon Laplace.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], one of the originators of the nebular hypothesis]]
Ideas concerning the origin and fate of the world date from the earliest known writings; however, for almost all of that time, there was no attempt to link such theories to the existence of a "Solar System", simply because it was not generally thought that the Solar System, in the sense we now understand it, existed. The first step toward a theory of Solar System formation and evolution was the general acceptance of [[heliocentrism]], which placed the Sun at the centre of the system and the [[Earth]] in orbit around it. This concept had developed for millennia ([[Aristarchus of Samos]] had suggested it as early as 250 BC), but was not widely accepted until the end of the 17th century. The first recorded use of the term "Solar System" dates from 1704.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary | title=Solar system | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solar%20system | accessdate=2008-04-15 |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current standard [[theory]] for Solar System formation, the [[nebular hypothesis]], has fallen into and out of favour since its formulation by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of [[angular momentum]] when compared to the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Michael Mark Woolfson | author-link=Michael Woolfson | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | volume=313 | title=Rotation in the Solar System | issue=1524 |year=1984 | pages=5–18 | bibcode=1984RSPTA.313....5W | doi=10.1098/rsta.1984.0078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.newscientist.com/channel/solar-system/comets-asteroids/mg13117837.100 | title=Birth of the planets: The Earth and its fellow planets may be survivors from a time when planets ricocheted around the Sun like ball bearings on a pinball table | work=New Scientist | author=Nigel Henbest |year=1991 | accessdate=2008-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding of how the Sun is expected to continue to evolve required an understanding of the source of its power. [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]]'s confirmation of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from [[nuclear fusion]] reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Sun: A Biography | author=David Whitehouse | date=2005 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=978-0-470-09297-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars.&lt;ref name=Hoyle2005&gt;{{cite book | title=Fred Hoyle: A Life in Science | author=Simon Mitton | publisher=Aurum|date=2005|chapter=Origin of the Chemical Elements|pages=197–222 | isbn=978-1-85410-961-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Hoyle]] [[B2FH paper|elaborated]] on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called [[red giant]]s [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|created many elements]] heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.&lt;ref name=Hoyle2005/&gt;

==Formation==
{{See also|Nebular hypothesis}}

===Pre-solar nebula===
The nebular hypothesis says that the Solar System formed from the gravitational collapse of a fragment of a giant [[molecular cloud]].&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006/&gt; The cloud was about 20&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]] (65 light years) across,&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006/&gt; while the fragments were roughly 1&amp;nbsp;parsec (three and a quarter [[light-year]]s) across.&lt;ref name= "Arizona"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lecture 13: The Nebular Theory of the origin of the Solar System|url = http://atropos.as.arizona.edu/aiz/teaching/nats102/mario/solar_system.html| author=Ann Zabludoff | accessdate=2006-12-27 | date=Spring 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The further collapse of the fragments led to the formation of dense cores 0.01–0.1&amp;nbsp;[[parsec|pc]] (2,000–20,000&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]]) in size.&lt;ref group=note&gt;An astronomical unit, or AU, is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, or about 150 million kilometres.

The [[Calcium–aluminium-rich inclusion|oldest inclusions found in meteorites]], thought to trace the first solid material to form in the pre-solar nebula, are 4568.2 million years old, which is one definition of the age of the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Bouvier"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Audrey Bouvier |author2=Meenakshi Wadhwa | title=The age of the solar system redefined by the oldest Pb-Pb age of a meteoritic inclusion | journal=Nature Geoscience |year=2010 | doi=10.1038/NGEO941 | volume=3 | pages=637–641|bibcode = 2010NatGe...3..637B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as [[iron-60]], that only form in exploding, short-lived stars.

The various planets are thought to have formed from the solar nebula, the disc-shaped cloud of gas and dust left over from the Sun's formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chondrule-forming Shock Fronts in the Solar Nebula: A Possible Unified Scenario for Planet and Chondrite Formation|author1=A.

Through direct contact, these grains formed into clumps up to 200 metres in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies ([[planetesimals]]) of ~10&amp;nbsp;kilometres (km) in size.&lt;ref name=Goldreich1973/&gt; These gradually increased through further collisions, growing at the rate of centimetres per year over the course of the next few million years.&lt;ref name=Goldreich1973&gt;{{cite journal |author1=P.

The [[inner Solar System]], the region of the Solar System inside 4&amp;nbsp;AU, was too warm for volatile molecules like water and methane to condense, so the planetesimals that formed there could only form from compounds with high melting points, such as metals (like [[iron]], [[nickel]], and [[aluminium]]) and rocky [[silicate]]s. These rocky bodies would become the [[terrestrial planet]]s ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]]). These compounds are quite rare in the Universe, comprising only 0.6% of the mass of the nebula, so the terrestrial planets could not grow very large.&lt;ref name=Arizona /&gt; The terrestrial embryos grew to about 0.05 [[Earth mass]]es ({{Earth mass}}) and ceased accumulating matter about 100,000&amp;nbsp;years after the formation of the Sun; subsequent collisions and mergers between these planet-sized bodies allowed terrestrial planets to grow to their present sizes (see [[#Terrestrial planets|Terrestrial planets]] below).&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt;

When the terrestrial planets were forming, they remained immersed in a disk of gas and dust. The gas was partially supported by pressure and so did not orbit the Sun as rapidly as the planets. The resulting [[drag (physics)|drag]] and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of [[angular momentum]], and as a result the planets gradually migrated to new orbits. Models show that density and temperature variations in the disk governed this rate of migration,&lt;ref name=dangelo_lubow_2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Angelo|first=G.|author2=Lubow, S.

The [[giant planet]]s ([[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]) formed further out, beyond the [[frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]], which is the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets, allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundant]] elements.&lt;ref name="Arizona" /&gt; Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to {{Earth mass|4|link=y}} within about 3&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt; Today, the four giant planets comprise just under 99% of all the mass orbiting the Sun.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The combined mass of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune is 445.6 Earth masses. The mass of remaining material is ~5.26 Earth masses or 1.1% (see [[Solar System#Notes]] and [[List of Solar System objects by mass]])&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists believe it is no accident that Jupiter lies just beyond the frost line. Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material, it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun. In effect, the frost line acted as a barrier that caused material to accumulate rapidly at ~5&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun. This excess material coalesced into a large embryo (or core) on the order of {{Earth mass|10}}, which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever-increasing rate.&lt;ref name=ayliffe_bate_2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayliffe|first=B.|author2= Bate, M.

T Tauri stars like the young Sun have far stronger [[stellar wind]]s than more stable, older stars. Uranus and Neptune are thought to have formed after Jupiter and Saturn did, when the strong [[solar wind]] had blown away much of the disc material. As a result, those planets accumulated little hydrogen and helium—not more than {{Earth mass|1}} each. Uranus and Neptune are sometimes referred to as failed cores.&lt;ref name="thommes" /&gt; The main problem with formation theories for these planets is the timescale of their formation. At the current locations it would have taken millions of years for their cores to accrete.&lt;ref name="ddl2011" /&gt;  This means that Uranus and Neptune  may have formed closer to the Sun—near or even between Jupiter and Saturn—and later migrated or were ejected outward (see [[#Planetary migration|Planetary migration]] below).&lt;ref name="thommes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; Motion in the planetesimal era was not all inward toward the Sun; the ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' sample return from [[Comet Wild 2]] has suggested that materials from the early formation of the Solar System migrated from the warmer inner Solar System to the region of the Kuiper belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2006|author=Emily Lakdawalla|work=The Planetary Society|title=Stardust Results in a Nutshell: The Solar Nebula was Like a Blender | url = http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000735/| accessdate=2007-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After between three and ten&amp;nbsp;million years,&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt; the young Sun's solar wind would have cleared away all the gas and dust in the protoplanetary disc, blowing it into interstellar space, thus ending the growth of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=B.

==Subsequent evolution==
The planets were originally thought to have formed in or near their current orbits. From that a minimum mass of the nebula i.e. the protoplanetary disc, was derived that was necessary to form the planets - the minimum mass solar nebula. It was derived that the nebula mass must have exceeded 3585 times that of the Earth.

However, this has been questioned during the last 20 years. Currently, many planetary scientists think that the Solar System might have looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner Solar System, the outer Solar System was much more compact than it is now, and the [[Kuiper belt]] was much closer to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]] |url = http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/planetlila/moon/index.html |title=Dysnomia, the moon of Eris |work=Personal web site|accessdate=2008-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrestrial planets===
At the end of the planetary formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon- to Mars-sized [[planetary embryo]]s.&lt;ref name="Petit2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kominami"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Tidal Interaction with a Gas Disk on Formation of Terrestrial Planets|author1=Junko Kominami |author2=Shigeru Ida |place=Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo|year=2001 | doi=10.1006/icar.2001.6811|journal=Icarus|
volume=157|issue=1|pages=43–56|bibcode=2002Icar..157...43K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100&amp;nbsp;million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt; One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see [[#Moons|Moons]] below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].&lt;ref name=Solomon2003&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sean C. Solomon|title=Mercury: the enigmatic innermost planet|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=216|issue=4|year=2003|pages=441–455|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(03)00546-6| bibcode=2003E&amp;PSL.216..441S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One unresolved issue with this model is that it cannot explain how the initial orbits of the proto-terrestrial planets, which would have needed to be highly eccentric to collide, produced the remarkably stable and nearly circular orbits they have today.&lt;ref name="Petit2001" /&gt; One hypothesis for this "eccentricity dumping" is that the terrestrials formed in a disc of gas still not expelled by the Sun. The "[[gravitational drag]]" of this residual gas would have eventually lowered the planets' energy, smoothing out their orbits.&lt;ref name= Kominami /&gt; However, such gas, if it existed, would have prevented the terrestrial planets' orbits from becoming so eccentric in the first place.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt; Another hypothesis is that gravitational drag occurred not between the planets and residual gas but between the planets and the remaining small bodies. As the large bodies moved through the crowd of smaller objects, the smaller objects, attracted by the larger planets' gravity, formed a region of higher density, a "gravitational wake", in the larger objects' path. As they did so, the increased gravity of the wake slowed the larger objects down into more regular orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Final Stages of Planet Formation|author1=Peter Goldreich |author2=Yoram Lithwick |author3=Re'em Sari |journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=614|issue=1|pages=497–507|date=10 October 2004|doi=10.1086/423612|bibcode=2004ApJ...614..497G|arxiv = astro-ph/0404240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asteroid belt===
The outer edge of the terrestrial region, between 2 and 4&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun, is called the [[asteroid belt]]. The asteroid belt initially contained more than enough matter to form 2–3 Earth-like planets, and, indeed, a large number of [[planetesimal]]s formed there.

===Planetary migration===

According to the nebular hypothesis, the outer two planets may be in the "wrong place".

Its inner edge would have been just beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15–20&amp;nbsp;AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.&lt;ref name="Tsiganis05"&gt;

According to the [[Nice model]], after the formation of the Solar System, the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals. After 500–600&amp;nbsp;million years (about 4&amp;nbsp;billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn fell into a 2:1 resonance: Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; This resonance created a gravitational push against the outer planets, possibly causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the ancient Kuiper belt.&lt;ref name="Tsiganis05" /&gt;
The planets scattered the majority of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The reason that Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all moved outward whereas Jupiter moved inward is that Jupiter is massive enough to eject planetesimals from the Solar System, while the other three outer planets are not. To eject an object from the Solar System, Jupiter transfers energy to it, and so loses some of its own orbital energy and moves inwards. When Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb planetesimals outwards, those planetesimals end up in highly eccentric but still bound orbits, and so can return to the perturbing planet and possibly return its lost energy. On the other hand, when Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb objects inwards, those planets gain energy by doing so and therefore move outwards. More importantly, an object being perturbed inwards stands a greater chance of encountering Jupiter and being [[Interstellar comet|ejected]] from the Solar System, in which case the energy gains of Neptune, Uranus and Saturn obtained from their inwards deflections of the ejected object become permanent.&lt;/ref&gt; Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud;&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt; This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and scattered disc's present low mass. Some of the scattered objects, including [[Pluto]], became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into [[mean-motion resonance]]s.&lt;ref name=Malhorta1995&gt;{{cite journal | author=R. Malhotra | title=The Origin of Pluto's Orbit: Implications for the Solar System Beyond Neptune | journal=Astronomical Journal | arxiv=astro-ph/9504036 |year=1995 | volume=110 | pages=420 | doi=10.1086/117532 | bibcode=1995AJ....110..420M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again.&lt;ref name="Levison2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fogg_nelson"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M.

In contrast to the outer planets, the inner planets are not thought to have migrated significantly over the age of the Solar System, because their orbits have remained stable following the period of giant impacts.&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt;

Another question is why Mars came out so small compared with Earth. A study by Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, published June 6, 2011 (called the [[Grand tack hypothesis]]), proposes that Jupiter had migrated inward to 1.5&amp;nbsp;AU. After Saturn formed, migrated inward, and established the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, the study assumes that both planets migrated back to their present positions. Jupiter thus would have consumed much of the material that would have created a bigger Mars. The same simulations also reproduce the characteristics of the modern asteroid belt, with dry asteroids and water-rich objects similar to comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.astronomy.com/News-Observing/News/2011/06/Jupiter%20may%20have%20robbed%20Mars%20of%20mass%20new%20report%20indicates.aspx | title= Jupiter may have robbed Mars of mass, new report indicates | work= Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas | date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Walsh, K.

Impacts are thought to be a regular (if currently infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9]] with [[Jupiter]] in 1994, the [[2009 Jupiter impact event]], the [[Tunguska event]], the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] and the impact feature [[Meteor Crater]] in [[Arizona]].

Over the course of the Solar System's evolution, [[comet]]s were ejected out of the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent thousands of AU outward to form the [[Oort cloud]], a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by [[galactic tide]]s, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into the inner Solar System.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli2006"&gt;{{cite arXiv

[[File:Artist's concept of collision at HD 172555.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of the [[Giant impact hypothesis|giant impact]] thought to have formed the [[Moon]]]]
Moons have come to exist around most planets and many other Solar System bodies. These [[natural satellite]]s originated by one of three possible mechanisms:
* Co-formation from a circumplanetary disc (only in the cases of the giant planets);
* Formation from impact debris (given a large enough impact at a shallow angle); and
* Capture of a passing object.

Jupiter and Saturn have several large moons, such as [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], which may have originated from discs around each giant planet in much the same way that the planets formed from the disc around the Sun.&lt;ref name="arxiv0812"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Canup, Robin M. |author2=Ward, William R. |title=Origin of Europa and the Galilean Satellites |publisher=University of Arizona Press |date=2008-12-30 |arxiv=0812.4995|bibcode = 2009euro.book...59C |page=59|isbn=978-0-8165-2844-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dangelo_podolak_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Angelo|first=G.|author2= Podolak, M.|title=Capture and Evolution of Planetesimals in Circumjovian Disks|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2015|volume=806|issue=1|pages=29pp|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/806/2/203|arxiv = 1504.04364 |bibcode = 2015ApJ...806..203D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=N.

==Future==
Astronomers estimate that the Solar System as we know it today will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning [[stellar evolution|its evolution]] from the [[main sequence]] of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] and into its [[red giant|red-giant]] phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.

===Long-term stability===
The Solar System is [[chaos theory|chaotic]] over million- and billion-year timescales,&lt;ref name=laskar94&gt;{{cite journal

|pages=L9–L12
|year=1994
|bibcode=1994A&amp;A...287L...9L }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the orbits of the planets open to long-term variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune–Pluto system, which lies in a 3:2 [[orbital resonance]]. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto with any degree of accuracy more than 10–20&amp;nbsp;million years (the [[Lyapunov time]]) into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Numerical evidence that the motion of Pluto is chaotic |author1=Gerald Jay Sussman |author2=Jack Wisdom | journal = Science | volume = 241 | pages = 433–437 |year = 1988 | url = http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/wisdom/pluto-chaos.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.241.4864.433 | pmid = 17792606 | issue = 4864 | bibcode=1988Sci...241..433S
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is Earth's [[axial tilt]], which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon ([[#Moon–ring systems|see below]]), is incomputable from some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the long term evolution of the spin of the Earth|author=O.

The outer planets' orbits are chaotic over longer timescales, with a Lyapunov time in the range of 2–230&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=hayes07&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wayne B. Hayes | title=Is the outer Solar System chaotic? | journal=Nature Physics | arxiv=astro-ph/0702179 |year=2007 | volume=3 | issue=10 | pages=689–691 | doi=10.1038/nphys728 | bibcode=2007NatPh...3..689H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In all cases this means that the position of a planet along its orbit ultimately becomes impossible to predict with any certainty (so, for example, the timing of winter and summer become uncertain), but in some cases the orbits themselves may change dramatically. Such chaos manifests most strongly as changes in [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], with some planets' orbits becoming significantly more—or less—[[ellipse|elliptical]].&lt;ref name="Stewart1997"&gt;{{cite book

Ultimately, the Solar System is stable in that none of the planets are likely to collide with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years.&lt;ref name=hayes07/&gt; Beyond this, within five&amp;nbsp;billion years or so Mars's eccentricity may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision. In the same timescale, Mercury's eccentricity may grow even further, and a close encounter with Venus could theoretically eject it from the Solar System altogether&lt;ref name=laskar94/&gt; or send it on a collision course with [[Venus]] or [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The solar system could go haywire before the sun dies|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13757-solar-system-could-go-haywire-before-the-sun-dies.html | author=David Shiga | work=NewScientist.com News Service | date=23 April 2008 | accessdate=2008-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could happen within a billion years, according to numerical simulations in which Mercury's orbit is perturbed.&lt;ref name="Batygin"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Batygin | first1 = K. | last2 = Laughlin | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1086/589232 | title = On the Dynamical Stability of the Solar System | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 683 | issue = 2 | pages = 1207–1216 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0804.1946 |bibcode = 2008ApJ...683.1207B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moon–ring systems===
The evolution of moon systems is driven by [[tide|tidal forces]]. A moon will raise a [[tidal bulge]] in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving in the same direction as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, [[angular momentum]] is transferred from the rotation of the primary to the revolution of the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.

The Earth and its Moon are one example of this configuration. Today, the Moon is [[tidally locked]] to the Earth; one of its revolutions around the Earth (currently about 29 days) is equal to one of its rotations about its axis, so it always shows one face to the Earth. The Moon will continue to recede from Earth, and Earth's spin will continue to slow gradually. Other examples are the [[Galilean moons]] of [[Jupiter]] (as well as many of Jupiter's smaller moons)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1982MNRAS.201..415G | title=Tidal Heating of Io and orbital evolution of the Jovian satellites | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | author=A. Gailitis | volume=201 | pages=415 |year=1980 | doi = 10.1093/mnras/201.2.415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of the larger moons of [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Bevilacqua |author2=O. Menchi |author3=A. Milani |display-authors= etal |date=April 1980 |title= Resonances and close approaches. I.

[[File:Voyager 2 Neptune and Triton.jpg|thumb|Neptune and its moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], taken by ''[[Voyager 2]]''. Triton's orbit will eventually take it within Neptune's [[Roche limit]], tearing it apart and possibly forming a new ring system.]]
A different scenario occurs when the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so the rotation of the primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out).&lt;ref group=note&gt;In all of these cases of transfer of angular momentum and energy, the angular momentum of the two-body system is conserved. In contrast, the summed energy of the moon's revolution plus the primary's rotation is not conserved, but decreases over time, due to dissipation via frictional heat generated by the movement of the tidal bulge through the body of the primary. If the primary were a frictionless ideal fluid, the tidal bulge would be centered under the satellite, and no transfer would take place. It is the loss of dynamical energy through friction that makes transfer of angular momentum possible.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, [[Tidal acceleration#Tidal deceleration|tidal deceleration]] causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a [[planetary ring]] system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] of Mars (within 30&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;50&amp;nbsp;million years),&lt;ref name=Bills2006&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bruce G.

A third possibility is where the primary and moon are [[tidally locked]] to each other. In that case, the tidal bulge stays directly under the moon, there is no transfer of angular momentum, and the orbital period will not change. Pluto and Charon are an example of this type of configuration.&lt;ref&gt;

Prior to the 2004 arrival of the ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' spacecraft, the [[rings of Saturn]] were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not expected to survive beyond another 300&amp;nbsp;million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saturn Rings Still A Mystery |work=Popular Mechanics |author=Stefano Coledan |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/1285531.html |year=2002 |accessdate=2007-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015710/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/1285531.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, data from the ''Cassini'' mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10&amp;nbsp;km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the rings of the other giant planets. This large mass is thought to have preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them for billions of years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Saturn's recycled rings | journal=Astronomy Now| pages=9 |date=February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long term, the greatest changes in the Solar System will come from changes in the Sun itself as it ages.

Gradually, the hydrogen burning in the shell around the solar core will increase the mass of the core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into [[carbon]] will begin, leading to a [[helium flash]]; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11&amp;nbsp;times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770&amp;nbsp;K. The Sun will become a [[Horizontal branch|horizontal giant]], burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100&amp;nbsp;million years. Eventually, it will have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its outer layers and will expand a second time, turning into what is known as an [[asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic giant]].

The ejected material will contain the helium and carbon produced by the Sun's nuclear reactions, continuing the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements for future generations of stars.&lt;ref name=nebula&gt;{{cite web | author=Bruce Balick | title=Planetary nebulae and the future of the Solar System | work=Personal web site | url = http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/WFPC2/| accessdate=2006-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any observer present to witness this occurrence would see a massive increase in the speed of the solar wind, but not enough to destroy a planet completely.

Initially, this white dwarf may be 100&amp;nbsp;times as luminous as the Sun is now. It will consist entirely of [[degenerate matter|degenerate]] [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]], but will never reach temperatures hot enough to fuse these elements. Thus the white dwarf Sun will gradually cool, growing dimmer and dimmer.&lt;ref name="future-sun"&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard W.

As the Sun dies, its gravitational pull on the orbiting bodies such as planets, comets and asteroids will weaken due to its mass loss. All remaining planets' orbits will expand; if Venus, Earth, and Mars still exist, their orbits will lie roughly at {{convert|1.4|AU|km| lk=on | abbr=on}}, {{convert|1.9|AU|km| lk=on | abbr=on}}, and {{convert|2.8|AU|km| lk=on | abbr=on}}. They and the other remaining planets will become dark, frigid hulks, completely devoid of any form of life.&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt; They will continue to orbit their star, their speed slowed due to their increased distance from the Sun and the Sun's reduced gravity.

==Galactic interaction==
[[File:Milky Way Spiral Arm.svg|left|thumb|Location of the Solar System within the Milky Way]]
The Solar System travels alone through the [[Milky Way]] in a circular orbit approximately 30,000&amp;nbsp;light years from the [[Galactic Centre]]. Its speed is about 220&amp;nbsp;km/s. The period required for the Solar System to complete one revolution around the Galactic Centre, the [[galactic year]], is in the range of 220–250 million years. Since its formation, the Solar System has completed at least 20 such revolutions.&lt;ref name="biblio"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/StacyLeong.shtml|work=The Physics Factbook (self-published)| author=Stacy Leong| editor=Glenn Elert |year=2002|title=Period of the Sun's Orbit around the Galaxy (Cosmic Year) | accessdate=2008-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scientists have speculated that the Solar System's path through the galaxy is a factor in the periodicity of [[mass extinction]]s observed in the Earth's [[fossil record]]. One hypothesis supposes that vertical oscillations made by the Sun as it orbits the Galactic Centre cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic disc, the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker; as it re-enters the galactic disc, as it does every 20–25&amp;nbsp;million years, it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the Solar System by a factor of 4, leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| url = http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/perturbing-the-oort-cloud
| accessdate = 2008-03-25
| publisher = The Scientific Research Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, others argue that the Sun is currently close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's [[spiral arms]]. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright [[blue giant]]s, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as [[supernovae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mass Extinctions and The Sun's Encounters with Spiral Arms|author1=Erik M. Leitch |author2=Gautam Vasisht |year=1998|pages=51–56|issue=1|journal=New Astronomy|volume= 3|arxiv=astro-ph/9802174|doi=10.1016/S1384-1076(97)00044-4|bibcode = 1998NewA....3...51L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galactic collision and planetary disruption===
{{Main article|Andromeda–Milky Way collision}}
Although the vast majority of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name=cain /&gt; In 4&amp;nbsp;billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both to deform as [[tidal force]]s distort their outer arms into vast [[tidal tails]]. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar System will be pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become [[gravity|gravitationally]] bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy.&lt;ref name=cain /&gt; After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%,&lt;ref name=cox /&gt; the galaxies' [[supermassive black hole]]s will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6&amp;nbsp;billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant [[elliptical galaxy]]. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a [[Starburst galaxy|starburst]].&lt;ref name=cain /&gt; In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an [[active galactic nucleus]]. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.&lt;ref name=cain&gt;{{cite web|title=When Our Galaxy Smashes Into Andromeda, What Happens to the Sun?|author=Fraser Cain|work=Universe Today|url = http://www.universetoday.com/2007/05/10/when-our-galaxy-smashes-into-andromeda-what-happens-to-the-sun/|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cox&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Collision Between The Milky Way And Andromeda |author1=J. T. Cox |author2=Abraham Loeb | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |arxiv=0705.1170 |year=2007 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13048.x|volume=386|issue=1|pages=461–474 | bibcode=2008MNRAS.386..461C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common misconception that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although it is true that the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/milky-way-collide.html |author=NASA|title=NASA's Hubble Shows Milky Way is Destined for Head-On Collision |work=NASA |date=2012-05-31 |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, over time, the [[Cumulative distribution function|cumulative probability]] of a chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the [[Big Crunch]] or [[Big Rip]] scenarios for the end of the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1&amp;nbsp;quadrillion (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist.&lt;ref name=dyson&gt;{{cite journal|title=Time Without End: Physics and Biology in an open universe|author=Freeman Dyson|place=Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton New Jersey|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=51 | pages=447–460|date=July 1979 | url = http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447 |accessdate=2008-04-02 | doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447|issue=3 | bibcode=1979RvMP...51..447D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
{{wide image|Solar Life Cycle.svg|600px|alt=Projected timeline of the Sun's life. From Formation To 14Gy}}
The time frame of the Solar System's formation has been determined using [[radiometric dating]]. Scientists estimate that the Solar System is 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion years old. The [[oldest rock|oldest known mineral grains]] on [[Earth]] are approximately 4.4&amp;nbsp;billion years old.&lt;ref name=Wilde&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nature | volume=409 | pages=175–8 | title= Evidence from detrital zircons for the existence of continental crust and oceans on the Earth 4.4 Gyr ago |author1=Simon A. Wilde |author2=John W. Valley |author3=William H. Peck |author4=Colin M. Graham | doi=10.1038/35051550 | url = http://www.geology.wisc.edu/%7Evalley/zircons/Wilde2001Nature.pdf | format=PDF |year= 2001 | pmid=11196637 | issue=6817 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks this old are rare, as Earth's surface is constantly being reshaped by [[erosion]], [[volcanism]], and [[plate tectonics]]. To estimate the age of the Solar System, scientists use [[meteorite]]s, which were formed during the early condensation of the solar nebula. Almost all meteorites (see the [[Canyon Diablo meteorite]]) are found to have an age of 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion years, suggesting that the Solar System must be at least this old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | date=2000 |author=Gary Ernst Wallace|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter=Earth's Place in the Solar System|title=Earth Systems: Processes and Issues|pages=45–58|isbn=0-521-47895-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of discs around other stars have also done much to establish a time frame for Solar System formation. Stars between one and three million years old have discs rich in gas, whereas discs around stars more than 10&amp;nbsp;million years old have little to no gas, suggesting that giant planets within them have ceased forming.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5319">The '''Graduate Institute of Development Studies''' ('''GIDS''', [[French language|French]]: ''Institut universitaire d’études du développement'', '''IUED''') was a [[graduate school]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] focusing on [[development studies]]. Created in 1961 as the '''Institut Africain de Genève''' ('''African Institute of Geneva'''), GIDS's stated goal was to promote teaching and research concerning [[international development]] and to encourage students from the [[North-South divide|Global South]]. &lt;ref name=graduateinstitute&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies|url=http://graduateinstitute.ch/home.html|publisher=graduateinstitute.ch|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=europaeum&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva|url=http://www.europaeum.org/europaeum/?q=node/43|publisher=europaeum.org|accessdate=1 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305194204/http://www.europaeum.org/europaeum/?q=node%2F43|archivedate=5 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=elliott-gwu&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies|url=http://elliott.gwu.edu/graduate-study-abroad/geneva|publisher=elliott.gwu.edu|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=mastersportal&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva|url=http://www.mastersportal.eu/universities/661/graduate-institute-of-international-and-development-studies-geneva.html|publisher=mastersportal.eu|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The GIDS trained several generations of development activists in Switzerland and in the world (including at PhD level after 1995) and was at the center of a huge international network. Very active in concrete development projects, the GIDS was also known in the francophone world for proposing an alternative and a critical view of development aid and world affairs [7], as well as for its journal, the Cahiers de l'IUED. It was also among the pioneer institutions in Europe for the intellectual development of the sustainable development perspective. Among its directors were Roy Preiswerk, Pierre Bungener, Jacques Forster (actual head of IHEID Foundation Board), Jean-Luc Maurer and Michel Carton. GIDS was attached to, but independent of, the [[University of Geneva]].

GIDS and the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] (HEI) are now integrated in a new institution, since the beginning of 2008, the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] (IHEID). The new Institute combines the fields of development and [[international relations]] and offers a much wider choice of teaching and research activities. The [[Academic degree|degree]] programmes of each previous institution ([[Master's degree|master's]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in development studies, master's in international affairs, master's and Ph.D. in international studies) continue to be offered by the new combined institution.

'''Group piano''' is the study of how to play the piano in a group setting. This contrasts with the more common individual/private lesson. Group piano originated at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and continues to be a widely-used method of piano instruction. Group lesson formats include [[Master class|master classes]], university classes, and pre-college music lessons. These classes typically have between 3 and 16 students. Benefits of the group lesson format include the development of independent learning, ensemble playing, critical listening skills, and exposure to a wide range of repertoire. Group piano instruction may require more space and equipment, increased preparation per class, and more attention to scheduling and group interaction than when teaching individual/private lessons.  

== History ==
Group piano instruction can be traced to [[Johann Bernhard Logier]] (1777-1846). Logier, an Irish business man, developed a system of teaching that increased income for teachers while lowering the cost of lessons for students. His classes accommodated up to thirty students of differing skill levels. The focus of the class was developing music theory and keyboard theory rather than developing advanced technique. Due to the affordability of Logier's class format, it quickly gained traction in Great Britain, India, Ireland, and the United States. 

Master classes were often taught by well-known pianist/composers. [[Clara Schumann]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Carl Tausig]], [[Anton Rubinstein]], [[Theodor Kullak|Theodore Kullak]], and [[Hans von Bülow]] were some of the most famous teachers to teach in this format.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/38665/Chiu_washington_0250E_16696.pdf?sequence=1|title=A Comparative Evaluation of Group and Private Piano Instruction on the Musical Achievements of Young Beginners|last=Chiu|first=Pai-Yu|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These classes occurred in the homes of teachers as well as in newly-formed [[Music school#Conservatory|conservatories]].

The Industrial Revolution and ensuing rise of the middle class in the 19th century provided increased opportunities for leisure activities and created a high demand for pianos. By the end of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the United States was a world leader in the production of pianos, and families all over the country owned a piano and sought music instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/amcm/hd_amcm.htm|title=Nineteenth-Century Classical Music|last=Dobney|first=Jayson Kerr|date=2004|website=www.metmuseum.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1889 the U.S. Office of Education promoted class piano programs in elementary schools as a viable way for students to get an affordable music education. The first group piano classes in public schools launched in 1913 and grew until the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, method books for teaching piano in the classroom began to be published. These included ''Young Student’s Piano Course'' by Earhart and Boyd (1918), ''Public School Class Method for Piano'' (1919) by Giddings and Gilman, and ''Steps for the Young Pianist'' (1919) by Hazel Kinsecella. By the end of the 1920s, over eight hundred elementary schools in the United States offered class piano programs, creating a demand for teacher training courses and certificate programs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching Piano in Groups|last=Fisher|first=Christopher|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-533703-7|location=New York, New York|pages=3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s, interest in elementary class piano programs began to decline due in part to the great depression and the second world war.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As group piano declined in public elementary schools, group lessons in the college setting began to gain momentum. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, [https://mtr.arcade-museum.com/MTR-1952-111-6/index.php?page_no=12 Raymond Burrows], a professor at Columbia University Teachers College, pioneered collegiate group piano instruction using piano labs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dynamic Group Piano Teaching|last=Pike|first=Pamela|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=978-1-138-24142-8|location=New York, New York|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1952, Burrows calculated that 256 universities in the United States provided group piano classes. These courses were designed to provide music majors with functional keyboard skills that would aid them in their musical careers; these classes focused on harmonization, transposition, and sight-reading. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because most university piano teachers were more familiar with the individual/private lesson format, universities began to offer [[iarchive:elementarypianoi00burr|courses]] in teaching group piano.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Group piano lessons in the college setting continued to expand with the invention of the electronic keyboard laboratory, first achieved by [[Ball State University]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haddon|first=Elizabeth|date=2017|title=Piano Performance: Group Classes for the Life Long Learner|url=|journal=Research Studies in Music Education|volume=39|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Independent pre-college piano studios continued to implement the group piano format. During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Robert Pace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iptfonline.org/Piano%20Lessons.pdf|title=Piano Lessons - Private or Group?|last=Pace|first=Robert|date=1978|website=International Piano Teaching Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, James Bastien, and [[Frances Clark]] began to write books encouraging partner lessons, group lessons, and various combinations of group and private instruction. By the end of the 1970s, group piano was established as profitable format for instruction. The [[Music Teachers National Association]] (MTNA) and the National Piano Foundation (NPF) began to provide training on teaching in groups, and journals such as ''American Music Teacher, Piano Quarterly'', ''Keyboard Companion'', and ''Clavier'' began publishing articles related to teaching in groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Student populations ==

=== Pre-college ===
Pre-college group piano classes are designed for students ranging in age from 4-18. Groups are usually created based on student experience and skill level. Pre-college group piano lessons may take place in a private studio with multiple keyboards or a piano lab in a school. Lessons may include a mixture of playing piano and activities away from the piano. There are group piano method books available and most methods can be adapted to fit group lessons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== College ===
Most North American university music departments provide group piano classes. The [[National Association of Schools of Music|National Association of Schools of Music (NASM)]], the principal U.S. accreditation organization of approximately 643 institutions educational programs in music and music-related disciplines, includes “keyboard competency” in their handbook as a necessary requirement for music students to graduate. Group piano classes are the most widely-used format for teaching keyboard competency to college students due to its efficiency and the advantages of group learning. Advocates for collegiate group piano have stated that it is the “most effective and efficient tool” for enabling students to be independent learners so they can continue to make music for a lifetime.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amoriello|first=Laura|date=September 2016|title=Student Perspectives on Secondary Piano|url=|journal=MTNA E-Journal|volume=|pages=13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While NASM does not define "keyboard competency", there is a general consensus among universities that competency should include functional piano skills such as the playing of repertoire, harmonization, transposition, sight-reading, open score reading, and improvisation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Margaret|date=February 2016|title=A National Survey of University-Level Group Piano Programs|url=|journal=MTNA E-Journal|volume=|pages=13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Margaret|date=2013|title=University-Level Group Piano Instruction and Professional Musicians.|url=|journal=Music Education Research|volume=Vol 15|pages=59|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The structure of college level group piano classes varies by university. Group piano sequences typically involve 2 to 6 semesters, situated within the first 2 or 3 years of study. Goals of the group piano sequence include introducing and reinforcing functional keyboard skills, bringing students with varying musical background to a competent level by the end of the course, and nurturing enthusiasm for music in general and the piano specifically.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At the end of the course sequence, music majors must often take a piano proficiency exam. Most piano proficiency exams require students to transpose, harmonize, sight-read, and perform a piece of solo piano repertoire. 

=== Adults ===
Group piano lessons are often taken by adults as a hobby and for personal development. They may take place in a private studio with multiple keyboards or a piano lab in a college community program. Because of the wide range of students, groups should be formed based upon students’ life span development stage or level of experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These lessons are often more flexible than pre-college and collegiate classes and involve more collaborative decision making.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The relatively new field of [[andragogy]] can inform teachers that engage in the teaching of adult group piano. Sponsored by the National Piano Foundation (NPF) and the [[National Association of Music Merchants]] (NAMM), Recreational Music-Making (RMM) is an approach to teaching adults that recognizes personal, social, and health-based benefits to music study in addition to the development of musical skills and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jutras|first=PJ|date=2006|title=The Benefits of Adult Piano Study as Self-Reported by Selected Adult Piano Students.|url=|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|volume=54 (2)|pages=97-110|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dillon|first=Brenda|date=2007|title=Recreational Music Making|url=|journal=American Music Teacher|volume=57 (1)|pages=21-23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Class formats ==

=== Partner lessons ===
Partner lessons take place when two students share a lesson. They may share an entire lesson, or their lesson times may overlap. One student may come for 20 minutes of private instruction and then be joined by another student for 20 minutes of partnered instruction. After the partner time, the second student will receive 20 minutes of private instruction. In this way, each hour lesson provides opportunity for collaboration with a peer as well as private instruction from the teacher.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== Hybrid ===
Hybrid piano lessons are any other combination of private and group piano lessons. This may include biweekly, monthly, or more occasional group meetings for students that are otherwise taking individual/private lessons. These types of lessons are often used as reinforcement of secondary or functional skills such as music history and music theory.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Occasional master classes, where students perform and receive feedback publicly, may also supplement individual/private instruction. This provides students with performance opportunities and a chance to observe and learn from their peers. 

== Advantages ==
Because students do not receive constant individualized attention in group lessons, they may learn to become independent learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Group Lessons a Plus?|url=|journal=Keyboard Companion|volume=17 (2)|pages=3-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environment requires students to problem-solve and internalize practice techniques. Group lessons provide ample opportunities for discussion, critical listening, [[Musical analysis|structural analysis]], study of historical contexts, and collective decision-making. Collective decision-making allows students to solve the problem on their own with guidance from both the teacher and peers. This social learning can assist with developing independent learning. 

Group piano lessons also expose students to a wider range of experiences through repertoire, performance opportunities, and ensemble playing. Students not only become familiar with their own repertoire, they have the opportunity to learn and think critically of the music being learned by their peers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This format may also help alleviate performance anxiety. Students have an audience on a weekly basis, which establishes a learning environment in which playing music for others is a natural part of the learning process. Group lessons provide an environment in which ensemble skills may be developed. Students may play duets, trios, and more.

Some teachers have found that the group lesson format may increase motivation in piano students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gipson|first=Ann M.|date=2005|title=Group Lessons = Positive Results|url=|journal=American Music Teacher|volume=55 (3)|pages=18-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be motivated by their fellow peers and develop more appreciation of the music through modeling. Peer learning might also create a sense of accountability within the cohort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Terry Lynn|date=November 2012|title=Group Teaching Thoughts|url=|journal=MTNA e-Journal|volume=4 (2)|pages=14-18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive peer pressure encourages students to feel like they should master their piece for the class, either to avoid embarrassment or to contribute to the group.

== Disadvantages  ==
Piano labs, multiple keyboards, headphones, and a conference system require more space and upfront cost than individual/private lessons. Group lessons also require more planning and preparation for teachers, as they teach multiple students at once and for longer time periods. Another disadvantage that may occur with group piano teaching is complications in developing and scheduling cohorts with similar experience levels and background.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Hans Kilian and Lotte Köhler Center''' for Cultural Psychology and Historical Anthropology (KKC) was established in August 2014 at the Chair for Social Theory and Social Psychology, [[Ruhr-University Bochum]], Germany. It is mainly funded by the ''Köhler Foundation'', which is a member of the ''Stifterverband'', a German business community initiative advocating long-term improvement of the German education and research landscape. The KKC is named after two individuals whose biographies are closely linked, namely, Hans Kilian and Lotte Köhler.

[[:de: Hans Kilian|Hans Kilian]] (1921-2008), M.D., held the Chair for Social Psychology and Applied Psychoanalysis at the University of Kassel, Germany, from 1971 to 1984. His research interests included psychosomatic medicine, work psychology, cultural-evolutionary anthropology, and the interdisciplinary analysis of psychohistorical and psychosocial developments in individuals and their social environments. One of his specific interests was the lasting psychological effect of the Nazi system on post-war Germany.

[[:de: Lotte Köhler|Lotte Köhler]] (*1925), M.D., received her psychoanalytic training in Munich, Germany, and Zurich, Switzerland. As a scientist, she is known for her work on self psychology, early-childhood memory development, and attachment theory. As a businesswoman, she chaired the supervisory board and the shareholders’ meeting at Goebel, LLC, located in Darmstadt, Germany. She ended her business career in 1987 when she established the Köhler Foundation, which supports the advancement of the human sciences.

From the 1960s until Hans Kilian’s death, they shared a bond in both the private and scientific domain. As for the latter, they were decisive in introducing [[Heinz Kohut]]’s self psychology to Germany in the 1970s.

Following Hans Kilian’s and Lotte Köhler’s aim to advance psychological and psychoanalytical research through interdisciplinary efforts, the KKC invites input from scholars of manifold fields. In this regard, sociology, anthropology, history, education, and philosophy are considered as important as work in research fields like critical psychology, cultural and postcolonial studies, gender studies, and religious studies.

== Scientific Activities ==
The KKC resulted from a development that began when the [[Hans-Kilian-Award]] was given for the first time in 2011. Since then, its activities have increased and focus on the following areas:
* [[Hans-Kilian-Award]]
* Hans Kilian Lecture Series
* Hans Kilian symposia and workshops
* Hans Kilian fellowships
* Hans Kilian student program
* Collected Works of Hans Kilian
* Kilian-Köhler-Archive

'''Health technology assessment''' is the systematic evaluation of the properties and effects of a [[health technology]], addressing the direct and intended effects of this technology, as well as its indirect and [[unintended consequences]], and aimed mainly at informing decision making regarding health technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment) | title=HTA Glossary.net | url=http://htaglossary.net/health+technology+assessment+%28HTA%29 | date=Jun 1, 2015 | publisher=INAHTA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has other definitions including "a method of evidence synthesis that considers evidence regarding clinical effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness and, when broadly applied, includes social, ethical, and legal aspects of the use of health technologies. The precise balance of these inputs depends on the purpose of each individual HTA. A major use of HTAs is in informing reimbursement and coverage decisions by [[Health insurance|insurers]] and national health systems, in which case HTAs should include benefit-harm assessment and economic evaluation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Luce BR, etal | title=. EBM, HTA, and CER: clearing the confusion | journal=Milbank Q | date=2010 | volume=88 | pages=256–76 | pmid=20579285 | pmc=2980346 | issue=2 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2010.00598.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "a multidisciplinary process that summarises information about the medical, social, economic and ethical issues related to the use of a health technology in a systematic, transparent, unbiased, robust manner. Its aim is to inform the formulation of safe, effective, [[health policies]] that are patient focused and seek to achieve best value. Despite its policy goals, HTA must always be firmly rooted in research and the scientific method".&lt;ref&gt;EUnetHTA (European network for Health Technology Assessment) https://www.eunethta.eu/about-eunethta/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Health technology assessment is intended to provide a bridge between the world of research and the world of decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Battista, RN: ''The scientific basis of health services''. BMJ Publishing Group, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; HTA is an active field internationally and has seen continued growth fostered by the need to support management, clinical, and policy decisions. It has also been advanced by the evolution of evaluative methods in the social and applied sciences, including [[clinical epidemiology]] and [[Health economics|health economics]]. Health policy decisions are becoming increasingly important as the opportunity costs from making wrong decisions continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Menon D.| title=The internationalization of heath technology assessment | journal=IJTAHC | date=1996 | volume=12 | pages=45–51 | pmid=8690561 | last2=Marshall | first2=D | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; HTA is now also used in assessment of innovative medical technologies like telemedicine e.g. by use of the [[Model for assessment of telemedicine]] (MAST).

Health technology can be defined broadly as:
{{Quote|Any intervention that may be used to promote health, to prevent, diagnose or treat disease or for rehabilitation or long-term care. This includes the pharmaceuticals, devices, procedures and organizational systems used in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment). | title=HTA glossary. | url=http://htaglossary.net/tiki-index.php?page=health%20technology | date=Oct 8, 2013 | publisher=HTAi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
The growth of HTA internationally can be seen in the expanding membership of the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA), a non-profit umbrella organization established in 1993. Organizations and individuals involved in HTA research are also affiliated with societies such as the international societies HTAi and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research |url=https://www.ispor.org |website=ISPOR |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international Masters program in health technology assessment and management, ULYSSES, is also offered.

==Health Technology Assessment by country==
===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom's [[National Institute for Health Research]] runs several research programmes which may be viewed as falling into the realm of Health Technology Assessment. Of particular note is the NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme, its longest running, which undertakes both conventional HTA in the form of Evidence Synthesis and modelling, and evidence generation with a large portfolio of pragmatic [[Randomized controlled trial|RCTs]] and [[Cohort study|cohort studies]].

Also in the UK, the Multidisciplinary Assessment of Technology Centre for Healthcare carries out HTA in collaboration with the health service, the NHS and various industrial partners.  MATCH is organised into four themes addressing key HTA topics including Health Economics, Tools for Industry, User Needs and Procurement and Supply chain.

'''Humming Heads Inc.''' is an [[Information security|EIP]] (Enterprise Information Protection) software developer based in Japan.

==History==
Humming Heads Inc. was founded in 1999 to focus on the computer security. It shipped its first product, Security Platform (SeP) in 2001, as an anti-virus software. Taking [[Sarbanes Oxley Act|SOX]] seriously, Humming Heads introduced functionality preventing unauthorized access and confidential information theft from the electronic systems. Further Humming Heads came with its own implementation of the desktop file manager. In 2017 the firm entered the US market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esecurityplanet.com/network-security/shinobi-defense-system-arrives-in-the-u.s..html|title=Shinobi Defense System Arrives in the U.S.|author=Pedro Hernandez|date=May 10, 2017|website=esecurityplanet.com|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security Platform==
SeP prevents unauthorized information access from the PC as well as from the external devices. SeP client is controlling all the storage devices, and automatically performs operations like encryption. It also keeps log of the user operations, which is stored at the server side and can be analyzed if needed. One of important features of SeP is that it has marginal effect in client's PC performance.
Originally SeP is available in Japanese language. Chinese and English versions of the SeP software are under development.

'''Indirect self-reference''' describes an object [[self-reference|referring to itself]] ''indirectly''.

For example, define the function f such that f(x) = x(x). Any function passed as an argument to f is invoked with itself as an argument, and thus in any use of that argument is indirectly referring to itself.

This example is similar to the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] expression "((lambda(x)(x x)) (lambda(x)(x x)))", which is expanded to itself by beta reduction, and so its evaluation loops indefinitely despite the lack of explicit looping constructs. An equivalent example can be formulated in [[lambda calculus]].

Indirect self-reference is special in that its self-referential quality is not explicit, as it is in the sentence "this sentence is false." The phrase "this sentence" refers directly to the sentence as a whole. An indirectly self-referential sentence would replace the phrase "this sentence" with an expression that effectively still referred to the sentence, but did not use the pronoun "this."

An example will help to explain this. Suppose we define the [[quine (computing)|quine]] of a phrase to be the quotation of the phrase followed by the phrase itself. So, the quine of:
 is a sentence fragment
would be:
 "is a sentence fragment" is a sentence fragment
which, incidentally, is a true statement.

Now consider the sentence:
 "when quined, makes quite a statement" when quined, makes quite a statement

The quotation here, plus the phrase "when quined," indirectly refers to the entire sentence. The importance of this fact is that the remainder of the sentence, the phrase "makes quite a statement," can now make a statement about the sentence as a whole. If we had used a pronoun for this, we could have written something like "this sentence makes quite a statement."

It seems silly to go through this trouble when pronouns will suffice (and when they make more sense to the casual reader), but in systems of [[mathematical logic]], there is generally no analog of the pronoun. It is somewhat surprising, in fact, that self-reference can be achieved at all in these systems.

Upon closer inspection, it can be seen that in fact, the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] example above uses a [[quine (computing)|quine]], and f(x) is actually the quine function itself.

Indirect self-reference was studied in great depth by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] (after whom the operation above is named), and occupies a central place in the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]].  Among the paradoxical statements developed by Quine is the following:

 "yields a false statement when preceded by its quotation" yields a false statement when preceded by its quotation

The '''Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] which continues the process of [[land reform in Scotland]] following the [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]]. It is notable for granting [[Scottish ministers]] the power to force the sale of private land to community bodies to further [[sustainable development]] in the absence of a willing seller.

==Provisions==

Under the provisions of the act there is to be a ‘Land Rights and Responsibilities Statement’, setting out the Scottish Government’s objectives for [[Land reform in Scotland|land reform]], a [[Scottish Land Commission]] is to take forward the land reform process, preparing a strategic plan, for the approval of Scottish ministers. One of the new land commissioners is to be a Tenant Farming Commissioner who must be neither an agricultural landlord nor a tenant but who is to be responsible for reviewing issues relating to [[tenant farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Mike|title=A Brief Guide to Land Reform in Scotland|url=http://www.gillespiemacandrew.co.uk/media/340813/land-reform-act-2016.pdf|publisher=Gillespie Macandrew LLP|accessdate=5 March 2017|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further provision is the creation of the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development. This permits Scottish ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Unlike the Community Right to Buy established by the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] and extended by the [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]], the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. In this respect it is similar to the Crofting Community Right to Buy of the 2003 Act which allows [[crofting]] communities to purchase croft land and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a willing seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community rights to buy in Scotland – which is which, and what are they for?|url=http://www.brodies.com/node/8185|website=Brodies|accessdate=5 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis. 

Other provisions of the act include new regulations to require persons who control land to be identified, with information obtained to appear in the Land Register of Scotland; the removal of sporting rights exemption from rates, which are to be re-valued; and further powers for [[Scottish Natural Heritage]] to control deer management. It also makes provision for notice and consultation where core paths are to be amended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2016/18/pdfs/asp_20160018_en.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mechanism''' is the belief that natural wholes (principally living things) are like complicated machines or artifacts, composed of parts lacking any intrinsic relationship to each other. Thus, the source of an apparent thing's activities is not the whole itself, but its parts or an external influence on the parts.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The doctrine of mechanism in [[philosophy]] comes in two different flavors. They are both doctrines of [[metaphysics]], but they are different in scope and ambitions: the first is a global doctrine about nature; the second is a local doctrine about humans and their minds, which is hotly contested. For clarity, we might distinguish these two doctrines as [[universal mechanism]] and [[anthropic mechanism]].

{{quote|There is no constant meaning in the history of philosophy for the word Mechanism. Originally, the term meant that cosmological theory which ascribes the motion and changes of the world to some external force. In this view material things are purely passive, while according to the opposite theory (i. e., Dynamism), they possess certain internal sources of energy which account for the activity of each and for its influence on the course of events; These meanings, however, soon underwent modification. The question as to whether motion is an inherent property of bodies, or has been communicated to them by some external agency, was very often ignored. With a large number of cosmologists the essential feature of Mechanism is the attempt to reduce all the qualities and activities of bodies to quantitative realities, i. e. to mass and motion. But a further modification soon followed. Living bodies, as is well known, present at first sight certain characteristic properties which have no counterpart in lifeless matter. Mechanism aims to go beyond these appearances. It seeks to explain all "vital" phenomena as physical and chemical facts; whether or not these facts are in turn reducible to mass and motion becomes a secondary question, although Mechanists are generally inclined to favour such reduction. The theory opposed to this biological mechanism is no longer Dynamism, but Vitalism or Neo-vitalism, which maintains that vital activities cannot be explained, and never will be explained, by the laws which govern lifeless matter.&lt;ref name="CE1913"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Mechanism |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1913 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Mechanism}}&lt;/ref&gt;|"Mechanism" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)}}

== Universal mechanism&lt;!--'Universal mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The older doctrine, here called '''universal mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, is the ancient philosophies closely linked with [[materialism]] and [[reductionism]], especially that of the [[atomism|atomists]] and to a large extent, [[stoicism|stoic physics]]. They held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the [[motion (physics)|motion]] and collision of [[matter]]. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the [[scientific revolution]] had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of 'mechanical' laws, natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that implied a thorough going [[determinism]]: if ''all'' phenomena could be explained ''entirely'' through the motion of matter under the laws of [[classical physics]], then even more surely than the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, ''all'' phenomena must be completely determined: whether past, present or future. (One of the philosophical implications of modern [[quantum mechanics]] is that this view of determinism is not defensible.)

The French mechanist and determinist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] formulated the sweeping implications of this thesis by saying:

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of the past and the cause of the future. An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest [[atom]]; for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace|''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''}}

One of the first and most famous expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1651). What is less frequently appreciated is that [[René Descartes]] was a staunch mechanist, though today, in the [[philosophy of mind]], he is remembered for introducing the [[mind–body problem]] in terms of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[physicalism]].

Descartes was a [[substance dualist]], and argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended [[matter]], on the one hand, and immaterial [[mind]], on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was thoroughly mechanistic in nature:

:"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine’s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels." (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p.108)

His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic [[automaton|automata]]. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.

[[Isaac Newton]] ushered in a much weaker acceptation of mechanism that tolerated the antithetical, and as yet inexplicable, [[action at a distance]] of [[gravity]]. However, his work seemed to successfully predict the motion of both celestial and terrestrial bodies according to that principle, and the generation of philosophers who were inspired by Newton's example carried the mechanist banner nonetheless. Chief among them were French [[philosophy|philosophers]] such as [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Denis Diderot]] (see also: [[French materialism]]).

== Anthropic mechanism&lt;!--'Anthropic mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The thesis in '''anthropic mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is not that everything can be completely explained in mechanical terms (although some anthropic mechanists may ''also'' believe that), but rather that everything ''about human beings'' can be completely explained in mechanical terms, as surely as can everything about clocks or the internal combustion engine.

One of the chief obstacles that all mechanistic theories have faced is providing a mechanistic explanation of the human [[mind]]; Descartes, for one, endorsed [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] in spite of endorsing a completely mechanistic conception of the material world because he argued that mechanism and the notion of a mind were logically incompatible. Hobbes, on the other hand, conceived of the mind and the will as purely mechanistic, completely explicable in terms of the effects of perception and the pursuit of desire, which in turn he held to be completely explicable in terms of the materialistic operations of the nervous system. Following Hobbes, other mechanists argued for a thoroughly mechanistic explanation of the mind, with one of the most influential and controversial expositions of the doctrine being offered by [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] in his ''Man a Machine'' (1748).

Today, as in the past, the main points of debate between anthropic mechanists and anti-mechanists are mainly occupied with two topics: the mind — and consciousness, in particular — and [[free will]]. Anti-mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism is incompatible with our commonsense intuitions: in [[philosophy of mind]] they argue that unconscious matter cannot completely explain the phenomenon of consciousness, and in [[metaphysics]] they argue that anthropic mechanism implies determinism about human action, which (they argue) is incompatible with our understanding of ourselves as creatures with [[free will]]. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this position include [[Norman Malcolm]] and
[[David Chalmers]].

Anthropic mechanists typically respond in one of two ways. In the first, they agree with anti-mechanists that mechanism conflicts with some of our commonsense intuitions, but go on to argue that our commonsense intuitions are simply mistaken and need to be revised. Down this path lies [[eliminative materialism]] in [[philosophy of mind]], and [[hard determinism]] on the question of free will. This option is accepted by the eliminative materialist philosopher [[Paul Churchland]]. Some have questioned how eliminative materialism is compatible with the freedom of will apparently required for anyone (including its adherents) to make truth claims.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Jonas, ''The Phenomenon of Life: Toward a Philosophical Biology'' (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2001/1966), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The second option, common amongst philosophers who adopt anthropic mechanism, is to argue that the [[argument]]s given for incompatibility are specious: whatever it is we mean by "consciousness" and "free will," they urge, it is fully compatible with a mechanistic understanding of the human mind and will. As a result, they tend to argue for one or another non-eliminativist [[Physicalism|physicalist]] theories of mind, and for [[compatibilism]] on the question of free will. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this sort of account include [[J. J. C. Smart]] and [[Daniel Dennett]].

===Gödelian arguments&lt;!--'Gödelian argument' and 'Gödelian arguments' redirect here--&gt;===
Some scholars have debated over what, if anything, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] imply about anthropic mechanism. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a [[Turing machine]], or by the [[Church-Turing thesis]], any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is [[Consistency|consistent]], then Gödel's incompleteness theorems would apply to it.

'''Gödelian arguments'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent and powerful enough to recognize its own consistency. Since this is impossible for a Turing machine, the Gödelian concludes that human reasoning must be non-mechanical.

However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent "idealized version" ''H'' of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of ''H'' (otherwise ''H'' is provably inconsistent); and that Gödel's theorems do not lead to any valid argument against mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Graham Oppy]]|title=Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#GdeArgAgaMec|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=20 January 2015|quote=These Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however, problematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stuart J.

An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of Gödel's incompleteness results': "The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail."&lt;/ref&gt; This consensus that Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in ''[[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]]'': "''any'' attempt to utilize (Gödel's incompleteness results) to attack the [[computationalism|computationalist]] thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis."&lt;ref name=laforte&gt;LaForte, G., Hayes, P. J., Ford, K. M. 1998. Why Gödel's theorem cannot refute computationalism. [[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]], 104:265-286, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
One of the earliest attempts to use incompleteness to reason about human intelligence was by Gödel himself in his 1951 [[Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectureship|Gibbs Lecture]] entitled "Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their philosophical implications".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel, Kurt]], 1951, ''Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their implications'' in  [[Solomon Feferman]], ed., 1995. ''Collected works / Kurt Gödel, Vol. III''. Oxford University Press: 304-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this lecture, Gödel uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist [[Diophantine equations]] for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a "certain fact".

In subsequent years, more direct anti-mechanist lines of reasoning were apparently floating around the intellectual atmosphere. In 1960, [[Hilary Putnam]] published a paper entitled "Minds and Machines," in which he points out the flaws of a typical anti-mechanist argument.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilary Putnam|Putnam, Hilary]], 1960, ''Minds and Machines'' in [[Sidney Hook]], ed., ''Dimensions of Mind: A Symposium''. New York University Press. Reprinted in Anderson, A. R., ed., 1964. ''Minds and Machines''. Prentice-Hall: 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informally, this is the argument that the (alleged) difference between "what can be mechanically proven" and "what can be seen to be true by humans" shows that human intelligence is not mechanical in nature. Or, as Putnam puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let T be a Turing machine which "represents" me in the sense that T can prove just the mathematical statements I prove. Then using Gödel's technique I can discover a proposition that T cannot prove, and moreover I can prove this proposition. This refutes the assumption that T "represents" me, hence I am not a Turing machine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hilary Putnam]] objects that this argument ignores the issue of consistency. Gödel's technique can only be applied to consistent systems. It is conceivable, argues Putnam, that the human mind is inconsistent. If one is to use Gödel's technique to prove the proposition that T cannot prove, one must first prove (the mathematical statement representing) the consistency of T, a daunting and perhaps impossible task. Later Putnam suggested that while Gödel's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. If we are to believe that it is consistent, then either we cannot prove its consistency, or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.&lt;ref&gt;The Gödel Theorem and Human Nature, a talk given by [[Hilary Putnam]] in the Gödel centenary 2006  [http://www.logic.at/goedel2006/abstract.php?putnam]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. R. Lucas]] in ''[[Minds, Machines and Gödel]]'' (1961), and later in his book ''The Freedom of the Will'' (1970), lays out an anti-mechanist argument closely following the one described by Putnam, including reasons for why the human mind can be considered consistent.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lucas (philosopher)|Lucas, J. R.]], 1961, "[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/mmg.html Minds, Machines, and Gödel.]" ''Philosophy 36'':112-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lucas admits that, by Gödel's second theorem, a human mind cannot formally prove its own consistency, and even says (perhaps facetiously) that women and politicians are inconsistent. Nevertheless, he sets out arguments for why a male non-politician can be considered consistent. These arguments are philosophical in nature and are the subject of much debate; Lucas provides references to responses on his own [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/referenc.html website].

Another work was done by [[Judson Webb]] in his 1968 paper "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Judson Webb|Webb, Judson]], 1968, "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind," ''Philosophy of Science 35'': 156-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Webb claims that previous attempts have glossed over whether one truly can see that the Gödelian statement ''p'' pertaining to oneself, is true. Using a different formulation of Gödel's theorems, namely, that of [[Raymond Smullyan]] and [[Emil Post]], Webb shows one can derive convincing arguments for oneself of both the truth and falsity of ''p''. He furthermore argues that all arguments about the philosophical implications of Gödel's theorems are really arguments about whether the [[Church-Turing thesis]] is true.

Later, [[Roger Penrose]] entered the fray, providing somewhat novel anti-mechanist arguments in his books, ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]''  (1989) [ENM] and ''[[Shadows of the Mind]]'' (1994) [SM]. These books have proved highly controversial.  [[Martin Davis]] responded to ENM in his paper [http://www.cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/davism/penrose.ps "Is Mathematical Insight Algorithmic?" (ps)], where he argues that Penrose ignores the issue of consistency.  [[Solomon Feferman]] gives a critical examination of SM in his paper [http://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/penrose.pdf "Penrose's Gödelian argument" (pdf)].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The response of the scientific community to Penrose's arguments has been negative, with one group of scholars calling Penrose's repeated attempts to form a persuasive Gödelian argument "a kind of intellectual shell game, in which a precisely defined notion to which a mathematical result applies... is switched for a vaguer notion".&lt;ref name=laforte /&gt;

A Gödel-based anti-mechanism argument can be found in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', though Hofstadter is widely viewed as a known skeptic of such arguments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Looked at this way, Gödel's proof suggests – though by no means does it prove! – that there could be some high-level way of viewing the mind/brain, involving concepts which do not appear on lower levels, and that this level might have explanatory power that does not exist – not even in principle – on lower levels. It would mean that some facts could be explained on the high level quite easily, but not on  lower levels at all. No matter how long and cumbersome a low-level statement were made, it would not explain the phenomena in question.
It is analogous to the fact that, if you make derivation after derivation in [[Peano arithmetic]], no matter how long and cumbersome you make them, you will never come up with one for G – despite the fact that on a higher level, you can see that the [[Gödel sentence]] is true.

What might such high-level concepts be? It has been proposed for eons, by various holistically or "soulistically" inclined scientists and humanists that consciousness is a phenomenon that escapes explanation in terms of brain components; so here is a candidate at least. There is also the ever-puzzling notion of free will. So perhaps these qualities could be "emergent" in the sense of requiring explanations which cannot be furnished by the physiology alone
  (''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', p. 708).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rationology.net/eGodel.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aerial photograph of Maiden Castle from the west, 1937.jpg|thumb|[[Mortimer Wheeler]] pioneered a [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|system of excavation]] in the early 20th century. Pictured are his excavations at [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], in October 1937.]]

'''Modern archaeology''' is the [[Archaeological sub-disciplines|discipline of archaeology]] which contributes to [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cyprus-mail.com/2018/10/03/modern-archaeology-much-more-than-excavations/ |title=Modern archaeology ‘much more than excavations’ |author=CNA News Service |date=3 October 2018 |access-date=3 October 2018 |newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{what|date=October 2018}}

[[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] was one of the founders of scientific archaeology and first applied the categories of style on a large, systematic basis to the [[history of art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Walter |title=Instant Art History |date=February 1995 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=0-449-90698-1 |page=240 |chapter=Introduction |quote=The father of official art history was a German named Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–68).}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was "the prophet and founding hero of modern archaeology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=Boorstin|authorlink=Daniel J. Boorstin|author=Boorstin, Daniel J. |title=[[The Discoverers]]|publisher= Random House |place=New York|year= 1983|isbn=978-0-394-72625-0 |page=584}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next major figure in the development of archaeology was [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s and 1930s brought the science into the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stout |first=Adam |title=Creating Prehistory: Druids, Ley Hunters and Archaeologists in Pre-War Britain |location=Malden and Oxford |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4051-5505-2 |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheeler developed the [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|grid system of excavation]], which was further improved on by his student [[Kathleen Kenyon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology |last=Hawkes |first=Jacquetta |year=1982 |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |isbn=978-0-297-78056-4 |pages=149–151, 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tessa Verney Wheeler: Women and Archaeology Before World War Two |last=Carr |first=Lydia C. |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-19-964022-5 |pages=172-175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two constant themes in their attempts to improve archaeological excavation were first, to maintain strict stratigraphic control while excavating (for this purpose, the baulks between trenches served to retain a record of the strata that had been dug through), and second, to publish a record of the excavation promptly and in a form that would tell the story of the site to the intelligent reader.

Bomb damage during the Second World War and subsequent rebuilding gave archaeologists the opportunity to meaningfully examine inhabited cities for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler |last=Piggott |first=Stuart |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society |publisher=The Royal Society |volume=23 |year=1977 |jstor=769628 |page=635 |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1977.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bombed sites provided windows onto the development of European cities whose pasts had been buried beneath working buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology |last=Hawkes |first=Jacquetta |year=1982 |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |isbn=978-0-297-78056-4 |pages=192-194}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urban archaeology]] necessitated a new approach as centuries of human occupation had created deep layers of stratigraphy that could often only be seen through the keyholes of individual building plots. In Britain, post-war archaeologists such as [[W. F. Grimes]] and [[Martin Biddle]] took the initiative in studying this previously unexamined area and developed the archaeological methods now employed in much cultural resource management and [[rescue archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biddle |first1=Martin |last2=Hudson |first2=Daphne M |title=Future of London's Past|date= 1 April 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeology increasingly became a professional activity during the first half of the 20th century. Although the bulk of an excavation's workforce would still consist of volunteers, it would normally be led by a professional. It was now possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and other schools, and by the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates of such programs.

==New technology==
Undoubtedly the major technological development in 20th century archaeology was the introduction of [[radiocarbon dating]], based on a theory first developed by American scientist [[Willard Libby]] in 1949. Despite its many limitations (compared to later methods it is inaccurate; it can only be used on organic matter; it is reliant on a dataset to calibrate it; and it only works with remains from the last 10,000 years), the technique brought about a revolution in archaeological understanding. For the first time, it was possible to put reasonably accurate dates on discoveries such as bones. This in some cases led to a complete reassessment of the significance of past finds. Classic cases included the [[Red Lady of Paviland]]. It was not until 1989 that the Catholic Church allowed the technique to be used on the [[Turin Shroud]], indicating that the linen fibres were of medieval origin.

Other developments, often spin-offs from wartime technology, led to other scientific advances. For field archaeologists, the most significant of these was the use of the [[archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]]. This encompasses a number of [[remote sensing]] techniques, such as [[aerial photography]] and [[satellite imagery]]. Also used is [[LIDAR|light detection and ranging (LIDAR)]], a technology that measures the height of the ground surface and other features in large areas of landscape with resolution and accuracy that was not previously available. Subsurface remote sensing techniques such as [[magnetometry]] and [[ground-penetrating radar]] enable an advanced picture to be built up of what lies beneath the soil before excavation even commences. The entire Roman town of [[Viroconium Cornoviorum|Viroconium]], modern day [[Wroxeter]], has been surveyed by these methods, though only a small portion has actually been excavated.  The application of physical sciences to archaeology, known as archaeometry or [[archaeological science]], is now a major part of archaeology.

Archaeology has also come to use [[Geographic Information System|geographic information systems]], designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and visualize all types of geospatial data.

The discovery in 1991 in the [[Ötztaler Alpen|Ötztaler Alps]] of the prehistorical mummy dubbed [[Ötzi]] resulted in the techniques of [[genetics]] being brought to bear on archaeological science. With the help of [[DNA Analysis|DNA analysis]], scholars were able to ascertain that Ötzi does not belong to any known human population. In the subsequent years, genetics has helped us reconstruct human migrations that occurred during prehistory.

'''Music [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]]''' is the copying and distributing of recordings of a piece of music for which the rights owners (composer, recording artist, or [[copyright]]-holding record company) did not give consent. In the contemporary legal environment, it is a form of [[copyright infringement]], which may be either a [[tort|civil wrong]] or a crime depending on jurisdiction. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw much controversy over the ethics of redistributing media content, how much production and distribution companies in the media were losing, and the very scope of what ought to be considered piracy — and cases involving the piracy of music were among the most frequently discussed in the debate.

==History==
The invention of the internet and digital media created music piracy in its modern form. With the invention of newer technology that allowed for the piracy process to become less complicated, it became much more common. Users of the web began adding media files to the internet, and prior potential risks and difficulties to pirating music, such as the physicality of the process, were eliminated. It was much easier for people with little to no knowledge of technology and old piracy methods to gather media files.&lt;ref name="Online Piracy-History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Piracy-History|url=http://piracy.web.unc.edu/brief-history-of-online-piracy/|website=Online Piracy|publisher=UNC Digital Commons|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first application that demonstrated the implications of music piracy was [[Napster]]. Napster enabled users to exchange music files over a common free server without any regard for copyright laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Piracy|url=http://www.csun.edu/~ch1842/piracy/index.html|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napster was quickly shut down after lawsuits filed by [[Metallica]] and [[Dr. Dre]] and a separate lawsuit in regards to the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]].&lt;ref name="Online Piracy-History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Napster settles suits|url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/07/12/news/napster/|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other music sharing services such as [[Limewire]] continued to be a resource to those searching for free music files. These platforms were also removed after a few years of service due to copyright laws and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. After finding some loopholes, piracy began to exist in more legal forms, an example being [[Pirate Bay]]. This technical legality was due to the format of the websites and their country of origin and administration. The websites were set up so that the site itself did not host any of the illegal files, but gave the user a map as to where they could access the files. Additionally, in Pirate Bay's case, the website was hosted under Swedish law, where this “map” was not illegal.&lt;ref name="Online Piracy-History"/&gt;

===Arguments over legality===
In face of the growing encroachment on potential sales from internet piracy, industry associations like the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) have lobbied for stricter laws and stricter punishment of those breaking copyright law. Record companies have also turned to technological barriers to copying, such as [[Digital rights management|DRM]], to some [[Digital right management#Controversy|controversy]]. These organizations have tried to add more controls to the digital copy of the music to prevent consumers from copying the music. For the most part, the industry has come to a consensus that, if not DRM, then some similar measures are necessary for them to continue to make a profit.

Critics of the record companies' strategy have proposed that the attempts to maintain sales rates are impeding the rights of legitimate listeners to use and listen to the music as they wish. When the US Congress passed the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], it deliberately gave less copyright control to music composers than that of novelists: "Its fear was the monopoly power of rights holders, and that that power would stifle follow-on creativity".&lt;ref name=lessig /&gt; According to the internationally established [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]],&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt; "Existing laws and regulations may be too broad and general to deal adequately with the rapid technological developments that facilitate digital piracy, and policy makers may need to consider enacting some specific provisions to deal with these infringements. Such provisions should not unduly impede legitimate digital communications, nor unreasonably impact on the Internet as an effective communications platform, commercial channel and educational tool..."&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt;

There have been several means of free access to copyrighted music for the general public including Napster, Limewire, and Spotify. Napster was a free file sharing software created by college student Shawn Fanning to enable people to share and trade music files in mp3 format. Napster became hugely popular because it made it so easy to share and download music files. However, the heavy metal band Metallica sued the company for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2000/04/14/mu4.html | work=Forbes | first=Amy | last=Doan | title=Metallica Sues Napster}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to other artists following suit and shutting down Napster’s service. Likewise, Limewire was a free peer-to-peer file sharing software similar to that of Napster. The software enabled unlimited file sharing between computers and ended being one of the most popular sharing networks around. Like Napster, Limewire struggled through multiple legal battles and inevitably wound up being shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/oct/27/limewire-shut-down|title=LimeWire shut down by federal court|author=Josh Halliday|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spotify and other on-demand streaming services are offering a way for consumers to still get their music for free while also contributing to the musician in a small way instead of simply illegally downloading the music, but it also moves customers away from buying hard copies of music or even legally downloading songs which is severely reducing artists' income. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wlömert|first=Nils|last2=Papies|first2=Dominik|date=2016-06-01|title=On-demand streaming services and music industry revenues — Insights from Spotify's market entry|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167811615001226|journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing|series=The Entertainment Industry|volume=33|issue=2|pages=314–327|doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2015.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) since Shawn Fanning started the program file sharing program Napster in 1999 music revenue has gone down 53% from $14.6 billion to $7.0 billion in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RIAA - Scope Of The Problem - June 14, 2015|url = https://www.riaa.com/physicalpiracy.php?content_selector=piracy-online-scope-of-the-problem|website = riaa.com|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study done in 2007 by the Institute of Policy Innovation states that music piracy resulted in a loss of 71,060 U.S. jobs, out of which 23,860 would have been in the recording industry and 44,200 jobs in other unrelated industries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipi.org/ipi_issues/detail/the-true-cost-of-sound-recording-piracy-to-the-us-economy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law enforcement===
The RIAA, a powerful lobby for the recording industry, is responsible for carrying out most of the lawsuits against music piracy in the United States. Some claim that the enforcement against music piracy, which may cost copyright violators up to $150,000 per infringement,&lt;ref name=lessig /&gt; is unreasonable, and that it may even violate United States constitutional protections against [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. Some have accused the RIAA of outright bullying, as when one of their lawyers, Matt Oppenheimer, told the defendant in one lawsuit, “You don’t want to pay another visit to a dentist like me".&lt;ref name=lessig /&gt; In that same case, according to Lawrence Lessig, "the RIAA insisted it would not settle the case until it took every penny [the defendant] had saved".&lt;ref name=lessig /&gt;

Further attempts at progress towards controlling the privacy of public media content by targeting the elimination of piracy were made when the highly anticipated yet often debated bill known as the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) was passed in recent years. The bill was first introduced in October 2011 by the United States House representative Lamar S. Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/house-introduces-internet-piracy-bill/2011/10/26/gIQA0f5xJM_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Cecilia | last=Kang | title=House introduces Internet piracy bill | date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general scope of the law was to fulfill the goal of putting a stop to online piracy by expanding upon existing criminal laws regarding copyright violations. The essential goal of the bill was to protect intellectual property of content creators by raising awareness of the severity of punishments for copyright infringement. Naturally, the bill was met with considerable opposition from various parties. One instance of this was an article comment by Edward J. Black, president and CEO of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, who questioned the potential effectiveness of the bill by reasoning that the major pirate websites that SOPA attempts to eliminate could just as easily respawn under a different name if taken down as early as a few hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/edward-j-black/stop-online-piracy-act-vote_b_1145949.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Internet Users, Free Speech Experts, Petition Against SOPA | date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, strong protest attempts were made across the internet when numerous high-profile online organizations including Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, and participating in American Censorship Day on January 18, with some sites including Reddit and Wikipedia going as far as completely blacking out all of their pages, redirecting the user to SOPA protest messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2011-11-16/-american-censorship-day-makes-an-online-statement-the-ticker|title='American Censorship Day' Makes an Online Statement: The Ticker|date=16 November 2011|work=BloombergView.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, as a result of aggressive protests and lack of consenting opinions within the congress, SOPA was tabled on January 20 by its creator, House representative Lamar Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/01/20/sopa-is-dead-timeline-january-blackout/|title=The Week That Killed SOPA: A Timeline|author=Alex Fitzpatrick|date=20 January 2012|work=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic ramifications==
Piracy's real effect on music sales is difficult to accurately assess. In [[neoclassical economics]] prices are determined by the combination of the forces of [[supply and demand]], but the participators in the digital market do not always follow the usual motives and behaviors of the supply and demand system. First, the cost of digital distribution has decreased significantly from the costs of distribution by former methods. Furthermore, the majority of the filesharing community will distribute copies of music for a zero price in monetary terms, and there are some consumers who are willing to pay a certain price for legitimate copies even when they could just as easily obtain pirated copies,&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt; such as with [[pay what you want]] vendors.

Another issue is that because many people in the world illegally download music because they cannot afford to purchase legitimate copies, not every illegal download necessarily equates to a lost sale. This has some effect on music sales, but as [[Lawrence Lessig]] points out, there is wide asymmetry between the estimated volume of illegal downloading and the projected loss of sales:

{{cquote|In 2002, the RIAA reported that CD sales had fallen by 8.9 percent, from 882 million to 803 million units; revenues fell 6.7 percent. This confirms a trend over the past few years. The RIAA blames Internet piracy for the trend, though there are many other causes that could account for this drop. SoundScan, for example, reports a more than 20 percent drop in the number of CDs released since 1999. That no doubt accounts for some of the decrease in sales... But let’s assume the RIAA is right, and all of the decline in CD sales is because of Internet sharing. Here’s the rub: In the same period that the RIAA estimates that 803 million CDs were sold, the RIAA estimates that 2.1 billion CDs were downloaded for free. Thus, although 2.6 times the total number of CDs sold were downloaded for free, sales revenue fell by just 6.7 percent... [So] there is a huge difference between downloading a song and stealing a CD.&lt;ref name=lessig&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Lawrence Lessig]]|year=2004 |title=Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Control Creativity |location=New York |publisher=The Penguin Press |isbn=1-59420-006-8 |oclc=53324884 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Woolley's introduction each year It is estimated that 12.5 billion dollars are lost due to file sharing and music piracy, and 5 billion of that is profits lost from the music industry directly. Due to this dramatic loss in profits the music industry has been forced to cut down their staffing. Music piracy has become such an issue that the industry is encouraged to adapt to this new era and change.&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, D. J. (2010). The cynical pirate: how cynicism effects music piracy. Academy of Information and Management Sciences Journal, 13(1), 31+. Retrieved from http://bi.galegroup.com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu/essentials/article/GALE|A241861851/b8772514a705be025bdcd7edee6d5cdc?u=maine_orono&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital copies==
The article, "The Music Industry On (The) Line? Surviving Music Piracy In A Digital Era" By Jelle Janssens, Stijn Vandaele, and Tom Vander Beken presents an analysis of the prevalence of piracy in music trade, which has affected the global sales of CDs. This article points out that technological development such as file sharing, MP3 players, and CDRs have increased music piracy. The most common forms of music piracy are Internet Piracy and compact disc piracy. It also discusses the association between music piracy and organized crime, which is defined as profit-driven illegal activities. The fact that digital products are virtual instead of physical affects the economic mechanisms behind the production and distribution of content, and how piracy works for digital as opposed to physical products: "the main consequence of the non-physical form of digital products is their virtually negligible marginal cost of reproduction and their ability to be digitally delivered."&lt;ref name=oecd&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Stryszowski |editor1-first=Piotr |editor2-last=Scorpecci |editor2-first=Danny |year=2009 |title=Piracy of Digital Content |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Publishing |isbn=978-92-64-06543-7 |oclc=663833839 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of burning a CD drastically lowered the [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] for record companies, as well as for music pirates, and with the growing tendency toward [[online distribution]] among legitimate and illicit distributors alike, the expense of distributing shrunk further from the costs of printing and transporting CDs to merely the costs of maintaining a [[website]].&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt; By sheer volume of file transfers, though, distributing music through traditional web servers and [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] servers were not as popular as [[peer to peer]] (P2P) now, because the traditional [[Direct download link|direct download]] method is slower.

The 2008 British Music Rights survey&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Orlowski]]. ''[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/16/bmr_music_survey/ 80% want legal P2P - survey]''. [[The Register]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that 80% of people in Britain wanted a legal P2P service. This was consistent with the results of earlier research conducted in the United States, upon which the [[Open Music Model]] was based.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shuman Ghosemajumder]]. ''[http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/8438 Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models]''. [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the majority of filesharers in the survey preferred to get their music from "local sources" such as [[Local area network|LAN]] connections, [[email]], [[USB flash drive|flash drives]], sharing with other people they know personally.&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt; The other most common method of filesharing was with P2P technologies. By 2007, P2P networks' popularity had grown so much that they used as much as 39% of the total volume of information exchanged over the internet.&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt;

==Rights Holders Solution==
Alongside the RIAA and BPI's industry anti-piracy service sit a number of other independent companies offering anti-piracy solutions. 
These companies tend to have a better reach and success rate than the slower industry bodies and provide an alternative solution. Notable market leaders include [[Audiolock|AudioLock]], Web Sheriff, Topple Track, Detecnet, Muso and Attributor.

==Minimising Online Music Piracy==
There are ways to minimise music piracy on using the latest Google court decisions on the [[right to be forgotten]] as well as using some proven techniques relating to adding a watermark to the tracks and uploading the files yourself with promotional intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mixingmastering.co.uk/music-piracy-how-to-avoid/|title=Music Piracy And How To Avoid It|work=Mixing Mastering Resources for Music, Media and Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper called the '''Music Anti-Piracy Best Practise Guidelines''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicindie.com/resources/document-library|title=Document library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been published by music anti-piracy specialists [http://www.audiolock.net AudioLock] and endorsed by the [[Association of Independent Music]], the Association For Electronic Music (AFEM), [[Digital distribution|music distributors]] Believe Digital and [[Judge Jules]] (DJ and Lawyer). These guidelines give advice on how to minimise exposure to music-piracy and how best to utilise the solutions that are available.

Statistics have shown that since the latter half the 2000s, there has been a decline in music piracy. According to a NPD survey, in 2012, approximately one in ten Internet users in the United States downloaded music through a file sharing service similar to BitTorrent or LimeWire. This number is significantly less than 2005, the peak of the piracy phenomenon, when one in five users used peer-to-peer networks to gather music files. The emergence of free streaming services has decreased the number of users who pirate music on the internet. Services such as [[Spotify]] and [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]] have easy-to-use interfaces and decrease the risk for computer viruses and spyware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luckerson|first1=Victor|title=Revenue Up, Piracy Down: Has the Music Industry Finally Turned a Corner?|url=http://business.time.com/2013/02/28/revenue-up-piracy-down-has-the-music-industry-finally-turned-a-corner/|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=Time Magazine|date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to the illegal software used by older music piracy networks such as Napster or Limewire, current music streaming services such as Spotify and Rdio offer cheap yet legal access to copyrighted music by paying the rights holders through money made off of payments made by premium users and through advertisements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/30081/13-streaming-music-services-compared-by-price-quality-catalog-size-and-more/ | work=Time | title=13 Streaming Music Services Compared by Price, Quality, Catalog Size and More | first=Matt | last=Peckham | date=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acronym, NAME, originally stood for the ''Nuclear Accident ModEl''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=The U.K. nuclear accident model| url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014919709190043O| journal=[[Progress in Nuclear Energy]]| date=1991|issn=0149-1970|pages=85–104| volume=26|issue=2|doi=10.1016/0149-1970(91)90043-O}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Met Office has revised and upgraded the model over the years and it is now used as a general purpose dispersion model. The current version is known as the '''NAME III''' (''Numerical Atmospheric dispersion Modeling Environment'') model. NAME III is currently{{when|date=May 2018}} operational and it will probably completely replace the original NAME model sometimes in 2006.

==Features and capabilities of NAME==

NAME (in its current NAME III version) is a [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Lagrangian]] [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion model]] for short range to global range scales. It employs 3-dimensional meteorological data provided by the Met Office's ''Unified National Weather Prediction Model''. [[Random walk]] techniques using [[empirical]] [[turbulence]] profiles are utilized to represent turbulent mixing. In essence, NAME follows the 3-dimensional trajectories of parcels of the [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|pollution plume]] and computes pollutant concentrations by [[Monte Carlo method]]s — that is, by direct simulation rather than solving equations.&lt;ref name=1996Gazette/&gt;

NAME uses a [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|puff]] technique when modelling dispersion over a short range which shortens the time needed to compute the pollutant concentrations at the receptors.

The model has the capability to calculate: the rise of [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|buoyant plumes]]; deposition of pollution plume components due to rainfall (i.e., [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|wet deposition]]); [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|dry deposition]]; plume chemistry focusing on sulphate and nitrate chemistry; plume depletion via the decay of radioactive materials; the [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|downwash effects]] of buildings.&lt;ref name=MOSAC/&gt;&lt;ref name=1996Gazette/&gt;

The model can also be run 'backwards' to generate maps that locate possible plume originating sources.

==The Met Office's commitments to emergency response service==

The Met Office has international commitments &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EMS2006/00567/EMS2006-A-00567.pdf Met Office Emergency Response Capability]&lt;/ref&gt;  to provide emergency response dispersion modelling services for releases of hazardous gases and materials into the atmosphere. Such events include the release of radioactive materials and emissions from erupting volcanoes. Those commitments are met by an operational group known as EMARC who are supported by a Met Office team of dispersion modelling staff. That team is also responsible for the scientific development of NAME III which, combined with the Met Office numerical weather prediction model, is used to provide the  dispersion modelling services needed to implement the listed commitments:

*The [[WMO]] (''World Meteorological Office'') has designated the Met Office to operate one of the worldwide RSMCs (''Regional Specialist Meteorological Centre'')
*The Met Office has also been designated a [[Volcanic Ash Advisory Center|VAAC]] (''Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre'') which is part of the IAVW (''International Airways Volcano Watch'') set up by the [[ICAO]] (''International Civil Aviation Organization'').

Over the years, NAME has been applied to radioactive releases, the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]], major industrial fires and chemical spills, and two [[Volcanism in Iceland|volcanic eruptions in Iceland]].&lt;ref name=2000Gazette/&gt;

The '''New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities''' states that it is an inter-disciplinary research centre "dedicated to providing the research base for innovative solutions to the economic, social, environmental and cultural development" of New Zealand urban centres. It states "87% of New Zealanders live in cities. The health and well-being of a significant proportion of (New Zealand) population is reliant on developing environments that take into account the connections between transport, design, energy, health and governance and other issues." &lt;ref name="New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities |url= http://sustainablecities.org.nz/|publisher=New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of human nutrition==

===Antiquity===
[[File:Hippocrates pushkin02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Stone sculpture of a man's head|[[Hippocrates]] lived about 400 BC, and Galen and the understanding of nutrition followed him for centuries.]]
The first recorded dietary advice, carved into a [[Babylon]]ian stone tablet in about 2500 BC, cautioned those with pain inside to avoid eating [[onion]]s for three days. [[Scurvy]], later found to be a [[vitamin C deficiency]], was first described in 1500 BC in the [[Ebers Papyrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Profession of Dietetics|author1=Payne-Palacio, June R.  |author2=Canter, Deborah D.|year=2014|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1-284-02608-5|pages=3, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Walter Gratzer]], the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC. In China, the concept of ''[[qi]]'' developed, a spirit or "wind" similar to what Western Europeans later called ''[[pneuma]]''.&lt;ref name=Gratzer40&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Food was classified into "hot" (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and "cold" (green vegetables) in China, India, Malaya, and Persia.&lt;ref name=Gratzer41 /&gt; ''[[Humorism|Humours]]'' developed perhaps first in China alongside ''qi''.&lt;ref name=Gratzer40 /&gt; Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements ([[Wu Xing]]: fire, water, earth, wood, and metal), and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets.&lt;ref name=Gratzer41&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; About the same time in Italy, [[Alcmaeon of Croton]] (a Greek) wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out, and warned that imbalance would result in disease marked by [[obesity]] or [[emaciation]].&lt;ref name=Gratzer36&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded nutritional experiment with human subjects is found in the Bible's [[Book of Daniel]]. Daniel and his friends were captured by the king of [[Babylon]] during an invasion of Israel. Selected as court servants, they were to share in the king's fine foods and wine. But they objected, preferring vegetables ([[Pulse (legume)|pulses]]) and water in accordance with their [[Jewish]] dietary restrictions. The king's chief steward reluctantly agreed to a trial. Daniel and his friends received their diet for ten days and were then compared to the king's men. Appearing healthier, they were allowed to continue with their diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=dan#en-NIV-21743 Daniel 1:5–16]. Biblegateway.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McCollum, Elmer V.|title=A History of Nutrition|publisher=The Riverside Press (Houghton Mifflin)|location=Cambridge, Mass.|year=1957|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 475 BC, [[Anaxagoras]] stated that food is absorbed by the human body and, therefore, contains "homeomerics" (generative components), suggesting the existence of nutrients.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060824032910/http://rcw.raiuniversity.edu/biotechnology/MScBioinformatics/generalnutrition/lecture-notes/lecture-01.pdf ''History of the Study of Nutrition in Western Culture''] (Rai University lecture notes for General Nutrition course, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Around 400 BC, [[Hippocrates]], who recognized and was concerned with obesity, which may have been common in southern Europe at the time,&lt;ref name=Gratzer36 /&gt; said, "Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Let food by thy medicine… | author=Smith, Richard | journal=BMJ |date=24 January 2004| volume=328 | doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7433.0-g | pages=0–g | issue=7433| pmc=318470 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The works that are still attributed to him, ''[[Hippocratic Corpus|Corpus Hippocraticum]]'', called for [[moderation]] and emphasized [[Physical exercise|exercise]].&lt;ref name=Gratzer36 /&gt;

[[File:Galen detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Shoulder high portrait of a man with beard and mustache wearing a cap|Followed for a millennium and a half, [[Galen]] (1st century) created the first coherent (although mistaken) theory of nutrition.&lt;ref name=Gratzer37&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Salt]], [[Black pepper|pepper]] and other spices were prescribed for various ailments in various preparations for example mixed with vinegar. In the 2nd century BC, [[Cato the Elder]] believed that [[cabbage]] (or the urine of cabbage-eaters) could cure digestive diseases, ulcers, warts, and intoxication. Living about the turn of the millennium, [[Celsus|Aulus Celsus]], an ancient Roman doctor, believed in "strong" and "weak" foods (bread for example was strong, as were older animals and vegetables).&lt;ref name=Gratzer37 /&gt;

===Galen to Lind===
One mustn't overlook the doctrines of [[Galen]]: In use from his life in the 1st century AD until the 17th century, it was [[heresy]] to disagree with him for 1500 years.&lt;ref name=Gratzer&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 38, 39, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Galen was physician to gladiators in [[Pergamon]], and in [[Rome]], physician to [[Marcus Aurelius]] and the three emperors who succeeded him.&lt;ref name=Gratzer38&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Galen's teachings were gathered and enhanced in the late 11th century by [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine monks]] at the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|School of Salerno]] in ''[[Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum]]'', which still had users in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Gratzer39&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Galen believed in the bodily ''humours'' of Hippocrates, and he taught that ''pneuma'' is the source of life. [[Classical element|Four elements]] (earth, air, fire and water) combine into "complexion", which combines into states (the [[four temperaments]]: sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic). The states are made up of pairs of attributes (hot and moist, cold and moist, hot and dry, and cold and dry), which are made of [[humorism|four humours]]: blood, phlegm, green (or yellow) bile, and black bile (the bodily form of the elements). Galen thought that for a person to have [[gout]], [[kidney stones]], or [[arthritis]] was scandalous, which Gratzer likens to Samuel Butler's ''[[Erehwon]]'' (1872) where sickness is a crime.&lt;ref name=Gratzer /&gt;
[[File:James lind.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Waist high portrait drawn in pen and ink of a man balancing three books|[[James Lind]] conducted in 1747 the first controlled [[clinical trial]] in modern times, and in 1753 published ''Treatise on Scurvy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Perspectives in Clinical Research|date=January–March 2010|pages=6–10|author=Bhatt, Arun|title=Evolution of Clinical Research: A History Before and Beyond James Lind|pmc=3149409|pmid=21829774|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the 1500s, [[Paracelsus]] was probably the first to criticize Galen publicly.&lt;ref name=Gratzer /&gt; Also in the 16th century, scientist and artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] compared [[metabolism]] to a burning candle. Leonardo did not publish his works on this subject, but he was not afraid of thinking for himself and he definitely disagreed with Galen.&lt;ref name=Gratzer41 /&gt; Ultimately, 16th century works of [[Andreas Vesalius]], sometimes called the father of modern [[Outline of human anatomy|human anatomy]], overturned Galen's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by piercing thought amalgamated with the era's mysticism and religion sometimes fueled by the [[mechanics]] of Newton and Galileo. [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]], who discovered several [[gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]], performed the first [[quantitative research|quantitative experiment]]. [[Robert Boyle]] advanced [[chemistry]]. [[Sanctorius]] measured [[body weight]]. Physician [[Herman Boerhaave]] modeled the [[digestion|digestive process]]. Physiologist [[Albrecht von Haller]] worked out the difference between [[nerve]]s and [[muscle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes forgotten during his life, [[James Lind]], a physician in the British navy, performed the first [[science|scientific]] nutrition experiment in 1747. Lind discovered that [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice saved sailors that had been at sea for years from [[scurvy]], a deadly and painful bleeding disorder. Between 1500 and 1800, an estimated two million sailors had died of scurvy.&lt;ref name=Willett-scurvy&gt;{{cite book|author=Willett, Walter C. with Skerrett, Patrick J.|title=Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide To Healthy Eating|year=2005|origyear=2001|isbn=978-0-684-86337-5|publisher=Free Press (Simon &amp; Schuster)|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery was ignored for forty years, after which British sailors became known as "limeys."&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 21–24, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The essential [[vitamin C]] within citrus fruits would not be identified by scientists until 1932.&lt;ref name=Willett-scurvy /&gt;

===Lavoisier and modern science===
[[File:Lavoisier humanexp.jpg|alt=Black and white engraving of Lavoisier's laboratory, man seated at left with a tube attached to his mouth, man at center conducting experiment, woman seated at right drawing, other people visible|thumb|left|By containing his assistant, [[Armand Seguin]], inside a rubber suit fitted with a tube sealed to his mouth with putty, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] first measured [[basal metabolic rate]].&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing by [[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze|Madame Lavoisier]] (seated at right).]]
Around 1770, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] discovered the details of metabolism, demonstrating that the [[oxidation]] of food is the source of body heat. Called the most fundamental chemical discovery of the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Silberberg, Martin S.|year=2009|title=Chemistry: The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-304859-8|edition=5|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lavoisier discovered the principle of [[conservation of mass]]. His ideas made the [[phlogiston theory]] of [[combustion]] obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, [[George Fordyce]] recognized [[calcium]] as necessary for the survival of fowl. In the early 19th century, the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] were recognized as the primary components of food, and methods to measure their proportions were developed.&lt;ref name="Paul Muljadi"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=dpNGTccTTbEC&amp;pg=PA42 | title=Health | publisher=Paul Muljadi | author=Muljadi, Paul | pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816, [[François Magendie]] discovered that dogs fed only [[carbohydrate]]s (sugar), [[fat]] (olive oil), and [[water]] died evidently of starvation, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying [[protein]] as an essential dietary component.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Prout]] in 1827 was the first person to divide foods into carbohydrates, fat, and protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|title=William Prout (1785–1850):  A Biographical Sketch|author=Ahrens, Richard|date=January 1, 1977|volume=107|issue=1|page=15|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/107/1/15.full.pdf+html|format=PDF|doi=10.1093/jn/107.1.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] and [[Justus von Liebig]] quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants (animal and plant protein are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds).&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; With a reputation as the leading [[organic chemistry|organic chemist]] of his day but with no credentials in [[Physiology|animal physiology]],&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter 1994, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Liebig grew rich making food [[extract]]s like beef [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company|bouillon]] and [[infant formula]] that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 86, 92, 95, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, [[Claude Bernard]] discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood [[glucose]] can be stored as fat or as [[glycogen]].&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Takaki_Kanehiro.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Neck high portrait of middle aged man wearing a military uniform|[[Takaki Kanehiro]] surmised that [[beriberi]] was a nutritional deficiency not an infectious disease.]]
In the early 1880s, [[Kanehiro Takaki]] observed that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice) developed [[beriberi]] (or endemic neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease, (not because of the increased protein as Takaki supposed but because it introduced a few parts per million of [[thiamine]] to the diet, later understood as a cure&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter 1994, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In 1896, [[Eugen Baumann]] observed [[iodine]] in thyroid glands. In 1897, [[Christiaan Eijkman]] worked with natives of [[Java (island)|Java]], who also suffered from beriberi. Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact. His assistant, [[Gerrit Grijns]] correctly identified and described the anti-beriberi substance in rice. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice, discovering that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B1, also known as [[thiamine]].

===From 1900 to the present===
[[File:Carl_von_Voit.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Shoulder high portrait of white haired man with a mustache and beard wearing a suit and bow tie|[[Carl von Voit]] has been called the father of modern dietetics.]]
In the early 20th century, [[Carl von Voit]] and [[Max Rubner]] independently measured [[calorie|caloric]] energy expenditure in different species of animals, applying principles of physics in nutrition.  In 1906, Edith G. Willcock and [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|Frederick Hopkins]] showed that the amino acid [[tryptophan]] aids the well-being of mice but it did not assure their growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Willcock, Edith G. |author2=F.

&lt;div style="float:left;margin-right:1em;width:15em;"&gt;[[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] closed down its nutrition department after World War II because the subject seemed to have been completed between 1912 and 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carpenter, Kenneth J.|title=A Short History of Nutritional Science: Part 4 (1945–1985)|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/133/11/3331.long|date=November 1, 2003|volume=133|issue=11|pages=3331–3342|pmid=14608041|doi=10.1093/jn/133.11.3331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
In 1912, [[Casimir Funk]] coined the term [[vitamin]], a vital factor in the diet, from the words "vital" and "amine," because these unknown substances preventing scurvy, beriberi, and [[pellagra]], were thought then to be derived from ammonia.  The vitamins were studied in the first half of the 20th century.

In 1913, [[Elmer McCollum]] and [[Marguerite Davis]] discovered the first vitamin, fat-soluble [[vitamin A]], then water-soluble [[vitamin B]] (in 1915; now known to be a complex of several water-soluble vitamins) and named [[vitamin C]] as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy. [[Lafayette Mendel]] and [[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Thomas Osborne]] also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B. In 1919, Sir [[Edward Mellanby]] incorrectly identified [[rickets]] as a vitamin A deficiency because he could cure it in dogs with cod liver oil.&lt;ref name=NAS-D&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/beyond-discovery/vitamin-d.pdf|title=Unraveling the Enigma of Vitamin D|author1=Conlan, Roberta|author2=Elizabeth Sherman|year=October 2000|accessdate=June 13, 2016|publisher=National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil, but found that it still cured rickets.&lt;ref name=NAS-D /&gt;  Also in 1922, H.M. Evans and L.S. Bishop discover [[Tocopherol|vitamin E]] as essential for rat pregnancy, originally calling it "food factor X" until 1925.

In 1925, Hart discovered that trace amounts of [[copper]] are necessary for [[iron]] absorption.  In 1927, [[Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus]] synthesized vitamin D, and was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry in 1928. In 1928, [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] isolated [[ascorbic acid]], and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing scurvy. In 1935, he synthesized it, and in 1937, he won a Nobel Prize for his efforts. Szent-Györgyi concurrently elucidated much of the [[citric acid cycle]].

In the 1930s, [[William Cumming Rose]] identified [[essential amino acid]]s, necessary protein components that the body cannot synthesize.  In 1935, Underwood and Marston independently discovered the necessity of [[cobalt]].  In 1936, [[Eugene Floyd DuBois]] showed that work and school performance are related to caloric intake. In 1938, [[Erhard Fernholz]] discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E and then he tragically disappeared.&lt;ref name=NAS&gt;{{cite web|author=Subcommittee on Vitamin Tolerance, Committee on Animal Nutrition, National Research Council|title=Vitamin E, in Vitamin Tolerance of Animals|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=949&amp;page=23|year=1987|publisher= National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=F.B.I.

In 1940, [[rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II]] took place according to nutritional principles drawn up by [[Elsie Widdowson]] and others. In 1941, the first [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDAs) were established by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]].

In 1992, The U.S. Department of Agriculture introduced the [[Food Guide Pyramid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/MyPyramid/OriginalFoodGuidePyramids/FGP/FGPPamphlet.pdf |publisher=United States Department Of Agriculture |title=USDA's Food Guide Pyramid Booklet, 1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824061938/http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/MyPyramid/OriginalFoodGuidePyramids/FGP/FGPPamphlet.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This replaced the [[Four Food Groups]] (1956-1992) and was superseded by the concept of [[MyPlate]] (2011–present).

==Nutrients==
{{Main|Nutrient}}
The list of nutrients that people are known to require is, in the words of [[Marion Nestle]], "almost certainly incomplete".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nestle, Marion|authorlink=Marion Nestle|title=Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health|publisher=University of California Press|page=413|isbn=978-0-520-27596-6|year=2013|origyear=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, nutrients are thought to be of two types: [[macro-nutrient]]s which are needed in relatively large amounts, and [[micronutrient]]s which are needed in smaller quantities.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman /&gt; A type of carbohydrate, [[dietary fiber]], i.e. non-digestible material such as cellulose, is required,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/get-the-facts-on-fiber|title=Get the Facts on Fiber|website=webmd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, although the exact reasons remain unclear. Some nutrients can be stored - the fat-soluble vitamins - while others are required more or less continuously. Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients, or for some vitamins and minerals, too much of a required nutrient.

===Macronutrients===
The macronutrients are [[carbohydrate]]s, [[dietary fiber|fiber]], [[fat]]s, [[protein]], and [[water]].&lt;ref name=Fuhrman /&gt;
The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and [[lipid]]s from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built) and [[Bioenergetics|energy]]. Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in [[Joule]]s or [[calorie|kilocalories]] (often called "Calories" and written with a capital ''C'' to distinguish them from little 'c' calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17&amp;nbsp;kJ approximately (4&amp;nbsp;kcal) of energy per gram, while fats provide 37&amp;nbsp;kJ (9&amp;nbsp;kcal) per gram,&lt;ref name=Stryer&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Berg J, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H. Freeman | edition = 5th | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7167-4684-3 |page= 603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance. Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons.

Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple [[monosaccharide]]s (glucose, fructose and galactose) to complex [[polysaccharide]]s (starch). Fats are [[triglyceride]]s, made of assorted [[fatty acid]] [[monomer]]s bound to a [[glycerol]] backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are [[Essential fatty acid|essential]] in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing [[amino acid]]s, some of which are [[Essential amino acid|essential]] in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production, just as ordinary glucose, in a process known as [[gluconeogenesis]]. By breaking down existing protein, the carbon skeleton of the various amino acids can be metabolized to intermediates in cellular respiration; the remaining ammonia is discarded primarily as urea in urine.

====Carbohydrates====
{{Main|Carbohydrate}}
Carbohydrates may be classified as [[monosaccharide]]s, [[disaccharide]]s, or [[polysaccharide]]s depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They constitute a large part of foods such as [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, [[bread]], and other [[grain]]-based products, also [[potatoes]] , yams, beans, fruits, fruit juices and vegetables.
Monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides contain one, two, and three or more sugar units, respectively. Polysaccharides are often referred to as ''complex'' carbohydrates because they are typically long, multiple branched chains of sugar units.

Traditionally, simple carbohydrates are believed to be absorbed quickly, and therefore to raise blood-glucose levels more rapidly than complex carbohydrates. This, however, is not accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Otto|first=H|title=Diabetik Bei Diabetus Mellitus|year=1973|publisher=Verlag Hans Huber|location=Bern}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crapo|first=P|author2=Reaven, Olefsky |journal=Diabetes|year=1977|volume=26|pages=1178–1183|doi=10.2337/diabetes.26.12.1178|pmid=590639|title=Postprandial plasma-glucose and -insulin responses to different complex carbohydrates|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crapo|first=P |author2=Kolterman, Waldeck |author3=Reaven, Olefsky|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|year=1980|volume=33|pages=1723–1728|pmid=6996472|title=Postprandial hormonal responses to different types of complex carbohydrate in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance|issue=8|doi=10.1093/ajcn/33.8.1723 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=David|author2=Jenkins, Alexandra L. |author3=Wolever, Thomas M.S. |author4= Thompson, Lilian H.  and Rao, A.

=====Fiber=====
{{Main|Dietary fiber}}
Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate that is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially [[plum]]s, [[prune]]s, and [[ficus|figs]]), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as [[constipation]] and [[diarrhea]] by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in [[whole wheat flour]], nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates [[peristalsis]];– the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digest along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of [[type 2 diabetes]]. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain.

====Fat====
{{Main|Fat}}
A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several [[fatty acid]]s (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a [[glycerol]]. They are typically found as [[triglyceride]]s (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as [[saturated fat|saturated]] or [[unsaturated fat|unsaturated]] depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms [[Double bond|double-bonded]], so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as [[omega-3]] or [[omega-6]] fatty acids. [[Trans fat]]s are a type of unsaturated fat with ''trans''-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) [[hydrogenation]].  There are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat. Fatty acids such as [[conjugated linoleic acid]], catalpic acid, eleostearic acid and [[punicic acid]], in addition to providing energy, represent potent immune modulatory molecules.

Saturated fats (typically from animal sources) have been a staple in many world cultures for millennia. Unsaturated fats (e. g., vegetable oil) are considered healthier, while trans fats are to be avoided.  Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as [[butter]] or [[lard]]), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as [[olive oil]] or [[flaxseed oil]]). Trans fats are very rare in nature, and have been shown to be highly detrimental to human health, but have properties useful in the [[food processing]] industry, such as rancidity resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klonoff|first=David C.|date=2016-06-24|year=|title=Replacements for Trans Fats—Will There Be an Oil Shortage?|pmc=2769584|journal=Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology|language=en|volume=1|issue=3|pages=415–422|doi=10.1177/193229680700100316|pmid=19885099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Essential fatty acids ====
{{Main|Essential fatty acids}}
Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are [[essential fatty acid|essential]] and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—[[omega-3]] and [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these "omega" long-chain [[unsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acids]] are [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for a class of [[eicosanoid]]s known as [[prostaglandin]]s, which have roles throughout the human body. They are [[hormone]]s, in some respects. The omega-3 [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 [[linoleic acid]] (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins, which is one reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.

The conversion rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines the production of the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2. Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA). Moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme [[desaturase|delta-5-desaturase]], which in turn is controlled by hormones such as [[insulin]] (up-regulation) and [[glucagon]] (down-regulation). The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of amino acid, can influence processes involving insulin, glucagon, and other hormones; therefore, the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health, and specific effects on immune function and [[inflammation]], and [[mitosis]] (i.e., cell division).

====Protein====
[[File:Myoglobin.png|thumb|right|Proteins are chains of amino acids found in most nutritional foods.]]

{{Main|Protein (nutrient)}}

Proteins are structural materials in much of the animal body (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of [[amino acid]]s, which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the [[keratin]] in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are ''[[essential amino acid|essential]]'' (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are ''[[non-essential amino acid|non-essential]]'' (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential and, therefore, must be included in the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A ''complete'' protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an ''incomplete'' protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids.

It is possible with [[protein combination]]s of two incomplete protein sources (e.g., rice and beans) to make a complete protein source, and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions. However, complementary sources of protein do not need to be eaten at the same meal to be used together by the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=American Dietetic Association|title=Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: Vegetarian diets|journal= JADA|year= 2003|volume= 103|issue=6|pages= 748–765|pmid=12778049|doi=10.1053/jada.2003.50142|last2=Dietitians Of|first2=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excess amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called [[gluconeogenesis]].

====Water====
{{Main|Drinking water}}
[[Image:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|left|A manual [[water]] [[pump]] in [[China]]]]
Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; including [[urine]] and [[feces]], [[sweating]], and by [[water vapour]] in the exhaled breath. Therefore, it is necessary to adequately rehydrate to replace lost fluids.

Early recommendations for the quantity of water required for maintenance of good health suggested that 6–8 glasses of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper [[Tissue hydration|hydration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/healthy_living/nutrition/drinks_water.shtml |title=Healthy Water Living|publisher=BBC.

Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods."&lt;ref&gt;Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sciences. Recommended Dietary Allowances, revised 1945. National Research Council, Reprint and Circular Series, No. 122, 1945 (Aug), pp. 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent comparisons of well-known recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good health.&lt;ref name="Le Bellego"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Le Bellego L, Jean C, Jiménez L, Magnani C, Tang W, Boutrolle I |title= Understanding fluid consumption patterns to improve healthy hydration|journal= Nutr Today|year= 2010|volume=45|issue=6|pages=S22–S26|doi=10.1097/NT.0b013e3181fe4314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, to help standardize guidelines, recommendations for water consumption are included in two recent [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary guidelines and (ii) Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes (ADI).&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water"&gt;{{cite journal|author=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA)|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1459|title=Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for Water|journal=EFSA Journal |year=2010|volume=8|issue=3|page=1459|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/6350877/5.Scientific.pdf}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with “desirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed.”&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water" /&gt;

For healthful hydration, the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water intakes of 2.0 L/day for adult females and 2.5 L/day for adult males. These reference values include water from drinking water, other beverages, and from food. About 80% of our daily water requirement comes from the beverages we drink, with the remaining 20% coming from food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Armstrong LE, Pumerantz AC, Roti MW, Judelson DA, Watson G, Dias JC, Sokmen B, Casa DJ, Maresh CM | year = 2005 | title = Fluid, electrolyte, and renal indices of hydration during 11 days of controlled caffeine consumption | journal = Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 252–65 |pmid=16131696 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Water content varies depending on the type of food consumed, with fruit and vegetables containing more than cereals, for example.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x9892e/x9892e00.htm "FAO Corporate Document Repository. Food Balance Sheets- A Handbook."] Retrieved 2011-03-07&lt;/ref&gt; These values are estimated using country-specific food balance sheets published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;

The EFSA panel also determined intakes for different populations. Recommended intake volumes in the elderly are the same as for adults as despite lower energy consumption, the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity.&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water" /&gt; [[Pregnant]] and [[breastfeeding]] women require additional fluids to stay hydrated. The EFSA panel proposes that pregnant women should consume the same volume of water as non-pregnant women, plus an increase in proportion to the higher energy requirement, equal to 300 mL/day.&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water" /&gt; To compensate for additional fluid output, breastfeeding women require an additional 700 mL/day above the recommended intake values for non-lactating women. Dehydration and over-hydration - too little and too much water, respectively - can have harmful consequences. Drinking too much water is one of the possible causes of [[hyponatremia]], i.e., low serum sodium.&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1770067|title=Fatal water intoxication |journal= Journal of Clinical Pathology | date=October 2003|pmid=14514793|volume=56|issue=10|vauthors=Farrell DJ, Bower L |pages=803–4|doi=10.1136/jcp.56.10.803-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alcohol (ethanol)====
Pure ethanol provides 7 calories per gram. For [[distilled spirit]]s, a standard serving in the United States is 1.5 fluid ounces, which at 40% ethanol (80 proof), would be 14 grams and 98 calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/appendix-9/#footnote2|title=Appendix 9. Alcohol|last=|first=|date=|website=health.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wine and beer contain a similar range of ethanol for servings of 5 ounces and 12 ounces, respectively, but these beverages also contain non-ethanol calories. A 5 ounce serving of wine contains 100 to 130 calories. A 12 ounce serving of beer contains 95 to 200 calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deanofstudents.cua.edu/alcohol/alcohol-facts/nutrition.cfm|title=Alcohol and Nutrition: The Calorie and Carb Breakdown!|last=|first=|date=|website=The Catholic University of America|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based on [[NHANES]] 2013-2014 surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8 grams/day and men consume on average 15.5 grams/day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf "What We Eat in America, NHANES 2013-2014"]&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring the non-alcohol contribution of those beverages, the average ethanol calorie contributions are 48 and 108 cal/day. Alcoholic beverages are considered [[empty calorie]] foods because other than calories, these contribute no essential nutrients.

===Micronutrients===
The micronutrients are [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], [[vitamin]]s, and others.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman&gt;{{cite book|author=Fuhrman, Joel|title=The End of Dieting|publisher=Harper One (Harper Collins)|year=2014|isbn=978-0-06-224932-6|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minerals====
{{Main|Mineral (nutrient)|Composition of the human body}}

Dietary minerals are [[inorganic compounds|inorganic]] [[chemical element]]s required by living organisms,&lt;ref name="Mitchell, Dakota and Haroun, Lee 2012 279"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mitchell, Dakota  |author2=Haroun, Lee|title=Introduction to Health Care|year=2012|edition=3|publisher=Delmar Cengage|isbn=978-1-435-48755-0|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; other than the four elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] that are present in nearly all [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]]. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned, including several [[metal]]s, which often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as [[calcium carbonate]] from ground [[oyster]] shells). Some minerals are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most famous is likely iodine in [[iodized salt]] which prevents [[goiter]].

=====Macrominerals=====
Many elements are essential nutrients called [[dietary minerals]]. Some have roles as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]], while others are [[electrolyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nelson, D. L. |author2=Cox, M.

* [[Calcium]], a common electrolyte, but also needed structurally (for muscle and digestive system health, bone strength, some forms neutralize acidity, provides signaling ions for nerve and membrane functions)
* [[Chloride]]; electrolyte; see sodium, below

* [[Potassium]], an electrolyte (heart and nerve functions)
* [[Sodium]], an electrolyte; common in food and manufactured beverages, typically as [[sodium chloride]]. Excessive sodium consumption can deplete [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/Y2809E/y2809e0k.htm|title=Chapter 14.

=====Trace minerals=====

Many elements are required in trace amounts, usually because they play a [[catalytic]] role in [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref name=lipp&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lippard, S. J.  |author2=Berg, J. M. | title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry | publisher=University Science Books | location=Mill Valley, CA | year=1994|isbn=978-0935702729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trace mineral elements (RDA &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;mg/day) are, in alphabetical order:
* [[Cobalt]] required for biosynthesis of [[vitamin B12]] family of [[coenzyme]]s.  Animals cannot biosynthesize B12, and must obtain this cobalt-containing vitamin in their diet.
* [[Copper]] required component of many redox enzymes, including [[cytochrome c oxidase]] {{main|Copper in health}}
* [[Chromium]] required for sugar metabolism
* [[Iodine]] required not only for the biosynthesis of [[thyroxine]] but also&amp;nbsp;— it is presumed&amp;nbsp;— for other important organs as breast, stomach, salivary glands, thymus, etc. (see Extrathyroidal [[iodine]]); for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list, and sometimes classified with the macrominerals
* [[Iron]] required for many enzymes, and for [[hemoglobin]] and some other proteins
* [[Manganese]] (processing of oxygen)
* [[Molybdenum]] required for [[xanthine oxidase]] and related oxidases
* [[Selenium]] required for [[peroxidase]] (antioxidant proteins)
* [[Zinc]] required for several enzymes such as [[carboxypeptidase]], [[Alcohol dehydrogenase#In humans|liver alcohol dehydrogenase]], and [[carbonic anhydrase]]

====Vitamins====
{{Main|Vitamin}}

Vitamins are essential nutrients,&lt;ref name="Mitchell, Dakota and Haroun, Lee 2012 279"/&gt; necessary in the diet for good health. ([[Vitamin D]] is an exception, as it can be synthesized in the skin in the presence of [[UVB radiation]], and many animal species can synthesize vitamin C.) Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions, including [[goitre]], [[scurvy]], [[osteoporosis]], impaired immune system, disorders of cell metabolism, certain forms of cancer, symptoms of premature aging, and poor [[psychology|psychological health]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Shils, M. S.| year=2005 | title=Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins | isbn=978-0-7817-4133-0|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excess levels of some vitamins are also dangerous to health. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has established Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for seven vitamins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs): Tolerable Upper Intake Levels, Vitamins | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t7/?report=objectonly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phytochemicals==
{{Main|Phytochemical}}
{{See also|List of antioxidants in food}}

Phytochemicals such as [[polyphenol]]s are compounds produced naturally in plants (phyto means "plant" in Greek). In general, the term identifies compounds that are prevalent in plant foods, but are not proven to be essential for human nutrition, as of 2018. There is no conclusive evidence in humans that polyphenols or other non-nutrient compounds from plants confer health benefits, mainly because these compounds have poor [[bioavailability]], i,e., following ingestion, they are digested into smaller [[metabolite]]s with unknown functions, then are rapidly eliminated from the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2871118|year=2010|last1=d'Archivio|first1=M.|title=Bioavailability of the polyphenols: status and controversies|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1321–1342|last2=Filesi|first2=C.|last3=Varì|first3=R.|last4=Scazzocchio|first4=B.|last5=Masella|first5=R.|pmid=20480022|doi=10.3390/ijms11041321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/healthy/eat-healthy-get-active/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/common-questions.html?_ga=2.57358826.1597423548.1542983382-1390869997.1542983382|title=Common questions about diet and cancer|date=5 February 2016|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While initial studies sought to reveal if [[dietary supplement]]s might promote health, one [[meta-analysis]] concluded that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins A and E and beta-carotene did not convey any benefits, and may increase risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bjelakovic G |title=Mortality in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for primary and secondary prevention: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=8 |pages=842–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17327526 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 |last2=Nikolova |first2=D |last3=Gluud |first3=LL |last4=Simonetti |first4=RG |last5=Gluud |first5=C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamin C and selenium supplements did not impact mortality rate.

==Intestinal bacterial flora==
{{Main|Gut flora}}
Animal intestines contain a large population of [[gut flora]]. In humans, the four dominant [[phylum|phyla]] are [[Firmicutes]], [[Bacteroidetes]], [[Actinobacteria]], and [[Proteobacteria]].&lt;ref name="pmid24388028"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khanna S, Tosh PK |title=A clinician's primer on the role of the microbiome in human health and disease |journal=Mayo Clin.

Bacteria in the large intestine perform many important functions for humans, including breaking down and aiding in the absorption of fermentable fiber, stimulating cell growth, repressing the growth of harmful bacteria, training the immune system to respond only to pathogens, producing [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], and defending against some infectious diseases.&lt;ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12489-0 |title=Gut flora in health and disease |year=2003 |last1=Guarner |first1=F |last2=Malagelada |first2=J |journal=The Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9356 |pages=512–9 |pmid=12583961}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Probiotic]]s" refers to the idea of deliberately consuming live bacteria in an attempt to change the bacterial population in the large intestine, to the health benefit of the host human or animal. "[[Prebiotic (nutrition)]]" refers to the idea that consuming a bacterial energy source such as soluble fiber could support the population of health-beneficial bacteria in the large intestine. There is not yet a scientific consensus as to health benefits accruing from probiotics or prebiotics.

==Animal nutrition==
{{main|Animal nutrition|Human nutrition}}

[[Carnivore]] and [[herbivore]] diets are contrasting, with basic [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]] proportions vary for their particular foods. Many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose, while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Geographic Society|title=herbivore|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/herbivore/|website=National Geographic Society|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=en|date=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant nutrition==

{{Main|Plant nutrition}}
Plant nutrition is the study of the [[chemical element]]s that are necessary for plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Plant Nutrition|author1=Allen V. Barker |author2=David J. Pilbeam | page=Preface| publisher=CRC Press, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several principles that apply to plant nutrition. Some elements are directly involved in plant [[metabolism]]. However, this principle does not account for the so-called beneficial elements, whose presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.

A nutrient that is able to limit plant growth according to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]] is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete its full life cycle without it. There are 16 essential plant soil nutrients, besides the three major elemental nutrients carbon and oxygen that are obtained by photosynthetic plants from carbon dioxide in air, and [[hydrogen]], which is obtained from water.

Plants uptake essential elements from the [[soil]] through their [[root]]s and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their [[Leaf|leaves]]. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by [[cation exchange]], wherein [[root hair]]s pump [[hydrogen ion]]s (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) into the soil through [[proton pump]]s. These hydrogen ions displace [[cation]]s attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, [[stomata]] open to take in carbon dioxide and expel [[oxygen]]. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.

Although [[nitrogen]] is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, very few plants can use this directly. Most plants, therefore, require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow. This is made possible by the fact that largely inert atmospheric nitrogen is changed in a [[nitrogen fixation]] process to biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann, W.C. and Glover C.R. (2003) [http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_a/A129/welcome.html Nitrogen Fixation by Legumes]. New Mexico State University/&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely, partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given [[cloning|clone]]. Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms, and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high. Furthermore, deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element, and vice versa.

==Advice and guidance==

===Government policies===
[[Canada's Food Guide]] is an example of a government-run nutrition program. Produced by [[Health Canada]], the guide advises food quantities, provides education on balanced nutrition, and promotes physical activity in accordance with government-mandated nutrient needs. Like other nutrition programs around the world, Canada's Food Guide divides nutrition into four main food groups: vegetables and fruit, grain products, milk and alternatives, and meat and alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170612160554/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/index-eng.php Canada's Food Guide]. Health Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike its American counterpart, the Canadian guide references and provides alternative to meat and dairy, which can be attributed to the growing [[vegan]] and [[vegetarian]] movements.

In the US, nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the [[USDA|US Department of Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]] and these recommendations are published as the [[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]]. Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of [[MyPlate]], which superseded the [[MyPyramid|food pyramid]], which replaced the [[Four Food Groups]]. The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the USDA is the ''Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee''. Committee hearings are often televised on [[C-SPAN]]. The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] provides a sample week-long menu that fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080308032337/http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/sample_menu.pdf Sample Menus for a 2000 Calorie Food Pattern]. mypyramid.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government programs===
Governmental organisations have been working on nutrition literacy interventions in non-primary health care settings to address the nutrition information problem in the U.S. Some programs include:

The Family Nutrition Program (FNP) is a free nutrition education program serving low-income adults around the U.S. This program is funded by the Food Nutrition Service’s (FNS) branch of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) usually through a local state academic institution that runs the program.  The FNP has developed a series of tools to help families participating in the Food Stamp Program stretch their food dollar and form healthful eating habits including nutrition education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guthrie|first=Joanne F.|last2=Stommes|first2=Eileen|last3=Voichick|first3=Jane|date=January–February 2006|title=Evaluating Food Stamp Nutrition Education: Issues and Opportunities|url=https://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046(05)00003-5/fulltext|journal=Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior|volume=38|issue=1|pages=6–11|doi=10.1016/j.jneb.2005.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://web.archive.org/web/20111118025724/http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/food/efnep/efnep.html Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program] (ENFEP) is a unique program that currently operates in all 50 states and in American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia, Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. It is designed to assist limited-resource audiences in acquiring the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and changed behavior necessary for nutritionally sound diets, and to contribute to their personal development and the improvement of the total family diet and nutritional well-being.

An example of a state initiative to promote nutrition literacy is [https://web.archive.org/web/20120221061109/http://www.smartbodies.org/smart-bodies Smart Bodies], a public-private partnership between the state’s largest university system and largest health insurer, Louisiana State Agricultural Center and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana Foundation.  Launched in 2005, this program promotes lifelong healthful eating patterns and physically active lifestyles for children and their families.  It is an interactive educational program designed to help prevent childhood obesity through classroom activities that teach children healthful eating habits and physical exercise.

===Education===
Nutrition is [[Teaching|taught]] in schools in many countries. In [[England and Wales]], the [[Personal and Social Education]] and Food Technology curricula include nutrition, stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging.  In many schools, a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments.  In some American schools, students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes.  Nutrition is offered at many schools, and, if it is not a class of its own, nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as: Life Skills, Independent Living, Single Survival, Freshmen Connection, Health etc.  In many Nutrition classes, students learn about the food groups, the food pyramid, Daily Recommended Allowances, calories, vitamins, minerals, malnutrition, physical activity, healthful food choices, portion sizes, and how to live a healthy life.

A 1985, US [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] report entitled ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'' concluded that nutrition education in medical schools was inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Life Sciences. (1985). ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'', [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=597&amp;page=4 p. 4]. National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 20% of the schools surveyed taught nutrition as a separate, required course. A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adams KM, Lindell KC, Kohlmeier M, Zeisel SH |title=Status of nutrition education in medical schools |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=941S–4S |year=2006 |pmid=16600952 |pmc=2430660 |doi=10.1093/ajcn/83.4.941S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership by physicians in leading professional nutrition societies such as the [[American Society for Nutrition]] has generally declined from the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McClave|first=Stephen A.|last2=Mechanick|first2=Jeffrey I.|last3=Bistrian|first3=Bruce|last4=Graham|first4=Toby|last5=Hegazi|first5=Refaat|last6=Jensen|first6=Gordon L.|last7=Kushner|first7=Robert F.|last8=Merritt|first8=Russell|date=2016-12-01|title=What is the significance of a physician shortage in nutrition medicine?|journal=JPEN.

===Professional organizations===
In the US, [[Dietitian|Registered dietitian nutritionists]] (RDs or RDNs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an RDN and DTR?|url=http://www.eatrightpro.org/resources/about-us/what-is-an-rdn-and-dtr|publisher=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[health professionals]] qualified to provide safe, evidence-based dietary advice which includes a review of what is eaten, a thorough review of nutritional health, and a personalized nutritional treatment plan. They also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places, schools and similar institutions. Certified Clinical [[Nutritionist]]s or CCNs, are trained health professionals who also offer dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic disease, including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaacn.org/ The International &amp; American Associations of Clinical Nutritionist, 2014, Retrieved 2014-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Government regulation especially in terms of licensing, is currently less universal for the CCN than that of RD or RDN. Another advanced Nutrition Professional is a Certified Nutrition Specialist or CNS. These Board Certified Nutritionists typically specialize in [[obesity]] and [[chronic disease]]. In order to become board certified, potential CNS candidate must pass an examination, much like Registered Dieticians. This exam covers specific domains within the health sphere including; Clinical Intervention and Human Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FAQs about CNS Certification – Certification Board for Nutrition Specialists|url = http://cbns.org/faqs-cns-certification/|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition literacy==
The findings of the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) provide a basis upon which to frame the nutrition literacy problem in the U.S. NAAL introduced the first ever measure of "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions"&amp;nbsp;– an objective of Healthy People 2010&lt;ref&gt;Baldi, S. (ED.) et al. (2009). [http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009476 Technical Report and Data File User’s Manual for the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NCES 2009–47)]. U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; and of which nutrition literacy might be considered an important subset. On a scale of below basic, basic, intermediate and proficient, NAAL found 13 percent of adult Americans have proficient health literacy, 44% have intermediate literacy, 29 percent have basic literacy and 14 percent have below basic health literacy. The study found that health literacy increases with education and people living below the level of poverty have lower health literacy than those above it.

Another study examining the health and nutrition literacy status of residents of the lower Mississippi Delta found that 52 percent of participants had a high likelihood of limited literacy skills.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zoellner, J., Connell, C., Bounds, W., Crook, L., Yadrick, K. |year=2009|title= Nutrition Literacy Status and Preferred Nutrition Communications Channels Among Adults in the Lower Mississippi Delta|journal= Preventing Chronic Disease|volume= 6|issue=4|pages=A128|url=https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2009/oct/08_0016.htm|pmid=19755004|pmc=2774642 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While a precise comparison between the NAAL and Delta studies is difficult, primarily because of methodological differences, Zoellner et al. suggest that health literacy rates in the Mississippi Delta region are different from the U.S. general population and that they help establish the scope of the problem of health literacy among adults in the Delta region. For example, only 12 percent of study participants identified the My Pyramid graphic two years after it had been launched by the USDA. The study also found significant relationships between nutrition literacy and income level and nutrition literacy and educational attainment&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; further delineating priorities for the region.

These statistics point to the complexities surrounding the lack of health/nutrition literacy and reveal the degree to which they are embedded in the social structure and interconnected with other problems. Among these problems are the lack of information about food choices, a lack of understanding of nutritional information and its application to individual circumstances, limited or difficult access to healthful foods, and a range of cultural influences and socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education and high levels of poverty that decrease opportunities for healthful eating and living.

The links between low health literacy and poor health outcomes has been widely documented&lt;ref&gt;Berkman N. D., Sheridan, S.L., Donahue, K. E., Halpern, D.J., Viera, A., Crotty, K., … Viswanathan, M. (2011). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK82434/ Health and Literacy Intervention Outcomes: an Updated Systematic Review. Evidence Report/Technology Assessment no. 199]. Prepared by RTI International – University of North Carolina Evidence-based Practice Center. Publication Number 11-E006. Rockville, MD. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is evidence that some interventions to improve health literacy have produced successful results in the primary care setting. More must be done to further our understanding of nutrition literacy specific interventions in non-primary care settings&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; in order to achieve better health outcomes.

==Malnutrition==
{{Main|Malnutrition}}

Malnutrition refers to insufficient, excessive, or imbalanced consumption of nutrients by an organism. In developed countries, the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with nutritional imbalances or excessive consumption. In developing countries, malnutrition is more likely to be caused by poor access to a range of nutritious foods or inadequate knowledge. In [[Mali]], the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) and the [[Aga Khan Foundation]] trained women's groups to make ''equinut'', a healthy and nutritional version of the traditional recipe ''di-dèguè'' (comprising peanut paste, honey and millet or rice flour). The aim was to boost nutrition and livelihoods by producing a product that women could make and sell, and which would be accepted by the local community because of its local heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2013/04/Nourishing-Communities-Through-Holistic-Farming ''Nourishing communities through holistic farming''], Impatient optimists, [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]. April 30th 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insufficient===
The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board sets Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals. EARs and RDAs are part of [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s.&lt;ref name="ods.od.nih.gov"&gt;[https://ods.od.nih.gov/Health_Information/Dietary_Reference_Intakes.aspx]
Nutrient recommendations: Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI).&lt;/ref&gt; The DRI documents describe nutrient deficiency signs and symptoms.

===Excessive===
The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board sets Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. ULs are set a safe fraction below amounts shown to cause health problems. ULs are part of [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s.&lt;ref name="ods.od.nih.gov"/&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] also reviews the same safety questions and set its own ULs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unbalanced===
When too much of one or more nutrients is present in the diet to the exclusion of the proper amount of other nutrients, the diet is said to be unbalanced. High calorie food ingredients such as vegetable oils, sugar and alcohol are referred to as [[Empty calorie|"empty calories"]] because they displace from the diet foods that also contain protein, vitamins, minerals and fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What are empty calories? |website=USDA MyPlate 2011 |url=http://www.choosemyplate.gov/weight-management-calories/calories/empty-calories.html |accessdate=2017-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130125320/http://www.choosemyplate.gov/weight-management-calories/calories/empty-calories.html |archivedate=2014-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processed foods==

{{Main|Food processing}}

Since the [[Industrial Revolution]] some two hundred years ago, the food processing industry has invented many [[technology|technologies]] that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature. Cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled. These latter technologies include [[pasteurisation]], [[autoclavation]], [[drying]], [[salting (food)|salting]], and separation of various components, all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food. Pasteurisation and autoclavation (heating techniques) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods, preventing epidemics of bacterial infection. But some of the (new) food processing technologies have downfalls as well.

Modern separation techniques such as [[Gristmill|milling]], [[centrifugation]], and [[Expeller pressing|pressing]] have enabled concentration of particular components of food, yielding flour, oils, juices, and so on, and even separate fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Inevitably, such large-scale concentration changes the nutritional content of food, saving certain nutrients while removing others. Heating techniques may also reduce food's content of many heat-labile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals, and possibly other yet-to-be-discovered substances.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Audrey |author2=Audia Barnett |author3=Olive-Jean Burrows|title=Effect of Processing on Nutrient Content of Foods|journal=Cajanus|volume=37|issue=3|pages=160–164|year=2004|url=http://www.paho.org/English/CFNI/cfni-caj37No304-art-3.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-26|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of reduced nutritional value, processed foods are often 'enriched' or 'fortified' with some of the most critical nutrients (usually certain vitamins) that were lost during processing. Nonetheless, processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole, fresh foods, regarding content of both sugar and high GI starches, [[potassium]]/[[sodium]], vitamins, fiber, and of intact, unoxidized (essential) fatty acids. In addition,
processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and trans fatty acids.

A dramatic example of the effect of food processing on a population's health is the history of epidemics of [[beri-beri]] in people subsisting on polished rice. Removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential vitamin [[thiamine]], causing beri-beri. Another example is the development of [[scurvy]] among infants in the late 19th century in the United States. It turned out that the vast majority of sufferers were being fed milk that had been heat-treated (as suggested by [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]]) to control bacterial disease. Pasteurisation was effective against bacteria, but it destroyed the vitamin C.

As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world. There is little doubt that the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development. The food processing industry is a major part of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g., nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend. In general, whole, fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus, the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive, but nutritionally superior, whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior, processed foods. Because processed foods are often cheaper, more convenient (in both purchasing, storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition-related health complications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26052">'''Peace economics''' is a specialized branch of [[economics]].  Peace economics focuses on the design of the sociosphere's political, economic, and cultural institutions and their interacting policies and actions with the goal of preventing, mitigating, or resolving violent conflict within and between societies.  This violent conflict could be of any type and could involve either latent or actual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Brauer, Jurgen and Raul Caruso. (2012). "Economists and Peacebuilding." In Roger MacGintry (ed.), Handbook on Peacebuilding. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Presuming knowledge of the cost of violence, it focuses on the benefits of (re)constructing societies&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, John M. (1920). The Economic Consequences of the Peace. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, Kenneth E. (1945). The Economics of Peace. New York: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Del Castillo, Graciana. (2008). Rebuilding War-Torn States: The Challenge of Post-Conflict Economic Reconstruction. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brauer, Jurgen and J. Paul Dunne. (2012). Peace Economics: A Macroeconomic Primer for Violence-Afflicted States. Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with a view toward achieving irreversible, stable [[peace]].&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, Kenneth E. (1978). Stable Peace. Austin, TX: The University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with approaches drawn from disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, psychology and cognitive science, geography and regional science, and political science and international relations, peace economics forms part of peace science, an evolving part of [[peace and conflict studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. (1992). Understanding Conflict and the Science of Peace. Cambridge, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace economics is distinct from both war economics and military economics, even though there may be substantial overlap between these disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Poast, Paul. (2006). The Economics of War. New York: McGraw-Hill Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, Keith and Todd Sandler, eds. (1995). Handbook of Defense Economics. Vol. 1. Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Todd and Keith Hartley. (1995). The Economics of Defense. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ron P. (2009). Military Economics: The Interaction of Power and Money. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;  Peace economics is also distinct from [[conflict economics]],&lt;ref&gt;Hirshleifer, Jack. (2001). The Dark Side of the Force: Economic Foundations of Conflict Theory. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderton, Charles H. and John R. Carter. (2009). Principles of Conflict Economics: A Primer for Social Scientists. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is distinct from security economics.&lt;ref&gt;Brück, Tilman. (2005). "An Economic Analysis of Security Policies." Defense and Peace Economics. Vol. 16, No. 5, pp. 375-389.&lt;/ref&gt; A key difference between peace economics and these related fields is that peace economics emphasizes a study of the presence of peace, as distinct from studying the absence or presence of conflict, violence, war, or insecurity.

==Other definitions==

Peace economics has also been defined as "the use of economics to understand the causes and effects of violent conflict in the international system and the ways that conflict can be avoided, managed, or resolved."&lt;ref&gt;Anderton, Charles H. and John R. Carter. (2007). "A Survey of Peace Economics," pp. 1211-1258 in Todd Sandler and Keith Hartley, eds., Handbook of Defense Economics. Vol. 2. Amsterdam: Elsevier. The quote is from p. 1212.&lt;/ref&gt; This restricts the subject matter to the international realm and leaves out the study of peace itself. [[Walter Isard]] defines peace economics as "generally concerned with: (1) resolution, management or reduction of conflict in the economic sphere, or among behaving units in their economic activity; (2) the use of economic measures and policy to cope with and control conflicts whether economic or not; and (3) the impact of conflict on the economic behavior and welfare of firms, consumers organizations, government and society."&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. (1994). "Peace Economics: A Topical Perspective." Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 11-13. The quote is from p. 11. [A slightly revised reprint of Walter Isard, "Peace Economics" in Douglas Greenwald, Editor in Chief, The McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Economics. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1994, pp. 767-769.]&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of violence is absent and peace itself is not studied, but the level of analysis can be other than conflict between states. In a context restricted to international trade, another author writes that "Peace economics studies ways to eradicate and control conflict as well as to assess conflict's impact on society."&lt;ref&gt;Polachek, Solomon W. (1994). "Peace Economics: A Trade Theory Perspective." Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 2, pp.14-17. The quote is from p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of violence is not explicit and the benefits of peace are seen only inasmuch as a reduction of conflict may improve opportunities for expanded global trade. Others make a distinction between "productive" and "unproductive" or "appropriative" economic activities their starting point of analysis in peace economics.&lt;ref&gt;Haavelmo, Trygve. (1954). A Study in the Theory of Economic Evolution. Amsterdam: North-Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumas, Lloyd J. (1986). The Overburdened Economy: Uncovering the Causes of Chronic Unemployment, Inflation, and National Decline. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baumol, William J. (1990). "Entrepreneurship: Productive, Unproductive, and Destructive." The Journal of Political Economy. Vol. 98, No. 5, Part 1 (October), pp. 893-921.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CarusoRaul"&gt;Caruso, Raul. (2010). "On the Nature of Peace Economics." Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 16, No. 2, Article 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics Nobelist [[Jan Tinbergen]] defines peace economics as "economic science used for [a purpose that] prohibits [war] as an instrument of settling conflicts between nations and [to organize] the world in a way that warfare is punished".&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen Jan. (1994). "What is Peace Economics?" Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 4, pp. 3-5. The quote is from p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence is addressed only at the level of sovereigns, not dealing with civil war or debilitating organized or individual-level criminal violence. In related work, Tinbergen writes about a [[International relations|world order]] that would inhibit violence and permit peace between and among states. In his view, this requires a "world government",&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen Jan. (1994). "What is Peace Economics?" Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 4, pp. 3-5. The quote is from p. 3 as well.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Tinbergen, Jan and Dietrich Fischer (1987). Warfare and Welfare: Integrating Security Policy into Socio-Economic Policy. New York: St. Martin's Press, and Tinbergen Jan. (1990). World Security and Equity. Aldershot, UK: Elgar.&lt;/ref&gt; a sentiment not now commonly agreed among economists. These definitions of peace economics all share [[Johan Galtung]]'s characterization of negative peace (the absence of violent conflict) as opposed to positive peace (the presence of peace-enabling structures).

==Methods, norms, and context==

A number of peace economists are explicit about the use of particular explanatory schema to be applied in peace economics, e.g., [[rational choice theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Dacey, Ray. (1994). "Peace Economics as the Political Economy of Peace and War." Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy. Vol. 2, No. 1, pp.8-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the main definition of peace economics is open to a variety of approaches. Virtually all authors acknowledge that peace economics is part of both [[positive economics]] and [[normative economics]].&lt;ref name="CarusoRaul" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, Kenneth J. (1995). "Some General Observations on the Economics of Peace and War, Peace Economics." Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; While for most contemporary economists, work in positive economics may lead them to lay out a descriptive array or evaluation of [[policy]] choices from which one that is most valued is recommended to or chosen by policy makers, in peace economics, in contrast, it is the norm of peace to be achieved that inspires the search for a system design that can reliably deliver on the desired norm.

Peace economics is built on [[general systems theory]] exemplified by the work of [[Kenneth Boulding]].&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, Kenneth E. (1970). "Economics as a Social Science," pp. 1-22 and "Economics as a Political Science," pp. 77-96, both in Kenneth E. Boulding, Economics as a Science. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth may be viewed as a self-regulating ([[homeostatic]]) system, consisting of natural and social subsystems. In each, deviation from a set goal is self-corrected through feedback loops. Homeostatic systems are commonly observed in nature, such as in ecology and in the physiology of organisms (e.g., self-regulation of population sizes, self-regulation of body heat). The systems concept has been adopted in the engineering sciences, for example in designing thermostats. The user sets a desired goal state (temperature), the instrument measures the actual state, and for a deviation of sufficient degree a corrective action is taken (heating or cooling).

Relatively new is the insight that social systems designed to achieve certain purposes (e.g., the retirement or pension system) imply a [[choice architecture]] that may permit failed or failing social systems to persist. Similarly, choice architecture may facilitate the (re)design of institutions aimed at securing beneficial social outcomes such as peace. This is [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] applied to the problem of peace (peace engineering)&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Dietrich. (1993). Nonmilitary Aspects of Security: A Systems Approach. Brookfield, VT: Dartmouth Publ.&lt;/ref&gt; and overlaps with ideas of [[mechanism design]] (reverse game theory) in which a solution is stipulated a priori and the structure of the game that would bring about the desired outcome is inferred. In this way, system design links back to normative economics.

==Examples==

===Free trade and peace===
[[File:Economic connections between US, EU, China, Russia and India.png|thumb|Economic ties between the US, EU, China, Russia and India (thickness of the lines is proportional to the bilateral trade volume)]]
The classical English liberals of the 19th century largely believed that [[free trade]] promoted peace. This view, attributed to [[Adam Smith]] and [[Edmund Burke]], was evident in the advocacy of [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], and in the writings of the most prominent English economists and political thinkers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Alfred Marshall]]. [[John Maynard Keynes]] said that he was "brought up" on this idea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent 20th century US exponent of this idea was the Secretary of State under President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], [[Cordell Hull]].

===World War I and the Paris Peace Conference===

Upon resigning from the United Kingdom's Treasury team at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in June 1919, [[John Maynard Keynes]] penned a small book. Published in 1920, ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'' famously lays out his case for why the allies' Terms of Peace to be imposed on Germany were physically and financially impossible to fulfill and how they would encourage Germany to rise up again. Predicting a coming World War II, Keynes wrote: "... if this view of nations and of their relation to one another (i.e., a [[Carthaginian peace|Carthaginian Peace]]) is adopted by the democracies of Western Europe, and is financed by the United States, heaven help us all. If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp. Nothing can then delay for very long that final civil war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing, and which will destroy, whoever is victor, the civilisation and the progress of our generation."&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, John M. (1920). The Economic Consequences of the Peace. London: Macmillan. The quote is from p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Keynes' effort to change the treaty terms failed, it is a dramatic demonstration of what peace economics is about: the creation of a mutually reinforcing structure of political, economic, and cultural systems to achieve peace such that reversal to violence is unlikely.

===Capitalism and war, and managed capitalism===
In the 1930s, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]] and with the rise of fascist powers, many western socialist and liberal thinkers believed that capitalism caused war. However, Keynes in his ''General Theory of Enployment, Interest and Money'' in 1936, argued that this need not be so, and that the management of capitalism along the lines he proposed to promote high employment would be more conducive to peace than [[laissez-faire]] capitalism with the [[gold standard]] had been. This analysis underlay his approach during World War II to the creation of institutions for international economic governance in the post-war world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapters 5 &amp; 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II, Bretton Woods, and the Marshall Plan===

Late in World War II, as Nazi-Germany's eventual defeat appeared clear, [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]], then-Secretary of the United States Treasury, advocated the partitioning of Germany, stripping it of its most valuable raw materials and industrial assets, and envisioned the complete pastoralization of Germany. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] agreed to the [[Morgenthau Plan]], in modified form, on 16 September 1944. Following victory, Germany's remaining factories were dismantled, parts, machinery, and equipment shipped abroad, patents expropriated, research forbidden, and useful engineers and scientists transferred out of the country. Despite the negotiation of international treaties at [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] to create a set of complementary global monetary, trade, and reconstruction and development institutions, namely the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (today part of the [[World Bank Group]]), and, separately, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (incorporated in today's [[World Trade Organization]]), Germany's and Europe's other postwar economies collapsed. Keynes' Economic Consequences of the Peace appeared to repeat themselves. However, Roosevelt had died and [[Harry S. Truman]] assumed the U.S. American Presidency on 12 April 1945. Even as the deindustrialization of Germany proceeded as planned, Truman's first Secretary of State, [[James F. Byrnes]], by 1947 took a dismal view of its effects on Germany's impoverished population. So did former president [[Herbert C. Hoover]] in a series of reports penned in 1947. Meanwhile, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union emerged as a formidable power and the implication seemed clear: An economically strengthened, resurgent Germany could either be part of a new Western political, economic, and cultural alliance or else be incorporated into a Soviet one. Truman thus came to abolish the punitive measures imposed on Germany, and his new Secretary of State, General [[George C. Marshall]], formulated what would become the [[Marshall Plan]], in effect from 1948 to 1952. The new global institutions and the unilateral Marshall Plan action combined to endow new institutions with sufficient resources to result in a somewhat unwitting peace economics: clearly designed toward the purpose of international peace and prosperity, yet skewed toward Western Europe and the incipient [[Cold War]]. Moreover, the new social architecture was invested with incentives, such as the [[United Nations Security Council]] that provided five of its members with permanent seats and veto powers, that, while keeping superpower peace, threatened peace and prosperity in the post-colonial [[Third World]].

===Origins of the European Union===

Like Keynes, [[Jean Monnet]] participated in the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, in Monnet's case as an assistant to the French delegation. Like Keynes, he envisioned a pan-European economic cooperation zone. Like Keynes, he would be disappointed. Despite this, the French appreciated his good efforts and awarded him with the post of Deputy Secretary-General of the then newly founded [[League of Nations]]. Monnet was but 31 years old. He resigned four years later to devote himself to international business and finance in private capacity but resurfaced during the early World War II years in positions of high influence in France, Britain, and the United States, urging Roosevelt to get on with an industrial armaments plan. Following World War II, Monnet, however, at first crafted the [[Monnet Plan]] which, similar to Morgenthau's, envisioned the transfer of the German [[Ruhr]] and [[Saarland]] territories, raw materials, and industries (coal and steel) to France to assist it in its own reconstruction. This was approved by French Prime Minister [[Charles de Gaulle]] shortly before his resignation in January 1946. The transfer of the Saar region took place with U.S. help in 1947, while the Ruhr region was placed under an international authority in 1949 that assured France access to German coal at low prices. This led to rising frictions between Germany and the allies, just as Keynes had foretold 30 years earlier.

Monnet changed course and, together with Paul Reuter, Bernard Clappier, Pierre Uri, and Étienne Hirsch, plans were crafted that resulted in the [[Schuman Declaration]] of 9 May 1950, celebrated today as [[Europe Day]] or Schuman Day. [[Robert Schuman]], the Franco-German-Luxembourgian statesman, French Minister of Finance, Minister of Foreign Affairs and two-time Prime Minister of France, envisioned, first, a Franco-German and, then, a pan-European sharing of crucial coal and steel resources among Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg that would make future war "not only unthinkable but materially impossible."&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of 9 May 1950." http://www.robert-schuman.eu/declaration_9mai.php. (Retrieved on 14 February 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1951, this resulted in the formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), the forerunner to today's [[European Union]]. In contrast to the negotiations surrounding the founding of the [[United Nations]] and a set of associated organizations in 1945, the European idea appears to have been deliberately designed as a kernel with organic growth-potential, the precise development of which would be learned in future. Thus, no institutional structures were put in place that, due to accrued vested interests, would later prove to be too difficult to change.

===Current research directions===

War at the interstate level has subsided and, to a degree, so have the massive civil wars that took place in the immediate Post-Cold War period (especially in Africa in the 1990s and 2000s).&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2009/2010. Human Security Report Project. http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/20092010/overview.aspx (Retrieved 14 February 2012.) For longer-term trends, see Steven Pinker, ''The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has Declined '' (New York: Viking, 2011) and literature cited therein.&lt;/ref&gt; But violent conflict takes place at many levels, from self-directed harm (e.g., self-injury and [[suicide]]) and [[domestic violence]] between intimate partners and family members to [[workplace violence]] and [[Organized crime|organized criminal violence]], all of which are massively costly and ultimately require positive, structural solutions whereby resort to violence becomes "unthinkable," even as it may remain "materially possible."

The [[Institute for Economics and Peace]], a think tank with offices in Sydney, New York, and Mexico City, is "developing metrics to analyse peace and to quantify its economic value. It does this by developing global and national indices, calculating the economic cost of violence, analysing country level risk and understanding positive peace." &lt;ref&gt;http://economicsandpeace.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erddig Mortar making machine - geograph.org.uk - 351058.jpg|thumb|An old fashioned type of pug mill in Wales. Attribution: Betty Longbottom, geograph.org.uk - 351058]]
A '''pugmill''' or '''pug mill''' is a machine in which clay or other materials are mixed into a plastic state or a similar machine for the [[trituration]] of ore.&lt;ref&gt;"Pug-mill" def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009 &lt;/ref&gt; Industrial applications are found in [[pottery]], [[brick]]s, [[cement]] and some parts of the [[concrete]] and [[asphalt]] mixing processes. A pugmill may be a fast continuous mixer. A continuous pugmill can achieve a thoroughly mixed, homogeneous mixture in a few seconds, and the right machines can be matched to the right application by taking into account the factors of agitation, drive assembly, inlet, discharge, cost and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bulk-solids-handling.com/?q=topics/processing/mixing-blending/pugmill-mixer-selection-guide {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101542/http://www.bulk-solids-handling.com/?q=topics%2Fprocessing%2Fmixing-blending%2Fpugmill-mixer-selection-guide |date=2015-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixing materials at optimum moisture content requires the forced mixing action of the pugmill paddles, while soupy materials might be mixed in a drum mixer. A typical pugmill consists of a horizontal boxlike chamber with a top inlet and a bottom discharge at the other end, 2 shafts with opposing paddles, and a drive assembly. Some of the factors affecting mixing and residence time are the number and the size of the paddles, paddle swing arc, overlap of left and right swing arc, size of mixing chamber, length of pugmill floor, and material being mixed.

==Common construction and industrial uses==

Road Base - Dense well-graded aggregate, uniformly mixed, wetted, and densely compacted for building the foundation under a pavement.

Lime Addition to asphalt – Lime may be added to the cold feed of an [[asphalt plant]] to strengthen the binding properties of the asphalt.

Flyash Conditioning – Wetting [[fly ash]] in a pugmill to stabilize the ash so that it won’t create dust. Some flyashes have cementitious properties when wetted and can be used to stabilize other materials.

Waste stabilization – various waste streams are remediated with pugmills forcing the mixing of the wastes with remediation agents.

[[Roller-compacted concrete]] – (RCC) or rolled concrete is a special blend of concrete that has the same ingredients as conventional concrete but in different ratios. It has cement, water, and aggregates, but RCC is much drier and essentially has no slump. RCC is placed in a manner similar to paving, often by dump trucks or conveyors, spread by bulldozers or special modified asphalt pavers. After placement it is compacted by vibratory rollers.  
The “stiff” nature of RCC may require a paddle type pugmill to force the materials to mix completely and discharge easily.

[[Ceramic]]s pug mills, or commonly just "pugs", are not used to grind or mix, rather they extrude clay bodies prior to shaping processes. Some can be fitted with a vacuum system that ensures the extruded clay bodies have no entrapped air. According to the 1913 edition of [[Webster's Dictionary]], a clay pug mill typically consists of an upright shaft armed with projecting knives, which is caused to revolve in a hollow cylinder, tub, or vat, in which the clay body is placed.

Pugmills that run intermittently are used in the [[kaolin]] mining industry to mix certain grades of [[kaolin]] clay with water.

'''Pulhamite''' was a [[patented]] [[anthropic rock]] material invented by James Pulham (1820–98) of the firm [[James Pulham and Son]] of [[Broxbourne]] in [[Hertfordshire]].

Pulhamite, which usually looked like gritty [[sandstone]],  was used to join natural rocks together or crafted to simulate natural stone features. It was so realistic that it fooled some geologists of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gardens and Landscapes in Historic Building Conservation|page=460|author=Marion Harney|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2014|isbn=1118508130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recipe went to the grave with him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulham.org.uk/ The Pulham Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern analysis of surviving original Pulhamite have shown it to be a blend of sand,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7293">{{Distinguish|Richter magnitude scale}}

The '''Riddle scale''' (also known as ''Riddle homophobia scale'' or ''Riddle scale of homophobia'') was a [[psychometric]] [[Scale (social sciences)|scale]] that measured the degree to which a person is or is not [[homophobic]]. The scale was frequently used in tolerance education about [[anti-discriminatory]] attitudes regarding [[sexual orientation]]. It is named after its creator, psychologist [[Dorothy Riddle]].

==Overview==
The Riddle homophobia scale was developed by [[Dorothy Riddle]] in 1973–74 while she was overseeing research for the [[American Psychological Association]] Task Force on Gays and Lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silgbtcenter.org/ Staten Island LGBT history] Staten Island LGBT Community Center, Accessed Dec. 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The scale was distributed at talks and workshops but was not formally published for a long time; it is cited in the literature either as an (unpublished) conference presentation from 1985&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, D. I. (1985). Homophobia scale. ''Opening doors to understanding and acceptance: A facilitator’s guide for presenting workshops on lesbian and gay issues'', Workshop organized by Kathy Obear and Amy Reynolds, Boston. Unpublished essay.&lt;/ref&gt; or as an article from 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, D., (1994). The Riddle scale. ''Alone no more: Developing a school support system for gay, lesbian and bisexual youth.'' St Paul: Minnesota State Department.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was developed, Riddle's analysis was one of the first modern classifications of attitudes towards homosexuality.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In that respect, the scale has served the purpose that Riddle originally had in mind: she devised the scale to explicate the continuum of attitudes toward gays and lesbians and to assess the current and desired institutional culture of an organization or a work place.&lt;ref&gt;Peterkin, A. Risdon, C., (2003). ''Caring for lesbian and gay people: A clinical guide.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Level of measurement==
The Riddle scale is an eight-term uni-[[dimension]]al [[Likert scale|Likert]]-type [[Level of measurement#Interval scale|interval scale]] with nominal labels and no explicit [[Origin (mathematics)|zero point]]. Each term is associated with a set of attributes and beliefs; individuals are assigned a position on the scale based on the attributes they exhibit and beliefs they hold.

The scale is frequently divided into two parts, the 'homophobic levels of attitude' (first four terms) and the 'positive levels of attitude' (last four terms).&lt;ref&gt;Clauss-Ehlers, C. S. (ed), (2010). ''Encyclopedia of Cross-Cultural School Psychology''. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The scale==
*'''Repulsion''': Homosexuality is seen as a crime against nature. Gays/lesbians are considered sick, crazy, immoral, sinful, wicked, etc. Anything is justified to change them: [[incarceration]], [[hospital]]ization, [[Reparative therapy|behavior therapy]], [[electroconvulsive therapy]], etc.
*'''Pity''': Represents heterosexual [[chauvinism]]. Heterosexuality is considered more mature and certainly to be preferred. It is believed that any possibility of becoming straight should be reinforced, and those who seem to be born that way should be pitied as less fortunate ("the poor dears").
*'''Tolerance''': Homosexuality is viewed as a phase of adolescent development that many people go through and most people grow out of. Thus, lesbians/gays are less mature than straights and should be treated with the protectiveness and indulgence one uses with children who are still maturing. It is believed that lesbians/gays should not be given positions of authority because they are still working through their adolescent behavior.
*'''Acceptance''': Still implies that there is something to accept; the existing climate of discrimination is ignored. Characterized by such statements as "You're not lesbian to me, you're a person!" or "What you do in bed is your own business." or "That's fine with me as long as you don't flaunt it!"
*'''Support''': People at this level may be uncomfortable themselves, but they are aware of the homophobic climate and the irrational unfairness, and work to safeguard the rights of lesbians and gays.
*'''Admiration''': It is acknowledged that being lesbian/gay in our society takes strength.  People at this level are willing to truly examine their homophobic attitudes, values, and behaviors.
*'''Appreciation''': The diversity of people is considered valuable and lesbians/gays are seen as a valid part of that diversity. People on this level are willing to combat homophobia in themselves and others.
*'''Nurturance''': Assumes that gay/lesbian people are indispensable in our society. People on this level view lesbians/gays with genuine affection and delight, and are willing to be their allies and advocates.

==Discussion==
Riddle's analysis has been credited for pointing out that although 'tolerance' and 'acceptance' can be seen as positive attitudes, they should actually be treated as negative because they can mask underlying fear or hatred (somebody can tolerate a baby crying on an airplane while at the same time wishing that it would stop) or indicate that there is indeed something that we need to accept, and that we are the ones with the power to reject or to accept.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld W. J. (2000). How homophobia hurts everyone. ''Readings for diversity and social justice''. New York: Routledge, 267–275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ollis, D., (2004). I’m just a home economics teacher. Does discipline background impact on teachers’ ability to affirm and include [[gender and sexual diversity]] in secondary school health education programs? ''AARE Conference'', Melbourne 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This observation generalizes to attitude evaluations in other areas besides sexual orientation and is one of the strengths of Riddle's study.

Although it deals mostly with adult attitudes towards difference, the model has been positioned in the cognitive developmental tradition of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg's]] [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirscheld, S., (2001).

'''Risk score''' (or '''risk scoring''') is the name given to a general practice in applied [[statistics]], [[Biostatistics|bio-statistics]], [[econometrics]] and other related disciplines, of creating an easily calculated number (the '''score''') that reflects the level of [[risk]] in the presence of some [[risk factor]]s (e.g. risk of mortality or disease in the presence of symptoms or genetic profile, risk financial loss considering credit and financial history, etc.). 

Risk scores are designed to be: 
* Simple to calculate: In many cases all you need to calculate a score is nothing a pen and a piece of paper (although [[QRISK|some]] scores use rely on more sophisticated or less transparent calculations that require a computer program).
* Easily interpreted: The result of the calculation is a single number, and higher score usually means higher risk. Furthermore, many scoring methods enforce some form of [[Monotonic_function|monotonicity]] along the measured risk factors to allow a straight forward interpretation of the score (e.g. risk of mortality only increases with age, risk of payment default only increase with the amount of total debt the customer has, etc.).
* Actionable: Scores are designed around a set of possible actions that should be taken as a result of the calculated score. Effective score-based policies can be designed and executed by setting thresholds on the value of the score and associating them with escalating actions. 

== Formal definition == 
A typical scoring method is composed of 3 components:
# A set of consistent rules (or weights) that assign a numerical value ("points") to each risk factor that reflect our estimation of underlying risk.
# A formula (typically a simple sum of all accumulated points) that calculates the score.
# A set of thresholds that helps to translate the calculated score into a level of risk, or an equivalent formula or set of rules to translate the calculated score back into probabilities (leaving the nominal evaluation of severity to the practitioner0.

Items 1 &amp; 2 can be achieved by using some form of [[Regression_analysis|regression]], that will provide both the risk estimation and the formula to calculate the score. Item 3 requires setting an arbitrary set of thresholds and will usually involve expert opinion. 

=== Estimating risk with GLM ===
Risk score are designed to represent an underlying probability of an adverse event denoted &lt;math&gt; \lbrace Y = 1 \rbrace &lt;/math&gt; given a vector of &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; [[explaining variables]] &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt; containing measurements of the relevant risk factors. In order to establish the connection between the risk factors and the probability we estimate a set of weights &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is estimated using a [[generalized linear model]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}(\mathbf{Y} | \mathbf{X}) = \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{Y} = 1 | \mathbf{X}) = g^{-1}(\mathbf{X} \beta)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued, monotonically increasing function that maps the values of the  [[Generalized_linear_model#Linear_predictor|linear predictor]] &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} \beta &lt;/math&gt; to the interval &lt;math&gt; [0,1] &lt;/math&gt;. GLM methods typically uses the [[logit]] or [[probit]] as the [[Generalized_linear_model#Link_function|link function]].

==== Estimating risk with other methods ====
While it's possible to estimate &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{Y} = 1 | \mathbf{X}) &lt;/math&gt; using other statistical or machine learning methods, the requirements of simplicity and easy interpretation (and monotonicity per risk factor) make most of these methods difficult to use for scoring in this context:
* With more sophisticated methods it becomes difficult to attribute simple weights for each risk factor and to provide a simple formula for the calculation of the score. A notable exception are tree-based methods like [[Classification_and_regression_tree|CART]], that can provide a simple set of decision rules and calculations, but cannot ensure the monotonicity of the scale across the different risk factors.
* The fact that we are estimating underlying risk across the population, and therefore cannot tag people in advance on an ordinal scale (we can't know in advance if a person belongs to a "high risk" group, we only see observed incidences) [[Statistical_classification|classification]] methods are only relevant if we want to classify people into 2 groups or 2 possible actions. 

=== Constructing the score ===
When using GLM, the set of estimated weights &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; can be used to assign different values (or "points") to different values of the risk factors in &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt; (continuous or nominal as indicators). The score can then be expressed as a weighted sum:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{Score} = \mathbf{X} \beta = \sum_{j=1}^{P} \mathbf{X}_{j} \beta_{j}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

* While some scoring methods use the values of the score "as is", some scoring methods (e.g. [[ABCD²_score|ABCD²]] score) will translate the score into probabilities by using &lt;math&gt; g^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; or a look-up table. This makes the process of obtaining the score more complicated computationally but has the advantage of translating an arbitrary number to a more familiar scale of 0 to 1.
* The columns of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt; can represent complex transformations of the risk factors (including multiple [[Interaction_(statistics)|interactions]]) and not just the risk factors themselves.
* The values of &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; are sometimes scaled or rounded to allow working with integers instead of very small fractions (making the calculation simpler). While scaling has no impact ability of the score to estimate risk, rounding has the potential of disrupting the "optimality" of the GLM estimation. 

=== Making score-based decisions ===
Let &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \lbrace \mathbf{a}_{1}, ... ,\mathbf{a}_{m} \rbrace &lt;/math&gt; denote a set of &lt;math&gt; m \geq 2 &lt;/math&gt; "escalating" actions available for the decision maker (e.g. for credit risk decisions:  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_{1} &lt;/math&gt; = "approve automatically", &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_{2} &lt;/math&gt; = "require more documentation and check manually", &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_{3} &lt;/math&gt; = "decline automatically"). In order to define a decision rule, we want to define a map between different values of the score and the possible decisions in &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt; \tau = \lbrace \tau_1, ... \tau_{m-1} \rbrace &lt;/math&gt; be a [[Partition_of_an_interval|partition]] of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; consecutive, non-overlapping intervals, such that &lt;math&gt; \tau_1 &lt; \tau_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; \tau_{m-1} &lt;/math&gt;. 

The map is defined as follows: 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{If Score} \in [\tau_{j-1},\tau_{j}) \rightarrow \text{Take action } \mathbf{a}_{j}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

* The values of &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; are set based on expert opinion, the type and prevalence of the measured risk, consequences of miss-classification, etc. For example, a risk of 9 out of 10 will usually be considered as "high risk", but a risk of 7 out of 10 can be considered either "high risk" or "medium risk" depending on context. 
* The definition of the intervals is on right open-ended intervals but can be equivalently defined using left open ended intervals &lt;math&gt; (\tau_{j-1},\tau_{j}] &lt;/math&gt;.
* For scoring methods that are already translated the score into probabilities we either define the partition &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; directly on the interval &lt;math&gt; [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; or translate the decision criteria into &lt;math&gt; [g^{-1}(\tau_{j-1}),g^{-1}(\tau_{j})) &lt;/math&gt;, and the monotonicity of &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; ensures a 1-to-1 translation.

== Examples ==
=== Biostatistics ===
Some notable examples, taken from the category page [[:Category:Medical_scoring_system]]:
* [[Framingham Risk Score]]
* [[QRISK]]
* [[TIMI]]
* [[Rockall score]]
* [[ABCD² score]]
* [[CHA2DS2–VASc score]]

=== Financial industry ===
The primary use of scores in the financial sector is for [[Credit scorecards]], or [[Credit_score|credit scores]]: 
* In many countries (such as the [[Credit_score_in_the_United_States|US]]) credit score are calculated by commercial entities and therefore the exact method is not public knowledge (for example the [[Bankruptcy risk score]], [[Credit_score_in_the_United_States#FICO_score|FICO score]] and others). Credit scores in [[Credit_score#Australia|Australia]] and [[Credit_score#United_Kindgom|UK]] are often calculated by using [[Logistic_Regression|logistic regression]] to estimate [[probability of default]], and are therefore a type of risk score.
* Other financial industries, such as the [[Insurance_score|insurance]] industry also use variants of credit score.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16019">'''Saltwater intrusion''' is the movement of [[saline water]] into [[freshwater]] [[aquifer]]s, which can lead to contamination of [[drinking water]] sources and other consequences. Saltwater intrusion occurs naturally to some degree in most [[coast]]al aquifers, owing to the [[hydraulic]] connection between [[groundwater]] and [[seawater]]. Because saline water has a higher mineral content than freshwater, it is denser and has a higher water pressure. As a result, saltwater can push inland beneath the freshwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain human activities, especially groundwater pumping from coastal freshwater [[water well|wells]], have increased saltwater intrusion in many coastal areas. Water extraction drops the level of fresh groundwater, reducing its water pressure and allowing saltwater to flow further inland. Other contributors to saltwater intrusion include [[navigation channel]]s or agricultural and [[drainage channel]]s, which provide conduits for saltwater to move inland, and it can also make [[sea level rise]].&lt;ref name=Barlow2003&gt;{{cite web

==Hydrology==
[[image:Salt water intrusion wikipedia2.png|thumb|600px|Cause and Impact of Saltwater Intrusion]]
At the coastal margin, fresh groundwater flowing from inland areas meets with saline groundwater from the ocean. The fresh groundwater flows from inland areas towards the coast where elevation and groundwater levels are lower.&lt;ref name="Barlow2003"/&gt;  Because saltwater has a higher content of [[Total dissolved solids|dissolved salts and minerals]], it is denser than freshwater, causing it to have higher [[hydraulic head]] than freshwater. Hydraulic head refers to the liquid pressure exerted by a water column: a water column with higher hydraulic head will move into a water column with lower hydraulic head, if the columns are connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher pressure and density of saltwater causes it to move into coastal aquifers in a wedge shape under the freshwater. The saltwater and freshwater meet in a transition zone where mixing occurs through [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] and [[diffusion]]. Ordinarily the inland extent of the saltwater wedge is limited because fresh groundwater levels, or the height of the freshwater column, increases as land elevation gets higher.&lt;ref name="Barlow2003"/&gt;

==Causes==

===Groundwater extraction===
[[Water abstraction|Groundwater extraction]] is the primary cause of saltwater intrusion. Groundwater is the main source of drinking water in many coastal areas of the United States, and extraction has increased over time. Under baseline conditions, the inland extent of saltwater is limited by higher pressure exerted by the freshwater column, owing to its higher elevation. Groundwater extraction can lower the level of the [[water table|freshwater table]], reducing the pressure exerted by the freshwater column and allowing the denser saltwater to move inland laterally.&lt;ref name="Barlow2003"/&gt; In [[Cape May, New Jersey]], since the 1940s water withdrawals have lowered groundwater levels by up to 30 meters, reducing the water table to below sea level and causing widespread intrusion and contamination of [[water supply]] wells.&lt;ref name=Lacombe&amp;Carleton2002&gt;{{cite web

   |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010
  |accessdate=2012-12-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groundwater extraction can also lead to well contamination by causing upwelling, or upcoming, of saltwater from the depths of the aquifer.&lt;ref name=Reilly&amp;Goodman1987&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reilly, T.E.  |author2=Goodman, A.S.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Analysis of saltwater upconing beneath a pumping well |journal=Journal of Hydrology |volume=89 |year=1987 |pages=169–204 |doi=10.1016/0022-1694(87)90179-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under baseline conditions, a saltwater wedge extends inland, underneath the freshwater because of its higher density. Water supply wells located over or near the saltwater wedge can draw the saltwater upward, creating a saltwater cone that might reach and contaminate the well. Some aquifers are predisposed towards this type of intrusion, such as the [[Floridan aquifer|Lower Floridan aquifer]]: though a relatively [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impermeable]] rock or clay layer separates fresh groundwater from saltwater, isolated cracks breach the confining layer, promoting upward movement of saltwater. Pumping of groundwater strengthens this effect by lowering the water table, reducing the downward push of freshwater.&lt;ref name="Barlow&amp;Reichard2010"/&gt;

===Canals and drainage networks===
The construction of [[canal]]s and [[drainage]] networks can lead to saltwater intrusion. Canals provide conduits for saltwater to be carried inland, as does the deepening of existing [[Channel (geography)|channels]] for [[navigation]] purposes.&lt;ref name="Barlow2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Good_etal1995&gt;{{cite web |format=pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sabine Lake]] Estuary in the Gulf of Mexico, large-scale waterways have allowed saltwater to move into the lake, and upstream into the rivers feeding the lake. Additionally, channel dredging in the surrounding wetlands to facilitate oil and gas drilling has caused land [[subsidence]], further promoting inland saltwater movement.&lt;ref name=SRAofTexas&gt;{{cite web

Drainage networks constructed to drain flat coastal areas can lead to intrusion by lowering the freshwater table, reducing the water pressure exerted by the freshwater column. Saltwater intrusion in southeast Florida has occurred largely as a result of drainage canals built between 1903 into the 1980s to drain the [[Everglades]] for agricultural and urban development. The main cause of intrusion was the lowering of the water table, though the canals also conveyed seawater inland until the construction of water control gates.&lt;ref name="Barlow&amp;Reichard2010"/&gt;

==Effect on water supply==
Many coastal communities around the United States are experiencing saltwater contamination of water supply wells, and this problem has been seen for decades.&lt;ref name=Todd1960&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences of saltwater intrusion for supply wells vary widely, depending on extent of the intrusion, the intended use of the water, and whether the salinity exceeds standards for the intended use.&lt;ref name="Barlow2003"/&gt; In some areas such as Washington State, intrusion only reaches portions of the aquifer, affecting only certain water supply wells. Other aquifers have faced more widespread salinity contamination, significantly affecting groundwater supplies for the region. For instance, in [[Cape May, New Jersey]], where groundwater extraction has lowered water tables by up to 30 meters, saltwater intrusion has caused closure of over 120 water supply wells since the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Barlow&amp;Reichard2010"/&gt;

==Ghyben–Herzberg relation==
The first physical formulations of saltwater intrusion were made by W. Badon-Ghijben (1888, 1889) and  A. Herzberg (1901), thus called the Ghyben–Herzberg relation.&lt;ref name=Verrjuit1968&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Saltwater Intrusion.gif]]&lt;ref name=Barlow2003/&gt;

The figure shows the Ghyben–Herzberg relation. In the equation, &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt; z = \frac{ \rho_f} {(\rho_s-\rho_f)} h&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; the thickness of the freshwater zone above sea level is represented as &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and that below sea level is represented as &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The two thicknesses &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, are related by &lt;math&gt;\rho_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\rho_f&lt;/math&gt; is the density of freshwater and &lt;math&gt;\rho_s &lt;/math&gt; is the density of saltwater. Freshwater has a density of about 1.000 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) at 20&amp;nbsp;°C, whereas that of seawater is about 1.025 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The equation can be simplified to &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;z\ = 40 h&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Barlow2003/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Ghyben–Herzberg ratio states, for every foot of fresh water in an unconfined aquifer above sea level, there will be forty feet of fresh water in the aquifer below sea level.

In the 20th century the vastly increased [[computer|computing]] power available allowed the use of numerical methods (usually [[finite difference]]s or [[finite elements]]) that need fewer assumptions and can be applied more generally.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Modeling==
Modeling of saltwater intrusion is considered difficult. Some typical difficulties that arise are:

* The possible presence of [[fissures]] and cracks and fractures in the aquifer, whose precise positions are unknown but which have great influence on the development of the saltwater intrusion
* The possible presence of small scale heterogeneities in the hydraulic properties of the aquifer, which are too small to be taken into account by the model but which may also have great influence on the development of the saltwater intrusion
* The change of hydraulic properties by the saltwater intrusion. A mixture of saltwater and freshwater is often undersaturated with respect to calcium, triggering [[solvation|dissolution]] of calcium in the mixing zone and changing hydraulic properties.
* The process known as [[Ion exchange|cation exchange]], which slows the advance of a saltwater intrusion and also slows the retreat of a saltwater intrusion.
* The fact that saltwater intrusions are often not in equilibrium makes it harder to model. Aquifer dynamics tend to be slow and it takes the intrusion cone a long time to adapt to changes in pumping schemes, rainfall, etc. So the situation in the field can be significantly different from what would be expected based on the sea level, pumping scheme etc.
* For long-term models, the future [[climate change]] forms a large unknown. Model results often depend strongly on sea level and recharge rate. Both are expected to change in the future.

Saltwater  is also an issue where a [[Canal lock|lock]] separates saltwater from freshwater (for example the [[Hiram M. Chittenden Locks]] in Washington). In this case a collection basin was built from which the saltwater can be pumped back to the sea. Some of the intruding saltwater is also pumped to the [[fish ladder]] to make it more attractive to migrating [[fish]].&lt;ref name=Mausshardt1995&gt;{{cite journal

'''Sea surface temperature''' (SST) is the water [[temperature]] close to the [[ocean]]'s surface. The exact meaning of ''surface'' varies according to the measurement method used, but it is between {{convert|1|mm|in|sigfig=1}} and {{convert|20|m|ft|sigfig=1}} below the [[sea]] surface.  [[Air mass]]es in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] are highly modified by sea surface temperatures within a short distance of the shore.  Localized areas of heavy [[snow]] can form in [[rainband|bands]] downwind of warm water bodies within an otherwise cold air mass.  Warm sea surface temperatures are known to be a cause of [[tropical cyclogenesis]] over the [[Earth]]'s oceans.  Tropical cyclones can also cause a cool wake, due to turbulent mixing of the upper {{convert|30|m|ft|sigfig=1}} of the ocean.  SST changes diurnally, like the air above it, but to a lesser degree. There is less SST variation on breezy days than on calm days.  In addition, [[ocean current]]s such as the [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]] (AMO), can effect SST's on multi-decadal time scales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-05-global-climate-verge-multi-decadal.html|doi=10.1038/nature14491|authors=Gerard D. McCarthy, Ivan D. Haigh, Joël J.M. Hirschi, Jeremy P. Grist &amp; David A. Smeed|date=27 May 2015|journal=Nature|title=Ocean impact on decadal Atlantic climate variability revealed by sea-level observations|bibcode = 2015Natur.521..508M|volume=521|pages=508–510|pmid=26017453}}&lt;/ref&gt; a major impact results from the global [[thermohaline]] circulation, which affects average SST significantly throughout most of the world's oceans.

'''Ocean temperature''' is related to [[ocean heat content]], an important topic in the debate over [[global warming]]. 

Coastal SSTs can cause offshore winds to generate [[upwelling]], which can significantly cool or warm nearby landmasses, but shallower waters over a [[continental shelf]] are often warmer.  Onshore winds can cause a considerable warm-up even in areas where upwelling is fairly constant, such as the northwest coast of [[South America]].  Its values are important within [[numerical weather prediction]] as the SST influences the atmosphere above, such as in the formation of [[sea breeze]]s and [[advection fog#Types|sea fog]].  It is also used to calibrate measurements from [[weather satellite]]s.

==Measurement==
[[File:MODIS and AIRS SST comp fig2.i.jpg|right|thumb|Temperature profile of the surface layer of the ocean (a) at night and (b) during the day]]
There are a variety of techniques for measuring this parameter that can potentially yield different results because different things are actually being measured.  Away from the immediate sea surface, general temperature measurements are accompanied by a reference to the specific depth of measurement.  This is because of significant differences encountered between measurements made at different depths, especially during the daytime when low wind speed and high sunshine conditions may lead to the formation of a warm layer at the ocean's surface and strong vertical temperature gradients (a diurnal [[thermocline]]).&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;   Sea surface temperature measurements are confined to the top portion of the ocean, known as the near-surface layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tZary8a4HMwC&amp;dq=ocean+layers+book&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=ocean%20layers%20book&amp;f=false|page=xi|author1=Alexander Soloviev |author2=Roger Lukas |title=The near-surface layer of the ocean: structure, dynamics and applications|isbn=978-1-4020-4052-8|year=2006|publisher=シュプリンガー・ジャパン株式会社|accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermometers===
SST was one of the first oceanographic variables to be measured.  [[Benjamin Franklin]] suspended a [[mercury thermometer]] from a ship while travelling between the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] in his survey of the [[Gulf stream]] in the late eighteenth century.  SST was later measured by dipping a [[thermometer]] into a bucket of water that was manually drawn from the sea surface.  The first automated technique for determining SST was accomplished by measuring the temperature of water in the intake port of large ships, which was underway by 1963.  These observations have a warm bias of around {{convert|0.6|C-change|F-change|sigfig=1}} due to the heat of the engine room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A6ew-bJDIDIC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=measurement+of+sea+surface+temperature+bucket+of+water+book#v=onepage&amp;q=measurement%20of%20sea%20surface%20temperature%20bucket%20of%20water%20book&amp;f=false|pages=24–25|title=Data analysis methods in physical oceanography|author1=William J.

Thomson |year=2001|accessdate=2011-01-09|isbn=978-0-444-50757-0|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This bias has led to changes in the &lt;!-- scientific or public? --&gt; perception of [[global warming]] since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19772-ships-and-buoys-made-global-warming-look-slower-.html|journal=New Scientist|author=Michael Marshall|date=2010-11-16|accessdate=2011-01-29|title=Ships and buoys made global warming look slower}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fixed [[weather buoy]]s measure the water temperature at a depth of {{convert|3|m|ft}}. Measurements of SST have had inconsistencies over the last 130 years due to the way they were taken. In the nineteenth century, measurements were taken in a bucket off of a ship. However, there was a slight variation in temperature because of the differences in buckets. Samples were collected in either a wood or an uninsulated canvas bucket, but the canvas bucket cooled quicker than the wood bucket. The sudden change in temperature between 1940 and 1941 was the result of an undocumented change in procedure. The samples were taken near the engine intake because it was too dangerous to use lights to take measurements over the side of the ship at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burroughs|first=William James|title=Climate change : a multidisciplinary approach|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

NOAA's &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.goes.noaa.gov/ GOES (Geostationary Orbiting Earth Satellites)]&lt;/span&gt; satellites are [[geostationary orbit|geo-stationary]] above the Western Hemisphere which enables to them to deliver SST data on an hourly basis with only a few hours of lag time.

There are several difficulties with satellite-based absolute SST measurements. First, in infrared remote sensing methodology the radiation emanates from the [[Sea surface microlayer|top "skin" of the ocean]], approximately the top 0.01 [[millimetre|mm]] or less, which may not represent the [[bulk temperature]] of the upper meter of ocean due primarily to effects of solar surface heating during the daytime, reflected radiation, as well as sensible heat loss and surface evaporation. All these factors make it somewhat difficult to compare satellite data to measurements from buoys or shipboard methods, complicating ground truth &lt;!-- clarify --&gt;efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jk1fIo51uwMC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=measurement+of+sea+surface+temperature+book#v=onepage&amp;q=measurement%20of%20sea%20surface%20temperature%20book&amp;f=false|page=279|author=Ian Stuart Robinson|title=Measuring the oceans from space: the principles and methods of satellite oceanography|publisher=Springer|year=2004|accessdate=2011-01-09|isbn=978-3-540-42647-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Secondly, the satellite cannot look through clouds, creating a cool bias in satellite-derived SSTs within cloudy areas.&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;  However, passive microwave techniques can accurately measure SST and penetrate cloud cover.&lt;ref name="John"/&gt;  Within atmospheric sounder channels on [[weather satellite]]s, which peak just above the ocean's surface, knowledge of the sea surface temperature is important to their calibration.&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;

El Niño is defined by prolonged differences in Pacific Ocean surface temperatures when compared with the average value. The accepted definition is a warming or cooling of at least 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C (0.9&amp;nbsp;°F) averaged over the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean.  Typically, this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of 2–7 years and lasts nine months to two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ensofaq.shtml#HOWOFTEN|title=ENSO FAQ: How often do El Niño and La Niña typically occur?|accessdate=2009-07-26|date=2005-12-19|author=[[Climate Prediction Center]]|publisher=[[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average period length is 5 years. When this warming or cooling occurs for only seven to nine months, it is classified as El Niño/La Niña "conditions"; when it occurs for more than that period, it is classified as El Niño/La Niña "episodes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/enso/?year=2009&amp;month=6&amp;submitted=true|title=El Niño / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) June 2009|author=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 2009|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign of an El Niño in the sea surface temperature pattern is when warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east Pacific. It takes the rain with it, causing extensive drought in the western Pacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern Pacific.  El Niño's warm rush of nutrient-poor tropical water, heated by its eastward passage in the Equatorial Current, replaces the cold, nutrient-rich surface water of the [[Humboldt Current]]. When El Niño conditions last for many months, extensive ocean warming and the reduction in Easterly Trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient-rich deep water and its economic impact to local fishing for an international market can be serious.&lt;ref name="deadfish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/eln/home.rxml|title=El Niño|date=1998-04-28|accessdate=2009-07-17|author=WW2010|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea surface temperature affects the behavior of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] above, so their initialization into [[atmospheric model]]s is important.  While sea surface temperature is important for [[tropical cyclogenesis]], it is also important in determining the formation of sea fog and sea breezes.&lt;ref name="space"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hH2NkL_318wC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=sea+surface+temperature+forecasting+numerical+weather+prediction+book#v=onepage&amp;q=sea%20surface%20temperature%20forecasting%20numerical%20weather%20prediction%20book&amp;f=false|page=263|title=Oceanography from Space: Revisited|author=Vittorio Barale|year=2010|accessdate=2011-01-09|isbn=978-90-481-8680-8|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heat from underlying warmer waters can significantly modify an air mass over distances as short as {{convert|35|km|mi}} to {{convert|40|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/fm26377722407422/|author=Jun Inoue, Masayuki Kawashima, Yasushi Fujiyoshi and Masaaki Wakatsuchi|title=Aircraft Observations of Air-mass Modification Over the Sea of Okhotsk during Sea-ice Growth|issue=1|date=October 2005|doi=10.1007/s10546-004-3407-y|pages=111–129|issn=0006-8314|volume=117| journal=Boundary-Layer Meteorology|bibcode = 2005BoLMe.117..111I }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, southwest of Northern Hemisphere [[extratropical cyclone]]s, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow [[lake-effect snow]] (or sea effect) bands. Those bands bring strong localized [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], often in the form of [[snow]], since large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences—larger than {{convert|13|C-change|F-change|sigfig=2}}—between the water surface and the air above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=B.

===Tropical cyclones===

{{Main article|Tropical cyclogenesis|Tropical cyclones and climate change}}
Ocean temperature of at least 26.5[[degrees Celsius|°C]] (79.7[[degrees Fahrenheit|°F]]) spanning through at minimum a 50-[[metre]] depth is one of the precursors needed to maintain a [[tropical cyclone]] (a type of [[mesocyclone]]).&lt;ref name="A15"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Chris Landsea]]|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html|title=Subject: A15) How do tropical cyclones form?|accessdate=2011-01-27|year=2011|publisher=[[Hurricane Research Division]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SST&gt;{{cite web|last=Webster|first=PJ|title=Changes in tropical cyclone number, duration, and intensity in a warming environment|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA136847986&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=mnastbens&amp;it=r&amp;p=PROF&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=335992f2037df3339c5901f7981d2045|publisher=Gale Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These warm waters are needed to maintain the [[Tropical cyclone#Mechanics|warm core]] that fuels tropical systems.  This value is well above 16.1&amp;nbsp;°C (60.9&amp;nbsp;°F), the long term global average surface temperature of the oceans.&lt;ref name="SSTMEAN"&gt;{{Cite web| author = Matt Menne | publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] | url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cmb-faq/anomalies.php#mean | title = Global Long-term Mean Land and Sea Surface Temperatures | date = March 15, 2000 | accessdate = 2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this requirement can be considered only a general baseline because it assumes that the ambient atmospheric environment surrounding an area of disturbed weather presents average conditions. Tropical cyclones have intensified when SSTs were slightly below this standard temperature.

Tropical cyclones are known to form even when normal conditions are not met. For example, cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude (e.g., at the 500&amp;nbsp;[[hPa]] level, or 5.9&amp;nbsp;km) can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures, as a certain [[lapse rate]] is required to force the atmosphere to be [[Baroclinic instability|unstable]] enough for convection. In a moist atmosphere, this lapse rate is 6.5&amp;nbsp;°C/km, while in an atmosphere with less than 100% [[relative humidity]], the required lapse rate is 9.8&amp;nbsp;°C/km.&lt;ref name="TCS EESC"&gt;{{cite web|year=2000|last=Kushnir|first=Yochanan|title=The Climate System|url=http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/ees/climate/lectures/atm_phys.html|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 500&amp;nbsp;hPa level, the air temperature averages −7&amp;nbsp;°C (18&amp;nbsp;°F) within the tropics, but air in the tropics is normally dry at this height, giving the air room to [[Wet-bulb temperature|wet-bulb]], or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500&amp;nbsp;hPa in a tropical atmosphere of {{convert|-13.2|C|F}} is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is {{convert|26.5|C|F}}, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1&amp;nbsp;°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1&amp;nbsp;°C change at 500&amp;nbsp;hpa.
Inside a [[cold-core low|cold cyclone]], 500&amp;nbsp;hPa temperatures can fall as low as {{convert|-30|C|F}}, which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the [[troposphere]], roughly at the 500&amp;nbsp;hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500&amp;nbsp;hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey|author1=John M.

There is considerable debate is to why exactly the seconds are sloppy. The most currently accepted theory is that it is the [[Semen|cum]], however there remains some disagreement and this remains an open area of research as of 2018.

=== Introduction ===
''Streptomyces griseus'' was chosen for the honor of becoming the New Jersey State Microbe because the organism is a New Jersey native that made unique contributions to healthcare and scientific research worldwide. A strain of ''S. griseus'' that produced the antibiotic [[streptomycin]] was discovered in New Jersey in “heavily [[manure]]d field soil” from the New Jersey Agricultural Experimental Station by [[Albert Schatz (scientist)|Albert Schatz]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz A, Bugie E, Waksman SE. (1944). "Streptomycin, a Substance Exhibiting Antibiotic Activity Against Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria". Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine. 55: 66–69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Streptomycin is noteworthy because it is: the first significant antibiotic discovered after [[penicillin]]; the first systemic [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] discovered in America; the first antibiotic active against [[tuberculosis]]; first-line treatment for [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Moreover, New Jersey was the home of [[Selman Waksman]], who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his systematic studies of antibiotic production by ''S. griseus'' and other soil microbes.&lt;ref&gt;''"The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1952". www.nobelprize.org. Retrieved 2017-11-16.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislative Activity ===
On May 15, 2017, Senate Bill 3190 (S3190) was introduced by [[New Jersey Senate|Senator]] [[Samuel D. Thompson]] (R-12); the bill designates ''[[Streptomyces griseus]]'' as the [[New Jersey]] State Microbe, to be added to [[List of New Jersey state symbols|the state's other state symbols]]. On June 1, 2017 [[New Jersey General Assembly|Assemblywoman]] [[Annette Quijano]] (D-20) introduced Assembly Bill 4900 (A4900); the bill also designates ''S. griseus'' as the New Jersey State Microbe, and is the Assembly counterpart of S3190.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/A5000/4900_I1.HTM|title=A4900|website=www.njleg.state.nj.us|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; S3190 was referred to the Senate State Government, Wagering, Tourism &amp; Historic Preservation Committee and A4900 was referred to the Assembly State and Local Government Committee for consideration and review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://legiscan.com/NJ/research/A4900/2016|title=New Jersey A4900 {{!}} 2016-2017 {{!}} Regular Session|work=LegiScan|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education Activity ===
The Rutgers University [[Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences|School of Environmental and Biological Science]] (SEBS) Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology has provided a web page since 2010 on which people can vote for one of three excellent choices for the New Jersey State Microbe. The candidates have been ''[[Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans]]'' (discovered in NJ, 1922), ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]'' (discovered in [[Vineland nj|Vineland, NJ]], 1903), and ''Streptomyces griseus'' ([[New Brunswick, NJ]] is home of the streptomycin-producing strain).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dbm.rutgers.edu/stateMicrobe.php|title=Vote for State Microbe {{!}} Department of Microbiology and Biochemistry at the Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences|website=dbm.rutgers.edu|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''S. griseus'' has been the winning microbe by a 3 to 1 margin. The Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology has also been actively involved in public education and outreach at annual Rutgers Day events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rutgersday.rutgers.edu/content/passion-puddle-area|title=Passion Puddle Area {{!}} Rutgers Day|website=rutgersday.rutgers.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, they received hundreds of signatures on a petition urging legislators to recognize ''S. griseus'' as the State Microbe. The microbiology community, both within and outside of NJ, has been an advocate for the State Microbe, actively submitting letters of endorsement to the New Jersey Legislature.

The New Jersey State Microbe was the subject of a presentation by John Warhol at the 2018 [[Rutgers University]] Microbiology Symposium,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dbm.rutgers.edu/MicrobioSymPrgrm2018.pdf|title=Rutgers Microbiology Symposium 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; video of the presentation is available [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iei0-tH03aI here]. Dr Warhol also spoke about the New Jersey State Microbe at the Theobald Smith Society (NJ Chapter of the American Society for Microbiology) Meeting in Miniature at [[Seton Hall University]] in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shu.edu/arts-sciences/news/shu-to-host-theobald-smith-society-meeting.cfm|title=Seton Hall University to Host the Theobald Smith Society Meeting in Miniature - Seton Hall University|website=www.shu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Jersey State Microbe was the subject of a Science Cafe, titled The New Jersey State Microbe and You-- Perfect Together! held at the New Jersey Institute for Food, Nutrition, and Health on March 1. Presenters were Max Haggblom, Douglas Eveleigh, and John Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://microminutes.tumblr.com/image/171385435429|title=Micro Minutes! : Photo|website=microminutes.tumblr.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Dr Jeffrey Boyd spoke to students and teachers at the Bartle Elementary School in Highland Park, firing up their enthusiasm for microbial life in general and ''S. griseus'' in particular. The students were taught about microbiology, antibiotics, the interaction of science and public service, and how to contact their state legislators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://microminutes.tumblr.com/post/173991310639/microbial-school-outreach-rutgers-professor-dr|title=Micro Minutes!, Microbial School Outreach  Rutgers Professor Dr…|website=Micro Minutes!|language=en|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, John Warhol introduced the topic of microbiology and the State Microbe to students at the Indian Hill School in Holmdel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://microminutes.tumblr.com/post/175327698532/talking-about-microbes-in-school-i-had-the|title=Micro Minutes!, Talking about Microbes in School I had the…|website=Micro Minutes!|language=en|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;        

A scientific paper on the political and social process of designating an official state microbe was presented at Microbe 2018, the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4623/presentation/6277|title=Program Planner|website=www.abstractsonline.com|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titled "How to Get Your Own Official State Microbe" the presentation  stressed the importance of clear communication and legislator contact by academic, industrial, and student supporters.  The authors were Max Haggblom, Douglas Eveleigh, and John Warhol.     

In mid-September, John Warhol gave a public presentation on the New Jersey State Microbe and science communication at the Middletown, NJ Public Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://microminutes.tumblr.com/post/179828059459/microbe-talk-at-the-library-this-was-a-lot-of|title=Micro Minutes!, Microbe Talk at The Library.   This was a lot of...|website=Micro Minutes!|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mtpl.evanced.info/signup/Calendar|title=Middletown Library Presentation Calendar|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[botany]], a '''stipe ''' is a stalk that supports some other structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/glossary_8.html|title=UCMP Glossary: Botany|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise meaning is different depending on which taxonomic group is being described.

[[Image:Phalaenopsis orchid-Stipe.jpg|thumb|An orchid's stipe, with pollinia]]
[[Image:Laminaria hyperborea.jpg|thumb|The stipe of a brown alga]]
In the case of [[fern]]s, the stipe is only the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] from the [[rootstock]] to the beginning of the [[leaf]] tissue, or lamina. The continuation of the structure within the lamina is then termed a [[rachis]].

In flowering plants, the term is often used in reference to a stalk that sometimes supports a flower's [[ovary (plants)|ovary]]. In [[orchid]]s, the stipe or caudicle is the stalk-like support of the [[pollinium|pollinia]]. It is a non-viscid band or strap connecting the pollinia with the viscidium (the viscid part of the [[rostellum]] or beak).

A stipe is also a structure found in organisms that are studied by botanists but that are no longer classified as plants. It may be the stem-like part of the [[thallus (tissue)|thallus]] of a [[mushroom]] or a [[seaweed]], and is particularly common among [[brown algae]] such as kelp. The stipe of a kelp often contains a central region of cells that, like the [[phloem]] of vascular plants, serves to transport nutrients within the alga.

RISE SICS (previously Swedish Institute of Computer Science) is a leading research institute for applied information and communication technology in Sweden, founded in 1985. 

RISE SICS is a research institute in the most expansive area of industry this century: the total digitalization of products, services and businesses. SICS is in the midst of this revolution, boosting the competitive strength of Swedish industry and the quality and efficiency of Sweden’s public sector. 

In January 2005, SICS had about 88 employees, of which 77 were researchers, 30 with PhD degrees. {{As of|2016|04}}, SICS had about 200 employees, of which 160 were researchers, 83 with [[PhD]] degrees. The institute is headquartered in the [[Kista]] district of [[Stockholm]], with the main office in the Electrum building.

==Software==
Several well-known software packages have been developed at SICS:

*[[Contiki]], an [[operating system]] for small-memory embedded devices
*[[Delegent]], an authorization server
*[[Distributed Interactive Virtual Environment]] or DIVE in short
*[[lwIP]], a [[TCP/IP stack]] for [[embedded system]]s
*[[Oz (programming language)|Oz-Mozart]], a multi-platform programming system
*[[Nemesis (computing)|Nemesis]], a concept [[exokernel]] [[operating system]]
*[[Protothreads]], light-weight stackless [[Thread (computing)|threads]]
*[[Quintus Prolog]] and [[SICStus Prolog]], [[Prolog]] implementations
*[[Simics]], a full-system simulator originally developed at SICS
*[[uIP (micro IP)|uIP]], a [[TCP/IP stack]] for [[embedded system]]s

==Academic output==
The research at SICS results in approximately 100 refereed publications in [[academic journal]]s, conferences and workshops per year. Around 2-4 SICS researchers receive higher [[academic degree]]s per year, and 1-3 persons move to academia for [[tenure]]d positions.

SICS was ranked as the 15th most acknowledged computer science research institution in the world in an article in the December 2004 issue of the highly esteemed journal [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] (PNAS). SICS is the only Swedish institution included in the list, and is one of two European institutions (the other one is [[INRIA]]) alongside 13 well-known American institutions, several of them larger than SICS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0407743101 |title=Who gets acknowledged: Measuring scientific contributions through automatic acknowledgment indexing |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proc.

'''Sympathetic magic''', also known as '''imitative magic''', is a type of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] based on imitation or correspondence.

==Similarity and contagion==
It has been said that the theory of sympathetic magic was first developed by Sir [[James George Frazer]] in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1889); [[Richard Andree]], however, anticipates Frazer, writing of 'Sympathie-Zauber' in his 1878 ''Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche''. Frazer further subcategorised sympathetic magic into two varieties: that relying on similarity, and that relying on contact or 'contagion':
{{Quote |If we analyze the principles of thought on which magic is based, they will probably be found to resolve themselves into two: first, that like produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause; and, second, that things which have once been in contact with each other continue to act on each other at a distance after the physical contact has been severed. The former principle may be called the Law of Similarity, the latter the Law of Contact or Contagion. From the first of these principles, namely the Law of Similarity, the magician infers that he can produce any effect he desires merely by imitating it: from the second he infers that whatever he does to a material object will affect equally the person with whom the object was once in contact, whether it formed part of his body or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3623/3623-h/3623-h.htm#c3section1 | publisher = Bartleby | title = The Golden Bough | year = 1922 | chapter = 3: Sympathetic Magic; Part 1: The Principles of Magic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Imitation==
Imitation involves using [[effigies]], [[fetishes]] or [[poppet]]s to affect the environment of people, or occasionally people themselves.  [[Voodoo doll]]s are an example of fetishes used in this way. Such as using a lock of hair on the doll creating a "link" between the doll and the person the hair came from so whatever happens to the doll will also happen on the person.

==Correspondence==
[[Correspondence (theology)|Correspondence]] is based on the idea that one can influence something based on its relationship or resemblance to another thing. Many popular beliefs regarding properties of plants, fruits and vegetables have evolved in the [[traditional medicine|folk-medicine]] of different societies owing to sympathetic magic. This include beliefs that certain herbs with [[yellow]] sap can cure [[jaundice]], that [[walnut]]s could strengthen the brain because of the nuts' resemblance to brain, that [[red beet]]-juice is good for the blood, that phallic-shaped roots will cure [[male impotence]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Harrison| first = Regina | title = Signs, songs, and memory in the Andes: translating Quechua language and culture| publisher = [[University of Texas Press]]| year = 1989| page = 178| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t6RkAAAAMAAJ | isbn = 978-0-292-77627-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional societies believed that an effect on one object can cause an analogous effect on another object, without an apparent causal link between the two objects. For instance, many folktales feature a villain whose "life" exists in another object, and who can only be killed if that other object is destroyed. (Examples including [[Sauron]]'s [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and the [[Russian folktale]] of [[Koschei the Deathless]]. Compare [[Horcrux]] and [[lich]].) [[Mircea Eliade]] wrote that in [[Uganda]], a [[barren woman]] is thought to cause a barren garden, and her husband can seek a divorce on purely economic grounds.&lt;ref name= " Haper &amp; Row - 1976 - A Mircea Eliade Reader - "&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Mircea Eliade | first = Mircea | last = Eliade |title=Myths, Rites, Symbols: A Mircea Eliade Reader|editor1-first =Wendell C | editor1-last = Beane | editor2-first = William G | editor2-last = Doty|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]| year=1976|page =385|isbn=978-0-06-090510-1|oclc= 2136392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many societies have been documeted as believing that, instead of requiring an image of an individual, influence can be exerted using something that they have touched or used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Rehabilitation interventions: Ideas based on a South Pacific example|author-last=Gregory|author-first=R. J.| journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|volume=18|issue=1|date=1996|doi=10.3109/09638289609167089|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the inhabitants of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna, Vanuatu]] in the 1970s were cautious when throwing away food or losing a fingernail, as they believed these small scraps of personal items could be used to cast a spell causing fevers. Similarly, an 18th-century compendium of Russian [[Folk Orthodoxy|folk magic]] describes how someone could be influenced through sprinkling cursed salt on a path frequently used by the victim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Witchcraft and Medicine in Pre-Petrine Russia|author-last=Zguta|author-first=Russell|journal=The Russian Review|volume=37|issue=4|date=1978|p=446|jstor=128509}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 15th-century [[Hwi-bin Kim|crown princess of Joseon Korea]] is recorded as having cut her husband's lovers' shoes into pieces and burnt them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=世宗實錄 |trans-title=[[Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty|Veritable Records of Sejong]]|date=1454|url=http://sillok.history.go.kr/search/inspectionMonthList.do?id=kda|volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses about prehistoric sympathetic magic==
The term is most commonly used in [[archaeology]] in relation to [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s such as those in [[North Africa]] and at [[Lascaux]] in [[France]].  The theory is one of prehistoric human behavior, and is based on studies of more modern [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. The idea is that the paintings were made by [[Cro-Magnon]] [[Shamanism|shaman]]s. The shamans would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a [[trance]] state and then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing power out of the cave walls themselves. This goes some way towards explaining the remoteness of some of the paintings (which often occur in deep or small caves) and the variety of subject matter (from prey animals to [[predator]]s and human hand-prints). In his book ''Primitive Mythology'', [[Joseph Campbell]] stated that the paintings "...were associated with the magic of the hunt." For him, this sympathetic magic was akin to a ''[[participation mystique]]'', where the paintings, drawn in a sanctuary of "timeless principle", were acted upon by rite.

In 1933, [[Leo Frobenius]], discussing [[Cave painting#Africa|cave paintings in North Africa]], pointed out that many of the paintings did not seem to be mere depictions of animals and people. To him, it seemed as if they were acting out a hunt before it began, perhaps as a consecration of the animal to be killed. In this way, the pictures served to secure a successful hunt. While others interpreted the cave images as depictions of hunting accidents or of ceremonies, Frobenius believed it was much more likely that "...what was undertaken [in the paintings] was a consecration of the animal effected not through any real confrontation of man and beast but by a depiction of a concept of the mind."

In 2005, Francis Thackeray published a paper in the journal Antiquity, in which he recognised that there was a strong case for the principle of sympathetic magic in southern Africa in prehistory.  For example, a rock engraving from Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa (dated at 4000 years before the present, BP) showed a zebra which had probably been "symbolically wounded", with incisions on the rump being associated with wounds.  Ochre on the engraved slab could represent blood. A prehistoric rock painting at Melikane in Lesotho shows what appear to be men (shamans) bending forward like animals, with two sticks to represent the front legs of an antelope.  Thackeray suggests that these men, perhaps shamans or "medicine-men" dressed under animal skins, were associated with hunting rituals of the kind recorded by H. Lichtenstein in 1812 in South Africa, in which a hunter simulated an antelope which was symbolically killed by other hunters, in the belief that this was essential for a successful hunt.  Such rituals could be represented in prehistoric art such as paintings at Melikane in Lesotho.  Thackeray suggests that the Melikane therianthropes are associated with both trance and the principle of sympathetic hunting magic  In 2005, in the journal Antiquity, Francis Thackeray suggests that there is even a photograph of such rituals, recorded in 1934 at Logageng in the southern Kalahari, South Africa. Such rituals may have been closely associated with both roan antelope and eland, and other animals.

In the Brandberg in Namibia, in the so-called "White Lady" panel recorded by the Abbe Henri Breuil and Harald Pager, there are "symbolic wounds" on the belly of a gemsbok-like therianthrope (catalogued as T1), which might relate to the principle of sympathetic hunting magic and trance, as suggested by Thackeray in 2013.

At the Apollo 11 cave in Namibia, Erich Wendt discovered mobile art about 30,000 years old, including a stone broken in two pieces, with a gemsbok-like therianthrope that closely resembles the Brandberg therianthrope which Thackeray catalogues as T1.   Both examples of art may be related to sympathetic hunting magic and shamanism.

In 2013 Thackeray emphasised that in southern Africa, the principle of sympathetic hunting magic and shamanism (trance) were not mutually exclusive.

However, as with all [[prehistory]], it is impossible to be certain due to the limited evidence and the many pitfalls associated with trying to understand the prehistoric mindset with a modern [[Mind#Evolutionary history of the human mind|mind]].

'''Synaptic stabilization''' is crucial in the developing and adult nervous systems and is considered a result of the late phase of [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP). The mechanism involves strengthening and maintaining active [[synapses]] through increased expression of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix elements and postsynaptic [[scaffold protein]]s, while pruning less active ones. For example, [[cell adhesion molecules]] (CAMs) play a large role in synaptic maintenance and stabilization. [[Gerald Edelman]] discovered CAMs and studied their function during development, which showed CAMs are required for [[cell migration]] and the formation of the entire nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutishauser U, Jessell TM | title = Cell adhesion molecules in vertebrate neural development | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 68 | issue = 3 | pages = 819–57 | date = July 1988 | pmid = 3293093 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.1988.68.3.819 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerald M.

== Types of CAMs ==

===SynCAMs===

Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play a crucial role in axon pathfinding and synaptic establishment between neurons during [[neurodevelopment]] and are integral members in many synaptic processes including the correct alignment of pre- and post-synaptic [[signal transduction pathways]], vesicular recycling in regards to [[endocytosis]] and [[exocytosis]], integration of postsynaptic receptors and  anchoring to the [[cytoskeleton]] to ensure stability of synaptic components &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bukalo|first1=Olena|last2=Dityatev|first2=Alexander|title=Synaptic Plasticity Dynamics Development and Disease|date=27 December 2012|publisher=Springer, Vienna|location=Vienna|isbn=978-3-7091-0932-8|pages=97–128|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-7091-0932-8_5|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SynCAM’s (also known as Cadm or nectin-like molecules) are a specific type of synaptic CAM found in [[vertebrates]] that promotes growth and stabilization of excitatory (not inhibitory) synapses. SynCAM’s are localized primarily in the [[brain]] at both pre- and postsynaptic sites and their structures consist of intracellular FERM and PDZ binding domains, a single transmembrane domain, and three extracellular [[immunoglobulin domains|Ig-domains]]. During neurodevelopment, SynCAMs such as SynCAM1 act as “contact sensors” of axonal [[growth cones]] accumulating rapidly when axo-dendritic connections are made and helping to form a stable [[adhesion]] complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Biederer|first1=Thomas|last2=Missler|first2=Markus|last3=Südhof|first3=Thomas|title=Synaptic Cell Adhesion|url=http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/4/4/a005694.long|website=Cold Springs Harbor Perspectives in Biology|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

synCAM1 along with [[neuroligin]] are the two CAM’s known to be sufficient to initiate the formation of presynaptic terminals, as addition of synCAM1 to media of co-cultured neuronal and non-neuronal cells lead to the establishment of presynaptic terminals. Homophillic binding of two synCAM1 molecules on the filopodia of axonal growth cone and dendritic spine allow for initial contact between pre- and postsynaptic cell to be made.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Washbourne|first1=Philip|last2=Dityatev|first2=Alexander|last3=Scheiffele|first3=Peter|last4=Biederer|first4=Thomas|last5=Weiner|first5=Joshua A.|last6=Christopherson|first6=Karen S.|last7=El-Husseini|first7=Alaa|title=Cell Adhesion Molecules in Synapse Formation|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=20 October 2004|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3339-04.2004|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/42/9244|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

synCAMs belong to the [[immunoglobulin superfamily|Ig superfamily]] of proteins. The cytosolic PDZ domains of synCAMs imbedded in the post-synaptic membrane interact with post-synaptic scaffold protein [[PSD-95]] which helps anchor the complex to the underlying cytoskeleton.

===Cadherin-catenin===
[[File:Localization of cadherin-catenin.jpg|thumb|Temporal and spatial distribution of N-cadherin complexes in the developing and mature synapse]]
[[Cadherin]]s are calcium- dependent, homophilic [[cell adhesion molecules]] that form complexes with cytosolic partners known as [[catenin]]s.&lt;ref name="Bamji_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bamji SX | title = Cadherins: actin with the cytoskeleton to form synapses | journal = Neuron | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 175–8 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16039559 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2005.06.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Components of this complex bind to a number of different scaffolding proteins, phosphotases, kinases, and receptors.&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008" /&gt; Classical cadherins have five extracellular repeating structures which bind calcium, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tail with a distal cytosolic domain that binds a catenin partner.&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arikkath J, Reichardt LF | title = Cadherins and catenins at synapses: roles in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 31 | issue = 9 | pages = 487–94 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18684518 | pmc = 2623250 | doi = 10.1016/j.tins.2008.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seong_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seong E, Yuan L, Arikkath J | title = Cadherins and catenins in dendrite and synapse morphogenesis | journal = Cell Adhesion &amp; Migration | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 202–13 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25914083 | pmc = 4594442 | doi = 10.4161/19336918.2014.994919 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has implicated the cadherin-catenin complex in a number of different central nervous system processes such as synaptic stabilization and [[Synaptic plasticity|plasticity]].&lt;ref name="Bamji_2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seong_2015" /&gt;

Many cadherins in the [[Cns|CNS]] exhibit distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns.&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008" /&gt; For example, [[CDH2|N-cadherin]] is widely expressed at the developing synapse and later remains near the mature active zone implicating that this complex may be well-suited to provide a link between structural changes and synaptic stability.&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008" /&gt; In fact, local synaptic activity changes impact the expression of the [[Cadherin–catenin complex in learning and memory|cadherin-catenin]] complexes.&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008" /&gt; An increase in activity at a particular [[Dendritic spine|spine]] leads to the dimerization of N-cadherin which is then cleaved leading the repression of CBP/[[CREB in cognition|CREB]] transcription.&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008" /&gt; This repression has many developmental and plasticity related implications.

In the case of [[dendritic spine]] formation and [[Synaptic pruning|pruning]], a competition hypothesis has been proposed and corroborated.&lt;ref name="Whalley_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whalley K | title = Neural development: a complex competition for spines | journal = Nature Reviews. Neuroscience | volume = 16 | issue = 10 | pages = 577 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26307326 | doi = 10.1038/nrn4024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bian_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bian WJ, Miao WY, He SJ, Qiu Z, Yu X | title = Coordinated Spine Pruning and Maturation Mediated by Inter-Spine Competition for Cadherin/Catenin Complexes | journal = Cell | volume = 162 | issue = 4 | pages = 808–22 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26255771 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.07.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis suggests that relative levels of cadherin-catenin complexes, which are distributed amongst spines in a local area in an activity-dependent manner, determines the fate of individual spines. That is, the inter-spine competition for β-catenin determines whether a spine will be matured (increased number of complexes) or pruned (decreased number of complexes).&lt;ref name="Bian_2015" /&gt; This is a critical mechanism during the refinement of cortical circuitry that occurs throughout development.&lt;ref name="Whalley_2015" /&gt;

===Nectin===

[[Nectin]]s are a distinct family of [[cell adhesion molecules]].  These CAMs are involved in the initial contact of [[Chemical synapse|presynaptic]] and postsynaptic neuronal processes during synapse formation.  There are only four well characterized Nectins at the [[synapse]], they are Nectin-1, 2, 3, and 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanes |first=Dan | name-list-format = vanc |title=Development of the Nervous System | edition = 3rd |publisher=Elsevier |date=January 25, 2011 | isbn =978-0-08-092320-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; All [[Cell Membrane|membrane]] bound Nectins possess an extracellular region with three immunoglobulin-like loops.  The furthest loop from the membrane is called the V-type loop and the two loops more interior are C2-type loops.  Multiple Nectins on one cell membrane will bind together at the V-type loop to form a cluster of Nectin proteins, a process called Cis-Clustering.  When two cells possessing individual Cis-Clusters come into contact they form a strong complex called a Trans-Interaction which provides adhesion and, in some cases, signaling between the two cells.&lt;ref name = "Irie_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Irie K, Shimizu K, Sakisaka T, Ikeda W, Takai Y | title = Roles and modes of action of nectins in cell-cell adhesion | journal = Seminars in Cell &amp; Developmental Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 643–56 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15561584 | doi = 10.1016/j.semcdb.2004.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most robust knowledge of Nectin’s role in synaptic stabilization comes from the synapses made between [[Mossy fiber (hippocampus)|Mossy Fiber]] terminals and [[Pyramidal cell]] dendrites in the CA3 region of the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref name = "Rikitake_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rikitake Y, Mandai K, Takai Y | title = The role of nectins in different types of cell-cell adhesion | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 125 | issue = Pt 16 | pages = 3713–22 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 23027581 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.099572 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nectins involved in formation and stabilization of this synapse are Nectin-1 and Nectin-3 which protrude from the plasma membrane of the postsynaptic cell and presynaptic cell, respectively, forming heterophilic [[extracellular]] contacts.  The intracellular domain of all Nectins directly bind to a protein called L-[[MLLT4|Afadin]].  L-Afadin is an [[actin]] binding protein that binds to the F-actin of the actin [[cytoskeleton]].  In this way, Nectins form ridged connections of the cells actin architecture allowing for the synapse to develop in a controlled and stable environment.&lt;ref name = "Takai_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takai Y, Shimizu K, Ohtsuka T | title = The roles of cadherins and nectins in interneuronal synapse formation | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 520–6 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14630213 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2003.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As synapses mature in the CA3 region of the Hippocampus, Nectins and Cadherins, which affiliate closely with one another in synaptic stabilization, are shifted to the periphery of the [[active zone]] and form the Puncta Adherentia Junction (PAJ).  The PAJ functions much like [[Adherens junction]]s in [[Epithelium|epithelial]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].  The displacement of these CAMs and the formation of this junction provides the nascent synaptic membranes room to interact and mature while partitioning off the surrounding membrane and providing cytoskeletal fixation.&lt;ref name="Irie_2004"/&gt;

===Neurexin-neuroligin===
[[Neurexin]]-[[Neuroligin]] interactions help establish the trans-synaptic functional asymmetry essential for the stabilization and maintenance of proper [[synaptic transmission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Craig AM, Kang Y | title = Neurexin-neuroligin signaling in synapse development | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–52 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17275284 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2007.01.011 | pmc = 2820508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presynaptic neurexin and its postsynaptic binding partner, neuroligin, complex early in neural development and are both known to be potent inducers of [[synaptogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dean C, Dresbach T | title = Neuroligins and neurexins: linking cell adhesion, synapse formation and cognitive function | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–9 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16337696 | doi = 10.1016/j.tins.2005.11.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-neuronal cells that artificially express neurexin are sufficient to mobilize post-synaptic specializations in co-cultured neurons;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nam CI, Chen L | title = Postsynaptic assembly induced by neurexin-neuroligin interaction and neurotransmitter | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 17 | pages = 6137–42 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15837930 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0502038102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; neuroligin-expressing cells are likewise able to induce markers of pre-synaptic differentiation in neighboring neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic neurochemistry : principles of molecular, cellular, and medical neurobiology| first1 = Scott T | last1 = Brady | first2 =  George J | last2 = Siegel | first3 = R Wayne | last3 = Albers | first4 = DL | last4 = Price | name-list-format = vanc | isbn=978-0-12-374947-5|edition=Eighth|location=Waltham, Massachusetts|oclc=754167839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Missler M, Südhof TC, Biederer T | title = Synaptic cell adhesion | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = a005694 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22278667 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a005694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while both play an important role in synaptogenesis, these [[cell adhesion molecule]] are not necessary for formation of neuronal connections during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = A Short History of the Synapse – Golgi Versus Ramón y Cajal | title = The Sticky Synapse | last1 = Hortsch | first1 = Michael | editor-last1 = Hortsch | editor-first1 = Michael | editor-last2 = Umemori | editor-first2 = Hisashi | name-list-format = vanc |date=2009|publisher=Springer, New York, NY|isbn=978-0-387-92707-7|pages=1–9|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-92708-4_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A triple [[knockout mouse]] mutant of either neurexins or neuroligins exhibit a normal number of synapses but express an embryonic lethal phenotype due to impairment of normal synaptic transmission.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Missler M, Zhang W, Rohlmann A, Kattenstroth G, Hammer RE, Gottmann K, Südhof TC | title = Alpha-neurexins couple Ca2+ channels to synaptic vesicle exocytosis | journal = Nature | volume = 423 | issue = 6943 | pages = 939–48 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12827191 | doi = 10.1038/nature01755 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they are not necessary for synapse formation ''per se'' but are essential for the maturation and integration of synapses into the functional circuits necessary for survival.

Beyond their extracellular contact with each other, neurexins and neuroligins also bind intracellularly to a vast network of [[Signal transducing adaptor protein|adaptor protein]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and scaffolding structures, which in concert with the [[actin cytoskeleton]], help localize necessary components of synaptic transmission. For example, the first neuroligin ([[NLGN1]]) discovered was identified by its [[PDZ domain]] which binds to [[Psd95|PSD95]], a well-known a [[scaffold protein]] at [[Glutamatergic neurotransmission|glutamatergic synapses]] that functionally links [[NMDA receptor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to the proper post-synaptic locale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of neuroscience|date=2009|publisher=Academic Press| last = Squire | first = Larry R. | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=978-0-08-096393-8|location=Amsterdam|oclc=503584095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, another isoform of neuroligin ([[NLGN2]]) interacts with [[gephyrin]], a scaffolding protein specific to [[GABA|GABA-ergic synapses]], and is responsible for activation of the synaptic adapator protein [[collybistin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang C, Atasoy D, Araç D, Yang X, Fucillo MV, Robison AJ, Ko J, Brunger AT, Südhof TC | title = Neurexins physically and functionally interact with GABA(A) receptors | journal = Neuron | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 403–16 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20471353 | pmc = 3243752 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2010.04.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of neurexins, their intracellular binding interactions are equally as important in recruiting the essential machinery for synaptic transmission at the active zone. Like neuroligins, neurexins possess a PDZ-domain that associates with [[CASK]] ([[Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to phosphorylating itself and neurexin, CASK promotes interactions between neurexins and actin binding proteins, thus providing a direct link by which neurexin can modulate cytoskeletal dynamics that is essential for synaptic stability and plasticity. Neurexin can also bind [[Synaptotagmin 1|synaptotagmin]], a protein embedded in the membrane of synaptic vesicles, and can also promote associations with [[voltage-gated calcium channel]] which mediate the ion flux required for [[neurotransmitter]] [[exocytosis]] upon synaptic stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hata Y, Davletov B, Petrenko AG, Jahn R, Südhof TC | title = Interaction of synaptotagmin with the cytoplasmic domains of neurexins | journal = Neuron | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 307–15 | date = February 1993 | pmid = 8439414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In this way, neurexin and neuroligin coordinate the morphological and functional aspects of the synapse which in turn permits nascent, immature contacts to stabilize into full-fledged functional platforms for neurotransmission.

===Ephrin-Eph signaling===

Non-traditional adhesion molecules, such as the [[ephrin]]s, also help stabilize synaptic contacts. [[Eph receptor]]s and their membrane bound ligands, the ephrins, are involved in a variety of cellular processes during development and maturation including [[axon guidance]], [[neuronal migration]], [[synaptogenesis]], and [[axon pruning]].&lt;ref name="lisbeth"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lisabeth EM, Falivelli G, Pasquale EB | title = Eph receptor signaling and ephrins | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = a009159 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24003208 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a009159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bianchi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bianchi|first1=Lynne | name-list-format = vanc |title=Developmental Neurobiology|date=2018|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780815344827|pages=299–302|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[hippocampus]], [[dendritic spine]] [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] may be regulated by [[astrocytes]] via bi-directional ephrin/EphA signaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolton MM, Eroglu C | title = Look who is weaving the neural web: glial control of synapse formation | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 491–7 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19879129 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2009.09.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Astrocytes and their processes express [[ephrin A3]], whereas the EphA4 receptor is enriched in hippocampal neurons. This interaction, mediated by ephrin A3/EphA4 signaling, induces the recruitment and activation of [[cyclin-dependent kinase 5]] (Cdk5), which then phosphorylates the [[guanine exchange factor]] (GEF), ephexin1.&lt;ref name="rubenstein"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubenstein|first1=John | name-list-format = vanc |title=Cellular Migration and Formation of Neuronal Connections: Comprehensive Developmental Neuroscience|date=May 2013|publisher=Elsevier Science &amp; Technology|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-0-12-397266-8|pages=659–669|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorylated ephexin1 can then activate the small [[GTPase]], [[RhoA]], leading to subsequent activation of its effector, [[Rho-kinase]] (ROCK),  which results in the rearrangement of actin filaments.&lt;ref name="rubenstein"/&gt; Through this mechanism, astrocytic processes are able to stabilize individual dendritic protrusions as well as their maturation into spines via ephrin/EphA signaling. Forward signaling involving the activation of EphA4 results in the stabilization of synaptic proteins at the [[neuromuscular junction]].&lt;ref name="rubenstein"/&gt; As in the EphA4/ephrinA3-mediated neuron–glia interaction, this process regulates dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton by activating ROCK through ephexin.&lt;ref name="rubenstein"/&gt;

Ephrin B/EphB signaling is also involved in synaptic stabilization through different mechanisms. These molecules contain cytoplasmic tails which interact with scaffolding proteins via their [[PDZ domain|PDZ]] domains to stabilize newly formed CNS synapses.&lt;ref name="bianchi"/&gt; For example, [[Ephrin B3]] interacts with the adaptor protein glutamate-receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP-1) to regulate the development of excitatory dendritic shaft synapses.&lt;ref name="bianchi"/&gt; This process, which was identified in cultures of hippocampal neurons, revealed that Eph/ephrin B3 reverse signaling recruits GRIP1 to the membrane of the postsynaptic shaft.&lt;ref name="mara"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flannery DB | title = Nondisjunction in Down syndrome | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 181–2 | date = September 1988 | pmid = 2975924 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1973910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once at the membrane shaft, GRIP1 helps anchor glutamate receptors below the presynaptic terminal. This process also involves the phosphorylation of a serine residue near the ephrin-B [[carboxyl terminus]] (proximal to the PDZ-binding motif) that leads to the stabilization of [[AMPA]] receptors at synapses.&lt;ref name="lisbeth"/&gt;

Another mechanism, found in hippocampal neurons, revealed that EphB signaling could promote spine maturation by modulating Rho GTPase activity, as observed with EphAs.&lt;ref name="aoto"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lerner AM | title = Viral myocarditis as an incidental discovery | journal = Hospital Practice | volume = 25 | issue = 10 | pages = 81–4, 87–90 | date = October 1990 | pmid = 2170431 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.11.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike EphAs, however, the [[EphB2]] receptor has been shown to interact with the postsynaptic [[N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors]] (NMDARs) to recruit the GEF Tiam1 to the complex upon ephrinB binding.&lt;ref name="aoto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rubenstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dina"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arvanitis D, Davy A | title = Eph/ephrin signaling: networks | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 416–29 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18281458 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1630408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorylation of Tiam1 occurs in response to NMDAR activity, which allows for the influx of calcium that activates Tiam1. This mechanism also results in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. As a result of this stabilization, both EphB2 forward signaling and ephrin-B3 reverse signaling has been found to induce LTP via NMDARs.&lt;ref name="yang"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lundgren A, Tibbling L, Henriksson NG | title = DC-determined displacement of the nystagmus beat in rotatory tests | journal = Practica Oto-Rhino-Laryngologica | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–64 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 5795627 | doi = 10.3892/etm.2018.5702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11543">The '''topological derivative''' is, conceptually, a [[derivative]] of a shape functional with respect to infinitesimal changes in its topology, such as adding an infinitesimal hole or crack. When used in higher dimensions than one, the term '''topological gradient''' is also used to name the first-order term of the topological asymptotic expansion, dealing only with infinitesimal singular domain perturbations. It has applications in [[shape optimization]], [[topology optimization]], [[image processing]] and mechanical modeling.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; be an open bounded domain of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^d &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; d \geq 2 &lt;/math&gt;, which is subject to a nonsmooth perturbation confined in a small region &lt;math&gt; \omega_\varepsilon(\tilde{x}) = \tilde{x} + \varepsilon \omega &lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \tilde{x} &lt;/math&gt; an arbitrary point of &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; a fixed domain of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^d &lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt; \Psi &lt;/math&gt; be a characteristic function associated to the unperturbed domain and &lt;math&gt; \Psi_\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; be a characteristic function associated to the perforated domain &lt;math&gt; \Omega_\varepsilon = \Omega \backslash \overline{\omega_\varepsilon} &lt;/math&gt;. A given shape functional &lt;math&gt; \Phi(\Psi_\varepsilon(\tilde{x})) &lt;/math&gt; associated to the topologically perturbed domain, admits the following '''topological asymptotic expansion''':

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \Phi(\Psi_\varepsilon(\tilde{x})) = \Phi(\Psi) + f(\varepsilon) g(\tilde{x}) + o(f(\varepsilon)) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Phi(\Psi) &lt;/math&gt; is the shape functional associated to the reference domain, &lt;math&gt; f(\varepsilon) &lt;/math&gt; is a positive first order correction function of &lt;math&gt; \Phi(\Psi) &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; o(f(\varepsilon)) &lt;/math&gt; is the remainder. The function &lt;math&gt; g(\tilde{x}) &lt;/math&gt; is called the topological derivative of &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; \tilde{x} &lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==

=== Structural mechanics ===
The topological derivative can be applied to shape optimization problems in structural mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sokolowski and A. Zochowski, [http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/07/35/18/PDF/RR-3170.pdf 44On topological derivative in shape optimization44], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The topological derivative can be considered as the singular limit of the shape derivative. It is a generalization of this classical tool in shape optimization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/ANR-GAOS/CIRM2012/Conferences/Jan-LUMINY.pdf Topological Derivatives in Shape Optimization], Jan Sokołowski, May 28, 2012. Retrieved November 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Shape optimization concerns itself with finding an optimal shape. That is, find &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; to minimize some scalar-valued [[objective function]], &lt;math&gt;J(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;. The topological derivative technique can be coupled with [[level-set method]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Allaire, F. Jouve, ''Coupling the level set method and the topological gradient in structural optimization'', in IUTAM symposium on topological design optimization of structures, machines and materials, M. Bendsoe et al. eds., pp3-12, Springer (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the topological asymptotic expansion for the [[Laplace equation]] with respect to the insertion of a short crack inside a plane domain had been found. It allows to detect and locate cracks for a simple model problem: the steady-state heat equation with the heat flux imposed and the temperature measured on the boundary.&lt;ref&gt;S. Amstutz, I. Horchani, and M. Masmoudi. ''[http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/cc/cc34/cc3415.pdf Crack detection by the topological gradient method]''. Control and Cybernetics, 34(1):81–101, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The topological derivative had been fully developed for a wide range of second-order differential operators and in 2011, it had been applied to [[Kirchhoff–Love plate theory|Kirchhoff plate bending problem]] with a fourth-order operator.&lt;ref&gt;S. Amstutz, A.A. Novotny, [http://www.univ-avignon.fr/fileadmin/documents/Users/Fiches_X_P/platesfi.pdf Topological asymptotic analysis of the Kirchhoff plate bending problem].

=== Image processing ===
In the field of image processing, in 2006, the topological derivative has been used to perform [[edge detection]] and [[image restoration]]. The impact of an insulating crack in the domain is studied. The topological sensitivity gives information on the image edges. The presented  algorithm is non-iterative and thanks to the use of spectral methods has a short computing time.&lt;ref&gt;L. J. Belaid, M. Jaoua, M. Masmoudi, and L. Siala. ''Image restoration and edge detection by topological asymptotic expansion''. CRAS Paris, 342(5):313–318, March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Only &lt;math&gt;O(Nlog(N))&lt;/math&gt; operations are needed to detect edges, where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of pixels.&lt;ref name="Image processing by topological asymptotic analysis"&gt;D. Auroux and M. Masmoudi. ''Image processing by topological asymptotic analysis''. ESAIM: Proc. Mathematical methods for imaging and inverse problems, 26:24–44, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years, other problems have been considered: classification, [[segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]], [[inpainting]] and [[super-resolution]].&lt;ref name="Image processing by topological asymptotic analysis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Auroux, M. Masmoudi, and L. Jaafar Belaid.

Auroux, L. Jaafar Belaid, and B. Rjaibi. ''[http://math.unice.fr/~auroux/Work/Articles/DZ.pdf Application of the topological gradient method to color image restoration]''. SIAM J. Imaging Sci., 3(2):153–175, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2010, isotropic diffusion was used for image reconstructions. The topological gradient is also able to provide edge orientation and this information can be used to perform [[anisotropic diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Larnier and J. Fehrenbach. ''[http://homepages.laas.fr/slarnier/Edge_detection_and_anisotropic_diffusion_with_anisotropic_topological_gradient.pdf Edge detection and image restoration with anisotropic topological gradient]''. In 2010 IEEE [[International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing]] (ICASSP), pages 1362–1365, March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a general framework is presented to reconstruct an image &lt;math&gt; u \in L^2(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt; given some noisy observations &lt;math&gt; Lu+n &lt;/math&gt; in a Hilbert space &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; is the domain where the image &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; is defined.&lt;ref name=larnier2012/&gt; The observation space &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; depends on the specific application as well as the linear observation operator &lt;math&gt; L : L^2(\Omega) \rightarrow E &lt;/math&gt;. The norm on the space &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; \|.\|_E &lt;/math&gt;. The idea to recover the original image is to minimize the following functional for &lt;math&gt; u \in H^1(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;  \| C^{1/2} \nabla u \|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 + \|Lu-v\|_E^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is a positive definite tensor. The first term of the equation ensures that the recovered image &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; is regular, and the second term measures the discrepancy with the data.
In this general framework, different types of image reconstruction can be performed such as&lt;ref name=larnier2012/&gt;
* [[image denoising]] with &lt;math&gt; E=L^2(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Lu=u &lt;/math&gt;,
* image denoising and deblurring with &lt;math&gt; E=L^2(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Lu=\phi \ast u &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; a [[motion blur]] or [[Gaussian blur]],
* [[inpainting|image inpainting]] with &lt;math&gt; E=L^2(\Omega\backslash\omega) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Lu=u|_{\Omega\backslash\omega} &lt;/math&gt;, the subset &lt;math&gt; \omega \subset\Omega &lt;/math&gt; is the region where the image has to be recovered.
In this framework, the asymptotic expansion of the cost function &lt;math&gt; J_\Omega(u_\Omega) = \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega u_\Omega^2 &lt;/math&gt; in the case of a crack provides the same topological derivative &lt;math&gt;g(x,n) = - \pi c (\nabla u_0.n) (\nabla p_0.n) - \pi(\nabla u_0.n)^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is the normal to the crack and &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; a constant diffusion coefficient. The functions &lt;math&gt; u_0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p_0 &lt;/math&gt; are solutions of the following direct and adjoint problems.&lt;ref name=larnier2012/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; -\nabla ( c \nabla u_0 ) + L^* L u_0 = L^* v&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \partial_n u_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; -\nabla ( c \nabla p_0 ) + L^* L p_0 = \Delta u_0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \partial_n p_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
Thanks to the topological gradient, it is possible to detect the edges and their orientation and to define an appropriate &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; for the image reconstruction process.&lt;ref name=larnier2012/&gt;

In image processing, the topological derivatives have also been studied in the case of a multiplicative noise of gamma law or in presence of Poissonian statistics.&lt;ref&gt;A. Drogoul, G. Aubert, [http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/01/01/82/00/PDF/drogoul_aubert_Two_Column.pdf The topological gradient method for semi-linear problems and application to edge detection and noise removal.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inverse problems ===
In 2009, the topological gradient method has been applied to [[tomographic reconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Auroux, L. Jaafar Belaid, and B. Rjaibi. ''[http://math.unice.fr/~auroux/Work/Articles/tamtam09.pdf Application of the topological gradient method to tomography]''. In ARIMA Proc. TamTam'09, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The coupling between the topological derivative and the level set has also been investigated in this application.&lt;ref&gt;T. Rymarczyk, P. Tchórzewski, J. Sikora, [https://scholar.google.fr/scholar_url?hl=fr&amp;q=http://www.thinkmind.org/download.php%3Farticleid%3Dadvcomp_2014_2_40_20085&amp;sa=X&amp;scisig=AAGBfm2yKjihVzWwJdrscxbau7m6cTVcQQ&amp;oi=scholaralrt ''Topological Approach to Image Reconstruction in Electrical Impedance Tomography''], ADVCOMP 2014 : The Eighth International Conference on Advanced Engineering Computing and Applications in Science&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilfred Cantwell Smith''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (July 21, 1916 &amp;ndash; February 7, 2000) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] professor of [[comparative religion]] who from 1964&amp;ndash;1973 was director of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Center for the Study of World Religions]]. The ''Harvard Gazette'' said he was one of the field's most influential figures of the past century.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/11.29/27-memorialminute.html|title=Wilfred Cantwell Smith: In Memoriam|work=Harvard University Gazette|accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1962 work ''The Meaning and End of Religion'' he notably and controversially questioned the validity of the concept of [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W.C. (1962) ''The Meaning and End of Religion''. First Fortress Press Edition 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Smith was born in [[Toronto]] to parents Victor Arnold Smith and Sarah Cory Cantwell. He was the younger brother of [[Arnold Smith]] and the father of [[Brian Cantwell Smith]].

He received a [[B.A]]. with honours in [[Languages of Asia|oriental languages]] in 1938 from the [[University of Toronto]]. After his thesis was rejected by [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], supposedly for its [[Marxist]] critique of the [[British Raj]], he and his wife Muriel Mackenzie Struthers spent seven years in Pre-Independence [[India]] (1940–1946), during which he taught [[Indian history|Indian]] and [[Islamic history]] at [[Forman Christian College]] in [[Lahore]].

In 1948 he obtained a [[Ph.D]] in oriental languages at [[Princeton University]], after which he taught at [[McGill University|McGill]], founding in 1952 the university's [[McGill University Institute of Islamic Studies|Institute of Islamic Studies]]. From 1964 to 1973 Smith taught at [[Harvard Divinity School]]. He left Harvard for [[Dalhousie University]] in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, NS]], where he founded the Department of Religion. He was also among the original Editorial Advisors of the scholarly journal ''[[Dionysius (journal)|Dionysius]]''. In 1978 he returned to Harvard. In 1979 he received an honorary doctorate from [[Concordia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.concordia.ca/smith-w|title=Honorary Degree Citation - Wilfred Cantwell Smith* {{!}} Concordia University Archives|website=archives.concordia.ca|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement from teaching, he was appointed a senior research associate in the Faculty of Divinity at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], University of Toronto, in 1985. He died on February 7, 2000.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

==Views on religion==
In his best known and most controversial work, Smith contends that the [[concept]] of religion, rather than being a universally valid category as is generally supposed, is a peculiarly [[Europe]]an [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of recent origin.  Religion, he argues, is a static concept that does not adequately address the complexity and flux of religious lives. Instead of the concept of religion, Smith proffers a new conceptual apparatus: the dynamic dialectic between ''cumulative tradition'' (all historically observable rituals, art, music, theologies, etc.) and ''personal faith''. (p.&amp;nbsp;194)

Smith sets out chapter by chapter to demonstrate that none of the founders or followers of the world's major religions had any understanding that they were engaging in a defined system called religion. The major exception to this rule, Cantwell Smith points out, is [[Islam]] which he describes as the most "entity like"' (p.&amp;nbsp;85). In a chapter titled ''The special case of Islam'', Smith points out that the term Islam appears in the [[Qur'an]], making it the only religion not named in opposition to or by another tradition. (p.&amp;nbsp;80). Other than the prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], only the prophet [[Muhammad]] was conscious of the establishment of a religion.  (p.&amp;nbsp;106). Smith points out that the [[Arabic]] language does not have a word for religion, strictly speaking: he details how the word ''din'', customarily translated as such, differs in significant important respects from the European concept.

The terms for major world religions today, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism, did not exist until the 19th century.  Smith suggests that practitioners of any given faith do not historically come to regard what they do as ''religion'' until they have developed a degree of cultural self-regard, causing them to see their collective spiritual practices and beliefs as in some way significantly ''different'' from the ''other''. Religion in the contemporary sense of the word is for Smith the product of both [[identity politics]] and [[apologetics]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One's own 'religion' may be piety and faith, obedience, worship, and a vision of God. An alien 'religion' is a system of beliefs or rituals, an abstract and impersonal pattern of observables. A dialectic ensues, however. If one's own 'religion' is attacked, by unbelievers who necessarily conceptualize it schematically, or all religion is, by the indifferent, one tends to leap to the defence of what is attacked, so that presently participants of a faith - especially those most involved in argument - are using the term in the same externalist and theoretical sense as their opponents. Religion as a systematic entity, as it emerged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, is a concept of polemics and apologetics" (p. 43).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By way of an [[etymology|etymological]] study of ''religion'' (''religio'', in [[Latin]]), Smith further contends that the term, which at first and for most of the centuries denoted an attitude towards a relationship between [[God]] and ''man'' (p.&amp;nbsp;26), has through conceptual slippage come to mean a "system of observances or beliefs" (p.&amp;nbsp;29), a historical tradition which has been institutionalized through a process of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]].  Whereas ''religio'' denoted personal [[piety]], ''religion'' came to refer to an [[abstract entity]] (or [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] signifier) which, Smith says, does not exist.

He argues that the term as found in [[Lucretius]] and [[Cicero]] was internalized by the [[Catholic Church]] through [[Lactantius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].  During the [[Middle Ages]] it was superseded by the term ''faith'', which Smith favors by contrast. In the [[Renaissance]],  via the Christian [[Platonist]] [[Marsilio Ficino]], ''religio'' becomes popular again, retaining its original emphasis on personal practice, even in [[John Calvin]]'s ''Christianae Religionis Institutio'' (1536). During 17th Century debates between Catholics and [[Protestant]]s, religion begins to refer to an abstract system of beliefs, especially when describing an oppositional structure. Through the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] this concept is further reified, so that by the nineteenth century [[Hegel]] defines religion as ''Begriff'', "a self-subsisting transcendent idea that unfolds itself in dynamic expression in the course of ever-changing history ... something real in itself, a great entity with which man has to reckon, a something that precedes all its historical manifestation" (p.&amp;nbsp;47).

Smith concludes (p.&amp;nbsp;48-9) by arguing that the term religion has now acquired four distinct senses: 
# personal piety (e.g. as meant by the phrase "he is more religious than he was ten years ago");
# an overt system of beliefs, practices and values, related  to a particular community manifesting itself as the ''ideal'' religion that the theologian tries to formulate, but which he knows transcends him (e.g. 'true Christianity');
# an overt system of beliefs, practices and values, related  to a particular community manifesting itself as the ''empirical phenomenon'', historical and sociological (e.g. the Christianity of history);
# a generic summation or universal category, i.e. ''religion in general''.

''The Meaning and End of Religion'' remains Smith's most influential work.

A '''worker–machine activity chart''' is a [[chart]] used to describe or plan the interactions between workers and machines over time.&lt;ref&gt;Groover, M. P. (2007). ''Work Systems: The Methods, Measurement &amp; Management of Work''. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|978-0-13-140650-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the name indicates, the chart deals with the criteria of work elements and their time for both the worker and the machine. This chart is useful to describe any repetitive worker-machine system.

==Formats==
A typical worker-machine activity chart consists of two main columns, one for the worker and the other the machine; in some chart formats, there is a third column showing the cumulative time. The chart can also be [[Color code|color-coded]] to convey information; for example, The time column is used to specify the activity of the worker and the machine, if the column is shaded with black color, it indicates that the worker or the machine is performing an operation, while if it is shaded with gray color, it refers to inspection. For moving, it is customary {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} to refer to it with diagonal lines, whereas horizontal lines indicate a holding activity. If the column is blank then the worker or the machine is idle.  For some other uses, there is a same version to accommodate enormous worker-machine interactions, called the multiple worker-multiple machine activity chart.

==Uses==
The chart can be used to investigate potential process improvements. It can be used to illustrate delays and [[:wikt:redundancy|redundancy]], so process improvement efforts can be made to eliminate [[Inefficiency|inefficiencies]] and identify the activities that can be combined. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
