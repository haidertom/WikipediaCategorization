Research institute '''AMOLF''' is part of the institutes organization of [[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] (NWO)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwo.nl/en|title=Welcome to NWO|website=www.nwo.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. AMOLF carries out fundamental research on the physics and design principles of natural and man-made complex matter. AMOLF uses these insights to create novel functional materials and find new solutions to societal challenges in renewable energy, green ICT and healthcare. AMOLF is located at the [[Amsterdam Science Park]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amsterdamsciencepark.nl/|title=Amsterdam Science Park Science and Business {{!}} Amsterdam Science Park|website=www.amsterdamsciencepark.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

AMOLF used to be part of the Dutch Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM). On 31 December, 2016 FOM integrated in NWO &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nwo-i.nl/en/nwo-institutes-organisation/nwo-transition/|title=NWO Transition - NWO-I|work=NWO-I|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

The institute was established in 1949 by the government as the FOM Laboratory for Mass Spectrography. In 1960, it was renamed to Laboratory for Mass Separation, and in 1966 it was reorganized into a research institute and renamed FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amolf.nl/about/history-of-amolf|title=History of AMOLF|publisher=AMOLF|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original research goal was to demonstrate the separation of uranium isotopes by electromagnetic separation methods, a topic of great strategic importance after World War II. To reach this goal, a number of novelanalytical instrumentation were developed, starting with the development of mass-spectrometric tools. In 1953 AMOLF was the first European institute to successfully enrich Uranium. Soon after, research on thermal diffusion in gases followed, as did [[ultracentrifuge]] concepts, cathode dispersion, excitation of gases by using energetic ions and research on molecular beams. The gas-[[ultracentrifuge]] developed at AMOLF (under [[:nl:Jacob_Kistemaker|Jacob Kistemaker]]) provided a base for the commercial enrichment of Uranium at the today well-known company of [[URENCO]] in [[Almelo]].

==Structure and organization ==

AMOLF functions as an incubator for Dutch science, both in terms of launching new research themes and in terms of training talented scientists. AMOLF is headed by its director [[Huib Bakker]], who succeeded [[:nl:Vinod_Subramaniam|Vinod Subramaniam]] on 1 February, 2016. The organization has 19 research groups headed by tenured or tenure-track group leaders. AMOLF employs about 130 researchers and 70 employees for technical and administrative support.

==Research==

AMOLF’s research program consists of four intertwined themes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amolf.nl/research|title=Research - AMOLF|work=AMOLF|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4737">'''Abraham Zevi Idelsohn''' ({{lang-he-n|אַבְרָהָם צְבִי אידלסון}} ''Avrohom Tzvi Idelsohn'' in [[Ashkenazi]] Hebrew; middle name also rendered '''''Tzvi''''', '''''Zvi''''', '''''Zwi''''', or '''''Zebi'''''; July 14, 1882 – August 14, 1938) was a prominent [[Jewish]] [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[musicology|musicologist]] and [[composer]], who conducted several comprehensive studies of [[Jewish music]] around the world.

Idelsohn was born in [[Feliksberg]], [[Latvia]] and trained as a [[Hazzan|cantor]]. He worked briefly in both Europe and [[South Africa]] before emigrating to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1905 and establishing a school of Jewish music there in 1919. In 1922 he moved to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] to take a position as professor of Jewish music at [[Hebrew Union College]]. He died in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lebrecht, ''The complete companion to 20th century music'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000. p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Idelsohn is generally acknowledged as the “father” of modern Jewish musicology. During his time in Jerusalem, he noted a great diversity of musical traditions among the Jews living in the region.  Idelsohn examined these traditional melodies and found recurring motifs and progressions that were not found in any other national music. This suggested a common origin for musical phrases that went back to Israel/Palestine in the first century C.E. He found that these motifs fell into three distinct tonal centers, which corresponded to the Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian modes of the ancient Greeks. Each of these modes elicited a distinct psycho-emotional response. The Dorian Mode was used for texts of an elevated and inspired nature; the Phrygian for sentimental texts, with their very human outbreaks of feeling, both of joy and grief; and the Lydian was used in composing music for the texts of lamenting and confessions of sins. Idelsohn further categorized and defined these motives as ones that either prepared a musical phrase,  began it, or concluded it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Echoes: Rediscovering Music &amp; Chant of Middle Eastern Spirituality |publisher=San Antonio Vocal Arts Ensemble. savae.org|url=http://www.savae.org/echoes1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324162522/http://www.savae.org/echoes1.html |archive-date=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works include the monumental ''Thesaurus of Hebrew Oriental Melodies'' (10 volumes, 1914–1932) and ''Jewish Music'' (1929). He is considered to be the author of the lyrics of the famous Jewish [[Folk music|folk song]] "[[Hava Nagila]]."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.radiohazak.com/Havahist.html ''Who Wrote Havah Nagilah?'' at RadioHazak.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "jofferadio4"&gt;[[Joel Joffe]] mentioned his grandfather and his grandfather's role in writing [[Hava Nagila]] in an appearance on [http://www.thejc.com/home.aspx?ParentId=m14s49s53&amp;SecId=53&amp;AId=56480&amp;ATypeId=1 BBC Radio 4 Desert Island Discs on 28 October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the maternal grandfather of [[Joel Joffe|Joel Goodman Joffe (Baron Joffe)]].&lt;ref name = "jofferadio4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More evidence of the relationship between Idelsohn and Joffe is provided in [http://himelfarb.org/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I669&amp;tree=Markel this family tree]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung I 1798-1799.jpg|thumb|Title page of the first volume, showing a portrait of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]].]]
The '''''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung''''' (''General music newspaper'') was a German-language periodical published in the 19th century. Comini (2008) has called it "the foremost German-language musical periodical of its time".&lt;ref&gt;Comini, Alessandra (2008) ''The Changing Image of Beethoven: A Study in Mythmaking''. Sunstone Press. {{ISBN|0-86534-661-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-86534-661-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It reviewed musical events taking place in many countries, focusing on the German-speaking nations, but also covering France, Italy, Russia, Britain, and even occasionally America.&lt;ref name=Barbour /&gt;

Its impartiality and adherence to basic principles of credibility and discretion regarding the personal position of those reviewed, assured and established itself in a high position as a periodical in the musical German society of the time, exercising great influence on the period.

==History==
The periodical appeared in two series: a weekly [[magazine]] published between 1798 and 1848, and a revived version which lasted from 1866 to 1882.&lt;ref name="ripm.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ripm.org/journals/AMZ.php |title=''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'': prepared by Karl Kügle |access-date=2009-05-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521100516/http://www.ripm.org/journals/AMZ.php |archive-date=2008-05-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher was [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] in [[Leipzig]] for the first period of publication and for the first three years of the second period; for the remainder of the periodical's history it was published by J. Reiter-Biedermann.&lt;ref name="ripm.org" /&gt; For a time during the second era it went by the title ''Leipziger Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' ("AmZ of Leipzig").

Much important material appeared in the magazine, including the serialized first version of [[Georg August Griesinger]]'s biography of [[Joseph Haydn]], and articles by scholar [[Gustav Nottebohm]] and critic [[Eduard Hanslick]].&lt;ref name="ripm.org" /&gt; The journal employed the famous critic [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] and published his influential review of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]. Both [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Franz Liszt]] published in the journal.

Somewhat less to its credit, the magazine also published the so-called "Rochlitz anecdotes," a series of vignettes about [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] written by the first editor. Today these anecdotes are widely considered to be heavily contaminated by material coming entirely from Rochlitz's own imagination (see [[Biographies of Mozart]] and [[Mozart's compositional method]]).

=== Editors ===
The editors of the ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' during its first 50-year period were:&lt;ref name=Barbour&gt;Barbour, J. Murray (1948) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/890433 "''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'': Prototype of Contemporary Musical Journalism."] ''Notes'', Second Series, 5:325–337. {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz]], for the first twenty years; he continued to contribute material for another seventeen.
* [[Gottfried Christoph Härtel]], the owner of the journal's publishing house, anonymously taking on editorship of the journal for ten years
* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Fink]], who edited for fourteen years
* [[Carl Ferdinand Becker (organist)|Carl Ferdinand Becker]], a Leipzig organist, in 1842
* [[Moritz Hauptmann]], cantor at [[St. Thomas Church, Leipzig]] in 1843
* a three-year hiatus without an editor
* [[Johann Christian Lobe]], for the last two and a half years.

=== ''Répertoire international de la presse musicale'' ===
The ''[[Répertoire international de la presse musicale]]'' has published volumes on both series:
*Ole Hass, ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung 1798–1848''. 14 vols. ''Répertoire International de la Presse Musicale'' (Baltimore, Maryland: RIPM, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ripm.org/pdf/Introductions/ALZintroEnglish.pdf Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Karl Kügle, ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung 1863–1882''. 7 vols. ''Répertoire International de la Presse Musicale'' (Ann Arbor, Michigan: UMI, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ripm.org/pdf/Introductions/AMZintroEnglish.pdf Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' is not to be confused with the ''Berliner allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'', a different musical journal which was published in Berlin, or with the ''Wiener allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' which was published in Vienna.

== Ancient civilizations ==

=== Mesopotamia ===

They were one of the first [[Bronze age]] people in the world. Early on they used [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[gold]], and later they used [[iron]]. Palaces were decorated with hundreds of kilograms of these very expensive metals. Also, copper, bronze, and iron were used for [[armor]] as well as for different weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s.

According to the assyriologist [[Stephanie Dalley]], the earliest [[pump]] was the [[Archimedes' screw]], first used by [[Sennacherib]], King of [[Assyria]], for the [[Domestic water system|water systems]] at the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] and [[Nineveh]] in the 7th century BCE. This attribution, however, is refuted by the historian of ancient water-lifting devices Olseon in the same paper, who still credits, as well as most other scholars, [[Archimedes]] with the invention.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Dalley and [[John Peter Oleson]] (January 2003).

Perhaps the most important advance made by the [[Mesopotamia]]ns was the [[Cuneiform|invention of writing]] by the [[Sumer]]ians. With the invention of writing came the first recorded laws called the [[Code of Hammurabi]] as well as the first major piece of literature called the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].

Although archaeologists don't know for sure who invented the wheel, the oldest wheel discovered was found in Mesopotamia. It is likely the Sumer first used the wheel in making pottery in 3500BC and used it for their chariots in around 3200 BC.

The Mesopotamians used a [[sexagesimal]] number system with the base 60 (like we use base 10). They divided time up by 60s including a 60-second minute and a 60-minute hour, which we still use today. They also divided up the circle into 360 degrees. They had a wide knowledge of mathematics including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, quadratic and cubic equations, and fractions. This was important in keeping track of records as well as in some of their large building projects. The Mesopotamians had formulas for figuring out the circumference and area for different geometric shapes like rectangles, circles, and triangles. Some evidence suggests that they even knew the Pythagorean Theorem long before Pythagoras wrote it down. They may have even discovered the number for pi in figuring the circumference of a circle.

[[Babylonian astronomy]] was able to follow the movements of the stars, planets, and the Moon. Application of advanced math predicted the movements of several planets.  By studying the phases of the Moon, the Mesopotamians created the first [[calendar]]. It had 12 lunar months and was the predecessor for both the [[Jewish calendar|Jewish]] and [[Greek calendar]]s.

[[Babylonian medicine]] used logic and recorded medical history to be able to diagnose and treat illnesses with various creams and pills. Mesopotamians had two kinds of medical practices, magical and physical. Unlike today they would use both on the same patient. They didn’t see it as one as good and one as bad.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Alan Chadwick, ''First Civilization: Ancient Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt (2)'' (London: Equinox Publishing Ltd, 2005), 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mesopotamians made many technological discoveries. They were the first to use the potter's wheel to make better pottery, they used irrigation to get water to their crops, they used bronze metal (and later iron metal) to make strong tools and weapons, and used looms to weave cloth from wool.

For later medieval technologies developed in the Mesopotamian region, now known as [[Iraq]], see [[Inventions in medieval Islam]].

===Egypt===
[[File:TurinPapyrus1.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Left half of the Turin papyrus map, courtesy J. Harrell]]
The [[Egyptians]] invented and used many simple machines, such as the [[inclined plane|ramp]] to aid construction processes. They were among the first to extract [[gold]] by large-scale mining using [[fire-setting]], and the first recognisable [[map]], the [[Turin papyrus]] shows the plan of one such mine in [[Nubia]].

Egyptian [[paper]], made from [[papyrus]], and [[pottery]] were mass-produced and exported throughout the Mediterranean basin. The [[wheel]], however, did not arrive until foreign invaders introduced the [[chariot]]. They developed Mediterranean [[maritime history|maritime]] technology including ships and lighthouses. Early construction techniques utilized by the Ancient Egyptians made use of bricks composed mainly of clay, sand, silt, and other minerals. These constructs would have been vital in flood control and irrigation, especially along the Nile delta.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Trzciñski , Malgorzata Zaremba , Sawomir Rzepka , Fabian Welc , and Tomasz Szczepañski. “Preliminary Report on Engineering Properties and Environmental Resistance of Ancient Mud Bricks from Tell El-retaba Archaeological Site in the Nile Delta,” ''Studia Quarternaria'' 33, no. 1 (2016): 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
{{main|Science and technology in Africa}}
Technology in Africa has a history stretching to the beginning of the human species, stretching back to the first evidence of [[Stone Age|tool use]] by hominid ancestors in the [[Hominid evolution|areas of Africa]] where humans are believed to have evolved. Africa saw the advent of some of the earliest [[ironworking]] technology in the [[Aïr Mountains]] region of what is today [[Niger]] and the erection of some of the world's oldest monuments, pyramids and towers in [[Egypt]], [[Nubia]], and [[History of North Africa|North Africa]]. In Nubia and ancient Kush, glazed quartzite and building in brick was developed to a greater extent than in Egypt. Parts of the East African [[Swahili Coast]] saw the creation of the world's oldest [[carbon steel]] creation with high-temperature [[blast furnace]]s created by the [[Haya people]] of Tanzania.

=== Indian subcontinent ===
{{main|History of Indian Science and Technology|List of Indian inventions}}
{{See also|List of inventions and discoveries of the Indus Valley Civilization}}

The [[history of Science and Technology in India|history of science and technology in India]] dates back to the earliest civilizations of the world. The Indus Valley civilization yields evidence of [[mathematics]], [[hydrography]], [[metrology]], and sewage collection and disposal being practiced by its inhabitants.

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]], situated in a resource-rich area, is notable for its early application of city planning and sanitation technologies. Cities in the Indus Valley offer some of the first examples of closed gutters, public baths, and communal granaries. The [[Takshashila]] University was an important seat of learning in the ancient world. It was the center of education for scholars from all over Asia. Many [[Greeks|Greek]], Persian and [[China|Chinese]] students studied here under great scholars including [[Kautilya]], Panini, [[Jivaka]], and Vishnu Sharma.
[[File:Mohenjo-daro.jpg|thumb|200px|Excavated ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]], Pakistan.]]

The ancient system of medicine in India, [[Ayurveda]] was a significant milestone in Indian history. It mainly uses herbs as medicines. Its origins can be traced back to origin of [[Atharvaveda]]. The [[Sushruta Samhita]] (400 BC) by Sushruta has details about performing cataract surgery, plastic surgery, etc.

Ancient India was also at the forefront of seafaring technology - a panel found at [[Mohenjo-daro]], depicts a sailing craft. Ship construction is vividly described in the Yukti Kalpa Taru, an ancient Indian text on Shipbuilding. (The Yukti Kalpa Taru had been translated and published by Prof. Aufrecht in his 'Catalogue of Sanskrit [[Manuscripts]]').

Indian construction and architecture, called '[[Vaastu Shastra]]', suggests a thorough understanding or materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation. Ancient Indian culture was also pioneering in its use of vegetable dyes, cultivating plants including [[indigo]] and [[cinnabar]]. Many of the dyes were used in art and sculpture. The use of [[perfume]]s demonstrates some knowledge of [[chemistry]], particularly [[distillation]] and purification processes.

=== China ===
{{main|History of science and technology in China|List of Chinese inventions}}
[[File:ArmillarySphere1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Chinese [[armillary sphere]]]]

The [[history of science and technology in China]] shows significant advances in science, technology, mathematics, and astronomy. The first recorded observations of comets, solar eclipses, and supernovae were made in China.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and herbal medicine were also practiced. The [[Four Great Inventions]] of China: the [[compass]], [[gunpowder]], papermaking, and printing were among the most important technological advances, only known in Europe by the end of the Middle Ages.

According to the Scottish researcher [[Joseph Needham]], the Chinese made many first-known discoveries and developments. Major technological contributions from China include early [[Seismology|seismological]] detectors, [[matches]], [[paper]], the double-action [[piston pump]], [[cast iron]], the iron [[plough]], the multi-tube [[seed drill]], the [[suspension bridge]], [[natural gas]] as fuel, the [[magnetic compass]], the [[raised-relief map]], the [[propeller]], the [[crossbow]], the [[south-pointing chariot]], and [[gunpowder]]. Other Chinese discoveries and inventions from the Medieval period, according to Joseph Needham's research, include: [[block printing]] and [[movable type]], phosphorescent paint, and the [[spinning wheel]].

The solid-fuel [[rocket]] was invented in China about 1150 AD, nearly 200 years after the invention of [[black powder]] (which acted as the rocket's fuel). At the same time that the [[age of exploration]] was occurring in the West, the Chinese emperors of the [[Ming Dynasty]] also sent ships, [[Treasure voyages|some reaching Africa]]. But the enterprises were not further funded, halting further exploration and development. When [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s ships reached [[Brunei]] in 1521, they found a wealthy city that had been fortified by Chinese engineers, and protected by a [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]. [[Antonio Pigafetta]] noted that much of the technology of Brunei was equal to Western technology of the time. Also, there were more cannons in Brunei than on Magellan's ships, and the Chinese merchants to the Brunei court had sold them [[spectacles]] and [[porcelain]], which were rarities in Europe.

The [[Qanat]], a water management system used for irrigation, originated in [[Iran]] before the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid period]] of Persia&lt;!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, "Persian Empire"; link to a specific iteration of this topic --&gt;. The oldest and largest known qanat is in the Iranian city of [[Gonabad]] which, after 2,700&amp;nbsp;years, still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ward English  | first = Paul  | title = The Origin and Spread of Qanats in the Old World | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume =  112| issue =  3 | pages =170–181 | publisher = [[JSTOR]]

In the 7th&amp;nbsp;century AD, Persians in [[Afghanistan]] developed the first practical [[windmill]]s. For later medieval technologies developed in [[Islamization of Iran|Islamic Persia]], see [[Inventions in medieval Islam]].

=== Greek and Hellenistic ===
[[File:Heron's Windwheel.jpg|thumb|200px|Hero's wind-powered [[Organ (music)|organ]] (reconstruction)]]
{{main|Ancient Greek technology}}

[[Ancient Greek technology]] developed at an unprecedented speed during the 5th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period, and beyond. Some inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks are the following: the gear, screw, bronze casting techniques, [[water clock]], [[water organ]](hydraulis), [[torsion siege engine]], and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war.

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] engineers invented many technologies and improved upon pre-existing technologies, particularly during the [[Hellenistic period]]. [[Heron of Alexandria]] invented a basic [[steam engine]] and demonstrated knowledge of mechanic and pneumatic systems. [[Archimedes]] invented several machines. The Greeks were unique in pre-industrial times in their ability to combine scientific research with the development of new technologies. One example is the [[Archimedean screw]]; this technology was first conceptualized in mathematics, then built. Other technologies invented by Greek scientists include the [[ballista]]e, the [[piston pump]], and primitive [[analog computers]] like the [[Antikythera mechanism]]. Greek architects were responsible for the first true [[dome]]s, and were the first to explore the [[Golden ratio]] and its relationship with geometry and architecture.

Apart from [[Hero of Alexandria]]'s steam [[aeolipile]], Hellenistic technicians were the first to invent watermills and windwheels, making them global pioneers in three of the four known means of non-human propulsion prior to the Industrial Revolution (the fourth being sails). However, only water power was used extensively in antiquity.

Other Greek inventions include torsion catapults, pneumatic catapults, crossbows, cranes, rutways, organs, the keyboard mechanism, gears, differential gears, screws, refined parchment, showers, dry docks, diving bells, odometer and astrolabes. In architecture, Greek engineers constructed monumental lighthouses such as the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] and devised the first central heating systems. The [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]] is the earliest tunnel in history which has been excavated with a scientific approach from both ends.

Automata like vending machines, automatic doors and many other ingenious devices were first built by Hellenistic engineers as [[Ctesibius]], [[Philo of Byzantium]] and Heron. Greek technological treatises were scrupuously studied and copied by later Byzantine, Arabic and Latin European scholars and provided much of the foundation for further technological advances in these civilizations.

=== Roman ===
{{main|Roman technology}}
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]] in France, a Roman aqueduct]]
[[File:Archscrew2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Drainage wheel from Rio Tinto mines]]

[[Roman technology]] supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years. The Roman Empire had an advanced set of technology for their time. Some of the Roman technology in Europe may have been lost during the turbulent eras of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Roman technological feats in many different areas like: civil engineering, construction materials, transport technology, and some inventions such as the [[mechanical reaper]] went unmatched until the 19th century.
Romans developed an intensive and sophisticated agriculture, expanded upon existing iron working technology, created [[Roman law|laws]] providing for individual ownership, advanced stonemasonry technology, advanced [[Roman road|road-building]] (exceeded only in the 19th century), military engineering, civil engineering, spinning and weaving and several different machines like the [[reaper|Gallic reaper]] that helped to increase productivity in many sectors of the Roman economy. They also developed water power through building aqueducts on a grand scale, using water not just for drinking supplies but also for [[irrigation]], powering [[water mill]]s and in mining. They used drainage wheels extensively in deep underground mines, one device being the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]. They were the first to apply [[hydraulic mining]] methods for prospecting for metal ores, and for extracting those ores from the ground when found using a method known as [[hushing]].

Roman engineers build [[monumental arches]], [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|public baths]], [[Roman bridge|true arch bridges]], [[harbour]]s, [[List of Roman dams|dam]]s, vaults and [[List of Roman domes|domes]] on a very large scale across their Empire. Notable Roman inventions include the [[Codex|book (Codex)]], [[glass blowing]] and [[concrete]]. Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the [[concrete]] which the Romans formulated was especially durable. Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day. Roman society had also carried over the design of a door lock with tumblers and springs from Greece. Like many other aspects of innovation and culture that were carried on from Greece to Rome, the lines between where each one originated from have become skewed over time. These mechanisms were highly sophisticated and intricate for the era.&lt;ref&gt;Naif A. Haddad, "Critical Review, Assessment and Investigation of Ancient Technology Evolution of Door Locking Mechanisms in S.E. Mediterranean," ''Mediterranean Archaeology &amp; Archaeometry'' 16, no. 1: 43-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman civilization was highly urbanized by pre-modern standards. Many cities of the [[Roman Empire]] had over 100,000 inhabitants with the capital Rome being the largest metropolis of antiquity. Features of Roman urban life included multistory apartment buildings called [[Insula (building)|insulae]], street paving, public flush toilets, glass windows and [[Hypocaust|floor and wall heating]]. The Romans understood [[hydraulics]] and constructed [[fountain]]s and waterworks, particularly [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]]s, which were the hallmark of their civilization. They exploited water power by building [[water mill]]s, sometimes in series, such as the sequence found at [[Barbegal]] in southern France and suspected on the [[Janiculum]] in Rome. Some [[Thermae|Roman baths]] have lasted to this day. The Romans developed many technologies which were apparently lost in the [[Middle Ages]], and were only fully reinvented in the 19th and 20th centuries. They also left texts describing their achievements, especially [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Frontinus]] and [[Vitruvius]].

Other less known Roman innovations include [[cement]], boat mills, arch [[dam]]s and possibly [[tide mill]]s.

== Mesoamerica &amp; Andean Region ==
Lacking suitable beasts of burden and inhabiting domains often too mountainous or boggy for wheeled transport, the ancient civilizations of the Americas did not develop wheeled transport or the mechanics associated with animal power. Nevertheless, they produced advanced engineering including above ground and underground acqeducts, quake-proof masonry, artificial lakes, dykes, 'fountains,' pressurized water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://live.psu.edu/story/46532 |title=Maya plumbing, first pressurized water feature found in New World |author=A’ndrea Messer |date=February 8, 2011 |website=Penn State News |access-date=August 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208225152/http://live.psu.edu/story/46532 |archive-date=2013-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; road ways and complex terracing. Equally, gold-working commenced early in Peru (2000 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archaeology.about.com/b/2008/03/31/the-first-gold-working-in-peru.htm | archive-date=April 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412174748/http://archaeology.about.com/b/2008/03/31/the-first-gold-working-in-peru.htm |title=A Walking Tour of Machu Picchu, Peru |author=K. Kris Hirst |date= |website= about.com |access-date= August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually copper, tin, lead and bronze were used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Although metallurgy did not spread to Mesoamerica until the Middle Ages, it was employed here and in the Andes for sophisticated alloys and gilding. The Native Americans developed a complex understanding of the chemical properties or utility of natural substances, with the result that a majority of the world's early medicinal drugs and edible crops, many important adhesives, paints, fibres, plasters, and other useful items were the products of these civilizations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Perhaps the best-known Mesoamerican invention was rubber, which was used to create rubber bands, rubber bindings, balls, syringes, 'raincoats,' boots, and waterproof insulation on containers and flasks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2465">'''Automotive Skills Limited''' is an English [[registered charity]] and one of 25 [[Sector Skills Councils]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20021201141235/http://sscalliance.org/] (SSC), responsible for the retail motor industry, awarded a licensed by the then secretary of state at the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]], the Rt Hon [[Charles Clarke]] MP, in February 2004 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070204154022/http://www.automotiveskills.org.uk/auto/docs/Licence%20Release.pdf].

==History==
The SSC suffered a fraud at the hands of its finance manager, which was discovered in 2006 [http://www.lynnnews.co.uk/news?articleid=2939241]. Subsequently, Automotive Skills' SSC license was transferred to the Institute of the Motor Industry in September 2007 [https://web.archive.org/web/20071008141043/http://www.motor.org.uk/news/articles/imi-will-focus-on-five-big-wins-as-the-new-sector-skills-council-331.html][https://web.archive.org/web/20071114073914/http://www.motortrader.com/25831/IMI-named-as-government-sector.ehtml].  The Institute uses the Automotive Skills brand, although the separate charity still exists [http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?remchar=&amp;chyno=1015461].

The SSC had a contract with the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA)[http://www.ssda.org.uk/], which was replaced by the [[UK Commission for Employment and Skills]] (UKCES)[http://www.ukces.org.uk/] on 1 April 2008.  One role of the UKCES will be to manage the performance of the [[Sector Skills Councils]], advising Ministers on their re-licensing [https://web.archive.org/web/20080531122927/http://www.ukces.org.uk/default.aspx?page=1].

The members of Automotive Skills Limited appointed liquidators PJ Clark and PD Williams of corporate restructuring organisation MCR [http://www.mcr.uk.com/], on 24 July 2008 [http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/issues/58787/pages/11884].

==Structure==
It was headquartered in [[Brickendon]] in [[Hertfordshire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2131">The '''Belgian Historical Institute in Rome''' ({{lang-nl|Belgisch Historisch Instituut te Rome}}, {{lang-fr|Institut historique belge de Rome}}, {{lang-it|Istituto storico belga di Roma}}), founded 1902, is a scholarly research institute focused on the study of Roman, and more broadly Italian, history and antiquities. It is currently located in the [[Academia Belgica]] and is one of a number of [[Roman Historical Institutes]].

==Foundation==
The idea for the foundation of a Belgian historical institute in Rome for the identification and publishing of Italian sources relating to Belgian history came from the ecclesiastical historian [[Alfred Cauchie]], professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834-1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]].&lt;ref&gt;http://kadoc.kuleuven.be/bhir-ihbr/en/2_org_hist_sub1.php&lt;/ref&gt; He published a pamphlet to this effect in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Cauchie, ''De la création d'une école Belge à Rome'' (Tournai, 1896).&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was founded in 1902, in the [[Palazzo Rusticucci-Accoramboni]], with [[Ursmer Berlière]] as its first director.

==Publications==
The institute has a strong focus on the publication of historical sources, primarily in the series ''Analecta Vaticano-Belgica''.

The institute's ''Bulletin'' ceased publication in 2010 and has been replaced by a digital journal, ''Forum Romanum Belgicum''.

==Directors==
The directors of the institute have been the following:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.academiabelgica.it/documenti/Inventaire_de_lIHBR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biomarkers''' are chemicals, metabolites, susceptibility characteristics, or changes in the body that relate to the exposure of an organism to a chemical. They have the ability to identify if an exposure has occurred, the route of exposure, the pathway of exposure, and the resulting effects of the exposure. The use of biomarkers in exposure studies is also referred to as [[biomonitoring (chemistry)|biomonitoring]]. When dealing with exposure assessment, there are three types of biomarkers that can be useful, biomarkers of susceptibility, biomarkers of exposure, and biomarkers of effect. Biomarkers of exposure are the most widely used because they can provide information on the route, pathway, and sometimes, even the source of exposure.

==Biomarkers of susceptibility==
Biomarkers of susceptibility are indicators of the natural characteristics of an organism that make it more susceptible to the effects of an exposure to a chemical.  They can help define what sensitivities are more susceptible as well as critical times when exposures can be most detrimental.  For example, the exhalation strength of an asthmatic will indicate how susceptible that person would be to the respiratory effects of exposure to brevetoxin, the toxic compound produced during a red tide.

==Biomarkers of exposure==
Biomarkers of exposure are the actual chemicals, or chemical metabolites, that can be measured in the body or after excretion from the body to determine different characteristics of an organism’s exposure.  For example, a person or fish’s blood can be tested to see the levels of lead and therefore determine the exposure.

==Biomarkers of effect==
Biomarkers of effect are the quantifiable changes that an individual endures, which indicates an exposure to a compound and may indicate a resulting health effect.  For example, after exposure to [[DDT]], an [[organochlorine]] [[insecticide]] known to cause problems in the reproductive system, a woman may experience miscarriages, which can be linked to her previous exposure.

Biomarkers of exposure are the most widely used because they can provide information on the route, pathway, and sometimes, even the source of exposure.  These indicators also allow researchers to work forward in time to determine an exposure, and prevent it from causing further damage.  This is unlike biomarkers of effect, in which a scientist may work backwards to determine if and what kind of exposure took place, but may be too late to change anything.  However, biomarkers of effect are useful for future studies on the chemical(s) of interest and the results may aid in stricter laws or guidelines regarding the chemical(s).

Biomarkers must be evaluated in terms of their ability to predict and quantify exposure and dose.  There are certain properties that are desirable when linking a biomarker with an exposure.  These include high specificity (one exposure to one biomarker), linear relationship across time, strong correlation with a health effect, inexpensive study, and consistency (the same exposure will produce the same concentration of the biomarker every time).  Without these ideal characteristics, the use of biomarkers as a strong predictor of exposure has limitations.

Many different classes of compounds can be measured in different tissues and parts of the body.  From breath to hair to saliva, almost every tissue in the body has been tested as a biomarker of exposure and almost every major environmental pollutant can be identified by biomarkers, including volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and metals like arsenic or lead.  It all depends on the chemical structures and reactivity of the compound with the makeup of its storage space.  The following table identifies major environmental pollutants and their biomarker tissue or organ&lt;ref&gt;Ott, W. R., Steinemann, A. C., &amp; Wallace, L. A. (2007). Biomarkers of exposure. In W.

[[Cicero]]'s '''''Brutus''''' (also known as ''De claris oratibus'') is a history of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Eloquence|oratory]].  It is written in the form of a dialogue, in which [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]] ask Cicero to describe the qualities of all the leading Roman orators up to their time. Cicero then attempts to propose a reconstruction of Roman history.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brill's Companion to Cicero|last=May|first=James|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=9004121471|location=Netherlands|pages=401–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is written in the form of a dialogue, the majority of the talking is done by Cicero with occasional intervention by Brutus and Atticus. The work was probably composed in 46 BC, with the purpose of defending Cicero's own oratory. He begins with an introductory section on Greek oratory of the Attic, Asianic, and Rhodian schools, before discussing Roman orators, beginning with [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], "The Liberator", though becoming more specific from the time of [[Marcus Cornelius Cethegus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howatson|first1=M.C|last2=Chivers|first2=Ian|title=Oxford Concise Companion to Classical Literature|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192827081|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
'''''Cicero''''' -  He is the main figure of the work. He strengthens the idea that after the civil war, many of the "good" orators have either left or fled Rome. The few individuals who stayed behind are hiding in silence. Cicero recalls his visits to the forum and some of the orators he has been able to hear. He also mentions his study of eloquence and his dedication to philosophical studies.

'''''Brutus''''' ''-'' He is a friend of Atticus and a person who does not like eloquence.

'''''Atticus''''' - He is a friend of Brutus who encounters Cicero while walking somewhere. Cicero mentions that Atticus is from Athens when he discusses the beginnings of oratory. It should also be noted that Atticus speaks the least of all the three men.

== History of Eloquence ==
Cicero begins his work by lamenting the death of his friend [[Quintus Hortensius|Hortensius]] and then ponders on whether anyone should feel sad that his friend died. His dialogue then proceeds to the moment where he comes across Brutus and Atticus. They begin to discuss a letter that reveals that the Roman state has suffered numerous losses and that Rome is going through tumultuous times. Cicero proceeds and states that he wants to write a universal history of Roman oratory. Because of the fatal overthrow of the state, Cicero deems it necessary to write this '''history of eloquence'''. Cicero begins by stating that [[eloquence]] is a difficult thing to acquire and that it was first present in Atticus' hometown: [[Athens]]. Oratory does not appear in the infancy of Athens, but is evident in the maturity of her power. He traces oratory from figures such as [[Peisistratos]], [[Solon]], [[Pericles]], and mentions how figures like [[Socrates]] challenged them. He continues by saying that oratory was only limited to Athens and was not ubiquitous in Greece. It was from here that oratory spread through parts of Asia and the world.

Cicero then begins to trace the origins of oratory in [[Rome]]. He mentions figures like [[Manius Curius Dentatus|Curius,]] [[Marcus Popillius Laenas|M. Popilius]], [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica|Quinius Metellus]] and even discusses how [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] and [[Lysias]] the Athenian resemble each other in their elegance, character, and brevity. Cicero mentions the idea that Cato is overshadowed by other figures, but is still noteworthy. After Cato, a whole new bunch of orators appeared in Rome like Severius Galba. He also provides an example of how Galba was able to win over the court with an amazing, eloquent speech and that his people (in a court case) were freed from all charges.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cicero's Brutus or History of Famous Orators|last=Jones|first=E.|publisher=AMS Press New York|year=|isbn=0-404-54106-2|location=|pages=1–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the ''Brutus'' ==
Cicero's work is typically seen as a list of orators and the development of oratory in Rome. While the purpose of the Brutus is to record the history of oratory and confirm that it has failed to exist, some scholars believe that Cicero fails in adequately achieving his task. This is a problem because Cicero fails to include a reliable list of Roman oratory by purposely omitting figures like [[Gaius Marius|Marius]], [[Sulla]], [[Catiline]], and [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steel|first=C.E.W.|date=2002–2003|title=Cicero's Brutus: The End of Oratory and the Beginning of History?|jstor=43646670|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies|volume=46|pages=195–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars also argue that the ''Brutus'' is not a complete list because Cicero fails to include himself in his list.

Another interesting criticism of the Brutus is that it lacks minuscule scene details. The work only thoroughly describes the garden and the statue of Plato where the three men plan to discuss oratory, but other than that, the work is devoid of other details. Whereas the scenery lacks details, the conversation does not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{lowercase}}

'''bya''' or '''b.y.a.''' is an [[abbreviation]] for "'''[[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years ago'''". It is commonly used as a [[unit of time]] to denote length of time before the present in 10&lt;SUP&gt;9&lt;/SUP&gt; years. This [[Acronym#Nomenclature|initialism]] is often used in the sciences of [[astronomy]], [[geology]], and [[paleontology]].

The "billion" in bya is the 10&lt;SUP&gt;9&lt;/SUP&gt; "billion" of the [[Long and short scales|short scale]] of the [[United States|U.S.]],&lt;ref name="Gale2009"&gt;Gale, Joseph (2009). ''Astrobiology of Earth: The Emergence''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=64zn0nxDVUYC&amp;pg=PA21 21.]&lt;/ref&gt; not the long-scale 10&lt;SUP&gt;12&lt;/SUP&gt; "billion" of some [[Europe]]an usage. Billion by this convention (10&lt;SUP&gt;9&lt;/SUP&gt;) is often called a "thousand million" in the UK and a "milliard" in some other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Chartrand, Mark (2004). ''Satellite Communications for the Nonspecialist''. New York: SPIE Press, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MM0d2cMUWbEC&amp;pg=PA73 73.]&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, there is potential for some confusion, and some scientists prefer the unit [[Gya]], while others prefer [[Giga-annum|Ga]] (Giga-annum), however bya remains in more widespread use.&lt;ref name="Gale2009"/&gt; In 1974, the UK switched from the long scale to the short scale.&lt;ref name="Gale2009"/&gt;

Related units are [[Mya (unit)|mya]] ("million years ago"), and '''byr''' ("billion years"). These are traditionally written in [[lowercase]].  [[Giga-annum|Ga]] or Gya has a [[capitalization|capitalized]] first letter instead.

'''Central Cotton Research Institute Multan''', established in 1976 in [[Multan]], [[Pakistan]], is one of the renowned  research institutes of [[Pakistan]]. The institute has many divisions dedicated to different aspects of cotton research including [[Agronomy]], [[plant breeding|Breeding]] and [[Genetics]], [[Cytogenetics]], [[Physiology]], Fiber Technology, [[Statistics]] and [[Agricultural Engineering]].
Over the years, many achievements have been made in the development of high yielding varieties with standard fibre quality characteristics like staple length, fineness and strength etc. The fine tuning of production technology at the grass-root level of common farming community to the progressive farmers has made tremendous impact on enhancing cotton productivity.

At the time of establishment of the Institute in 1970, the cotton productivity was 370&amp;nbsp;kg per hectare which has now risen to the level of 772&amp;nbsp;kg per hectare during the current year. The continuous and untiring research endeavors of the scientists have yielded 20 cotton varieties (17 Non-Bt and 03 Bt). The introduction of efficient water use technologies i.e. bed-furrow sowing technique, identification of water stress &amp; heat tolerant cotton varieties and other water saving techniques were advocated to the farmers to economize cotton production. 
Salient features of five new varieties viz. CIM-612, Cyto-124, Bt.CIM-600, Bt.CIM-616 and Bt.Cyto-177 were presented in the 71st Meeting of the Expert Sub Committee held at Ayub Agricultural Research Institute, Faisalabad on 09.03.2015. Apart from having up to the standard fibre quality traits, Bt.CIM-600 is tolerant to heat stress whereas Bt.CIM-616, CIM-612 and Bt.Cyto-177 are highly CLCuV tolerant with promising yield potential.

The Institute has made tremendous efforts in popularizing the technology for herbicide use in weed management. The continuous research on screening of weedicides and fine tuning of their application techniques (pre- and post-emergence) is another milestone of this Institute. The quantification of optimized fertilizer levels, application methodologies for efficient utilization and exploring the alternate nutrient sources remained as a continuous endeavor to achieve yield sustainability. The technique of plant mapping, disseminated from this Institute, for forecasting/ estimating yield potential is being practiced by the various research, academia and government departments. 
In the field of plant protection, the invasion of secondary pests like mealybug, dusky cotton bug and red cotton bug are becoming potential threats to achieve yield targets. A due attention is being made to devise pest management strategies to tackle these emerging pests. In the scenario of extended Bt cotton cultivation, the research has been diverted towards this new dimension for controlling sucking pests and studies on resistance management accrued due to inbuilt bollworm resistance in cotton plant. 
The country has suffered huge financial losses due to yield reduction in cotton crop caused by the wide scale infestation of cotton leaf curl virus (CLCuV) disease. Accepting this hard challenge, the scientists at the Institute were able to evolve varieties through introgression that have a high degree of tolerance to CLCuV. A variety Cyto-124, which is recently recommended by Expert Sub Committee, has shown its stability towards virus tolerance in early as well as late sowing (March to June planting). A couple of more promising genotypes (Cyto-120 &amp; Cyto-122) are in pipeline. The contribution in the development of disease resistance is the outcome of continuous involvement by the Pathology Section for quantification and transformation of resistant character and its build up in the new genetic material.

The development of new varieties is based on the maintenance of high fibre quality traits to cope with the standards of the textile industry. The varieties released by the Institute are stable and maintain their fibre quality under various ecological zones. The Institute is at advanced level in developing transgenic cotton through classical breeding along with biotechnological tools. Results of the data gathered from the experiments and surveys cannot be deduced or inferred without the statistical analysis. The mass scale statistical analysis of data has made success to bring out this 44th Progress Report of the Institute. The results are not confined in the four-walls of the Institute. Message dissemination measures through print and electronic media, personal communication, training of farmers, field staff of seed, fertilizer and NGOs remained a regular phenomena throughout the year. Various programs are televised through TV channels based at Multan.

== Plant breeding and genetics ==
The main focus of the scientists of Breeding and Genetics Section, CCRI, Multan is to develop and commercialize Bt. and non-Bt. new cotton varieties with inbuilt resistance/tolerance against the biotic and abiotic stresses along with desirable fibre traits. Development of germplasm has a key role in the process of variety development. This section holds its own recognition in this aspect. Two Bt. varieties Bt. CIM-600, Bt. CIM-616 and one non Bt. Variety CIM-612 were submitted for approval to Expert Sub-Committee. Six advanced Bt. strains were evaluated at Multan and Khanewal locations. The new strain Bt.CIM-616 gave best performance at both the locations. The strain had the lint percentage of 41.7 with the staple length of 28.8&amp;nbsp;mm and [[micronaire]] of 4.7&amp;nbsp;µg inch-1. The fibre strength of the strain is very good up to 100.3 tppsi. Seven advanced non-Bt. strains were also evaluated at Multan and Khanewal locations. The new strain CIM-716 produced the highest seed cotton yield on overall basis. All these strains have the desirable fibre characteristics. The crosses with exotic material (AS-0349) from France and Mac-7 for induction of CLCuD resistant/tolerance are in different filial generations.

== Cytogenetics ==
The intent was to travel around the possibilities of transferring enviable genes of the wild species to the cultivated cotton for commercial exploitation and to study inter and intra-genomic relationships in the genus Gossypium. The research work of Cytogenetics Section encompass maintenance of Gossypium germplasm to develop promising varieties, through introgression, which are resistant/tolerant to biotic (diseases) and abiotic (drought, heat) stresses with special hub on Burewala Strain of cotton leaf curl virus. Cytological studies of a newly developed inter-specific hybrid was undertaken. The material industrial through multiple species hybridization viz F7 of [{2(G.hirs.x G.anom.) x 3G.hirs.} x {2 (G.arbo. x G.anom.) x 2G.hirs.}] x G. hirs. were sown in single lines. Out of the 286 families 90 families remained free from virus under field conditions throughout the entire cotton season. Conversion of CLCuD tolerant lines in transgenic lines using back cross method is under observation in different filial generations i.e. F1, F2, F3, F4and F5.
Different shades of brown cotton were observed in F2 .Grey colour is also found in this material. All these shades have suitable fibre length. Search for aneuploids especially haploids remained in steps forward. Cyto material developed through multiple species hybridization was tested in progeny row trials, micro-varietal trials, Micro varietal trials and ZVT to observe their economic and fibre characteristics.
Bt Cyto-177and Cyto-124 (non Bt), varieties developed through introgression has been sent for recommendation to Expert Sub Committee on 9 March 2015. Both lines have completed two years in NCVT, PCCT, ZVT and DGR trials for its wider adaptability in different ecological zones. Cyto-179 will be tested in NCVT, PCCT and ZVT trials for its wider adoptability in different ecological zones.

== Agronomy  ==
Cotton agronomy fixes special significance in utilizing natural resources in the best available management techniques for achieving higher productivity in certain agro-ecological zones. The research carried out showed that planting of cotton in the second week of April is the best choice for achieving higher production. The delaying in planting time results in the successive decrease in yield. Genotypes CIM-608 produced higher yield over CIM-620 and Cyto-124. Application of 200&amp;nbsp;kg N ha-1 to non Bt. cotton gave non significant increase in seed cotton yield over 150&amp;nbsp;kg N ha-1. The research findings showed that planting of transgenic cotton on 1 March produced the highest yield as compared to other planting dates i.e. 15 March, 1 April, 15 April, 1 &amp; 15 May. Genotype Bt.CIM-616 produced significantly higher seed cotton yield as compared to Bt.Cyto-177 and Bt.CIM-598 (std). Nitrogenous fertilizer @ 400&amp;nbsp;kg ha-1 produced significantly higher seed cotton yield in transgenic cotton over 300&amp;nbsp;kg N ha-1.
The result revealed that cotton planting as relay crop (75&amp;nbsp;cm apart rows) produced maximum seed cotton yield (4618&amp;nbsp;kg ha-1) than fallow land early planting (4086&amp;nbsp;kg ha-1). Planting of cotton under modified technique (Relay crop 75&amp;nbsp;cm apart rows) produced 13, 99.5 and 105.3% higher cotton yield over fallow land, wide row (150&amp;nbsp;cm) and after wheat harvesting, respectively. The cost of production for the year 2014-15 was Rs. 73907 ac-1.

==  Entomology  ==
Plant protection strategy and activities have significant importance in the overall crop production programmes for sustainable agriculture. Variation of Bt gene expression in different cultivars over time and efficacy to bollworms are the main concern nowadays, studies undertaken on Earias spp proved the concerned. Similarly the efficacy of Bt cotton in the field is losing efficacy against the pink bollworm, survey conducted revealed high infestations in green bolls. Monitoring of lepidopterous pest population viz sex pheromone and light traps was carried out and forecast the increasing trend in all bollworms population. Studies on red and dusky cotton bugs continued and efforts are made to find bio agents for long term solutions. Seed treatment effect and development of natural on early and normal planting studies revealed that the population of jassid was more on early sown field than normal sowing also the natural fauna was recorded higher in the early sown. The distinct efforts of researchers of the section have proved meaningful in devising pest management strategies against common and new emerging insect pests through application of IPM. Studies are continued on host plant tolerance of CCRI, Multan and National Coordinated Bt. &amp; non-Bt. Strains. The section also studied effect of different IPM strategies on insect pest for transgenic cotton. Screening of new insecticides was also conducted against major insect pests of cotton.

== Fiber technology ==
Fibre Technology section was established in 1976. The prime objective of Fibre Technology section is to provide technical support to Plant Breeding &amp; Cytogenetics sections in testing of fibre characteristics and spinning potential of newly developed cotton cultivars &amp; strains and facilitates the other sections of the institute as well, to investigate the effect of different agricultural practices on fibre characteristics. The section is extending services to other cotton research stations of PCCC, Government &amp; private cotton agencies, commercial organizations, textile industry, progressive growers and providing research facilities and technical support to the research scholars from various textile institutes and universities in fibre testing and spinning of their research material. Apart from lab work, the section is also contributes in collaborative research studies with different sections of the institute. 
Testing Facilities
Fibre technology section is equipped with sophisticated and scientific fibre testing instruments and micro-spinning facility.

== Plant pathology  ==
The admirable collaboration and cooperation provided by this Section to Plant Breeding &amp; Genetics and Cytogenetics disciplines has overlaid in the development of virus resistance varieties. The survey during the crop season revealed that virus was prevalent across the belt. However under various agronomic practices and change in weather conditions CLCuD ranged from 0-100 percent. The incidence of stunting and boll rot was minimal. The material tested under VT, MVT. NCVT (Bt &amp; Non-Bt), NBCT, PCCT (Bt &amp; Non-Bt), and SVT were found susceptible, at various intensity levels, to CLCuD except one strains, which showed resistance. One thousand fifty US-germplasm tested under field condition, only 114 accessions show resistant against CLCuD. The cultivation of cotton of Bt-cotton in March and non-Bt in mid April escaped from virus to some extent while the crop planted beyond May fell prey to virus attack. The pattern of appearance of CLCuD and its progression during the crop season differed greatly with planting dates. The low incidence of the disease was due to planting of CIM-616 and Cyto-124. The fortnightly incidence of disease when compare with weather parameters i.e. average maximum temperature from 35.2 to 36.8&amp;nbsp;°C minimum temperature from 27.4 to 29.5&amp;nbsp;°C and relative humidity in the range of 71.2 to 81.4% at peak of CLCuD which helps for fortnightly increase of CLCuD, during mid-June to mid-August. Pantoa agglomeran reduces the seed quality and quantity in cotton rotted bolls. Streptomycin at different doses found effective to control this bacteria. Seed rottening decreased with increase of soil temperature and fungicide (Dynasty) gave minimum seed rottening in all sowing dates.

== Plant physiology ==
This section was established in 1970 with the aim to conduct basic research on physiology and nutrition of cotton crop. Since its establishment, the main focus of research scientists has been on the screening of cotton strains/varieties for thermal and water stress tolerance, integrated nutrient management, fertilizer application strategies to improve nutrient use efficiency and fertilizer use economics, soil health improvement, amino acids and growth regulators, biosafety studies of Bt cotton and seed physiology. The scientists of the section try their best to increase cotton production by managing the soil, plant and seed related problems through a coordinated approach. Apart from the allocated experimental area for field trials, the Physiology/Chemistry Section has well equipped laboratories for qualitative and quantitative studies such as pH and EC meters, flame photometers, double beam spectrophotometer, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, ICP, HPLC, GC’s, pressure chamber for leaf water potential, Osmometer, Photosynthesis measuring system, Micro Kjeldahl apparatus, centrifuges, water baths, hot plate, Soxhlet’s apparatus, Muffle furnace and sample grinding machines etc.

== Statistics ==
Statistics section is assigned the job of helping other sections in designing layout for trials and analysis of the research data. This facility is also provided to all research stations established by PCCC. Lay out for National Coordinated Variety Trials (NCVT) are prepared for Directorate of Research. Data of NCVT are statistically analyzed for Director Research, PCCC, Multan. Daily market rates of cotton commodities are documented.

== Transfer of technology ==
Transfer of Technology Section played a significant role in the dissemination of latest research practices/findings for profitable cotton production technology to all private and public sectors. The research findings are disseminated with the usage of electronic and print media during the cropping season and also in the off-season. Training/refresher courses were conducted for knowledge enhancement and skill development farmers and field officers of pesticide/seed industry. Cotton Crop Management Group (CCMG) Meetings were regularly held at the institute that helped in reviewing cotton crop situation and the devise of measures which should be adopted at gross root level through the intervention of Agriculture Department. A large number of printed materials were distributed among the extension workers, farmers and visitors of the institute during the season. Furthermore, a number of programs for general awareness/skill development in cotton production were taken up through Radio &amp; TV programs.

[[File:Charles Eamer Kempe, 1860.jpg|thumb|upright|Kempe in 1860]]

'''Charles Eamer Kempe''' (29 June 1837 – 29 April 1907) was a Victorian designer and manufacturer of [[stained glass]]. His studios produced over 4,000 windows and also designs for altars and altar frontals, furniture and furnishings, lichgates and memorials that helped to define a later nineteenth-century Anglican style. The list of English cathedrals containing examples of his work includes: [[Chester Cathedral|Chester]], [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]], [[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]], [[Lichfield Cathedral|Lichfield]], [[Wells Cathedral|Wells]], [[Winchester Cathedral|Winchester]] and [[York Minster|York]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:York Minster - RWB Hornby Window.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert William Bilton Hornby|R.W.B. Hornby]] memorial window at York Minster]]
Charles Kempe was born at Ovingdean Hall, near [[Brighton]], [[East Sussex]] in 1837. He was the youngest son of Nathaniel Kemp, a cousin of [[Thomas Read Kemp]], a politician and property developer responsible for the [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]] area of Brighton&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Kempe added the ‘e’ to his name in adult life&lt;/ref&gt; and the maternal grandson of Sir [[John Eamer]], who served as [[Lord Mayor of London]] in 1801.

After attending [[Twyford School]], he attended [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] where he was influenced by the [[Oxford Movement|Anglo-Catholic Tractarian]] revival and considered a vocation to the priesthood. When it became clear that his severe [[stammer]] would be an impediment to preaching Kempe decided that "if I was not permitted to minister in the Sanctuary I would use my talents to adorn it", and subsequently went to study [[architecture]] with the firm of a leading ecclesiastical architect [[George Frederick Bodley]], where he learned the aesthetic principles of medieval church art, particularly stained glass. During the 1860s Kempe collaborated with Bodley on the internal painting of two churches, [[All Saints Church, Cambridge|All Saints, Jesus Lane]] in [[Cambridge]] and [[Church of Saint John the Baptist, Liverpool|St John’s]], [[Tuebrook]] in [[Liverpool]]. Later, in 1892, Bodley and Kempe would work together once more on All Saints at [[Danehill, East Sussex|Danehill]], [[East Sussex]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Kempe Studios ==
[[File:Kempe maker's mark.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Kempe company maker's mark, the Wheatsheaf, on a window in [[St Mary's Church, Nottingham]]]]
In 1866 he opened a studio of his own in [[London]], supplying and creating stained glass and furnishings and [[vestment]]s. The firm prospered and by 1899 he had over fifty employees. As a [[trademark]], the firm used a golden ''garb'' or wheatsheaf, taken from Kempe's own [[coat of arms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LlQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA471&amp;lpg=PA471&amp;dq=%22garb%20or%22|title=The baronetage of England, or, The history of the English baronets, and such baronets of Scotland, as are of English families|first=rev William|last=Betham|date=1 January 1801|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-Victorian period were important years in the history of the design of English churches and Kempe’s influence is found in numerous examples, many in his home county of Sussex which has 116 examples of his work.&lt;ref&gt;The Corpus of Kempe Stained Glass, editor Philip N.H. Collins, The Kempe Trust, 2000,&lt;/ref&gt; The works at St Mark’s, [[Staplefield]] near [[Horsham]], [[West Sussex]] dating from 1869 are regarded as especially important, representing the earliest of three known examples of Kempe’s wall painting.&lt;ref&gt;http://southdownsliving.blogspot.com/2010/04/kempe-wall-paintings-st-marks-church.html Information on Kempe wall paintings at St Mark’s,  Staplefield&lt;/ref&gt; They contain key elements of Kempe’s figurative work. The angels holding the scroll are magnificently apparelled and the borders of their cloaks are embellished with pearls, each individually highlighted although they do not contain a design of peacock feathers, a well used embellishment in later works. [[Rosalie Glynn Grylls]], [[Mander family|Lady Mander]], whose home [[Wightwick Manor]], near [[Wolverhampton]], contains many pieces of Kempe's stained glass, wrote in 1973:
"Kempe's work has a unique charm; its colours shine out from jewels that cluster on the [[mitre]]s or the [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] his figures wear and from their [[peacock]]s' feathers, while [[angel]]s playing their instruments are drawn with tender delicacy and scattered above the main windows informally but making a pattern of precision. Above all, the prevailing yellow wash is literally translucent, for it lets through the rays of the full or the setting sun..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owlpen.com/wightwick.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322231351/http://www.owlpen.com/wightwick.shtml |archivedate=22 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Information on Wightwick Manor&lt;/ref&gt;

On Kempe’s death in 1907 in accordance with his will the firm was reformed as C. E Kempe &amp; Co. Ltd and Kempe's distant cousin, Walter Earnest Tower (1873–1955), was appointed Chairman. Tower thenceforth used a black tower above the golden garb. A lack of orders caused by the [[Great Depression]] ended the firm's life in 1934.

==Personal life==
Kempe was a rather shy person, who never married. He continued to live in Sussex most of his life and in 1875 he bought and renovated an Elizabethan House at [[Lindfield, West Sussex|Lindfield]], near [[Haywards Heath]] in West Sussex. Kempe would entertain his clients and professional colleagues from his home enjoying the role of a country squire.

Kempe died suddenly on 28 April 1907 aged 69, at 28 Nottingham Place, London, having caught a cold that led to congestion of the lung and refused to get medical help. He 
is buried in the churchyard at [[St Wulfran's Church, Ovingdean]].&lt;ref name="Dale207"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |page=207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, most of Kempe's records were disposed of after the firm shut in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;M.

{{English grammar}}

In [[corpus linguistics]], a '''collocation''' is a sequence of words or [[terminology|terms]] that [[co-occurrence|co-occur]] more often than would be expected by chance. In [[phraseology]], '''collocation''' is a sub-type of [[phraseme]]. An example of a phraseological collocation, as propounded by  [[Michael Halliday]],&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K., 'Lexis as a Linguistic Level', Journal of Linguistics 2(1) 1966: 57-67&lt;/ref&gt; is the expression ''strong tea''. While the same meaning could be conveyed by the roughly equivalent ''powerful tea'', this expression is considered excessive and awkward by English speakers. Conversely, the corresponding expression in technology, ''powerful computer'' is preferred over ''strong computer''. Phraseological collocations should not be confused with [[idiom]]s, where an idiom's meaning is derived from its convention as a stand-in for something else while collocation is a mere popular composition.

There are about six main types of collocations: adjective+noun, noun+noun (such as [[collective nouns]]), verb+noun, adverb+adjective, verbs+prepositional phrase ([[phrasal verb]]s), and verb+adverb.

[[Collocation extraction]] is a computational technique that finds collocations in a document or corpus, using various [[computational linguistics]] elements resembling [[data mining]].

==Expanded definition==
Collocations are partly or fully fixed expressions that become established through repeated context-dependent use. Such terms as 'crystal clear', 'middle management', 'nuclear family', and 'cosmetic surgery' are examples of collocated pairs of words.

Collocations can be in a [[syntax|syntactic]] relation (such as [[subject–verb–object|verb–object]]: 'make' and 'decision'), [[lexicon|lexical]] relation (such as [[antonymy]]), or they can be in no linguistically defined relation.  Knowledge of collocations is vital for the competent use of a language: a [[grammar|grammatically]] correct sentence will stand out as awkward if collocational preferences are violated.  This makes collocation an interesting area for language teaching. Recently, a mobile version of Collocation Dictionary was published on Google Play.&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.idiotsapps.oxford.collocation.dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Corpus linguists specify a [[Keyword (linguistics)|key word]] in context ([[key word in context|KWIC]]) and identify the words immediately surrounding them.  This gives an idea of the way words are used.

The processing of collocations involves a number of parameters, the most important of which is the ''measure of association'', which evaluates whether the [[co-occurrence]] is purely by chance or statistically [[Statistical significance|significant]].  Due to the non-random nature of language, most collocations are classed as significant, and the association scores are simply used to rank the results.  Commonly used measures of association include [[mutual information]], [[Student's t-test|t scores]], and [[log-likelihood]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, Ted (1993): "[http://aclweb.org/anthology/J/J93/J93-1003.pdf Accurate methods for the statistics of surprise and coincidence]". [[Computational Linguistics (journal)|Computational Linguistics]] 19, 1 (Mar. 1993), 61-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tdunning.blogspot.com/2008/03/surprise-and-coincidence.html |title=Surprise and Coincidence |author=Dunning, Ted|date=2008-03-21 |publisher=blogspot.com |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than select a single definition, Gledhill&lt;ref&gt;Gledhill C. (2000): Collocations in Science Writing, Narr, Tübingen&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that collocation involves at least three different perspectives: (i) co-occurrence, a statistical view, which sees collocation as the recurrent appearance in a text of a node and its collocates,&lt;ref&gt;Firth J.R. (1957): Papers in Linguistics 1934–1951. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair J. (1996): "The Search for Units of Meaning", in Textus, IX, 75–106.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smadja F. A &amp; McKeown, K. R. (1990): "[http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P90/P90-1032.pdf Automatically extracting and representing collocations for language generation]", Proceedings of ACL'90, 252–259, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) construction, which sees collocation either as a correlation between a lexeme and a lexical-grammatical pattern,&lt;ref&gt;Hunston S. &amp; Francis G. (2000): Pattern Grammar — A Corpus-Driven Approach to the Lexical Grammar of English, Amsterdam, John Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt; or as a relation between a base and its collocative partners&lt;ref&gt;Hausmann F. J. (1989): Le dictionnaire de collocations. In Hausmann F.J., Reichmann O., Wiegand H.E., Zgusta L.(eds), Wörterbücher : ein internationales Handbuch zur Lexikographie. Dictionaries. Dictionnaires. Berlin/New-York : De Gruyter. 1010-1019.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) expression, a pragmatic view of collocation as a conventional unit of expression, regardless of form.&lt;ref&gt;
Moon R. (1998): Fixed Expressions and Idioms, a Corpus-Based Approach. Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frath P. &amp; Gledhill C. (2005): "Free-Range Clusters or Frozen Chunks? Reference as a Defining Criterion for Linguistic Units," in Recherches anglaises et Nord-américaines, vol. 38 :25–43&lt;/ref&gt; It should be pointed out here that these different perspectives contrast with the usual way of presenting collocation in phraseological studies. Traditionally speaking, collocation is explained in terms of all three perspectives at once, in a continuum:

:'Free Combination' ↔ 'Bound Collocation' ↔ 'Frozen Idiom'

==In dictionaries==

In 1933, [[Harold E. Palmer|Harold Palmer]]'s ''Second Interim Report on English Collocations'' highlighted the importance of collocation as a key to producing natural-sounding language, for anyone learning a [[foreign language]].&lt;ref&gt;Cowie, A.P., English Dictionaries for Foreign Learners, Oxford University Press 1999:54-56&lt;/ref&gt; Thus from the 1940s onwards, information about recurrent word combinations became a standard feature of [[Monolingual learner's dictionary|monolingual learner's dictionaries]]. As these dictionaries became 'less word-centred and more phrase-centred',&lt;ref&gt;Bejoint, H., The Lexicography of English, Oxford University Press 2010: 318&lt;/ref&gt; more attention was paid to collocation. This trend was supported, from the beginning of the 21st century, by the availability of large text [[Corpus linguistics|corpora]] and intelligent [[Text_mining|corpus-querying software]], making possible to provide a more systematic account of collocation in dictionaries. Using these tools, dictionaries such as the ''[[Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners|Macmillan English Dictionary]]'' and the ''[[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]]'' included boxes or panels with lists of frequent collocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaries.com/about/med/key-features-of-the-macmillan-english-dictionary-second-edition/#7|title=MED Second Edition - Key features - Macmillan|work=macmillandictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of [[Specialized dictionary|specialized dictionaries]] devoted to describing the frequent collocations in a language.&lt;ref&gt;Herbst, T. and Klotz, M. 'Syntagmatic and Phraseological Dictionaries' in Cowie, A.P. (Ed.) The Oxford History of English Lexicography, 2009: part 2, 234-243&lt;/ref&gt; These include (for Spanish) ''Redes: Diccionario combinatorio del español contemporaneo'' (2004),  (for French) ''Le Robert: Dictionnaire des combinaisons de mots'' (2007), and (for English) the ''LTP Dictionary of Selected Collocations'' (1997) and the ''Macmillan Collocations Dictionary'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaries.com/features/how-dictionaries-are-written/macmillan-collocations-dictionary/|title=Macmillan Collocation Dictionary - How it was written  - Macmillan|work=macmillandictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistically significant collocation ==
[[Student's t-test]] can be used to determine whether the occurrence of a collocation in a corpus is statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing|last=Manning|first=Chris|last2=Schütze|first2=Hinrich|publisher=MIT Press|year=1999|isbn=0262133601|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=163–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[bigram]] &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;P(w_1) = \frac{\#w_1}{N}&lt;/math&gt; be the unconditional probability of occurrence of &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; in a corpus with size &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;P(w_2) = \frac{\#w_2}{N}&lt;/math&gt; be the unconditional probability of occurrence of &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt; in the corpus. Then the t-score for the bigram &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt; is calculated as:

&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{N}}}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \frac{\# w_iw_j}{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample mean of the occurrence of &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\#w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt; is the number of occurrences of &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu = P(w_i)P(w_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of &lt;math&gt;w_1w_2&lt;/math&gt; under the null-hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt; appear independently in the text, and &lt;math&gt;s^2 = \bar{x}(1-\bar{x}) \approx \bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample variance. With a large &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the t-test is equivalent to a [[z-test]].

'''Sarajevo Summer Law School''' is a project organized by the [[European Law Students' Association]] (ELSA) in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

[http://www.summerschoolsineurope.eu/course/4423/media-law-and-role-of-media-in-armed-conflicts]
ELSA summer law schools are organized like seven-day international schools on certain topics in science domains, guided by ideas which are helpful to youth in their academic, but in business upgrade too.

== Idea of project ==

Idea about the project of Sarajevo Summer Law School comes from Darko Dizdarević who was Vice President S&amp;C of ELSA B&amp;H at the moment of its foundation in 2013. The purpose is to expand the knowledge in the area of law through lectures of recognized experts and to gather students from different countries in Europe to exchange their opinions and to create effective network.

== Founders ==

Beside Darko, other founders of Sarajevo Summer Law School are: Nihad Odobašić, Mirza Hebib, Harun Išerić, Amina Mašović, Enida Šačirović, Ana-Maria Paponja, Nasir Muftić, Ajdina Batalović, Emina Agić, Muhamed Tulić.

[http://www.summerschoolsineurope.eu/course/4423/media-law-and-role-of-media-in-armed-conflicts]
Main ideas which characterize this project are knowledge expansion of students about certain law theme which is a base of entire project, education and progressional upgrade of students who participate in project, linking, at the same time, students from all over Europe because of networking as the main goal. ELSA summer law schools are held in summer, and gather approximately 40-50 participants. Inspired by this, ELSA B&amp;H decided to start this unique project, with aim to give unique opportunity to law students from B&amp;H and the other starters across Europe who are going to participate in this project, then to increase academic standard in B&amp;H which did not include an opportunity of additional education on this way, and to improve reputation, structure and organization of ELSA B&amp;H.

== First Sarajevo Summer Law School ==

Lectures in Sarajevo, Municipality of Old Town.jpg |thumb| Lectures in Sarajevo, Municipality of Old Town, 2013, academic program
In 2014, ELSA Bosnia and Herzegovina organized the first Summer Law School on the topic ''Media Law and International Standards on Information Access''. This school was the first law school of this type organized by students in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The idea for this project was created as a result of the need of a detailed and clear proposal solutions of unarranged domain access to information and abuse of media rights to the detriment of conscientious citizens.The school attracted around 40 students from 15 different countries, who had lectures for seven days (7–14 August) at the School of Economics and Business in Sarajevo. Recognized lecturers and experts such as: MSc Dunja Mijatović (The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media), MSc Amer Džihana (Internews BiH), MSc Kristina Ćendić (Internews BiH), Helena Mandić (Communications Regulatory Agency B&amp;H), DSc Marco Bellezza (Associate at Portolano Cavallo Studio Legale), DSc Oreste Pollicino (Bocconi University) and Anja Gengo (University of Sarajevo) attended.

== Second Sarajevo Summer Law School ==

After success of the first school, ELSA Bosnia and Herzegovina organized second Summer Law School in July 2015 on the topic " [http://sarajevosls.ba/?p=205 Media Law and Role of Media in Armed Conflicts "]. The focus remains on the field of Media Law, since this domain was highlighted as a focus programme of the ELSA International.

In existence and development of free democratic society media has an important role. Its original role as a mere transmitter of information in modern society is outdated. The formation of public opinion is considerably dependent on both the monitoring of information and its presentation in public. Growing power of media is evident and it reveals series of sensitive questions about legislation, such as freedom of expression, the right to information, the right to privacy, the right to honor and reputation, intellectual property rights, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Topic|url = http://sarajevosls.ba/?page_id=79|website = Sarajevo Summer Law School|access-date = 2016-01-31|language = en-US|last = elsasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Media law as a contemporary branch of law consolidates a large number of areas of law with radio and television, printed media, Internet and on-line services, various forms of entertainment, advertisements and marketing, as the subject to regulation. The interest of authority in this branch of law is significant since the trust and support of public are based on transparency and openness of decision-making process, which is provided by media. The topic of media law is very important and sensitive topic which is one of the reasons of it being selected as the topic of second Sarajevo Summer Law School. The biggest advantage of virtual communication is reflected in the two-way interactive communication, thus enabling denial of incorrect information. Another inevitable media is social media, a product of [[web 2.0]] , which accomplishes a complete democratization of data and information publishing. Nowadays, through social media people have the opportunity to globally affect messages, publish their attitudes, opinions and ideas. Information provided by these sites have had a significant role in the activism in recent years. The best example for that is [[Arab Spring]] in which these social media were used as the key tool for mobilization, training, forming the opinion and affecting the change. Despite the censorship of media and the fact that the national television was not reporting anything about what was happening, amateur footage of the first riots in Tunisia got on the Internet. Thereby, the whole world was informed about the course of these events, and citizens realized they can turn the power to their advantage. People of the Arab world understood that they are not alone, that there are others going through the same suffering and brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Topic|url = http://sarajevosls.ba/?page_id=79|website = Sarajevo Summer Law School|access-date = 2016-01-31|language = en-US|last = elsasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With 45 participants not only from Europe, second Sarajevo Summer Law School has grown in one of the most recognized schools in ELSA network, since our law school is one of the 36 law schools under ELSA organisation. The School was honored with presence of highly experts in this field: DSc Vladimir Bratić (Hollins University, USA), MSc Stana Tadić (Humanitarian Law Centre Belgrade), Nedžad Smailagić (Poitiers University, France), MSc Amer Džihana (Internews BiH), MSc Kristina Ćendić (Internews BiH), Nihad Kreševljaković (Sarajevo War Theatre) and Asja Rokša – Zubčević (Communications Regulatory Agency BiH).

Also, the appearance, structure and organization of ELSA B&amp;H are improved through this project, and there is expressed desire and need for the establishment of the Institute of Media Law and the study of Media Law in the frame of the regular curriculum at the Law Faculty in Sarajevo, and to the general public we enabled information about the protection of the rights of the injured through the media, which is extremely necessary for creating a democratic state.

== Third Sarajevo Summer Law School ==

After very successful second Sarajevo Summer Law School, in the summer of 2016. tradition is continued and the third Sarajevo Summer Law School is going to be organized. This year's summer school topic will be completely different from the topics discussed from previous two years.  
This year’s theme is "''Freedom of Religion in Europe''". Freedom of religion is considered by many people and nations to be a fundamental human right. In a country with a state religion, freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths.

'''Emma Trosse''' (6 January 1863-23 July 1949) was a German teacher and school administrator. Trained as a teacher and later passing an examination to be a principal, Trosse began her career working in public schools and as a private tutor. In 1895, she published one of the first scientific works on homosexuality and advocated for legal protections for homosexuals. She was the first known woman to scientifically discuss lesbianism. She also published books analyzing ancient medical practices in medieval Europe, and among the Greeks and Egyptians. After her marriage, she became a clinician in her husband's diabetes clinic, and began writing literature on diabetes.

==Early life==
Emma Johanna Elisabeth Trosse was born on 6 January 1863 in [[Gransee]], in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], a part of the [[German Confederation]]{{sfn|Eggeling|2012}} to Emma Emilie Therese (née Böther) and Friedrich Trosse.{{sfn|Leidinger|2013|p=15}} Early in her life Trosse demonstrated an ability as a [[polyglot]] and became proficient in seven languages.{{sfn|Poppelreuter|1987}} Though little is known of her early life, she came from a family of [[Pedagogy|educational theorists]].{{sfn|Leck|2016|p=71}} After attending school in [[Bromberg]] and passing her examinations, she went on to further her study at the women's [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. She attended lectures in philology at the [[Frederick William University]] in  [[Berlin]] in the 1880s and 1890s, having to hide behind a curtain to attend lectures, as women were barred from higher education.{{sfn|Eggeling|2012}}{{sfn|Poppelreuter|1987}}

==Career==
Trosse began her career working as a teacher at the Gransee public school and then taught at the women's gymnasium in [[Gnesen]]. Her next position was as a [[governess]]/teacher in {{ill|Schneidlingen|de}} near [[Magdeburg]] and then she taught in the public school of [[Obernkirchen]] in the [[Bückeberg|Bückeberg hills]]. Returning to Hanover, she passed the examination for school principals in Hannover, and began work as the director of the women's gymnasium and boarding school in [[Würzburg]]. Going on holiday to the [[Ahr Valley]], she became enamored of the area, resigned her position in Würzburg, and began to publish poetry about the local area.{{sfn|Poppelreuter|1987}} In 1893, she opened a girl's boarding school with Hermine Dulsmann, the Baroness von Bardeleben, in [[Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler|Bad Neuenahr]].{{sfn|Leidinger|2010}}

In 1895, Trosse began publishing a series of works examining [[homosexuality]] and seeking to redefine the scientific definition of natural sexuality. Her first publication ''Der Konträrsexualismus in Bezug auf Ehe und Frauenfrage'' (''Contrary-sexuality in relation to marriage and the women question''), was the first work written by a German woman on the topic.{{sfn|Leck|2016|p=71}}{{sfn|Leidinger|2013|p=12}} She was the first known woman to write scientifically about [[lesbianism]].{{sfn|Leidinger|2013|p=12}} Her study, published a year before [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]'s first publishings,{{sfn|Leidinger|2013|p=13}} and prior to those of [[Johanna Elberskirchen]] and [[Anna Rüling]],{{sfn|Leidinger|2013|p=14}} argued that homosexuality was a natural state and a diversity which appeared in nature. She argued that same-sex attraction and [[asexuality]] were not abnormal or exceptions to [[Natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] and as such, homosexual people should not be discriminated against and the state should take measures protect people's right to sexual freedom.{{sfn|Leck|2016|pp=71-72}} She saw [[Gender binary|sexual binarism]], as a [[moralistic]] position, rather than a scientific one.{{sfn|Leck|2016|p=73}} This first publication was followed by two additional treatments of the topic, ''Ein Weib? Psychologisch-biographische: Studie über eine Konträrsexuelle'' (''A woman? Psychological-biographical study of a contrary-sexual'', 1897) and ''Ist 'freie Liebe' Sittenlosigkeit?'' (''Is 'free love' immoral?'' 1897, 2nd ed. 1900).{{sfn|Leidinger|2013|p=12}} Censorship quickly banned the articles as immoral in [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[German Empire]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]].{{sfn|Leidinger|2013|p=14}}

In 1896, Trosse published two articles in English on ancient medical knowledge written about by [[Alexander of Tralles]], ''Burnt Substances'' and ''Sources of the Drugs Supplied to the Greeks''.{{sfn|''Janus''|1896|pp=143-149, 551-557}} She also published information about both Egyptian and medieval medical practices in Norway.{{sfn|''Janus''|1896|pp=263-264, 270-271}}{{sfn|Leidinger|2010}} Around 1897 or 1898, she met the Dr. Georg Alexander Constantin Külz, whom she would marry in 1900.{{sfn|Poppelreuter|1987}}{{sfn|Leidinger|2010}} Soon after meeting Külz, she published a book of poetry, ''Was die Ahr rauscht'' (''Why the Ahr Rushes'', 1899).{{sfn|Trosse|1899}} Because German law forbade married women to teach, she lost her employment upon her marriage{{sfn|Eggeling|2012}} and became a clinician in the [[diabetes]] clinic the couple founded.{{sfn|Poppelreuter|1987}} The clinic was the first one in the area to treat diabetic patients.{{sfn|Leidinger|2010}} After their daughter, Irmgard was born in 1902,{{sfn|Eggeling|2012}} Külz-Trosse performed work in the clinic laboratory{{sfn|Poppelreuter|1987}} and continued to publish, under the name of E. Külz or E. Külz-Trosse. In one article, published jointly with her husband, ''Das Breslauer Arzneibuch'' (''Medicine of Breslau''), they analyzed medieval medical practices in [[Breslau]].{{sfn|Leidinger|2010}}{{sfn|Külz|Külz-Trosse|1908}} 

In 1923, after returning from the war, her husband died{{sfn|Poppelreuter|1987}} and his cousin, [[Ludwig Külz]] moved to Bad Neuenahr to take over operation of the clinic. His morphine addiction impaired his abilities,{{sfn|Ender|2013}}{{sfn|Bergner|2010}} and Külz-Trosse struggled with keeping the facility open, until her daughter married a physician, Erwin Quednow, who took over running the clinic. She took care of the couple's five children and continued publishing medical articles.{{sfn|Poppelreuter|1987}} In 1930, she published ''Dauerheilung der Zuckerkrankheit'' (''Endurance of diabetes'') and in 1936 ''Trwałe wyleczenie cukrzycy'' (''Persistent cure of diabetes'' (Polish)).{{sfn|Leidinger|2010}}{{sfn|Külz|1930}}{{sfn|Külz|Rosińska|1936}}

==Death and legacy==
Külz-Trosse lost her sight as she aged and was completely blind by the time of her death on 23 July 1949 in Bad Neuenahr. In 2010, the [[Schwules Museum]] held an exhibit to honor her pioneering work in sexology.{{sfn|Leidinger|2010}} In 2011, the exhibit was shown to honor her in [[Mannheim]].{{sfn|CSD Rhein-Neckar|2011}}

===Greece===
[[Image:Kouros' Head, Acropolis' museum, Athens.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Blond Kouros's Head of the Acropolis]] museum in [[Athens]].]]
Though the word can simply refer to the adolescent age of young men of training age, its main use is for the members, exclusively from that age group, of an official institution (''ephebeia'') that saw to building them into citizens, but especially training them as soldiers, sometimes already sent into the field; the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city state]] (''[[polis]]'') mainly depended, as the [[Roman republic]] before [[Gaius Marius]]' reform, on its militia of citizens for defense.

In regards to Greek mythology, the ephebe was a young man or initiate, around the ages of 17 to 18, who was put through a period of isolation from his prior community, usually the world of his mother, where he was a child in the community. The ephebe would need to hunt, rely on his senses, on aggression, stealth, and trickery to survive. At the end of the initiation, the ephebe was reincorporated back into society as a man. The idea was that if the community was ever threatened, its men would have these skills needed to protect it.

===Rome===
In Rome, where the elite (mainly [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]) were often sent to Greece or received Greek teachers, the Greek word was adopted in the [[Latin]]ate form ''ephebus'' (plural ''ephebi''), and fixed at the 16 to 20 age bracket.

==Sculpture==
In [[Ancient Greek sculpture]], an '''ephebe''' is a sculptural type depicting a nude ''ephebos'' ([[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] examples of the type are also often known as the [[kouros]] type, or kouroi in the plural). This typological name often occurs in the form "the ''{{var|X}} Ephebe''", where {{var|X}} is the collection to which the object belongs or belonged, or the site on which it was found (e.g. the ''Agrigento Ephebe'').

==Policy==

Ethnopluralism has been proposed by some in the [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]] as a means to facilitate nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jensrydgren.com/Sociology%20of%20the%20radical%20right.pdf|title=The Sociology of the Radical Right|last=Rydgren|first=Jens|date=2007|website=|work=Annual Review of Sociology|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing this policy would require [[ethnic cleansing]] to establish separate territories for different ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=tracks/&gt;

Ethnopluralism emphasizes the separation of varying ethnic and cultural groups, in contrast to cultural [[Social integration|integration]] and intra-cultural diversity. It has been part of the ideological foundation of the [[European New Right]], which has used ethnopluralism to express its favoritism towards the cultural identity of individual groups, thus expressing its opposition to heterogeneity within states.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCulloch|first=Tom|date=2006-08-01|title=The Nouvelle Droite in the 1980s and 1990s: Ideology and Entryism, the Relationship with the Front National|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.fp.8200099|journal=French Politics|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=158–178|doi=10.1057/palgrave.fp.8200099|issn=1476-3419}}&lt;/ref&gt; These views of culture, ethnicity and race have become popular among several right-wing and [[far right|far-right]] groups in [[Europe]] since the 1970s, and has been covered in some [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[left-wing politics|left]] sources (i.e. ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'') also.&lt;ref name="Spektorowska Feb 2003" /&gt;

Ethnopluralists use the concept of cultural differentialism to assert a "right to difference" to propose [[regionalism (politics)|regional policies]] of ethnic and racial [[separatism]]. Among ethnopluralists there is no agreed upon definition of group membership, nor where these hypothetical borders would lie. Some ethnopluralists advocate limiting Europe to "true Europeans", while others propose much smaller divisions, similar to an ethnically-based [[communitarianism]]. While some ethnopluralists would allow European Muslims to remain in Europe, Jews and [[Romani people|Romani]] are typically rejected by ethnopluralists.&lt;ref name=tracks/&gt; French [[Nouvelle Droite]] philosopher [[Alain de Benoist]] claims that indigenous cultures in Europe are being threatened, and that [[pan-European nationalism]] based on ethnopluralism would stop this process.&lt;ref name="Spektorowska Feb 2003"/&gt; Benoist has proposed ethnic and social territories be as small as possible, such that Muslims would be allowed ghettos in Europe subordinate to [[sharia]].&lt;ref name=tracks/&gt;

According to [[ethnomusicologist]] [[Benjamin R. Teitelbaum]], the term "ethnopluralism" was first coined by German sociologist [[Henning Eichberg]] in an essay that was written in opposition to both Western and European [[eurocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;Teitelbaum, Benjamin (2013).

'''Experiential education''' is a philosophy of education that describes the process that occurs between a teacher and student that infuses direct experience with the [[learning environment]] and content.&lt;ref&gt;Itin, C. M. (1999). Reasserting the Philosophy of Experiential Education as a Vehicle for Change in the 21st Century. The Journal of Experiential Education,.22(2), 91-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is not interchangeable with [[experiential learning]]; however experiential learning is a sub-field and operates under the methodologies of experiential education.&lt;ref&gt;Breuning, M., &amp; O'Connell, T. (2008, Spring/Summer). An overview of Outdoor Experiential Education. Taproot, 10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Experiential Education]] regards experiential education as "a philosophy that informs many methodologies in which educators purposefully engage with learners in direct experience and focused reflection in order to increase knowledge, develop skills, clarify values, and develop people's capacity to contribute to their communities".&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.aee.org/about/whatIsEE/ "What is Experiential Education?"], Association for Experiential Education,  Retrieved 8/7/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Experiential education is the term for the philosophy and [[educational progressivism]] is the movement which it informed.

==About==
[[John Dewey]] was the most famous proponent of experiential education, writing ''[[Experience and Education (book)|Experience and Education]]'' (1938).  It expressed his ideas about curriculum theory in the context of historical debates about school organization and the need to have experience as central in the educational process; hence, experiential education is referred to as a philosophy. Dewey's fame during that period rested on relentlessly critiquing public education and pointing out that the [[authoritarian]], strict, pre-ordained knowledge approach of modern traditional education was too concerned with delivering knowledge, and not enough with understanding students' experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wilderdom.com/experiential/ExperientialDewey.html Neil, J. (2005) "John Dewey, the Modern Father of Experiential Education"], Wilderdom.com. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey's work influenced dozens of other prominent experiential models and advocates in the later 20th century, including [[Foxfire Fund|Foxfire]],&lt;ref&gt;Starnes, B.A. (1999) [http://www.ericdigests.org/1999-3/foxfire.htm "The Foxfire Approach to Teaching and Learning: John Dewey, Experiential Learning, and the Core Practices."] ERIC Digests - ED426826. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[service learning]],&lt;ref&gt;Giles, D.E., Jr., &amp; Eyler, J. (1994). [http://www.umich.edu/%7Emjcsl/volumes/vol1abstracts.html#vol1-9 "Theoretical roots of service learning in John Dewey: Toward a theory of service learning."] ''Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning'', Fall, 77-85. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Hahn]] and [[Outward Bound]],&lt;ref&gt;Gass, M. (2003) "Kurt Hahn address 2002 AEE International Conference", ''Journal of Experiential Education.'' 25 (3), pp. 363-371&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paulo Freire]]. Freire is often cited in works on experiential education.&lt;ref&gt;Bing, A. (1989) "Peace Studies as Experiential Education," ''[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]]. 504.'', pp. 48–60.&lt;/ref&gt; He focused on the participation by students in experience and [[radical democracy]], and the creation of ''[[Praxis (process)|praxis]]'' among learners.

John Dewey was an educator, but he was foremost a philosopher. His interests included political philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, logic, and [[philosophy of education]].  [[Political philosophy]] was one of his many philosophical interests.  He saw weaknesses in both the traditional and progressive styles of education. He explains in length his criticisms of both forms of education in his book, ''Experience &amp; Education'' (1938). In essence, he did not believe that they met the goals of education, which he defined as obtaining freedom of thought. Dewey did not believe in freedom of thought in any kind of absolute sense.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Dewey advocated that education be based upon the quality of experience. For an experience to be educational, Dewey believed that certain parameters had to be met, the most important of which is that the experience has continuity and interaction. Continuity is the idea that the experience comes from and leads to other experiences, in essence propelling the person to learn more. Interaction is when the experience meets the internal needs or goals of a person. Dewey also categorizes experiences as possibly being mis-educative and non-educative. A mis-educative experience is one that stops or distorts growth for future experiences. A non-educative experience is one in which a person has not done any reflection and so has obtained nothing for mental growth that is lasting (''Experience &amp; Education,'' Dewey).

In addition to the notions raised by Dewey, recent research has shown that experiential learning does not replace traditional methods of learning but supplements it in the form of [[laboratory]] and clinical learning to offer additional skills, perspectives, and understanding of relationships. Instead, experiential learning is designed to improve one's understanding by giving one the freedom to explore and find the learning path that is most suitable for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Forecasting%20the%20Air%20Travel%20Market.pdf | title = Designing and using experiential exercises | author = [[J. Scott Armstrong]]| journal = Experiential Learning in Marketing Education | pages = 8–17 | year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

The methodologies reflected in experiential education have evolved since the time of Hahn and Dewey. For experiential education to become efficient pedagogy, physical experience must be combined with reflection.&lt;ref name="Howden, E. 2012 pp. 43-51"&gt;Howden, E. (2012) "Outdoor Experiential Education: Learning Through the Body," New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education. 134, pp. 43-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Adding reflective practice, allows for personal introspection of challenges and key learnings. That is, physical challenges provide a gateway in which we can observe qualities about ourselves, and those whom we are working with. Further, for the efficacy of experiential education, experiences must be separated, giving the learner sufficient time to process the information.&lt;ref name="Howden, E. 2012 pp. 43-51"/&gt;

Experiential education informs many educational practices underway in [[school]]s ([[formal education]]) and out-of-school ([[informal education]]) programs. Many [[teaching methods]] rely on experiential education to provide context and frameworks for learning through action and reflection while others at higher levels (university and professional education) focus on field skills and modeling.

*[[Outdoor education]] uses organized learning activities that occur in the outdoors, and uses environmental experiences as a learning tool.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V., &amp; Golins, G. L. (1976). ''[http://wilderdom.com/theory/OutwardBoundProcessModel.html The exploration of the Outward Bound process]''.  Denver, CO: [[Colorado Outward Bound School]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Service learning]] is a combination of [[community service]] with stated learning goals, relying on experience as the foundation for meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Furco, A. (1996) ''Expanding Boundaries: Serving and Learning,'' Florida Campus Compact.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cooperative learning]] alters [[homogeneous]] groupings in order to support diverse [[learning styles]] and needs within a group.&lt;ref&gt;McInnerney J., &amp; Roberts, T.S. (2005). "Collaborative and Cooperative Learning," In ''The Encyclopedia of Distance Learning, Volume 1: Online Learning and Technologies.'' Hershey, PA: Information Science Publishing, pp. 269–276.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Active learning]], a term popular in US education circles in the 1980s, encourages learners to take responsibility for their learning, requiring their experience in education to inform their process of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bonwell, C. and Eison, J. (1991) ''Active Learning: Creating Excitement in the Classroom.'' Washington, D.C.: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Environmental education]] is based in educating learners about relationships within the natural environment and how those relationships are interdependent. Students participate in outdoor activities as part of their learning experience.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, J.A. (1998) ''Environmental Education in the 21st Century: Theory, Practice, Progress, and Promise.'' New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Vocational education]] involves training for an occupation.
*[[Sandwich degree|Sandwich degrees]] involve a year working in industry during academic study.

Experiential education serves as an umbrella for linking many diverse practices into a coherent whole.  Its philosophy is closely linked to numerous other educational theories, but it should not be conflated with [[progressive education]], [[critical pedagogy]], [[youth empowerment]], feminist-based education, and [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]. The development of experiential education as a philosophy has been intertwined with the development of these other educational theories; their contrasts have clarified differences.

Fellowships and other training programs are available for experiential educators; but, formal training in experiential methods is lacking for K-12 undergraduate teaching programs (see Wendel, A. and Mantil, A., (2008) and the [http://www.nsee.org/ National Society for Experiential Education]).

== Examples ==
Examples of experiential education can be found in various disciplines. The educator [[Lucy Calkins]] writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we asked our students for the highlight of their school careers, most would choose a time when they dedicated themselves to an endeavor of great importance...I am thinking of youngsters from P.S. 321, who have launched a save-the-tree campaign to prevent the oaks outside their school from being cut down. I am thinking of children who write the school newspaper, act in the school play, organize the playground building committee.... On projects such as these, youngsters will work before school, after school, during lunch. Our youngsters want to work hard on endeavors they deem significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Living Between the Lines |last1=Calkins |first1=Lucy McCormick |last2=Harwayne |first2=Shelley |publisher=Heinemann |year=1991 |isbn=0435085387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing [[Diary|journals]] proves to be quite effective as part of English classes. Specifically, by writing "personal" and "text-related" journals, students find meaning in their own thoughts as well as in concepts learned in class. Personal [[Writing therapy|journaling]] is the recording of past and present personal thoughts and events in the student's life to enhance [[self-awareness]], student interest, and learning. Text-related journaling is writing about concepts learned in class in relation to students' personal experiences, to promote understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Strategies that Work: Journals in the Classroom|url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/strategy/strategy013.shtml|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other programs==

The [[Nicodemus Wilderness Project]] provides an environmental experiential education program with a global reach called the "Apprentice Ecologist Initiative".  This scholarship-based opportunity is targeted for youth volunteers who want to help protect the environment.  The initiative seeks to develop young people for leadership roles by engaging them in environmental cleanup and conservation projects, empower volunteers to rebuild the environmental and social well-being of our communities, and improve local living conditions for both citizens and wildlife.

[[Presidential Classroom]], a non-profit civic education organization in [[Washington D.C.]], is open to high school students from across the country and abroad.  They meet and interact with government officials, media correspondents, congressman, and key players on the world stage to learn how public policy shapes many aspects of citizens' lives.  Students travel to Washington and spend a week hearing from prominent speakers, meet with interest group spokesmen and tour the national capital.  Students participate in a group project directed by experienced instructors; they have mediated debates on current issues facing the country.  The focus of the week is to give students a hands-on introduction to how "real world" politics take place.

[[Global College]], a four-year international study program offered by [[Long Island University]], is based on self-guided, experiential learning while a student is immersed in foreign cultures. Regional centers employ mostly advisors rather than teaching faculty; these advisors guide the individual students in preparing a "portfolio of learning" each semester to display the results of their experiences and projects.

The [[New England Literature Program]] in the English Department at the [[University of Michigan]] is a 45-day program, in which University instructors live and work together with 40  UM students in the woods of Maine in early spring.  They intensively study 19th and 20th-century  New England literature, in a program that includes creative writing in the form of academic journaling, as well as a deep physical engagement with the landscape of New England.  NELP students and staff take hiking trips into the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] and other parts of the New England natural areas each week, integrating their experience of the landscape with writing and discussion of texts.

The [[Chicago Center for Urban Life and Culture]] is the only nonprofit and independent experiential educational program for college students in the United States.  The Chicago Center is distinguished by unique seminars characterized by a 'First Voice' pedagogy, its location in the multi-ethnic [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]], and development of several hundred [[intern]]ship sites in [[Chicago]]. While many of the students who attend Chicago Center grew up in cities, the majority are from suburban, rural and farming communities. Students participate individually in its Semester, May Term and Summer Session.  The Chicago Center also designs and staffs programs for groups, what it calls "LearnChicago!", which promise non-tourist experiences in the city.

[[The Philadelphia Center]] is an off-campus program based on a model of experiential education.  Recognized by The Great Lakes Colleges Association, The Philadelphia Center is currently the only undergraduate level program that supports independent living and encourages the use of the city as a [[learning space]].

Several Australian high schools have established experiential education programmes, including [[Caulfield Grammar School]]'s five-week internationalism programme in [[Nanjing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Geelong Grammar School]]'s Timbertop outdoor education programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Tarica | first=Elisabeth | title=School of life | date=21 August 2006 | publisher=The Age | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/education-news/school-of-life/2006/08/18/1155408026033.html?page=fullpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|SODOTO}}At the professional school level, experiential education is often integrated into curricula in "clinical" courses following the medical school model of "See one, Do one, Teach one", in which students learn by practicing medicine.  This approach is being introduced in other professions in which skills are directly worked into courses to teach every concept (starting with interviewing, listening skills, negotiation, contract writing and advocacy, for example) to larger-scale projects in which students run [[Legal clinic|legal aid clinics]] or community loan programs, or write legislation or community development plans.

The [[Boys and Girls Club of America]] provides a framework for youth development professionals to employ experiential learning methods.

[[Lifeworks International]] offers experiential, service-learning programs for high school students. Trips combine adventure travel, cultural immersion, community service, and global education during expeditions in China, Thailand, India, Costa Rica, Peru, the British Virgin Islands, and Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands.

In [[Legal Education]], critical pedagogy is associated with devising more equitable methods of teaching, helping students develop consciousness of freedom, and helping them connect knowledge to power.&lt;ref&gt;SpearIt and Stephanie Ledesma, Experiential Education as Critical Pedagogy: Enhancing the Law School Experience, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2498782&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change in roles and structures==
Whether teachers employ experiential education in cultural journalism, [[service learning]], [[environmental education]], or more traditional school subjects, its key idea involves engaging [[student voice]] in active roles for the purpose of learning. Armstrong (2012) claims that students should be responsible for learning, not teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students participate in a real activity with real consequences for the purpose of meeting learning objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2005) ''[http://www.soundout.org/MSIGuide.pdf Meaningful student involvement: Students as partners in school change]''. Olympia, WA: CommonAction. Retrieved 6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiential education uses various tools like field work, policy and civic activity, and entrepreneurship outside of the classroom along with games, simulations, role plays, stories in classrooms. The experiential education mindset changes the way the teachers and students view knowledge. Knowledge is no longer just some letters on a page. It becomes active, something that is transacted with in life or lifelike situations. It starts to make teachers experience and skill facilitators, and not just transmitters of the written word.

Besides changing student roles, experiential education requires a change in the role of teachers. When students are active learners, their endeavors often take them outside the classroom walls. Because action precedes attempts to synthesize knowledge, teachers generally cannot plan a curriculum unit as a neat, predictable package. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Teachers become active learners, too, experimenting together with their students, reflecting upon the learning activities they have designed, and responding to their students' reactions to the activities. In this way, teachers themselves become more active; they come to view themselves as more than just recipients of school district policy and curriculum decisions.

It is also important to point out that not all learners learn in the same way. As a result, there are diverse learners that have unique learning styles pertinent to their success as students. Studies have shown that cooperative learning is strongly suggested in a diverse learning atmosphere. "Contemporary views of learning and their pedagogical applications have begun to change traditional classroom interaction patterns, shaping the communicative roles of the teacher and students as participants in a classroom learning community," write David Wray &amp; Kristiina Kumpulainen. This paradigm shift in education gives both the student and teacher shared responsibility of the learning process. The teacher's participation in discussion sessions is to act as a facilitator, maintain classroom decorum, provide individual and group feedback, and alleviate concerns or issues in the lesson.

Critical thinking strategies are pertinent to the success of student-oriented learning. When students are engaged in active discussions, high-level thinking skills are put into practice to the point where students are synthesizing the information at a deeper level of understanding. According to [[Elliot Eisner]], "We need to provide opportunities for youngsters and adolescents to engage in challenging kinds of conversation, and we need to help them know how to do so. Such conversation is all too rare in schools. I use 'conversation' seriously, for challenging conversation is an intellectual affair. It has to do with thinking about what people have said and responding reflectively, analytically, and imaginatively to that process. The practice of conversation is almost a lost art. The most significant intellectual achievement is not so much in problem solving, but in question posing." Through experimental education, students are capable of finding their voice through '''peer-to-peer interaction'''. Students are now seen as [[child-centred|active participants]] in the learning process. [[Vygotsky]]`s social development theory requires students to play untraditional roles as they collaborate with one another through critical thinking and conversational skills. According to Ann Ketch, author of Conversation: The comprehension connection writes, "The oral process helps students clarify and solidify their thoughts. The thinking changes from what it was before the conversation took place. Through conversation, the student is in charge of his or her own mental processing. The teacher acts as a facilitator, pushing the student to rely upon and monitor his or her own comprehension, which fosters critical thinking." This is very vital because student conversation can elicit new ideas that may not have been mentioned or even thought of by another student. Therefore, student dialogue is very important because it helps individuals make sense of what is being learned. It also helps build respect for other's opinions while taking ownership of his or her learning process.

In experimental education, students are given the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills by making connections to the real world. Therefore, effective learning entails active experimentation with a '''hands-on''' approach to learning. It is perceived that students learn more by being active. Students are '''interdependent''' in establishing group goals and decision-making skills. As a result, students are also capable of developing leadership skills, which can also enhance student motivation and confidence.

When students are given a choice in terms of content to be learned, it ensures the teacher that his or her learners are interactive in the learning process. According to Ernie Stringer, "'''Action learners''' move through continuous cycles of this inquiry process to improve their understanding, extend their knowledge, or refine their skills." When given a preference, students may feel motivated to take control of his or her learning experience. Student incentives are tied to progress in academic achievement. "Research indicates that intrinsic motivation stems from one's interests and capacities to surmount challenge s when presented or pursued," says Fenice B. Boyd. Many schools are encouraging teachers to tap into student interests with the hope that they transfer that motivation into the classroom.

Through the continuous cycle of learning, teacher's often work with students to develop a framework of knowledge, which is to be evaluated based on student input to the lessons content. Therefore, the teacher should establish criteria of what is to be learned as related to the student(s) choice in learning material. Ernie Stringer draws on the importance that "'''action research''' provides a process for developing a rich, engaging curriculum relevant to the lives and purposes of students, engaging their interests and abilities, and serving the broad human needs of community, society, and the planet. Creative construction of curricula or syllabi provides the means whereby the needs, perspectives, and/or interests of diverse stakeholders can be incorporated into vital, creative, effective programs of learning." In essence, a well-planned curriculum is designed for learning that encompasses a broad range of goals and individual needs that ensures the '''active learning''' process.

As students and teachers take on new roles, the traditional organizational structures of the school also may meet challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talpiot.macam.ac.il/hishtalmut/principles.htm Best practice: New standards for teaching and learning in America's schools.] Zemelman, Daniels, and Hyde, 1998, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at the Challenger Middle School in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]], service activities are an integral part of the academic program. Such nontraditional activities require teachers and administrators to look at traditional practices in new ways. For instance, they may consider reorganizing time blocks. They may also teach research methods by involving students in investigations of the community, rather than restricting research activities to the library (Rolzinski, 1990). {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

At the University Heights Alternative School in [[the Bronx]], the [[Project Adventure]] experiential learning program has led the faculty to adopt an all-day time block as an alternative to the traditional 45-minute periods. The faculty now organizes the curriculum by project instead of by separate disciplines. Schools that promote meaningful student involvement actively engage students as partners in education improvement activities. These young people learn while planning, researching, teaching, and making decisions that affect the entire education system.

Other university level programs are entirely field-taught on outdoor expeditions. These courses combine traditional academic readings and written assignments with field observations, service projects, open discussions of course material, and meetings with local speakers who are involved with the course subjects. These "hybrid" experiential/traditional programs aim to provide the academic rigor of a classroom course with the breadth and personal connections of experiential education.

==Transitions from traditional to experiential==

[[File:Learning_Retention_Pyramid.JPG|thumb|Experiential education is more efficient than passive learning like reading or listening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015 Skill Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

At first, these new roles and structures may seem unfamiliar and uncomfortable to both students and adults in the school. Traditionally, students have most often been rewarded for competing rather than cooperating with one another. Teachers are not often called upon for collaborative work either. Teaching has traditionally been an activity carried out in isolation from one's peers, behind closed doors. Principals, accustomed to the traditional hierarchical structure of schools, often do not know how to help their teachers constitute self-managed work teams or how to help teachers coach students to work in cooperative teams. The techniques of experiential education can help students and staff adjust to teamwork, an important part of the process of reforming schools.

[[Adventure education]] may use the philosophy of experiential education in developing team and group skills in both students and adults (Rohnke, 1989). Initially, [[wikt:group|groups]] work to solve problems that are unrelated to the problems in their actual [[school]] environment. For example, in a [[ropes course]] designed to build the skills required by [[teamwork]], a faculty or student [[team]] might work together to get the entire group over a 12-foot wall or through an intricate web of rope. After each challenge in a series of this kind, the group looks at how it functioned as a team:

* Who took the [[leadership]] roles?
* Did the [[planning]] process help or hinder progress?
* Did people listen to one another in the group and use the strengths of all group members?
* Did everyone feel that the group was a supportive environment in which they felt comfortable making a contribution and taking [[risks]]?

The wall or web of rope can then become a [[metaphor]] for the [[classroom]] or [[school]] environment. While the problems and challenges of the [[classroom]] or [[school]] are different from the physical challenges of the adventure activity, many skills needed to respond successfully as a team are the same in both settings.

These skills &amp;mdash; [[listening]], recognizing each other's strengths, and supporting each other through difficulties &amp;mdash; can apply equally well to an academic [[Socratic Method]] of questioning or [[problem-solving]] toward schoolwide improvement efforts.

For example, the Kane School in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] has been using adventure as a tool for [[school]] restructuring. The entire faculty &amp;mdash; particularly the Faculty Advisory Council, which shares the decisionmaking responsibilities with the principal &amp;mdash; has honed group skills through experiential education activities developed by [[Project Adventure]]. These skills include open [[communication]], methods of [[conflict resolution]], and mechanisms for [[decision making]] (High Strides, 1990).

==Development in Asian countries==

Established in 1973, ''Breakthrough'' in [[Hong Kong]] was the first non-profit organization that applied the concepts of experiential education (though primarily conceptualized in terms of outdoor adventure education) in youth works. Since then, development in experiential education has proceeded in [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], [[Macau]], and some large cities in [[China]].

Experiential methods in education have existed in China for thousands of years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  However, it should be noted that John Dewey was in China in the early 1900s and his ideas were extremely popular.  Interest in Dewey's experience in China and contribution is growing.

Experiential education started in [[Qatar]] in 2010 through [[AL-Bairaq]], which is an outreach, non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on [[STEM fields]]. The idea behind AL-Bairaq is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the [[Center for Advanced Materials]] (CAM) at [[Qatar University]]. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills, using a hands-on-activities approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |archivedate=19 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

There are multiple ways in which experiential education is practiced.  Examples of experiential learning methods used include:

*[[Active-based learning]] – All participants in the group must engage actively in working together toward the stated objectives.
*[[Place-based learning]] – The process of using local community and environment as a starting point to teach concepts in language arts, mathematics, social studies, science, and other subjects across the curriculum.
*[[Problem-based learning]] – Provides a structure for discovery that helps students internalize learning and leads to greater comprehension.
*[[Project-based learning]] – An instructional method that uses projects as the central focus of instruction in a variety of disciplines.
*[[Service-learning]] – Providing meaningful service to a community agency or organization while simultaneously gaining new skills, knowledge and understanding as an integrated aspect of an academic program.
*[[Simulation-based learning]] – A combination of active, problem, project, and place-based learning; Participants are placed in a simulated environment and given objectives requiring constant attention and care.

All of these use the pattern of problem, plan, test and reflect as their foundation for the educative experience.

[[Impact evaluation]] of [[fair trade]] systems, like [[cost-benefit analysis]], start with the premise that any intervention in an economic system has various impacts throughout that system: some significant, many small; some costs, some benefits; some people benefit, others are harmed. Impact evaluations aim to identify costs and benefits throughout the system, then quantify them, so that people do not make unwarranted claims of impact and so that informed decisions can be made. 

The [[World Bank]] and Inter Bank in America have developed guidelines, but analysis is considered particularly difficult with developing country agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Winters, P., Alessandro Maffioli and Lina Salazar, ‘Introduction to the Special Feature: Evaluating the Impact of Agricultural Projects in Developing Countries’ Journal of Agricultural Economics, Vol. 62, No. 2, 2011, 393–402 doi: 10.1111/j.1477-9552.2011.00296.x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winters, P., Salazar, L. and Maffioli, A. ‘Designing impact evaluations for agricultural projects’, Impact Evaluation Guidelines, Strategy Development Division, Technical Notes No. IDB-TN-198. (Washington, DC: Inter-American Development Bank, 2010). Accessed at http://www.iadb.org/document.cfm?id=35529432&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelucci, M. and Di Maro, V. Project Evaluation and Spillover Effects. Impact Evaluation Guidelines, Strategy Development Division, Technical Notes No. IDB-TN-136 (Washington, DC: Inter-American Development Bank, 2010). Accessed at http://www-personal.umich.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Clemens and Gabriel Demombynes, ‘When Does Rigorous Impact Evaluation Make a Difference? The Case of the Millennium Villages’, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 5477, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Griffiths has examined the additional problems that arise when analysing the impact of Fairtrade interventions, arising from the way it is organized.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics: Volume 105, Issue 3 (2012), Page 357-373 (DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Studies==
Impact studies require study of the counterfactual, using [[control group]]s to ensure that an impact is the result of the intervention being studied, which is often impossible and always difficult with Fairtrade because of the way that Fairtrade is organized, notably because the Fairtrade farmers and cooperatives are selected from the richer and more efficient, and because the non-Fairtrade farmers may be harmed by Fairtrade. These problems arise with both case studies and more general surveys, and are particularly intractable when the appropriate control group is in another country. There have been virtually no base period studies, to determine the position before a cooperative joined Fairtrade, so it is seldom possible to claim that the farmers in a cooperative are better off or have more self-esteem because of Fairtrade, rather than because Fairtrade selects efficient cooperatives with educated, efficient, well-off farmers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The possibility that all groups of farmers have increased incomes because of higher world prices, changed exchange rates etc. is difficult to tackle. As most of the extra money paid by consumers is taken by firms in rich countries or is spent on added costs incurred in meeting Fairtrade standards, it is seldom possible to identify direct financial benefit to farmers, and the studies concentrate on non-monetary benefits, like improvement in self-esteem or the creation of [[community development]] projects. These are difficult to measure, and it is particularly difficult to measure these non-monetary benefits in control groups of local non-Fairtrade farmers, the extent to which non-Fairtrade farmers lose self-esteem, etc. because they are excluded from Fair trade impact studies, for instance, and even more difficult to measure any effects on non-Fairtrade farmers in other, poorer, countries. The decision on which such measures to include introduces a bias: it may be asked whether there are other non-money costs or benefits that might be included in the studies which would give answers less favourable to Fairtrade.

An unpublished consultancy report prepared for Fairtrade &lt;ref&gt;Nelson, V., &amp; Pound, B.: 2009, The Last Ten Years: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature on the Impact of Fairtrade. Retrieved from http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/resources/natural_resources_institute.aspx &lt;/ref&gt; found only 33 studies that met their own criteria (not those of the World Bank or Inter-American Bank) for impact studies. These 33 included unpublished undergraduate and masters’ dissertations, unpublished theses, articles by employees or members of Fairtrade cooperatives, several reports on the same cooperatives, and one report cited under two different titles. 

Griffiths&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics: Volume 105, Issue 3 (2012), Page 357-373 (DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that even this is optimistic: there are very few studies that examine any of the costs identified by critics of Fairtrade in the [[Fair trade debate]], and fewer still that attempt to quantify them. There are few mentions in the literature of the biggest financial costs and benefits, the extra price paid by consumers and the extra profit made by companies in rich countries, and fewer attempts to quantify these.  

One impact, the  amount of money going to businesses in rich countries rather than to Third World producers, is addressed in only a handful of studies.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., &amp; Niemi, N. (2010). “Empowering Coffee Traders? The Coffee Value Chain from Nicaraguan Fair Trade Farmers to Finnish Consumers.” Journal of Business Ethics , 97:257-270&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., &amp; Villalobos, A. (2006). “Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee”. Journal of Business Research , 59(3), 322–330.&lt;/ref&gt; These show that in some cases 90% to 99.5% of the extra money paid by consumers is kept as extra profit by firms in rich countries but cannot show that this is typical. The conclusion is rather that secretiveness prevents impact analysis of the full Fairtrade system. Few studies analyse how much extra money is received by the cooperatives, what it is spent on, how much is taken by managers of cooperatives and how much reaches the farmers. Few studies discuss the costs identified in the [[Fair trade debate]]. 

There are, however, case studies of Fairtrade cooperatives which do not attempt to be impact studies, identifying and quantifying all positive and negative impacts, but are, rather, examinations of how subsections of the system operate, usually single Fairtrade cooperatives and sometimes one Fairtrade product in a country - valuable but different research.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Even if twenty or thirty studies which met the impact evaluation criteria could be identified, it would not be possible to generalize from them because it is not claimed that they are typical.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The studies are not of randomly selected cooperatives. They are concentrated on better known, more successful and well established ones, and there are few which examine the problems of cooperatives which have recently joined Fairtrade or of the least successful quartile of Fairtrade cooperatives.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"/&gt;

'''Formal learning''' is education normally delivered by trained teachers in a systematic intentional way within a [[school]], [[higher education]] or [[university]]. It is one of three forms of [[learning]] as defined by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], the others being [[informal learning]], which typically takes place naturally as part of some other activity, and [[nonformal learning|non-formal learning]], which includes everything else, such as sports instruction provided by non-trained educators without a formal [[curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/recognitionofnon-formalandinformallearning-home.htm |title=Recognition of Non-formal and Informal Learning - Home |website=OECD |accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal learning theory ==
Formal learning theory is the formal study of inductive problems and their intrinsic solvability for both ideal and computable agents. Modal operator theory has very little to do with formal learning theory especially with respects to
# The significance of method and methodological recommendations.
# The idea of weakening the convergence criterion in order to get more problems within the scope of reliable inquiry.

== The origin of formal learning theory  ==
Research on logical reliability theory was first pursued under the name formal learning theory, given to the discipline by (Osherson et al. 1986). This name is somewhat misleading, as it suggests a study of how cognizers learn. With this in mind, Kevin Kelly renamed the approach computational epistemology (1991, 1996), which reflects its historical roots in computability theory while avoiding misinterpretation. 

Computer scientists are in the business of recommending and providing programs and algorithms for various empirical purposes. From this perspective learning is about reliable convergence to correct answers on various empirical questions. Thus learning theory is the formal study of inductive problems and their complexity and solvability for both ideal and Turing-computable agents.

In the middle of 1960s, (Gold 1967) applied formal learning theory to theories of language acquisition in which a child is asked to reliably converge to a grammar for its natural language. Very briefly, languages are modeled as recursive enumerable sets (or r.e sets) and a child is conceived as a function required to converge to a correct r.e index for a given set over all possible enumerations of the set. About the same time H.Reicherbanch's students, Hilary Putnam (Putnam 1963) applied learning theory to criticize Carnap's confirmation theory. Putnam at tempted to show Carnap's justification standards for a probabilistic theory of confirmation, there exists a hypothesis the Carnapian extrapolation algorithm cannot learn even given every possible instance of the hypothesis. Further mathematical treatments of the problems of induction were provided by (Blum and Blum 1975) and (Angluin 1980). 

Formal learning theory never really caught on among philosophers, perhaps because philosophers found it hard to see how the formal results concerning induction apply to classical philosophical. Due to the work of Kevin T. Kelly, Clark Glymour, Dan Osherson and others, formal learning theory has been adapted to questions in philosophy of science, methodology and epistemology.

== Logical Reliability ==
Formal learning theory offers a well-defined notion of reliability for methods, which importantly does not serve as a condition for knowledge. Though it is not an epistemological paradigm in the traditional sense, learning theory can play an important role in knowledge studies.

'''Fourierism''' is the systematic set of economic, political, and social beliefs first espoused by French intellectual [[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837). Based upon a belief in the inevitability of communal associations of people who worked and lived together as part of the human future, Fourier's committed supporters referred to his doctrines as '''Associationism'''. Political contemporaries and subsequent scholarship has identified Fourier's set of ideas as a form of [[utopian socialism]]{{Spaced en dash}}a phrase which retains mild pejorative overtones.

Never tested in practice at any scale in Fourier's lifetime, Fourierism enjoyed a brief boom in the [[United States of America]] during the middle of the 1840s{{Spaced en dash}}owing largely to the efforts of his American popularizer, [[Albert Brisbane]] (1809–1890) and the [[American Union of Associationists]]{{Spaced en dash}}but ultimately failed as a social and economic model. The system was briefly revived in the middle 1850s by [[Victor Prosper Considerant|Victor Considerant]] (1808–1893), a French disciple of Fourier's who [[La Reunion (Dallas)|unsuccessfully attempted to relaunch]] the model in the American state of [[Texas]] in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Beecher, ''Victor Considerant''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine==
===Passional attraction===

In contrast to the thoroughly [[secular]] communitarianism of his contemporary [[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858), [[Charles Fourier|Charles Fourier's]] thinking starts from a presumption of the existence of God and a divine social order on Earth in accordance with the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Franklin (ed.), "Introduction" to [https://archive.org/details/selectionsfromw00fourgoog ''Selections from the Works of Fourier.''] London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1901; pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier saw himself as a figure of world-historical importance akin to [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) for having identified the fundamental force driving social development, which he called "passional attraction" ''(attraction passionelle).''&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier believed that the structure of the world{{Spaced en dash}}that is the economic, political, and social system{{Spaced en dash}}inhibited humanity from the pursuit of their God-given individual passions, thereby preventing mankind from achieving a state of universal harmony.&lt;ref name=Franklin18&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than seeking to mold individuals to fit the existing form of economic, political, and social life, as had been the traditional goal of the educational and what we today call the [[socialization]] process, Fourier believed that instead the form of economic, political, and social life should itself be altered to fit the inherent passions of the individual, since these economic and social structures were man-made and not God-given.&lt;ref name=Franklin18 /&gt;

Through conscious understanding of this process, which Fourier characterized as "social science," new economic and social formations called "Associations" could be created, structured in such a way as to allow individuals to follow their passions and in this way advance towards the state of universal harmony.&lt;ref name=Franklin18 /&gt;

Always one to list and to systematize, Fourier declared there existed twelve basic passions of humanity grouped around three branches of a "passional tree": "luxurious passions" of the senses; "affective passions" of love, friendship, and parenthood; and the oft-ignored "distributive passions" such as the need for political intrigue, the need for variety, and the pure enthusiasm of spiritual pursuits.&lt;ref name=Guarneri18&gt;Carl J. Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative: Fourierism in Nineteenth-Century America.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1991; pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The sum of all these passions Fourier called "unityism," characterized as a universal feeling of benevolence and fraternity.&lt;ref name=Guarneri18 /&gt; Although fettered and mutated by Civilization, the free development of these passions would be allowed in the bright future world, Fourier believed.&lt;ref name=Guarneri18 /&gt;

===Stages of society===

Fourier believed himself the discoverer of the universal laws of societal evolution, theorizing the existence of 32 distinct periods beginning with Edenism and continuing through Savagery, Patriarchate, and Barbarism, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these stages was held to have distinctive material and ideological features, with the treatment afforded to women a particular marker of one stage from the next.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Of far greater concern to Fourier and his disciples was the current 5th form of society, Modern Society, as well as three emerging forms which were believed to be just around the corner: 6 (Guarantism), 7 (Simple Association), and 8 (Compound Association).&lt;ref name=Sears1-2&gt;Charles Sears, [https://archive.org/details/TheNorthAmericanPhalanx ''The North American Phalanx: An Historical and Descriptive Sketch.''] Prescott, WI: John M. Pryse, Publisher, 1886; pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Modern Society," from the Fourierist perspective, was based upon capital and labor and the buying and selling of goods through a network of useless middlemen.&lt;ref name=Sears1&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; With a sneer, Fourier referred to contemporary society as "Civilization," deeming it the cause of fraud, waste, and human unhappiness.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The "isolated family" he deemed inefficient, the wage system demoralizing and exploitative, and organized religion corrupt.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17 /&gt; An entire book was written detailing 36 types of bankruptcy and 76 sorts of "cuckoldry" to which humanity was subjected by its system of so-called Civilization, which Fourier viewed not only as imperfect but as wholly unacceptable.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17 /&gt;

Fourier believed that fortunately for humanity, the Civilization of modern society was a fleeting economic formation, soon to vanish from the Earth.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17 /&gt; The emerging socio-economic structure of "Guarantism" would be based upon the fundamental principle of universal insurance, Fourier believed, which was to include guarantee of the security of capital and guarantee on the right of labor to gainful employment.&lt;ref name=Sears1-2 /&gt; Petty traders and speculative profiteers would be eliminated from the economy in this new system of organized production and distribution, it was believed.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt;

The next stage in the Fourierist schema, that of "Simple Association," was to be based upon the cooperative enterprise of like bodies of farmers or artisans or industrial workers as distinct groups.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt; Farmers would associate with other farmers, artisans with other artisans, industrial producers with other industrial producers, producing and selling their goods collectively.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt; Simultaneously, these economic organizations were to for the first time include the association of family living and domestic labor,&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt; thereby eliminating the economic waste and social isolation of individual living. [[Wage labour|Wage labor]] would be eliminated, as the members of each of these associations would be co-proprietors, producing in tandem and sharing alike in the proceeds of their efforts.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt;

Subsequently, the Fourierists believed, there would emerge "Compound Association" or "Harmonism." Under Compound Association all pursuits – industrial producers and artisans and farmers alike – would join in large associations which would shatter all economic lines.&lt;ref name=Sears2&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; One Fourierian enthusiast described the system of Compound Association in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every interest is provided for, by an organization which embraces all details of production and distribution; and a system of natural and integral education is instituted – that is, a complete system of physical, mental, and emotional development, intimately connected with daily pursuits, provided for; that art and the science which underlies art may be taught together; that theory and practice may go hand in hand and that the individual may have the command of his whole personal power and enjoy the conditions of expressing it.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Every individual in these Compound Associations would be free to take part in the labor of a dozen or more different work groups, according to their interests and pleasure, over the course of any year, in the Fourierist vision.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; That which the [[Marxism|Marxists]] called [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation of labor]] would thereby be eliminated and production boosted, since "a man having himself on his own side works with more force, greater skill, and better effect than one who works against his inclinations," in the words of one Fourierian.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt;

===Economics===

Fourier believed that economic output was the product of three factors: labor, capital, and talent.&lt;ref name=Franklin20&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these, he argued, were important to production and each needed to be compensated as such for the general prosperity of the organized association to be preserved.&lt;ref name=Franklin20 /&gt; The communal associations which emerged based upon Fourier's ideas were generally formed as [[joint stock companies]], and their investor-members were compensated separately on the basis both of amount of capital invested and amount of labor performed – with labor time given a range of values based both on the necessity and difficulty of the work and the degree of talent and skill with which it was performed.

===Social life===
[[File:Phalanstère.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Elevated view of a Fourierist ''Phalanstère'' from the works of Victor Considerant.]]

Fourier's prescription was the establishment of communities called Phalanxes or Associations in the countryside. Housed inside gigantic serpentine edifices called "phalanstries" would be 1620 people, coming from various occupations and social classes.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; These residents were to be arranged in occupational "series," according to Fourier's model – major divisions such as between agrarians and industrial producers and artisans – which would be further divided into smaller "groups" to cooperatively conduct specific aspects of the work.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Mobility of the individual between various groups and even sections according to personal desires was to be allowed.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt;

Fundamental to the Fourierian ideal was the notion of collective living and the rational performance of domestic duties. Individual households were seen as both wasteful in terms of duplicated effort performed and isolating of individuals – standing in the way of true cooperation and social harmony.

Remaining in unpublished manuscript form until 1967 would be Fourier's imaginative predictions about degrees of sexual promiscuity and the institutions and moral codes which would emerge to govern love and interpersonal relationships in the harmonious world of Compound Association.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt;

===Role of force===

The Fourierian system of associations was based on the notion of voluntary participation and expansion through the force of example. Once founded, associations would demonstrate their practical merits and inspire emulation, with the first model communities replicating and spreading from localities to regions to nations and internationally. Never in his writings does Fourier appeal for the use of governmental legislation or coercive power of any sort, instead believing association to be a natural and wholly voluntary structure,&lt;ref name=Franklin21&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; part of a Divine Social Code.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt;

Moreover, the achievement on an international scale would eliminate war from the face of the earth.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; Instead, industrial armies would be formed to engage in gigantic reclamation projects, irrigating deserts and restoring vegetation and draining marshes and putting the land to cultivation.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; The elimination of disease would follow, as such banes as [[cholera]], [[typhus]], and [[yellow fever]] would vanish with the unhealthful places from whence they originated before society's restorative efforts.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; Through the planting of vast swaths of timber, cropland would be protected and the earth's climate itself would be slowly transformed, Fourier and his followers believed.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fantastic theories===

Fourier's theoretical system, described by one scholar as "vast and eccentric,"&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt; was only a part of the output of what another called "a most riotous and unpruned imagination."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Gray to the Aberdeen Philosophical Society, March 15, 1923. Quoted in "The Chaos and Sense of Fourier," ''Aberdeen Journal,'' March 16, 1923, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier believed that in the new world people would live for 144 years, that new species of friendly and pacifistic animals such as "anti-lions" would emerge, and that over time human beings would develop long and useful tails.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt; Fourier also professed a belief in the ability of [[Metempsychosis|human souls to migrate]] between physical and "aromal" worlds.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt; Such thinking was set aside during the last 15 years of Fourier's life, when he instead began to concentrate on testing in practice his economic and social ideas.&lt;ref name=Guarneri20&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier's disciples, including in the first rank the American Albert Brisbane and the French Victor Considerant, later pared down Fourier's writings into a comprehensible system for economic and social organization, with the Fourierist movement experiencing a brief [[boom and bust|boom]] in the United States during the middle years of the 1840s, when some 30 Fourierist associations were established.&lt;ref&gt;William Alfred Hinds, ''American Communities.'' Second edition. Chicago, IL: Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co., 1908; pg. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence on new religious movements ===
The Fourierist doctrine of attractions, correspondences, and analogies was identified with esoteric doctrines like [[Martinism]] by Fourierist like Just Muiron from an early point on.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, ''Sozialismus'', pp. 122-127; Beecher, ''Charles Fourier'', pp. 160-167.&lt;/ref&gt; It is no wonder, then, that contemporary observers like Louis Reybaud, the author of the first study of the socialists, perceived Fourierism and other [[Utopian socialism|early socialist schools]] in the context of mysticism, magic, kabbalah, or the occult sciences.&lt;ref&gt;''Strube, Sozialismus, pp. 105-115.''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it has been shown that Fourierism exerted a decisive influence on new religious movements like [[Spiritualism]] or [[Occultism]] after 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, "Socialist Religion"; cf. Strube, ''Sozialismus'' and Monroe, ''Laboratories''.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this date, Fourierism had already coined the ideas of US-American spiritualist thinkers such as [[Andrew Jackson Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;Albanese, ''Republic'', pp. 171-176, 208-218.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi]], who is regarded as the founder of modern occultism, was a pronounced adherent of Fourierism in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;''Strube, Sozialismus, pp. 316-351.''&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early twentieth century, there was a strong Fourierist presence in French socialist-spiritualist circles.

'''Incarceration prevention''' refers to a variety of methods aimed at reducing prison populations and costs while fostering enhanced social structures. Due to the nature of [[incarceration in the United States]] today caused by issues leading to increased incarceration rates, there are methods aimed at preventing the incarceration of at-risk populations.

== Prison population and cost to society==

{{See also|United States incarceration rate}}

Between 1998 and 2010, prison populations in the United States rose dramatically. This resulted in overcrowded facilities; increased expense to taxpayers; and potential loss of public funding for other community safety activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Examining growth in the federal prison population, 1998 to 2010|url=http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/412720-Examining-Growth-in-the-Federal-Prison-Population.pdf|year=2012|publisher=Urban Institute|location=Washington, D.C.|author=Kamala Kane|author2=Barbara Parthasarathy|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1982 and 2007, corrections expenditures increased by over 250 percent and in 2007 expenditure was over $74 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kyckelhahn|first=Tracey|title=Justice Expenditures and  Employment, FY 1982-2007|date=December 2011|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/jee8207st.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the number of youths in detention facilities was 61,423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Center for Juvenile Justice|url=http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezacjrp/asp/selection.asp|publisher=Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice.|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2012, approximately 2,228,400 individuals were incarcerated in jails and prisons, about 4,781,300 individuals were under some form of community supervision (such as probation or parole), and a total of approximately 6,937,600 individuals were under some form of correctional supervision (1 in 35 adults).&lt;ref name="bjs"&gt;{{cite web|title = Correctional Populations in the United States, 2012|url = http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus12.pdf|work = Office of Justice Programs Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin|publisher = U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate = 24 February 2014|author = Lauren Glaze|author2 = Erinn Herberman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average cost of the incarceration of an individual in 2012 was approximately $31,286 per year with a range of $14,603 to $60,076.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Price of Prisons: What Incarceration Costs Taxpayers|date=January 2012|publisher=The VERA Institute of Justice Center on Sentencing and Corrections|location=New York|url=http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/Price_of_Prisons_updated_version_072512.pdf|author=Christian Henrichson|author2=Ruth Delaney|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Economic Interest Convergence in Downsizing Imprisonment|ssrn = 2608698|publisher = Social Science Research Network|date = 2014-01-01|location = Rochester, NY|last = SpearIt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors contributing to incarceration rates==

=== Substance use disorder prevention or treatment ===

Between 1980 and 2005, the number of inmates incarcerated for drug-related crimes increased by 1,000 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stemen|first=Don|title=Reconsidering Incarceration: New Directions for Reducing Crime|date=January 2007|publisher=VERA Institute of Justice Center on Sentencing and Corrections|pages=8|url=http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/veraincarc_vFW2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, sixty-five percent of inmates reported a substance addiction or dependence issue.&lt;ref name = casa&gt;{{cite book|title=Shoveling Up II: The Impact of Substance Abuse on Federal, State and Local Budgets|date=May 2009|publisher=The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University|location=New York, NY|url=http://www.casacolumbia.org/modal_forms/nojs/webform/161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy-eight percent of violent crimes and eighty-three percent of property crimes involved drugs.&lt;ref name=casa /&gt; A greater amount of money is spent on incarceration than on prevention and treatment, despite research showing that treating drug addictions is more cost-effective than incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wachendorfer|first=Allan|title=Casualties of the Drug War|journal=Senior Honors Thesis|year=2013|issue=Paper 361|url=http://commons.emich.edu/honors/361}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], a full year of drug treatment costs approximately $4,700 compared to over $30,000 for a year of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is drug addiction treatment worth its cost?|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-addiction-treatment-research-based-guide-third-edition/frequently-asked-questions/drug-addiction-treatment-worth-its-cost|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to statistics produced by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] in September 2006, over 45% of federal prisoners, 56% of state prisoners, and 64% of jail inmates are [[Mentally ill prisoners in the United States|diagnosed with mental health problems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report: Mental Health Problems of Prison  and Jail Inmates|date=September 2006|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mhppji.pdf|author=Doris James|author2=Lauren Glaze|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests a direct correlation between a decrease in mental health services and facilities and an increase in mental health diagnoses in the prison system. A decrease in mental health funding has taken place on both the state and federal level, especially in changes in block grant funding as part of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981. The statewide support for mental health services has also seen significant cuts and has barely accounted for annual inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding for Mental Health Services and Programs|url=//www.bazelon.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=GzmAbAweikQ%3D&amp;tabid=436|publisher=Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall shift from institution-based care to a community-based care model was one that many mental health advocates welcomed; however, the funding appropriated to support such programs was much less than initial estimates and has had a significant impact on the ability of the community care based model to be successful in providing adequate mental health treatment to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;NAMI - State Mental Health Cuts : A National Crisis http://www.nami.org/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm?ContentFileID=126233&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===

{{See also|School-to-prison pipeline}}

68% of state prison inmates did not receive a high school diploma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report: Education and Correctional Populations|date=January 2003|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ecp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that schooling significantly reduces criminal activity. A significant portion of the effect of education on crime can be attributed to an increase in wages associated with schooling, suggesting that an increased level of education funding will result in decreased criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The E®ect of Education on Crime: Evidence from Prison Inmates, Arrests, and Self-Reports|date=October 2003|url=http://emlab.berkeley.edu/~moretti/lm46.pdf|author=Lance Lochner|author2=Enrico Moretti|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors involving race ===

{{see also|Race and the War on Drugs|Stop-and-frisk in New York City|Arizona SB 1070|Race and crime in the United States}}

There are many factors that have direct connections with the rises in the incarcerated population, many of which relate to structural and societal biases that exist in America today. As it relates directly to race, the practice of racial profiling regards policies and personal biases that target minority racial groups and contribute to a greater proportion of minorities being incarcerated compared to the general population. Currently, over sixty percent of inmates in the United States are people of color.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2012/03/13/11351/the-top-10-most-startling-facts-about-people-of-color-and-criminal-justice-in-the-united-states/&lt;/ref&gt; These practices have existed in the American Criminal Justice system for decades and although may have gained attention in recent years, still find ways to increase the likelihood of certain demographic groups receiving negative attention from the likes of law enforcement.

=== The war on drugs and longer prison sentences ===

Beginning in the Nixon administration, the war on drugs resulted in stricter drug laws including longer prison sentences for drug use and possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Travis|first1=Jeremy|last2=Western|first2=Bruce|last3=Redburn|first3=F. Stevens|title=The Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring Causes and Consequences|date=2014|publisher=The National Academic Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=118–121|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&amp;context=jj_pubs|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that the drug offender population in federal prisons rose by 63% from 1998 to 2012 and they accounted for 52% of federal prisoners by 2012.&lt;ref name=Taxy2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taxy|first1=Sam|last2=Samuels|first2=Julie|last3=Adams|first3=William|title=Drug Offenders in Federal Prison: Estimates of Characteristics Based on Linked Data|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/dofp12.pdf|website=Bureau of Justice Statistics|accessdate=27 November 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 35% of these drug offenders were not reoffenders or had minimal criminal backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Taxy2015 /&gt;

In relation, mandatory minimum penalties have contributed to mass incarceration. The United States Sentencing Commission found that in 2016, 67.3% of offenders charged of a crime with a mandatory minimum penalty were convicted of a drug offense.&lt;ref name=USSC2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=United States Sentencing Commission|title=An Overview of Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System|url=https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20170711_Mand-Min.pdf|accessdate=27 November 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission also found that in 2016, the average sentence length was 110 months in prison compared to 28 months for those charged of a crime with no mandatory minimum penalty.&lt;ref name=USSC2017 /&gt;

== Incarceration prevention ==

Incarceration prevention refers to a variety of methods aimed at reducing prison populations and costs while fostering enhanced social structures for the improvement of society. Incarceration prevention can take place in any of three stages: Primary Prevention, Diversion, or Recidivism Prevention.

===Prevention===

Primary prevention is an attempt to reduce the risk of behaviors that potentially lead to incarceration. The initial stage in this model includes looking at system wide or systemic approaches that ensure people have consistent social and structural interactions.

==== Safety nets ====

Studies suggest that crime and violence are likely to be a byproduct of issues including economic inequality and poverty.&lt;ref name=worldbank&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourguignon|first=F.|title=Facets of globalization international and local dimensions of development|year=2001|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-8213-4742-X|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/14014|accessdate=25 February 2014|format=print|chapter=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic theory shows how property crime and violent crimes may partly be consequences of excessive inequality and poverty.&lt;ref name=worldbank /&gt; Not only do crime rates increase with inequality, but propensity to commit crimes also increases with greater income inequality or poverty.&lt;ref name=worldbank /&gt; It follows that programs which elevate families out of poverty decrease behaviors associated with crime. National data indicates that a 10% increase in real wages lowers the crime index by 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stemen|first=Don|title=New Directions for Reducing Crime|journal=Federal Sentencing Reporter|date=April 2007|volume=19|issue=4|pages=221–233|doi=10.1525/fsr.2007.19.4.221|jstor=10.1525/fsr.2007.19.4.221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Youth justice ====

{{See also|School-to-prison pipeline}}

Often, primary prevention can be viewed in the context of a school or vocational program in which there is a system of disciplinary action and reactions to behavioral issues. The goal is to institute preventive measures and different methods of support (i.e., restorative justice, restorative circles, proactive circles, and peer mediation) that encourage students/youth to meet the behavioral and academic standards set before them, without instituting harsh punitive measures that disengage students from educational and social resources provided within a school environment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Diversion ===

Diversion is an attempt to circumvent incarceration and correct problem behaviors after an offense have been committed through alternatives to incarceration. This includes identifying those "most at risk" and setting in place additional supportive measures and strategies to provide opportunities for success.

In a school setting, this most often takes place after a young person has had multiple behavioral incidences within a short period of time and is at risk for more serious punitive measures. Steps for intervention may include (but are not limited to): additional counseling and support services, conflict resolution measures, peer-to-peer resolution groups, and engagement with community partners to provide additional services. The goal is to provide opportunities and support for those who show persistent behavioral issues, as they are most at-risk for future incarceration and/or legal trouble.&lt;ref&gt;EDJ Model: Secondary http://www.edjj.org/prevention/LevelsPrevention.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Deferred sentencing and jail diversion ====

Including but not limited to:
                    	
*[[Alternative sentencing|Community Service]]: Community sentence or alternative sentencing or non-custodial sentence is a collective name in criminal justice for all the different ways, in which courts can punish someone convicted of committing an offense in ways other than prison terms.
*[[Drug courts in the United States|Drug courts]]: Drug courts operate under a model that combines intensive judicial supervision, mandatory drug testing, escalating sanctions and treatment to help substance abusers break the cycle of addiction and the crime that accompanies it.
*[[Mental health court]]s: Mental health courts link offenders who would ordinarily be prison-bound to long-term community-based treatment. They rely on mental health assessments, individualized treatment plans, and ongoing judicial monitoring to address both the mental health needs of offenders and public safety concerns of communities.
*[[Domestic violence court]]s: Specialized domestic violence courts are designed to improve victim safety and enhance defendant accountability. They emerged as problem-solving courts in the 1980s and 1990s in response to frustration among victim advocates, judges and attorneys who saw the same litigants cycling through the justice system.
*[[Problem-solving courts in the United States|Problem-solving courts]]: Problem-solving courts address the underlying problems that contribute to criminal behavior and are a current trend in the legal system of the United States. There were over 2,800 problem-solving courts in 2008, intended to provide a method of resolving the problem in order to reduce recidivism.
*[[Restorative justice in social work|Restorative justice]]: Restorative justice uses dialogue to address the harm that has been done rather than relying solely on jail time as a means of justice.
*[[Ankle monitor|Electronic Monitoring]]: Electronic monitoring is a device that individuals under house arrest or parole are often required to wear. At timed intervals, the ankle monitor sends a radio frequency signal containing location and other information to a receiver. If an offender moves outside of an allowed range, the police will be notified.
*[[Deferred prosecution|Fines/Probation]]: A deferred prosecution agreement is a voluntary alternative to adjudication in which a prosecutor agrees to grant amnesty in exchange for the defendant agreeing to fulfill certain requirements. Fulfillment of the specified requirements will then result in dismissal of the charges.
*[[Diversion program]]s: A diversion program in the criminal justice system is a form of sentencing and such programs are often run by a police department, court, a district attorney's office, or outside agency designed to enable offenders of criminal law to avoid criminal charges and a criminal record.

===Recidivism prevention===

[[Recidivism]] prevention takes place during incarceration and after release back into society. Its purpose is to reduce the risk of an individual reoffending and eventually returning into the prison system. National rates of recidivism over the last three decades have remained relatively steady at approximately 43 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State of Recidivism April 2011 The Revolving Door of America’s Prisons|date=April 2011|publisher=The Pew Center on States|page=2|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/sentencing_and_corrections/State_Recidivism_Revolving_Door_America_Prisons%20.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations provided by the "Report of the Re-Entry Policy Council" coordinated by the "Council of State Governments"  reflect the opportunities available for action by entities interested in reducing recidivism. According to the report, there are steps policy makers or practitioners should complete in order to ensure successful programs, such as collaboration, proper funding, system integration, and educating the public. The report also states that policy makers must also consider additional programming needs for incoming offenders, including intake procedures, physical and mental health care, drug treatment, and vocational training. Finally, the report emphasizes the need to address changes in social service delivery, such as housing, workforce development, treatment programs, and mental and physical healthcare systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrantz|first=Dennis|title=Coordinating Community Development: The Heart of the Michigan Prisoner ReEntry Initiative|journal=Corrections Today Magazine|date=April 2007|volume=69|issue=2|pages=42–49|publisher=http://www.aca.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prison reform ====

Prison reform seeks to advocate for programming that gives offenders the tools they need for success. Physical and mental health, drug treatment, and educational and vocational programming give offenders the opportunity to begin the process of returning to their communities to become contributing members before they leave the facility.

==== Prisoner reentry initiatives  ====

{{See also|National Criminal Justice Association#Prisoner Reentry|l1=Prisoner reentry}}

The overall purpose of such programs is to provide options, support, and opportunities for prisoners returning home into communities. The goal of preventing crime and reducing recidivism is attained through support programs including vocational and educational programs that provide returning citizens with the skills necessary to succeed in their reintegrated lives. The programs typically start by assessing strengths and risk factors through assessments when offenders begin their sentences, effective support and a plan for success that includes community support, and different strategies to help remediate skill and social deficiencies typically experienced by returning citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Washtenaw Prisoner Re-Entry Program.http://washtenawprisonerreentry.org/contactus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Juvenile confinement rates on steady decline ==

A study published by the Pew Institute found that there has been a significant decline in at least 37 states for juvenile commitment and violent crime arrest rates between 1997 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latest Data Show Juvenile Confinement Continues Rapid Decline|url=http://www.pewstates.org/news-room/press-releases/latest-data-show-juvenile-confinement-continues-rapid-decline-85899480842#four|publisher=The Pew Charitable Trust State and Consumer Initiatives|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decreases in juvenile commitments can be a result of many different factors, including unique programs like the Ohio RECLAIM (Reasonable Equitable Community and Local Alternatives to the Incarceration of Minors) program. This program provides financial incentives that encourage juvenile courts to find and develop community based strategies and programs options that seek to meet the needs of juvenile offenders or at risk offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio Reclaim|url=http://www.dys.ohio.gov/dnn/Community/ReclaimOhio/tabid/131/Default.aspx|publisher=Ohio Department of Youth Services|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program works to focus the most critical resources for the most serious offenders, such as those committing violent crimes and the most serious of offenses, while encouraging courts to look into community and restorative program placements for the youth who commit crimes not fitting such severe categories. As a result, Ohio has seen a significant decrease in institutional crowding and an 80% decrease in Department of Youth Services (DYS) caseloads from its peak in 1997 to 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4858">An '''Institute of International Studies''' or '''Institute for International Studies''' is a type of [[research center]] that focuses on [[international studies]], [[international relations]], or [[area studies]]. It is often, though not always, part of a [[University|university or college]] where it is often affiliated with, and sometimes funded by, a university's [[Public policy school|public policy, public administration, or international relations school]], a degree-granting institution. These centers may also provide geographic areas of specializations, offer internship or study-abroad opportunities, and/or give support services to university students.

One of the earliest centers for international studies was founded in 1935 at [[Yale University]]. The Yale Institute for International Studies sought to establish a central point of contact for teaching and research on international affairs, societies, and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MacMillan Center expands commitment to graduate education with conference travel grants |url=https://macmillan.yale.edu/news/macmillan-center-expands-commitment-graduate-education-conference-travel-grants |website=Yale MacMillan Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s, it was renamed the Concilium on International and Area Studies, and later became the Yale Center for International and Area Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=https://macmillan.yale.edu/overview/history |website=Yale MacMillan Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars felt that scholars at the institute conducted too much research as individuals rather than in groups. Eight of these scholars moved to [[Princeton University]] where they founded the [[Center of International Studies]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Studies, The Center of, |url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/center_international_studies.html |website=A Princeton Companion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutes similar to those at Yale and Princeton soon emerged in the 1950s at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15488">An '''interruption''' is a speech event when one person breaks in to interject while another person is talking. [[Linguistics|Linguists]], [[Social psychology|social psychologists]], [[anthropologist]]s, and [[Sociology|sociologists]] are among the [[Social science|social scientists]] who have studied and identified patterns of interruption that may differ by [[gender]], [[social status]], [[Race and ethnicity|race/ethnicity]], [[culture]], and [[political orientation]].

== Turn-taking and overlaps ==
[[Harvey Sacks]], the [[Sociology|sociologist]] who launched the field of [[conversation analysis]], worked with [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Emanuel Schegloff]] and Gail Jefferson in the 1970s to analyze how [[turn-taking]] was organized in speech events such as everyday conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sacks|first=Harvey|last2=Schegloff|first2=Emanuel A.|last3=Jefferson|first3=Gail|date=1974|title=A Simplest Systematics for the Organization of Turn-Taking for Conversation|jstor=412243|journal=Language|volume=50|issue=4|pages=696–735|doi=10.2307/412243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech events are organized so that only one person speaks at a time and to provide for orderly ways to change speakers. Sacks et al. thought that the process of turn-taking is [[subconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;Cantrell, Lucy. 2013-14. "The Power of Rapport: An Analysis of the Effects of Interruptions and Overlaps in Casual Conversation." ''Innervate'' 6: 74-85. Accessed 03-11-18 at https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/documents/innervate/13-14/06-lucy-cantrell-q33103-pp-74-85.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Overlaps occur when two or more speakers talk simultaneously.

== Types of interruptions ==
Communication analyst Julia A. Goldberg uses [[conversation analysis]] to define three types of conversational interruptions. Relationally neutral interruptions are interjections by the listener that seek to repair, repeat, or clarify something the speaker just said. During this type of interruption, the interrupter does not intend to exert power over the speaker, or to establish rapport with the speaker. The act of interruption itself is understood as neutral in this instance. Another type of interruption defined by Goldberg is the power interruption, where the interrupter breaks in and cuts off the speaker as a way to display some social power. Power interruptions are understood as acts of conflict and competition, and are viewed as rude, hostile, disrespectful, and/or uncaring about the speaker and/or what the speaker is saying. A rapport interruption is designed to display mutuality and generally conveys the impression that the interrupter understands and empathizes with the speaker and/or the content of the speech, and is interpreted as collaborative and cooperative.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Julia A.|title=Interrupting the discourse on interruptions|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-2166(90)90045-F|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=14|issue=6|pages=883–903|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(90)90045-f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power interruptions are also analyzed by Zimmerman and West, sociologists who note that the people who seek to be socially dominant exert their power over others through interrupting their speech. This can be seen in interactions between whites and racial/ethnic [[Minority group|minorities]], and between adults and children. Zimmerman and West also analyzed how [[Sex Roles|sex roles]] shape interruption patterns.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Zimmerman, Don. H., and Candace West. 1996. "Sex Roles, Interruptions and Silences in Conversation." ''Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science'' 4: 211-236.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender and interruption patterns ==
Since the late-1970s, social scientists have studied the effect gender has on interruption patterns and other components of verbal communication. The findings of these studies are mixed, with some finding gender differences, while others did not. Among those that found gender differences are sociologists Don Zimmerman and Candace West who used male dominance theory to claim that men interrupted women to assert their [[Social dominance theory|social dominance]] over females. Zimmerman and West's work discovered that interruptions were more evenly distributed in conversations involving same-sex speakers, while in cross-sex interactions, men were much more likely to interrupt women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Candace|date=1979-06-01|title=Against Our Will: Male Interruptions of Females in Cross-Sex Conversation*|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1979.tb17755.x/abstract|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=327|issue=1|pages=81–96|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1979.tb17755.x|issn=1749-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Zhao and Gantz analyzed fictional TV shows to claim that male characters used disruptive interruptions more than female characters, while female characters more often used cooperative interruptions. They note, however, that the apparent gender differences in interruption patterns are affected by differences in [[social status]] among the TV characters.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Xiaoquan|last2=Gantz|first2=Walter|date=2003-06-01|title=Disruptive and Cooperative Interruptions in Prime-Time Television Fiction: The Role of Gender, Status, and Topic|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb02595.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=347–362|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb02595.x|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg notes that when conversational context and content are analyzed, interruptions may be seen as power displays, rapport displays, or as neutral acts that may or may not be shaped by the gender of the speaker.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Linguist Makri-Tsilipakou discovered that men and women use "simultaneous speech" at about the same rate, but the sexes differ as to their interpretation of the meaning of the interruption. Women use simultaneous speech as a sign of support and agreement, while men use it either as support for the other's speech or to dissent from other speakers or from their viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1994-04-01|title=Interruption revisited: Affiliative vs. disaffiliative intervention|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378216694900124|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=401–426|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(94)90012-4|issn=0378-2166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drass, a social psychologist, found that [[gender identity]], as separate from biological sex, was an important variable, with persons who were more male-identified being more likely to interrupt than persons who were more female-identified.

Conversely, a study by Murray and Covelli used Zimmerman and West's coding strategies on their own dataset of conversations to find that women interrupted men more often than men interrupted women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Stephen O.|last2=Covelli|first2=Lucille H.|title=Women and men speaking at the same time|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-2166(88)90022-7|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=12|issue=1|pages=103–111|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(88)90022-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James and Clarke, this pattern is especially evident in conversational situations where women felt more expertise, and thus may have felt that their interruptions were more legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;James, Deborah, and Sandra Clarke. 1993. Pp. 231-280 in ''Gender and conversational analysis.'' Edited by Deborah Tannen. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manterrupting ===
The term, [[:de:Manterruption|manterrupting]], was coined in early 2015 by Jessica Bennett in an article that appeared in ''Time.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3666135/sheryl-sandberg-talking-while-female-manterruptions/|title=How Not to Be 'Manterrupted' in Meetings|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett defines the term as "[u]nnecessary interruption of a woman by a man." During the 2016 [[United States presidential debates|American presidential debates]], the term was applied to candidate [[Donald Trump]] who interrupted [[Hillary Clinton]] dozens of times during the first and second debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/money/4524162/donald-trump-manterruption-presidential-debate/|title=Donald Trump's Manterruptions Continue Uninterrupted at Second Presidential Debate|website=Money|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its introduction, the term has gained a significant presence on the internet as experts offer advice on how to avoid manterrupting and as [[Feminism|feminist]] and [[Postfeminism|postfeminist]] [[Blog|bloggers]] and commentators debate its applicability.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In 2017, [http://www.womaninterruptedapp.com/en/ Woman Interrupted], an app to track the [[gender]] of conversational partners was introduced. The app, which is free, is designed to assist men and women in recognizing and addressing manterrupting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-app-wants-to-help-women-track-how-often-theyre-manterrupted_us_58bec18de4b09ab537d6bee9|title=This App Wants To Help Women Track How Often They're 'Manterrupted'|last=Hatch|first=Jenavieve|date=2017-03-07|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status and interruption patterns ==
Interruptions work as a status-organizing cue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farley|first=Sally D.|last2=Ashcraft|first2=Amie M.|last3=Stasson|first3=Mark F.|last4=Nusbaum|first4=Rebecca L.|date=2010-12-01|title=Nonverbal Reactions to Conversational Interruption: A Test of Complementarity Theory and the Status/Gender Parallel|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10919-010-0091-0|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=34|issue=4|pages=193–206|doi=10.1007/s10919-010-0091-0|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, conversational participants use cues such as perceptions of [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]], power, [[Social class|social class,]] gender, [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and age, to organize [[Communication in small groups|small group]] [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]]. Interruption patterns differ by social status, with persons of higher [[social status]], such as belonging to a social group who has more prestige or power, interrupting persons with lower status.&lt;ref name="Kollock 1985 34–46"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kollock|first=Peter|last2=Blumstein|first2=Philip|last3=Schwartz|first3=Pepper|date=1985|title=Sex and Power in Interaction: Conversational Privileges and Duties|jstor=2095338|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=50|issue=1|pages=34–46|doi=10.2307/2095338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobi and Schweers analyzed transcripts of oral arguments made before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] to find that senior justices interrupted their junior colleagues more frequently than the reverse.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobi|first=Tonja|last2=Schweers|first2=Dylan|date=2017-10-24|title=Justice, Interrupted: The Effect of Gender, Ideology and Seniority at Supreme Court Oral Arguments|ssrn=2933016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kollock et al. studied conversations among couples, including male couples, female couples, and mixed sex couples. They found that partners who were considered to have more social power interrupted their partners more often, regardless of the gender composition of the dyad.&lt;ref name="Kollock 1985 34–46"/&gt; In TV shows, characters who are lower in the status hierarchy are scripted to display a "sense of defiance" that allows them to interrupt more aggressively than persons who hold a mid-level status.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A study of interviews between physicians and patients found that physicians, who are considered to hold higher status than their patients in terms of prestige, are much more likely to interrupt their patients, regardless of the sex of the patient or the physician. Patients interrupted senior physicians at a higher rate than they interrupted doctors who were in training, indicating that the senior physicians are regarded as having a higher status than the their junior colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Menz, Florian, and Ali Al-Roubaie. 2008. "Interruptions, status and gender in medical interviews: the harder you brake, the longer it takes." ''Discourse &amp; Society'' 19(5): 645-666.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a study of physician-patient interactions among six different statuses, from low to high, indicated that patients tended to interrupt physicians more than the reverse, and that high and low status physicians did not differ in the number of times that they interrupted their patients. This study, by Irish and Hall, noted that status thus appears to be less of an indicator of the likelihood of interruptions among physicians and patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Irish|first=J. T.|last2=Hall|first2=J. A.|date=September 1995|title=Interruptive patterns in medical visits: the effects of role, status and gender|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=41|issue=6|pages=873–881|issn=0277-9536|pmid=8571159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to social status affecting interruption patterns, interruptions also affect social status. In a study of mixed-sex and same-sex [[Dyad (sociology)|dyads]], Farley discovered that the interrupters gained social status after they interrupted, while those who were interrupted lost social status. This study also found that people who interrupted also lost in terms of likeability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farley|first=Sally D.|date=2008-12-01|title=Attaining Status at the Expense of Likeability: Pilfering Power Through Conversational Interruption|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10919-008-0054-x|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=241–260|doi=10.1007/s10919-008-0054-x|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race/ethnicity and interruption patterns ==
Zimmerman and West note that whites interrupt blacks as a strategy to exert their power and dominance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cultural differences ==
Interruptions, and how people interpret interruptions, differ by [[culture]] and [[language]]. Makri-Tsilpakou notes that some languages and cultures have higher tolerance for simultaneous talk, and that interpretations of interruptions may differ depending on cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118611463.wbielsi088/abstract|title=The International Encyclopedia of Language and Social Interaction|last=Makri-Tsilipakou|first=Marianthi|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118611463|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118611463.wbielsi088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political orientation ==
Political [[Political spectrum|orientation]], e.g. where a person falls on the [[Conservatism|conservative]] to [[Liberalism|liberal]] political continuum, also shapes the likelihood that people will interrupt others or will be interrupted themselves. Jacobi and Schweers, in their study of transcripts of oral arguments made before the U.S. Supreme Court, found that conservative justices and advocates interrupt more often than liberals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1205">A '''kaross''' is a [[cloak]] made of [[sheepskin]], or the hide of other animals, with the hair left on. It is properly confined to the coat of skin without sleeves and used to be worn by the [[Khoikhoi]] and [[Bushmen|Bushmen / San]] peoples of [[South Africa]]. These karosses became replaced by a blanket. Their chiefs wore karosses of the skin of the wild cat, [[leopard]] or [[caracal]]. The word is also loosely applied to the cloaks of leopard-skin worn by the chiefs and principal men of several southern African tribes. Kaross is probably either a genuine Khoikhoi word, or else an adaptation of the Dutch kuras ({{lang-pt|couraça}}), a cuirass. In a vocabulary dated 1673 "karos" is described as a "corrupt Dutch word."

These days the kaross is a common tourist item, being made of various animal hides including cowhide. The term is loosely applied in modern times to fur blankets sold as bedding. These "karosses" often have panels of different types of animal fur sewn into them in order to make a decorative pattern.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

{{multiple issues|{{Tone|date=July 2008}}
{{primary sources|date=August 2008}}}}

The terms '''legal case management''' ('''LCM''') or '''matter management''' refer to a subset of [[law]] practice management and cover a range of approaches and technologies used by law firms and courts to leverage [[knowledge]] and methodologies for managing the life cycle of a case or matter more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;In the U.S., the term 'case' is customarily applied to a matter in which there are opposing parties or which involves a conflict between parties ''Capturing More Time ... And Keeping Your Clients Happy While Doing It'', Law Practice Today, March 2007.[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/articles/bot03071.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the terms refer to the sophisticated information management and workflow practices that are tailored to meet the legal field's specific needs and requirements.

As attorneys and law firms compete for clients they are routinely challenged to deliver services at lower costs with greater efficiency, thus firms develop practice-specific processes and utilize contemporary technologies to assist in meeting such challenges. Law practice management processes and technologies include case and matter management, time and billing, litigation support, research, communication and collaboration, [[data mining]] and modeling, and [[data security]], storage, and archive accessibility.

==Case management software==
Legal case or matter management software has two primary functions: it helps to better use, manage, consolidate, share, and protect information, and it tracks and shapes the business process. Because the most useful forms of such software can integrate data from multiple systems, departments, users, and business entities, its use can increase a firm's business advantage.

Case or matter management systems having the capacity to push and pull data over the Internet, whether within the software itself or within an integrated software framework or environment became an industry standard with the advent of the [[LexisNexis|Lexis]] and [[Westlaw]] legal research platforms.

Case management software is marketed to specific segments of the legal marketplace, with some products designed for small firms and others for large multinational firms, and a few claim to be scalable to all. Cost-containment and competition concerns facing small-to-mid-size firms that cannot afford a full-time IT staff often drive custom solutions incorporating muliple integrated products.

==In-house legal departments==
In-house legal teams (in the public and private sectors) have their own needs: generally these require less emphasis on billing and accounts (since clients tend to be internal), and even more on traceability, real-time integration and configurability. The need to improve productivity of the team and reduce costs to taxpayers, or the business, is often a key driver.  Some in-house teams have reduced their external legal bills by using case management software to increase their capacity and bring case work in-house.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Teh, Telegraph Media Group on [http://www.iken.biz www.iken.biz] January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case management in the U.S. federal courts==
As electronic court systems continue to increase their online presence, many now require case filings to be accomplished electronically.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., News Release, ''Electronic Case Filing in Federal Courts Reaches Milestone'', November 21, 2005.{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/cmecfat10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515005302/http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/cmecfat10.html |archivedate=2009-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Courts, ''About Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF)'', July 2009.{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/cmecf/cmecf_about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602021153/http://www.uscourts.gov/cmecf/cmecf_about.html |archivedate=2009-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many legal software vendors' products include the ability to take advantage of such electronic filing by pulling data from the case management product and pushing it into court filing systems.

==e-Discovery systems==
In litigation, the discovery process often results in enormous amounts of information that must be managed, and with the revision of the U.S. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in 2006 to include electronic means of discovery&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/#chapter_v FRCP]&lt;/ref&gt; came a new subset of case management systems that incorporated those changes, often dubbed 'electronic evidence' or 'e-discovery' management systems.&lt;ref&gt;See Kaplan, ''Industry Research Report, A Conversation with Corporate Counsel: e-Discovery Trends and Perspectives'', Fios, Inc. and Ari Kaplan Advisors, 2008.[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/docs/LPT608AriKaplan-ResearchStudy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/articles/tch04081.shtml Blake, ''Are You Litigation-Ready?'', Law Practice Today, April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the new rules took effect, e-Discovery firms as outside service vendors have flourished.

== Case management and the regulation of mediation in Australia ==
The term '''case management''' is also used to refer to systems in which court or tribunal officials assume closer administrative control over the litigation process than is traditionally associated with [[common law]] [[litigation]].&lt;ref name="Boulle"&gt;Boulle, L. (2005). Mediation: Principles Process Practice. 2nd Edition. Queensland, Australia. LexisNexis Butterworths.&lt;/ref&gt; The Assisted Dispute Resolution program was introduced into the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] in 1990 after a number of cases failed to reach resolutions having several directional hearings. In those cases the parties were not able to isolate the issues requiring determination. With the new program, judges can refer the parties to a court registrar for mediation. This is stated in the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Section 53A(1):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s53a.html|title=Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) s 53A|last=|first=|date=|website=www.austlii.edu.au|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504050856/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s53a.html|archive-date=2007-05-04|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|(1)  Subject to the Rules of Court, the Court may by order refer the proceedings in the Court, or any part of them or any matter arising out of them, to a mediator or an arbitrator for mediation or arbitration, as the case may be, in accordance with the Rules of Court. 

(1A)  Referrals under subsection (1) to a mediator may be made with or without the consent of the parties to the proceedings. However, referrals to an arbitrator may be made only with the consent of the parties.}} 

Case management in the State of New South Wales includes governing civil court proceedings by court management rules, which are the ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' (NSW)[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2005/28/full] and ''Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005'' (NSW)[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/regulation/2005/418/full]. The overriding purpose of case management in the ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' is 'to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution' to the matter at dispute in the civil court proceedings (s56(1), ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' (NSW) [http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2005/28/part6/div1/sec56]).

In Australia, mediation as an [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) method is designed to avoid resorting to formal court-based adjudication and is now also being applied to criminal matters. Traditional theories of criminal justice view the matter as one between the offender and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Sarre, R. and Earle, K. (2004). Restorative Justice in Key Issues in Criminal Justice Sarre R, and Tomaino, J. (eds) Key Issues in Criminal Justice, Adelaide: Australian Humanities Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary to have the parties consent to the mediation process and a judge can direct the mediation. In this sense, case management is designed to identify and define issues in dispute and to reduce delays, costs and unnecessary pre-trial activities. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hat was born of resistance and opposition to the formal justice system has been extensively integrated and co-opted into the system.&lt;ref&gt;Astor, H &amp; Chinkin, C. M. (2nd Edition, 2002). Dispute Resolution in Australia. Sydney Australia.. LexisNexis Butterworths&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1813">'''Mesosociology''' is the study of intermediate (''meso'') social forces and [[social stratification|stratification]] such as [[income]], [[Ageing|age]], [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[social organization|organization]]s and geographically circumscribed [[community|communities]]. 

Mesosociology lies between analysis of large-scale macro forces such as the [[economy]] or human [[society|societies]] (which is a domain of [[macrosociology]]), and everyday human [[social interaction]]s on a small scale (a domain of [[microsociology]]).

==Social control==
Meso-level forces of [[social control]] include organizations and communities. The organizations are middle level structures of control. One type is a total institution, which is an organization in which people are confined until they can adhere to society's norms, including prisons and mental hospitals. Another type of middle level organization is the reintegration structure. This structure rehabilitates those who do not conform. These include rehabilitation centers for drugs and alcohol. A final type of organization is a [[safety-valve organization]]. These provide outlets for behavior that is considered deviant, but cannot be eradicated from society, including prostitution. Communities also are instruments of social control. Things that are controlled by local governments are often the most visible signs of social control in a community, such as a police force and the organization of neighborhoods.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4473">[[File:Poster-museumofchristianart.jpg|thumb|Poster from the Museum of Christian Art, Goa.]]The '''Museum of Christian Art''', in the former colonial capital of [[Old Goa]], is a museum of [[Christian art]].

==About==

The [[museum]] is located in the [[Convent of Santa Monica]] in [[Old Goa]], [[Goa]]. It is open from 9.30 am to 5 pm on all days, Monday to Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.museumofchristianart.com/?flag=MU# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028221617/http://museumofchristianart.com/?flag=MU# |archive-date=2013-10-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a project of the [[Archdiocese of Goa]] and was set up with technical and financial assistance from the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]], [[Portugal]] and the [[Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage]] ([[INTACH]]), [[New Delhi]]. Earlier, it was located at the [[Seminary of Rachol]], [[Salcete]], [[Goa]].

==Exhibits==

Its exhibits are divided into the following categories:
* [[Sculptures]]
* [[Furniture]]
* [[Ivory]]
* [[Paintings]]
* [[Textiles]]
* [[Precious Metals]]
* [[Metals]]
* Miscellaneous

==Statuary, paintings, sculptures==

The ''[[Lonely Planet]]'' says: "Within the [[Convent of St. Monica]], the excellent Museum of Christian Art contains statuary, paintings and sculptures transferred here from the [[Rachol Seminary]]. Many of the works of [[Goan]] [[Christian art]] during the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] era were produced by local [[Hindu]] artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/goa/old-goa/sights/museum/museum-christian-art# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130092135/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/goa/old-goa/sights/museum/museum-christian-art# |archive-date=2012-01-30 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious silverware==

''[[Fodors]]'', another [[travel guide]], notes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/india/goa/review-445833.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207105925/http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/india/goa/review-445833.html# |archive-date=2013-12-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the museum is located inside the [[Convent of St. Monica]], and "has a number of objects of [[Christian]] interest, including paintings and religious silverware, some dating back to the 16th century." It also notes that this convent was the first nunnery of its kind in the [[East]] and continued until the late 19th century.

==Christian art, elsewhere==

In [[Goa]], the [[Goa State Museum]] also houses a Christian Art Gallery. In August 2011, [[Mumbai]] also announced plans to open its museum of [[Christian art]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-16/mumbai/29891827_1_church-artefacts-museum-christianity&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art heist==

In January 2012, a major art heist was reported&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-26/goa/30666486_1_security-guard-museum-burgled&lt;/ref&gt; at the museum. There was no detailed listing of the items that were stolen, in a case which saw a security guard being killed.

'''Nanzo-in''' ({{Nihongo2|南蔵院|help=yes}}) is a Shingon sect Buddhist temple in Sasaguri, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. It is notable for its bronze statue of a reclining Buddha, said to be the largest bronze statue in the world.

==History==
[[File:Gate of Nanzoin Temple in Sasaguri, Kasuya, Fukuoka.JPG|thumb|Gate to Nanzoin Temple in Sasaguri, Fukuoka, Japan.]]
Nanzo-in temple was originally located on [[Mountain Kōya|Mt. Koyasan]], but local anti-Buddhist authorities threatened to destroy the temple in 1886&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.japan.travel/in/spot/2167/|title=Nanzo-in Temple|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Public outcry lead to a decade-long effort to have the temple transferred to [[Sasaguri, Fukuoka|Sasaguri]].&lt;ref name=ACROS&gt;{{cite book|last1=ACROS|first1=Fukuoka|title=Fukuoka Guide Spring 2011|date=2011|publisher=ACROS Fukuoka}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was moved in 1899, under the leadership of Sasaguri priest, Hayashi Satoshiun.&lt;ref name=Sasagurikanko&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kanko|first1=Sasaguri|title=Sasaguri Tourism: Nanzoin Temple (Japanese)|url=http://www.sasagurikanko.com/temple/nanzoin/|website=Sasagurikanko.com|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanzo-in temple is the main location among the 88 temples that make up the Sasaguri pilgrimage route, one of the three famous walking [[pilgrimage]]s in Japan.&lt;ref name=Crossroads /&gt;

Today, the temple and its surrounding grounds receive more than 1 million visitors annually.&lt;ref name=Crossroads&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fukuoka|first1=Crossroads|title=Nanzoin Temple|url=http://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/event/?mode=detail&amp;id=4000000000402&amp;isSpot=1|publisher=Crossroads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lottery===
A chief priest of Nanzo-in temple once won the lottery after laying his ticket next to a statue of [[Daikokuten|Daikoku]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://taiken.co/single/nanzo-in-temple-the-reclining-buddha-temple/|title=Nanzo-in Temple: The Reclining Buddha Temple|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The temple claims that others who have made a similar effort have also won the lottery, bringing the temple associations with luck and lottery tickets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bemarietravels.com/nanzoin-temple-fukuoka/|title=The Beautiful Nanzoin Temple Fukuoka|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reclining Buddha==
[[File:Reclining Buddha in Nanzoin Temple 20150429.JPG|thumb|The reclining Buddha statue at Nanzoin Temple in Sasaguri, Fukuoka, Japan.]]
The reclining [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] statue, known as either ''Nehanzo'' or ''Shaka Nehan'' ("Nirvana")&lt;ref name=Macleans&gt;{{cite web|title=Karmic Cleansing|url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/karmic-cleansing/|website=Macleans.ca|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is 41 meters long, 11 meters high, and weighs nearly 300 tons.&lt;ref name="Sasaguri Town"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sasaguri-shi|title=Sasaguri Sight-Seeing Spots|publisher=Sasaguri Town|url=http://www.town.sasaguri.fukuoka.jp/userfiles/files/data/create/lecture/sightseeing_spots.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue depicts Buddha at the moment of death, or entrance into [[nirvana]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The interior holds ashes of Buddha and two Buddhist adherents, [[Ananda]] and [[Maudgalyayana]]. Those relics were a gift from Myanmar as thanks for the sect's donations of medical supplies to children in both [[Nepal]] and [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref name=Sasagurikanko /&gt; In 1995, 1,300 monks from Myanmar and Nepal attended the unveiling of the reclining Buddha statue.&lt;ref name=Sasagurikanko /&gt;

Inside the sculpture, sand from each of the 88 shrines that make up the [[Shikoku Pilgrimage|Shikoku pilgrimage]] are stored below bricks within a narrow hallway.&lt;ref name=Nakamura&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nakamura|first1=Connie|title=Sasaguri Town - Mini Pilgrimage And More!|url=http://taiken.co/single/sasaguri-town-mini-pilgrimage-and-more|website=Taiken.co|publisher=Taiken|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, hundreds of Buddhists come together to clean the statue using bamboo leaves tied to five-meter poles.&lt;ref name=Macleans /&gt;

==Funerals==
Nanzo-in Temple has 4,315 ''nokotsudo,'' places where bones of the deceased are stored.&lt;ref name=Bryant /&gt; The temple has a non-traditional fee structure for housing remains. First, it is open to all sects of Buddhism, and is even open to [[Shinto]] remains. Secondly, many Buddhist temples rely on a monthly fee for housing the bones of the deceased, which are then disposed of after a set period of time. Nanzo-in Temple has one fee, which covers 200 years.&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=Clifton|title=Handbook of Death and Dying|date=2003|publisher=SAGE|page=668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Institute of Radiological Sciences hospital established in 1961 is a research hospital with a basic focus on [[radiation therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medical-excellence-japan.org/en/hospital/002/index.html Charged Particle Therapy Research Center Hospital, National Institute of Radiological Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) of NIRS was launched, and in 1997 the Research Center for Charged Particle Therapy was opened as one of the leading medical centers using [[particle therapy|carbon ions]] are in operation.

On April 1, 2016, the [[Japan Atomic Energy Agency]] (JAEA) transferred some of its laboratories to the NIRS, and the NIRS body was renamed to the National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST) which includes existing laboratories of the NIRS; the NIRS is currently a radiological research division of the QST.

'''Neuroscience of sex differences''' is the study of understanding the characteristics of the brain that separate the male brain and the female brain.  Psychological sex differences are thought by some to reflect the interaction of genes, hormones and social learning on brain development throughout the lifespan.

Some evidence from brain morphology and function studies indicates that male and female brains cannot always be assumed to be identical from either a structural or functional perspective, and some brain structures are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]].&lt;ref name="Cahill"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

__TOC__

==History==
Ideas of differences in the male and female brain circulated during the time of ancient Greek philosophers around 850 B.C. [[Aristotle]] claimed that males did not "receive their soul" until 40 days post-gestation and females did not until 80 days. In 1854, [[Emil Huschke]] discovered that "the [[frontal lobe]] in the male is all of 1%  larger than that of the female."&lt;ref name=Swaab&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Swaab DF, Hofman MA |title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain. A historical perspective |volume=61 |issue= |pages=361–74 |year=1984 |pmid=6396708 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(08)64447-7|series=Progress in Brain Research |isbn=9780444805324 |chapter=Sexual Differentiation of the Human Brain a Historical Perspective }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 19th century progressed, scientists began researching sexual dimorphisms in the brain significantly more.&lt;ref name=Swaab2&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hofman MA, Swaab DF |title=Sexual dimorphism of the human brain: myth and reality |journal=Experimental and Clinical Endocrinology |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=161–70 |year=1991 |pmid=1778230 |doi=10.1055/s-0029-1211113|url=https://pure.knaw.nl/portal/files/490079/14938_285_swaab.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until around 21 years ago, scientists knew of several structural sexual dimorphisms of the brain, but they did not think that sex had any impact on how the human brain performs daily tasks. Through molecular, animal, and neuroimaging studies, a great deal of information regarding the differences between male and female brains and how much they differ in regards to both structure and function has been uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Margaret M.|date=2016-02-19|title=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences: 371 (1688)|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1688|journal=Phil.

==Evolutionary explanations==

===Sexual selection===
Females show enhanced information recall compared to males. This may be due to the fact that females have a more intricate evaluation of risk-scenario contemplation, based on a prefrontal cortical control of the amygdala.  For example, the ability to recall information better than males most likely originated from sexual selective pressures on females during competition with other females in mate selection. Recognition of social cues was an advantageous characteristic because it ultimately maximized offspring and was therefore selected for during evolution.&lt;ref name="Cahill"/&gt;

[[Oxytocin]] is a hormone that induces contraction of the uterus and lactation in mammals. It is also a characteristic hormone of nursing mothers. Studies have found that oxytocin improves spatial memory. Through activation of the [[MAP kinase]] pathway, oxytocin plays a role in the enhancement of long-term synaptic plasticity, which is a change in strength between two neurons over a synapse that lasts for minutes or longer, and long-term memory. This hormone may have helped mothers remember the location of distant food sources so they could better nurture their offspring.&lt;ref name="Cahill"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cahill L |title=Why sex matters for neuroscience |journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=477–84 |date=June 2006  |pmid=16688123 |doi=10.1038/nrn1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male vs. female brain anatomy==

===Hemisphere differences===
A popular theory regarding language functions suggests that women use both hemispheres more equally, whereas men are more strongly lateralized to the left hemisphere; however a 2008 meta-analysis of 29 studies comparing language lateralization in males and females found no overall difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sommer IE, Aleman A, Somers M, Boks MP, Kahn RS |title=Sex differences in handedness, asymmetry of the planum temporale and functional language lateralization |journal=Brain Research |volume=1206 |issue= |pages=76–88 |date=April 2008  |pmid=18359009 |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2008.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amygdala===
[[File:Amygdala small.gif|thumb|alt=image of Amygdala| The amygdala (red) in a human brain.]]
A 2016 meta-analysis found that the amygdala is not significantly larger in either sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marwha|first=Dhruv|last2=Halari|first2=Meha|last3=Eliot|first3=Lise|date=2017-02-15|title=Meta-analysis reveals a lack of sexual dimorphism in human amygdala volume|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916307431|journal=NeuroImage|volume=147|pages=282–294|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.12.021|pmid=27956206}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 meta-analysis of [[fMRI]] studies of amygdala activation found larger effect sizes in men compared with women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sergerie |first1=K |last2=Chochol |first2=C |last3=Armony |first3=JL |title=The role of the amygdala in emotional processing: a quantitative meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies. |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=2008 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=811–30 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.12.002 |pmid=18316124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amygdala volume correlates positively with fearfulness in girls but not in boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In fMRI studies, women display stronger activation in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex than men.&lt;ref name=Homberg2017/&gt;

===Hippocampus===
A 2016 meta-analysis found that the hippocampus does not differ in volume between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tan |first1=A |last2=Ma |first2=W |last3=Vira |first3=A |last4=Marwha |first4=D |last5=Eliot |first5=L |title=The human hippocampus is not sexually-dimorphic: Meta-analysis of structural MRI volumes. |journal=NeuroImage |date=1 January 2016 |volume=124 |issue=Pt A |pages=350–366 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.08.050 |pmid=26334947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other regions and not region-specific===

There are sex differences in [[locus coeruleus]] dendritic structure that allow for an increased reception and processing of limbic information in females compared to males.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kret |first1=ME |last2=De Gelder |first2=B |title=A review on sex differences in processing emotional signals. |journal=Neuropsychologia |date=June 2012 |volume=50 |issue=7 |pages=1211–21 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.12.022 |pmid=22245006|url=http://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/a-review-on-sex-differences-in-processing-emotional-signals(3aea49a9-7521-4aae-863d-6f351a012b88).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressive and defiant behavior is also associated with decreased right [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) volume in boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===White/grey matter===
In a 2013 meta-analysis, researchers found on average males had larger [[grey matter]] (GM) volume in bilateral [[amygdala]]e, [[Hippocampus|hippocampi]], anterior [[Parahippocampal gyrus|parahippocampal gyri]], [[Cingulate cortex|posterior cingulate gyri]], [[precuneus]], [[putamen]] and [[Temporal lobe|temporal]] poles, areas in the left posterior and [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate gyri]], and areas in the [[cerebellum]] bilateral VIIb, VIIIa and Crus I lobes, left VI and right Crus II lobes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A meta-analysis of sex differences in human brain structure|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763413003011|journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|date = 2014-02-01|pmc = 3969295|pmid = 24374381|pages = 34–50|volume = 39|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.12.004|first = Amber N.

== Brain networks ==
A 2014 meta-analysis found that although men and women commonly used the same brain networks for [[working memory]], specific regions were sex specific.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://brainmap.org/pubs/Hill_BP_14.pdf|title = Gender differences in working memory networks: A BrainMap meta-analysis|last = Hill|first = Ashley C.|date = 2014|journal = Biological Psychology|doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2014.06.008|pmid = 25042764|pmc = 4157091|access-date =|volume=102|pages=18–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, both men and women's active [[working memory]] networks composed of bilateral [[Brodmann area 46|middle frontal gyri]], left [[Cingulate cortex|cingulate gyrus]], right [[precuneus]], left [[Inferior parietal lobule|inferior]] and [[Parietal lobe|superior parietal lobes]], right [[claustrum]], and left middle [[Temporal lobe|temporal gyrus]] but women also tended have consistent activity in the [[Limbic system|limbic]] regions such as the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]], bilateral [[amygdala]] and right [[hippocampus]] while men tended to have a distributed networks spread out among the [[cerebellum]], portions of the superior [[parietal lobe]], the left [[Insular cortex|insula]] and bilateral [[thalamus]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A 2017 review from the perspective of [[large-scale brain networks]], hypothesized that women's higher susceptibility to stress-prone diseases like PTSD and major depressive disorder, in which the [[salience network]] is theorized to be overactive and to interfere with the [[Executive functions|executive control network]], may be due in part (along with societal exposure to stressors and the coping strategies that are available to women) to underlying sex-based brain differences.&lt;ref name=Homberg2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Homberg |first1=Judith R |last2=Kozicz |first2=Tamas |last3=Fernández |first3=Guillén |title=Large-scale network balances in the transition from adaptive to maladaptive stress responses |journal=Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences |date=April 2017 |volume=14 |pages=27–32 |doi=10.1016/j.cobeha.2016.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurochemical differences==

===Hormones===
[[Steroid hormones]] have several effects on brain development as well as maintenance of [[homeostasis]] throughout adulthood. One effect they exhibit is on the [[hypothalamus]], where they increase [[synapse]] formation.&lt;ref name= "Simerly"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simerly RB |title=Wired on hormones: endocrine regulation of hypothalamic development |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=81–5 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15721748 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2005.01.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estrogen receptors have been found in the [[hypothalamus]], [[pituitary gland]], [[hippocampus]], and [[frontal cortex]], indicating the estrogen plays a role in brain development.  [[Gonadal hormone]] receptors have also been found in the basal fore-brain nuclei.&lt;ref name="Genazzani"/&gt;

====Estrogen and the female brain====
[[Estradiol]] influences cognitive function, specifically by enhancing learning and memory in a dose-sensitive manner.  Too much [[estrogen]] can have negative effects by weakening performance of learned tasks as well as hindering performance of memory tasks; this can result in females exhibiting poorer performance of such tasks when compared to males.&lt;ref name="Korol"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Korol DL |title=Role of estrogen in balancing contributions from multiple memory systems |journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=309–23 |date=November 2004  |pmid=15464412 |doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2004.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that during development, estrogen can exhibit both feminizing and defeminizing effects on the human brain; high levels of estrogen induce male neural traits to develop while moderate levels induce female traits.  In females, defeminizing effects are resisted because of the presence of [[α-fetoprotein]] (AFP), a carrier protein proposed to transport estrogen into brain cells, allowing the female brain to properly develop. The role of AFP is significant at crucial stages of development, however. Prenatally, AFP blocks estrogen. Postnatally, AFP decreases to ineffective levels; therefore, it is probable that estrogen exhibits its effects on female brain development postnatally.&lt;ref name="Bakker"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bakker J, Baum MJ |title=Role for estradiol in female-typical brain and behavioral sexual differentiation |journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |date=January 2008  |pmid=17720235 |pmc=2373265 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2007.06.001|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/91356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ovariectomies, surgeries inducing [[menopause]], or natural menopause cause fluctuating and decreased [[estrogen]] levels in women. This in turn can "attenuate the effects" of endogenous opioid peptides. [[Opioid peptide]]s are known to play a role in emotion and motivation. [[β-endorphin]] (β-EP), an endogenous [[opioid peptide]], content has been found to decrease (in varying amounts/brain region), post [[ovariectomy]], in female rats within the [[hypothalamus]], [[hippocampus]], and [[pituitary gland]]. Such a change in β-EP levels could be the cause of mood swings, behavioral disturbances, and hot flashes in post menopausal women.&lt;ref name= "Genazzani"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Genazzani AR, Pluchino N, Luisi S, Luisi M |title=Estrogen, cognition and female ageing |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=175–87 |year=2007 |pmid=17135285 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dml042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Testosterone and the male brain====
[[Testosterone]] heavily influences male development; a study found that perinatal females introduced to elevated testosterone levels exhibited male behavior patterns. In the absence of testosterone, female behavior is retained.&lt;ref name="Simerly"/&gt;
Testosterone's influence on the brain is caused by organizational developmental effects. It has been shown to influence proaptotic proteins so that they increase neuronal cell death in certain brain regions.  Another way testosterone affects brain development is by aiding in the construction of the "limbic hypothalamic neural networks".&lt;ref name="Simerly"/&gt;

==== Oxytocin and Vasopressin ====
[[Oxytocin]] is positively correlated with maternal behaviours, social recognition, social contact, sexual behaviour and  pair bonding. Oxytocin appears at higher levels in women than in men.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://younglab.yerkes.emory.edu/Getz/2007%20Carter%20BBR.pdf|title = Sex differences in oxytocin and vasopressin: Implications for autism spectrum disorders?|last = Carter|first = C.Sue|date = 2006|journal = Behavioural Brain Research |volume=176 |issue = 1|pages=170–186|doi = 10.1016/j.bbr.2006.08.025|pmid = 17000015|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasopressin]] on the other hand is more present in men and mediates sexual behavior, aggression and other social functions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual dimorphism in cognition and behaviour: the role of X-linked genes|url = http://www.eje-online.org/content/155/suppl_1/S99|journal = European Journal of Endocrinology|date = 2006-11-01|issn = 0804-4643|pages = S99–S106|volume = 155|issue = suppl 1|doi = 10.1530/eje.1.02263|first = David H.|last = Skuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive tasks==
It was once thought that sex differences in cognitive task and problem solving did not occur until puberty. However, as of 2000 evidence suggested that cognitive and skill differences are present earlier in development. For example, researchers have found that three- and four-year-old boys were better at targeting and at mentally rotating figures within a clock face than girls of the same age were. Prepubescent girls, however, excelled at recalling lists of words. These sex differences in cognition correspond to patterns of ability rather than overall intelligence.  Laboratory settings are used to systematically study the sexual dimorphism in problem solving task performed by adults.&lt;ref name= "Kimura"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimura|first=Doreen|title=Sex and Cognition|date=July 31, 2000|publisher=A Bradford Book|isbn=978-0262611640|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, males excel relative to females at certain spatial tasks. Specifically, males have an advantage in tests that require the [[mental rotation]] or manipulation of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=DI |last2=Halpern |first2=DF |title=The new science of cognitive sex differences. |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |date=January 2014 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=37–45 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2013.10.011 |pmid=24246136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a computer simulation of a maze task, males completed the task faster and with fewer errors than their female counterparts. Additionally, males have displayed higher accuracy in tests of targeted motor skills, such as guiding projectiles.&lt;ref name="Kimura"/&gt; Males are also faster on reaction time and finger tapping tests.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender differences in processing speed: A review of recent research|journal = Learning and Individual Differences|pages = 145–149|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.lindif.2010.11.021|first = Eka|last = Roivainen|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, females excel relative to males on tests that measure recollection. They have an advantage on processing speed involving letters, digits and rapid naming tasks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Females tend to have better object location memory and [[verbal memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why women see differently from the way men see? A review of sex differences in cognition and sports|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254614000398|journal = Journal of Sport and Health Science|date = 2014-09-01|pmc = 4266559|pmid = 25520851|pages = 155–162|volume = 3|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.jshs.2014.03.012|first = Rena|last = Li}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also perform better at verbal learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Putative sex differences in verbal abilities and language cortex: A critical review|journal = Brain and Language|pages = 175–183|volume = 108|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2008.07.001|pmid = 18722007|first = Mikkel|last = Wallentin|year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females have better performance at matching items and precision tasks, such as placing pegs into designated holes. In maze and path completion tasks, males learn the goal route in fewer trials than females, but females remember more of the landmarks presented. This shows that females use landmarks in everyday situations to orient themselves more than males. Females are better at remembering whether objects had switched places or not.&lt;ref name="Kimura"/&gt;

A '''noun particle''' is any [[morpheme]] that denotes or marks the presence of a [[noun]].  Noun particles do not exist in [[English language|English]], but can be found in other languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. &lt;!-- I'm pretty sure Arabic has object and topic particles as well; someone knowledgeable in Arabic should add something below. -Roehl Sybing --&gt;

==Korean particles==
&lt;!-- The following section is based on the Korean reference found on Wikibooks, as I have very little experience with Korean.  Romanization - as well as clarifications/corrections - is most certainly encouraged and requested. -RS --&gt;
{{Main|Korean language}}
Korean particles are [[postposition]]s, which differ from English [[preposition]]s in that they come ''after'' the word they mark.
*'''Example #1:''' {{lang|ko|새가 지붕 '''위에''' 있어요.}} (There's a bird '''on''' the roof.)
The particle "{{lang|ko|위에}}" is used to mean "on" or "above." It follows the word "{{lang|ko|지붕}}" ("roof").
*'''Example #2:''' {{lang|ko|도서관이 시장 옆에 있어요.}} (The library is '''next to''' the market.)
The particle "{{lang|ko|옆에}}" means "next to," and it follows "{{lang|ko|시장}}" ("market").

==Japanese particles==
{{Main|Japanese grammar}}

Just as in Korean, noun particles follow the noun being marked, and can serve any of several functions in a given sentence.
*'''Example #1:''' {{lang|ja|昨日スーパーへ行きました。}} (Yesterday, I went '''to''' the supermarket.)
**Kinoo suupaa '''e''' ikimashita.
In this example, "e" is the noun particle for "suupaa" ("supermarket").  This particular noun particle denotes direction towards a place, being "supermarket."

*'''Example #2:''' {{lang|ja|昼ごはんは私がピザを食べた。}} (I ate pizza for lunch. '''lit.''' '''As for''' lunch, I ate pizza.)
**Hirugohan '''wa''' watashi '''ga''' piza '''o''' tabeta.
The three noun particles ("wa," "ga," and "o") all serve different functions:
* "wa" - ''topic marker'' ("hirugohan" - lunch)
* "ga" - ''subject marker'' ("watashi" - I)
* "o" - ''object marker'' ("piza" - pizza)

'''Objectivity''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] concept of being [[wikt:true|true]] independently from [[subject (philosophy)|individual]] [[subjectivity]] caused by perception, emotions, or imagination. A proposition is considered to have '''objective truth''' when its truth conditions are met without bias caused by a [[sentience|sentient]] subject. [[Objectivity (science)|Scientific objectivity]] refers to the ability to judge without partiality or external influence, sometimes used synonymously with ''[[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]]''.

== Objectivity of knowledge ==
&lt;!-- 'Rhetorical situation' points here --&gt;
[[Plato]] considered [[geometry]] a condition of [[Platonic idealism|idealism]] concerned with [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] truth. His contrasting between objectivity and [[doxa|opinion]] became the basis for philosophies intent on resolving the questions of [[reality]], [[truth]], and [[existence]]. He saw opinions as belonging to the shifting sphere of [[sensibility|sensibilities]], as opposed to a fixed, eternal and knowable [[incorporeality]]. Where Plato distinguished between [[epistemology|how we know things]] and their [[ontology|ontological]] status, [[subjectivism]] such as [[George Berkeley]]'s depends on [[perception]]. In [[Platonism|Platonic]] terms, a criticism of subjectivism is that it is difficult to distinguish between knowledge, opinions, and [[Subjectivity|subjective]] knowledge.

Platonic idealism is a form of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] objectivism, holding that the [[idealism|ideas exist independently]] from the individual. Berkeley's [[empiricism|empirical]] idealism, on the other hand, holds that [[subjectivism|things only exist as they are perceived]]. Both approaches boast an attempt at objectivity. Plato's definition of objectivity can be found in [[Platonic epistemology|his epistemology]], which is based on [[mathematics]], and [[Universal_(metaphysics)#Platonic_realism|his metaphysics]], where knowledge of the ontological status of objects and ideas is resistant to change.

In opposition to philosopher [[René Descartes]]' method of [[Cogito, ergo sum|personal deduction]], natural philosopher [[Isaac Newton]] applied the relatively objective [[scientific method]] to look for [[scientific evidence|evidence]] before forming a hypothesis. Partially in response to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[rationalism]], logician [[Gottlob Frege]] applied objectivity to his epistemological and metaphysical philosophies. If reality exists independently of [[consciousness]], then it would logically include a plurality of [[intension|indescribable]] forms. Objectivity requires a definition of [[truth]] formed by propositions with [[truth value]]. An attempt of forming an objective [[world view|construct]] incorporates [[ontological commitment]]s to the reality of objects.

The importance of perception in evaluating and understanding objective reality is debated in the [[Observer_effect_(physics)#Quantum_mechanics|observer effect]] of quantum mechanics. [[Direct and indirect realism|Direct]] or [[Naïve realism|naïve realist]]s rely on perception as key in observing objective reality, while [[instrumentalism|instrumentalists]] hold that observations are useful in predicting objective reality. The concepts that encompass these ideas are important in the [[philosophy of science]]. [[philosophy of mind|Philosophies of mind]] explore whether objectivity relies on [[Consensus reality|perceptual constancy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tyler Burge]], ''Origins of Objectivity'', Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectivity in ethics==

===Ethical subjectivism===
{{See also|David Hume|Non-cognitivism|Subjectivism}}
The term, "ethical subjectivism", covers two distinct theories in ethics. According to cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, the truth of moral statements depends upon people's values, attitudes, feelings, or beliefs. Some forms of cognitivist ethical subjectivism can be counted as forms of realism, others are forms of anti-realism. David Hume is a foundational figure for cognitive ethical subjectivism. On a standard interpretation of his theory, a trait of character counts as a moral virtue when it evokes a sentiment of approbation in a sympathetic, informed, and rational human observer. Similarly, Roderick Firth's [[ideal observer theory]] held that right acts are those that an impartial, rational observer would approve of. William James, another ethical subjectivist, held that an end is good (to or for a person) just in the case it is desired by that person (see also [[ethical egoism]]). According to non-cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, such as emotivism, prescriptivism, and expressivism, ethical statements cannot be true or false, at all: rather, they are expressions of personal feelings or commands. For example, on [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer's]] emotivism, the statement, "Murder is wrong" is equivalent in meaning to the emotive, "Murder, Boo!"

===Ethical objectivism===
{{Main|Moral realism}}
According to the ethical objectivist, the [[truth]] or falsehood of typical moral judgments does not depend upon the beliefs or feelings of any person or group of persons. This view holds that moral propositions are analogous to propositions about chemistry, biology, or history, in so much as they are true despite what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels. When they fail to describe this mind-independent moral reality, they are false—no matter what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels.

There are many versions of ethical objectivism, including various religious views of morality, Platonistic intuitionism, [[Kantianism]], [[utilitarianism]], and certain forms of [[ethical egoism]] and [[contractualism]]. Note that Platonists define ethical objectivism in an even more narrow way, so that it requires the existence of intrinsic value. Consequently, they reject the idea that contractualists or egoists could be ethical objectivists. Objectivism, in turn, places primacy on the origin of the frame of reference—and, as such, considers any arbitrary frame of reference ultimately a form of ethical subjectivism by a transitive property, even when the frame incidentally coincides with reality and can be used for measurements.

'''Scriptorium''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-scriptorium.ogg|s|k|r|ɪ|p|ˈ|t|ɔːr|i|ə|m}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|scriptorium|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally "a place for writing", is commonly used to refer to a room in medieval European [[monasteries]] devoted to the writing, copying and [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminating]] of manuscripts by monastic [[scribe]]s.

== The functional outset ==
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|left|This late 15th-century miniature of [[Jean Miélot]] (died 1472)&lt;ref&gt;
De Hamel, 1992, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 
depicts the author at work: perhaps his ''Miracles de Nostre Dame'', in which this miniature appears.]]

When monastic institutions arose in the early 6th century (the first European monastic writing dates from 517), they defined European literary culture and selectively preserved the literary history of the West. Monks copied Jerome's Latin Vulgate Bible and the commentaries and letters of early Church Fathers for missionary purposes as well as for use within the monastery.

In the copying process, there was typically a division of labor between the monks who readied the parchment for copying by smoothing and chalking the surface, those who ruled the parchment and copied the text, and those who illuminated the text. Sometimes a single monk would engage in all of these stages to prepare a manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Shailor, ''The Medieval Book'', (Toronto: U Toronto Press, 1991), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminators of manuscripts]] worked in collaboration with scribes in intricate varieties of interaction that preclude any simple understanding of monastic manuscript production.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Aliza Muslin-Cohen, ''A Medieval Scriptorium: St. maria Magdalena de Frankenthal'' series Wolfenbüttler Mittelalter Studien (Wiesbaden) 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The products of the monasteries provided a valuable medium of exchange.
Comparisons of characteristic regional, periodic as well as contextual styles of [[handwriting]] do reveal social and cultural connections among them, as new hands developed and were disseminated by travelling individuals, respectively what these individuals represented, and by the examples of manuscripts that passed from one cloister to another. 
Recent studies follow the approach, that ''scriptoria'' developed in relative isolation, to the extent that the [[Paleography|paleographer]] is sometimes able to identify the product of each writing centre and to date it accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;
McKitterick, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

By the start of the 13th century secular workshops developed,&lt;ref&gt;
De Hamel, 1992, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; 
where professional scribes stood at writing-desks to work the orders of customers, and during the [[Late Middle Ages]] the praxis of writing was becoming not only confined to being generally a monastic or regal activity. However, the practical consequences of private workshops, and as well the invention of the [[printing press]] vis-a-vis monastic ''scriptoria'' is a complex theme.&lt;ref&gt;
for example, cf. De Hamel, 1992, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==The physical scriptorium==

Much as medieval libraries do not correspond to the exalted sketches from [[Umberto Eco]]'s "Name of the Rose,”&lt;ref&gt;
[https://medievalfragments.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/library-or-labyrinth/ "Library or labyrinth" Irene O’Daly. January 11, 2013 (medievalfragments.wordpress.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
it seems that ancient written accounts, as well as surviving buildings, and archaeological excavations do not invariably attest to the evidence of scriptoria.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://medievalfragments.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/pondering-the-physical-scriptorium/ "Pondering the physical scriptorium" Jenneka Janzen. January 25, 2013 by medievalfragments (medievalfragments.wordpress.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Scriptoria in the physical sense of a room set aside for the purpose perhaps mostly existed in response to specific scribal projects; for example, when a monastic (and) or regal institution wished a large number of texts copied.

References in modern scholarly writings to 'scriptoria' typically refer to the collective written output of a monastery, 
somewhat like the [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] in the early regal times is taken to refer to a specific fashion of modelling formulars, 
but especially traditional is the view that scriptoria was a necessary adjunct to a library, as per the entry in du Cange, 1678 'scriptorium'.&lt;ref&gt;
Du Cange, et al., ''Glossarium mediae et infimae Latinitatis'', Niort: L. Favre, 1883–1887 (10 vol.).

Reading was done elsewhere."}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Giovanni Evangelista, Rimini===
At this church whose patron was [[Galla Placidia]] (died 450), paired rectangular chambers flanking the apse, accessible only from each aisle, have been interpreted as paired (Latin and Greek) libraries and perhaps scriptoria.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Charlotte Smith, "The Side Chambers of San Giovanni Evangelista in Ravenna: Church Libraries of the Fifth Century" ''Gesta,'' '''29'''.1 (1990): 86–97)&lt;/ref&gt; The well-lit niches .5 meter deep, provisions for [[hypocaust]]s beneath the floors to keep the spaces dry, have prototypes in the architecture of Roman libraries.&lt;ref&gt;E. Mackowiecka, ''The Origin and the Evolution of the Architectural Forms of the Roman Library'' (Warsaw) 1978, noted by Smith 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassiodorus and the Vivarium===
The monastery built in the second quarter of the 6th century under the supervision of [[Cassiodorus]] at the Vivarium near [[Squillace]] in southern Italy contained a scriptorium, for the purpose of collecting, copying, and preserving texts.

Cassiodorus' description of his monastery contained a purpose-built scriptorium, with self-feeding{{clarify|date=February 2016}} oil lamps, a [[sundial]], and a [[water-clock]]. The scriptorium would also have contained desks where the monks could sit and copy texts, as well as the necessary ink wells, penknives, and quills. Cassiodorus also established a library where, at the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|end of the Roman Empire]], he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and to preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of texts. In the end, however, the library at the Vivarium was dispersed and lost, though it was still active around 630.&lt;ref name=JNormanVivarium&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norman|first1=Jeremy|title=The Scriptorium and Library at the Vivarium (Circa 560)|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=204|website=HistoryofInformation.com|publisher=Jeremy Norman &amp; Co., Inc.|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
The scriptoria of the [[Cistercian]] order seem to have been similar to those of the Benedictines. The mother house at [[Cîteaux]], one of the best-documented high-medieval scriptoria, developed a severe "house style" in the first half of the 12th century. 
The 12th-century scriptorium of [[Cîteaux]] and its products, in the context of Cistercian scriptoria, have been studied by Yolanta Załuska, ''L'enluminure et le scriptorium de Cîteaux au XIIe siècle'' (Brecht:Cîteaux) 1989.

== Institutions ==
In [[Byzantium]] or [[Eastern Roman Empire]] learning maintained importance and numerous monastic 'scriptoria' were known for producing Bible/Gospel illuminations, along with workshops that copied numerous classical and Hellenistic works.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707023033|title=Books : a living history|last=Martyn|first=Lyons,|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|isbn=9781606060834|location=Los Angeles|oclc=707023033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records show that one such monastic community was that of [[Mount Athos]], which maintained a variety of illuminated manuscripts and ultimately accumulated over 10,000 books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Benedictines===
Cassiodorus' contemporary, [[Benedict of Nursia]], allowed his monks to read the great works of the pagans in the monastery he founded at [[Monte Cassino]] in 529. The creation of a library here initiated the tradition of Benedictine scriptoria, where the copying of texts not only provided materials needed in the routines of the community and served as work for hands and minds otherwise idle, but also produced a marketable end-product. Saint [[Jerome]] stated that the products of the scriptorium could be a source of revenue for the monastic community, but Benedict cautioned, "If there be skilled workmen in the monastery, let them work at their art in all humility".&lt;ref&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 57, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch57 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest Benedictine monasteries, the writing room was actually a corridor open to the central quadrangle of the [[cloister]].&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Landelin Robling OSB, ''Monastic Scriptoria'', [http://www.osb.org/gen/robling/03script.html#location OSB.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The space could accommodate about twelve monks, who were protected from the elements only by the wall behind them and the vaulting above. Monasteries built later in the Middle Ages placed the scriptorium inside, near the heat of the kitchen or next to the [[calefactory]]. The warmth of the later scriptoria served as an incentive for unwilling monks to work on the transcription of texts (since the charter house was rarely heated).

====St. Gall====
The Benedictine [[Plan of St. Gall]] is a sketch of an idealised monastery dating from 819–826, which shows the scriptorium and library attached to the northeast corner of the main body of the church; this is not reflected by the evidence of surviving monasteries. Although the purpose of the plan is unknown, it clearly shows the desirability of scriptoria within a wider body of monastic structures at the beginning of the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Murray, ''After Rome's Fall,'' (Toronto: University Toronto Press, 1998), pp. 262, 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
There is evidence that in the late 13th century, the Cistercians would allow certain monks to perform their writing in a small cell "which could not... contain more than one person".&lt;ref&gt;George Haven Putnam, ''Books and their Makers During the Middle Ages'', (New York: Hillary House, 1962), 405.&lt;/ref&gt; These cells were called scriptoria because of the copying done there, even though their primary function was not as a writing room.

===Carthusians===
The [[Carthusian]]s viewed copying religious texts as their missionary work to the greater [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]; the strict solitude of the Carthusian order necessitated that the manual labor of the monks be practiced within their individual cells, thus many monks engaged in the transcription of texts. In fact, each cell was equipped as a copy room, with parchment, quill, inkwell, and ruler. Guigues du Pin, or Guigo, the architect of the order, cautioned, "Let the brethren take care the books they receive from the cupboard do not get soiled with smoke or dirt; books are as it were the everlasting food of our souls; we wish them to be most carefully kept and most zealously made."&lt;ref&gt;C.H.Lawrence, ''Medieval Monasticism'', Ed.2 (London &amp; New York: Longman, 1989) 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Orthodox church===

====The Resava====

After the establishment of [[Manasija]] Monastery by [[Stefan Lazarević]] in the early 15th century, many educated monks have gathered there. They fostered copying and literary work that by its excellence and production changed the history of the South Slavic literature and languages spreading its influence all over the Orthodox [[Balkans]]. One of the most famous scholars of the so-called School of Resava was Constantine the Philosopher /Konstantin Filozof/, an influential writer and biographer of the founder of the school (Stefan Lazarević).

====Rača====
During the Turkish invasions of the Serbian lands (which lasted from the end of the 14th to the beginning of the 19th centuries) the monastery was an important centre of culture. The scriptorium of each monastery was a bastion of learning where illuminated manuscripts were being produced by monk-scribes, mostly Serbian liturgical books and Old Serbian ''Vita.'' [[hagiographies]] of kings and archbishops.

Numerous scribes of the Serbian Orthodox Church books—at the term of the 16th and the beginning of the 18th centuries—who worked in the [[Rača monastery]] are named in Serbian literature – "The Račans". . Among the monk-scribes the most renown are the illuminator Hieromonk Hristifor Račanin, [[Kiprijan Račanin]], [[Jerotej Račanin]], [[Teodor Račanin]] and [[Gavril Stefanović Venclović]]. These are well-known Serbian monks and writers that are the link between literary men and women of the late medieval ([[Late Middle Ages]]) and [[Baroque]] periods in art, architecture and literature in particular.

==Monastic rules==

===Cassiodorus' ''Institutes''===
Although it is not a monastic rule as such, [[Cassiodorus]] did write his ''[[Institutes]]'' as a teaching guide for the monks at Vivarium, the monastery he founded on his family's land in southern Italy. A classically educated Roman convert, Cassiodorus wrote extensively on scribal practices. He cautions over-zealous scribes to check their copies against ancient, trustworthy [[exemplar (manuscript)|exemplars]] and to take care not to change the inspired words of scripture because of grammatical or stylistic concerns. He declared "every work of the Lord written by the scribe is a wound inflicted on Satan", for "by reading the Divine Scripture he wholesomely instructs his own mind and by copying the precepts of the Lord he spreads them far and wide".&lt;ref&gt;Cassiodorus, Institutes, I, xxx&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that Cassiodorus did include the classical texts of ancient Rome and Greece in the monastic library. This was probably because of his upbringing, but was, nonetheless, unusual for a monastery of the time. When his monks copied these texts, Cassiodorus encouraged them to amend texts for both grammar and style.&lt;ref&gt;James O. O'Donnell, ''Cassiodorus,'' University of Californian Press, 1979. Postprint online (1995), [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap6.html Upenn.edu], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Benedict===
The more famous monastic treatise of the 7th century, Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]]'s [[Rule of St Benedict|Rule]], fails to mention the labor of transcription by name, though his institution, the monastery of [[Montecassino]], developed one of the most influential scriptoria, at its acme in the 11th century, which made the abbey "the greatest center of book production in South Italy in the High Middle Ages".&lt;ref&gt;Newton 1999:3; the scriptorium is fully examined in Francis Newton, ''The Scriptorium and Library at Monte Cassino, 1058–1105'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Here was developed and perfected the characteristic "Cassinese" [[Beneventan script]] under [[Desiderius of Montecassino|Abbot Desiderius]].

The [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] does explicitly call for monks to have ready access to books during two hours of compulsory daily reading and during [[Lent]], when each monk is to read a book in its entirety.&lt;ref name="accessed 2 May 2007"&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 48, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch48 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus each monastery was to have its own extensive collection of books, to be housed either in [[armarium]] (book chests) or a more traditional library. However, because the only way to obtain a large quantity of books in the [[Middle Ages]] was to copy them, in practice this meant that the monastery had to have a way to transcribe texts in other collections.&lt;ref&gt;Geo. Haven Putnam, ''Books and Their Makers During the Middle Ages'', (New York: Hillary House, 1962), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative translation of Benedict's strict guidelines for the oratory as a place for silent, reverent prayer actually hints at the existence of a scriptorium. In Chapter 52 of his Rule, Benedict's warns: "Let the oratory be what it is called, and let nothing else be done or stored there".&lt;ref&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 52, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch52 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; But ''condatur'' translates both as ''stored'' and ''to compose or write,'' thus leaving the question of Benedict's intentions for manuscript production ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Landelin Robling OSB, ''Monastic Scriptoria'', [http://www.osb.org/gen/robling/07script.html#rules OSB.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commentaries on the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] describe the labor of transcription as the common occupation of the community, so it is also possible that Benedict failed to mention the scriptorium by name because of the integral role it played within the monastery.

====Saint Ferréol====
Monastic life in the [[Middle Ages]] was strictly centered around [[Liturgy of the Hours|prayer]] and manual labor. In the early Middle Ages, there were many attempts to set out an organization and routine for monastic life. [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert|Montalembert]] cites one such sixth-century document, the Rule of [[Ferréol of Uzès|Saint Ferréol]], as prescribing that "He who does not turn up the earth with the plough ought to write the parchment with his fingers."&lt;ref&gt;Montalembert, ''The Monks of the West from St. Benedict to St. Bernard'', vol. 6, (Edinburgh, 1861–1879) p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; As this implies, the labor required of a [[scribe]] was comparable to the exertion of agriculture and other outdoor work. Another of Montalembert's examples is of a scribal note along these lines: "He who does not know how to write imagines it to be no labour, but although these fingers only hold the pen, the whole body grows weary."&lt;ref&gt;Montalembert, ''The Monks of the West from St. Benedict to St. Bernard'', vol. 6, (Edinburgh, 1861–1879) p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
An undated Cistercian ordinance, ranging in date from 1119–52 (Załuska 1989) prescribed ''literae unius coloris et non depictae'' ("letters of one color and not ornamented"), that spread with varying degrees of literalness in parallel with the Cistercian order itself, through the priories of Burgundy and beyond.

In 1134, the Cistercian order declared that the monks were to keep silent in the scriptorium as they should in the [[cloister]].

==Books and transcription in monastic life==

Manuscript-writing was a laborious process in an ill-lit environment that could damage one's health. One prior complained in the tenth century:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"''Only try to do it yourself and you will learn how arduous is the writer's task. It dims your eyes, makes your back ache, and knits your chest and belly together. It is a terrible ordeal for the whole body''".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: Greer, Germaine. ''The Obstacle Race: The Fortunes of Women Painters and Their Work''. Tauris Parke, 2001. p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The director of a monastic scriptorium would be the ''armarius'' ("provisioner"), who provided the scribes with their materials and supervised the copying process. However, the armarius had other duties as well. At the beginning of Lent, the armarius was responsible for making sure that all of the monks received books to read,&lt;ref name="accessed 2 May 2007"/&gt; but he also had the ability to deny access to a particular book. By the 10th century the armarius had specific liturgical duties as well, including singing the eighth [[responsory]], holding the lantern aloft when the abbot read, and approving all material to be read aloud in church, chapter, and [[refectory]].&lt;ref&gt;Fassler, Margot E., "The Office of the Cantor in Early Western Monastic Rules and Customaries," in ''Early Music History'', 5 (1985), pp. 35, 40, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Vivarium c. 540–548, '''Cassiodorus''' wrote a commentary on the Psalms entitled ''Expositio Psalmorum'' as an introduction to the Psalms for individuals seeking to enter the monastic community. The work had a broad appeal outside of Cassiodorus' monastery as the subject of monastic study and reflection.

Abbot '''[[Johannes Trithemius]]''' of Sponheim wrote a letter, ''De Laude Scriptorum'' (In Praise of Scribes), to Gerlach, Abbot of Deutz in 1492 to describe for monks the merits of copying texts. Trithemius contends that the copying of texts is central to the model of monastic education, arguing that transcription enables the monk to more deeply contemplate and come to a more full understanding of the text. He then continues to praise scribes by saying "The dedicated scribe, the object of our treatise, will never fail to praise God, give pleasure to angels, strengthen the just, convert sinners, commend the humble, confirm the good, confound the proud and rebuke the stubborn".&lt;ref name="Johannes Trithemius 1974 p.35"&gt;Johannes Trithemius, ''In Praise of Scribes (de Laude Scriptorum)'', Klaus Arnold, ed. (Lawrence, Kansas: Colorado Press, 1974), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons he gives for continuing to copy manuscripts by hand, are the historical precedent of the ancient scribes and the supremacy of transcription to all other manual labor. This description of monastic writing is especially important because it was written after the first printing presses came into popular use. Trithemius addresses the competing technology when he writes, "The printed book is made of paper and, like paper, will quickly disappear. But the scribe working with parchment ensures lasting remembrance for himself and for his text".&lt;ref name="Johannes Trithemius 1974 p.35"/&gt; Trithemius also believes that there are works that are not being printed but are worth being copied.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Trithemius, ''In Praise of Scribes (de Laude Scriptorum)'', Klaus Arnold, ed. (Lawrence, Kansas: Colorado Press, 1974), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manuscript-Alexander-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|[[John White Alexander]], Manuscript Book mural (1896), Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]

In his comparison of modern and medieval scholarship, '''James J. O'Donnell''' describes monastic study in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"''[E]ach Psalm would have to be recited at least once a week all through the period of study. In turn, each Psalm studied separately would have to be read slowly and prayerfully, then gone through with the text in one hand (or preferably committed to memory) and the commentary in the other; the process of study would have to continue until virtually everything in the commentary has been absorbed by the student and mnemonically keyed to the individual verses of scripture, so that when the verses are recited again the whole phalanx of Cassiodorian erudition springs up in support of the content of the sacred text''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James O. |last=O'Donnell |title=Cassiodorus |publisher=University of California Press |year=1979 |url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap5.html |accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this way, the monks of the Middle Ages came to intimately know and experience the texts that they copied. The act of transcription became an act of meditation and prayer, not a simple replication of letters.

{{see also|Seriality}}
'''Seriality''' or '''serial collectivity''' is a term that [[feminist]] scholar [[Iris Marion Young]] used to describe a reconceptualization of the category of [[woman]] in her 1994 essay ''Gender as Seriality''. [[Iris Marion Young|Young]] borrows the concept of [[seriality]] from [[Sartre]]'s ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]'', where he originally developed the idea to describe the relationship of individuals to social classes and the capitalist system of production and consumption. Understanding women as a ''series'', rather than a ''group'', entails the recognition that the category ''woman'' is not defined by any common biological or psychological characteristics; rather, individuals are positioned as ''woman'' by a set of material and immaterial social constructs that are the product of previous human actions.

==Group vs series==

A group, in [[Sartre]]'s definition, is a collection of people who self-consciously recognize themselves to be in a unified relationship with each other in the undertaking of a common project. A mutual acknowledgment of actively shared goals is the chief feature of a group. Guilds, reading groups, addiction support groups and animal cruelty prevention groups are all examples of groups.

Seriality, in contrast to the active effort of group being, describes a level of social existence that is habitually constrained and directed by existing circumstances and material conditions.
In a series, a collection of people are unified ''passively'' by objects, routines practices and habits around which their actions are oriented. For instance, people waiting in line for a bus, radio listeners, prison inmates and [[street theatre]] spectators are all examples of series. In each example, individuals are oriented toward the same goals by their response to existing conditions and structures in the environment, which are the collective legacy of human actions and decisions in the past. To illustrate concretely, the actions of people who stop and watch a street theatre performance may be shaped by existing conditions which constrain and permit their actions, such as the social acceptability of staging a performance on the street, the attractive costumes of the performers, high unemployment rates among actors, the existence of a public square, social expectations of their roles as spectators. Members of a series are anonymous and isolated, although not alone, often individuals in a series take into account the expected behavior of other members when pursuing their own actions – for instance, a bus rider may choose to avoid rush hour traffic. Members of a series are also interchangeable, although not identical, in relation to the objects that effect their serialized condition: from the point of view of a radio program broadcaster, one listener is interchangeable with another.

Groups and series are related in that groups arise out of a backdrop of seriality, and disperse to fall back into serialized conditions. In other words, groups are the product of individuals' response to shared conditions; Young gives the example of commuters at a bus stop who, when the bus fails to appear, organize themselves into a group to hail taxis, complain to the bus company, etc.

==Seriality as a solution to a conceptual dilemma in feminism==

Young's reconceptualization of ''women'' as a ''series'' is an attempt to provide a solution to the problems in [[feminist]] discourse surrounding the grouping of all [[women]] in a single category. This problem exists as a dilemma between two conflicting positions: &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Iris Marion|date=1994-04-01|title=Gender as Seriality: Thinking about Women as a Social Collective|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/494918|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=19|issue=3|pages=713–738|doi=10.1086/494918|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

i) On one hand, it is important to be able to speak of [[women]] as a group for practical political reasons. Feminist politics is organized around this category of ''woman''; its existence as a movement fundamentally depends on this conceptualization. Additionally, the category of ''women'' is necessary in order to understand [[oppression]] and disadvantage as something that is systematically inflicted upon women (or any societal group) in a structured, [[institution]]alized process, as opposed to being a natural or unique condition. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

ii) On the other hand, the category of ''woman'' is fraught with problems of essentialization, [[normalization (sociology)|normalization]] and exclusion. As [[Elizabeth Spelman]] points out, social categories are [[social construct|constructs]] that carry latent expressions of privilege and subordination; in this manner, feminist theories have often assumed the experience of white, [[middle-class]] [[heterosexual]] women as representative for all women, excluding less privileged points of view. [[Chandra Talpade Mohanty|Chandra Mohanty]] suggests that the category of ''woman'' creates the false impression of a coherent, homogeneous group, which leads to the mistake of assuming that all women are equally powerless and oppressed, rather than generating specific questions about oppression that can be empirically investigated. [[Judith Butler]] goes as far as to argue that the very act of defining such a gender category is what produces the [[normalization (sociology)|normalizations]] that privilege some viewpoints and exclude others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Thinking of ''woman'' as a series solves these conceptual problems. It allows one to meaningfully use the category while avoiding the mistake of falsely [[essentialism|essentializing]] women as a group. An [[essentialist]] approach attempts to define ''woman'' by common biological characteristics – evidently false when one considers, for instance, [[transgender]], [[bigender]] or [[intersex]] people, for instance – or by finding commonality in the vast diversity of women's actual lives, clearly not a viable enterprise.
A serial conception of ''woman'' also disconnects the idea of gender from an individual's personal identity, as it defines gender as a pre-existing set of societal forces that are visited upon each individual; this approach does not make any claims about the way individuals respond to these pressures. Indeed, the conception of gender as seriality derives its strength from precisely the fact that it does not attempt a comprehensive definition of the individual, but acknowledges that individuals exist within structures that constrain and channel their actions in particular ways.

==Other potential applications of seriality==

[[Iris Marion Young|Young]] has suggested that the concept of seriality might also be usefully applied to relationships of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[nationality]] as linkages which also result from historical conditions – such as the institution of [[slavery]] and projects of [[nation-building]] – which also function to limit and enable individuals' actions on the level of everyday life and habit.

'''''Sex Education''''' is a 1995 book by the American author Jenny Davis. It was written for readers in grades 9-12 and tells the story of two teens who, working together on a term project for their sex education class, are instructed to care for someone else for the semester. They choose a lonely, pregnant neighbor, a task that proves more difficult than they anticipated.

The book has been the subject of many legal challenges, according to the [[American Library Association]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3764">'''Spectromorphology''' is the perceived sonic footprint of a [[Frequency spectrum#Sound|sound spectrum]] as it manifests in [[time]]. A descriptive spectromorphological analysis of sound is sometimes used in the analysis of [[electroacoustic music]], especially [[acousmatic music]]. The term was coined by [[Denis Smalley]] in 1986 and is considered the most adequate English term to designate the field of sound research associated with the French writer, composer, and academic, [[Pierre Schaeffer]]  {{citation needed| reason=This claim doesn't fully explain the connection with Shaeffer's work neither by who this term is considered relevant to understand the research initiated by Schaeffer's work|date=January 2015}}.

Schaeffer's work at [[Groupe de Recherches Musicales#Groupe de Recherches Musicales|INA/GRM]] in Paris, beginning in the late 1940s, culminated in the publication of the book [[Musique concrète#Trait.C3.A9 des Objets Musicaux|Traité des objets musicaux]] in 1966. Smalley's notion of spectromorphology builds upon Schaeffer's theories relating to the use of a classification system for various categories of sound.&lt;ref&gt;(Thoresen:2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalley's term refers to the descriptive analysis of perceived morphological developments in sound spectra over time, and it implies that the "spectro" cannot exist without the [[Morphological typology|morphology]]: something has to be shaped and that something must have sonic content (Smalley, 1986, 1997).

==Theoretical framework==
The theoretical framework of spectro-morphology is articulated mainly in four parts: 
* the [[typology (statistics)|typology]] of the spectra
* morphology
* motion
* structuring processes.

===Spectral typologies===
Smalley defines three different spectral typologies that exist in what he calls the noise-note [[continuum (theory)|continuum]]. This continuum is subdivided into three principal elements: 
* the noise. 
* the node (an event having a more complex texture than a single pitch).
* the note, which is in turn subdivided into note, harmonic spectrum and inharmonic spectrum.

===Morphological archetypes===
Smalley also designates different morphological [[archetype]]s:
* attack-impulse. Modeled on the single detached note: a sudden onset which is immediately terminated. In this instance the attack-onset is also the termination. 
* attack-decay (closed and open) - modeled on sounds in which the attack-onset is extended by a [[resonance]] that quickly or gradually decays towards termination. The closed form represents a quick decay which is strongly attack-determined. The open form reflects a more gradual decay where the ear is drawn away from the formative influence of the attack into the continuing behaviour of the sound on its way to termination. 
* graduated continuant - Modeled on sustained sounds. The onset is graduated, settling into a [[continuant]] phase which eventually closes in a graduated termination. The onset is perceived as a much less formative influence than in the other two archetypes. Attention is drawn to the way in which the sound is maintained rather than to its initiation.

'''''Tabu Homosexualität: Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils''''' ({{lang-de|The Taboo of Homosexuality: The History of a Prejudice}}) is a standard work of Germanophone research into [[homophobia]], written by German sociologist, ethnologist, and sexologist [[Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg]], and first published in 1978.

== Background ==

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg used the better part of the 1970s in order to complete ''Tabu Homosexualität: Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils'' (reprinted in 1981, then leaving out the word ''Tabu'' from its title) as beside drawing from scholars such as [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Marija Gimbutas]], and [[Michel Foucault]], she conducted sociological research on homophobia and homosexuality, and translated previously unavailable or neglected artifacts and records from dead languages for the first time.

== Content ==

=== Introducing chapters ===

In the prefacing ''Einführung'', Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg deals with the post-WWII mitigation of German laws forbidding same-sex activities, and her motivations for researching the issue of homophobia, an undertaking whereupon she came upon increasingly earlier and earlier manifestations each inspiring countless cultural derivations of this hatred.

In order to give an idea of the old age of negative prejudices directed against same-sex activities in the West, in Chapter I, ''Alte Nachrichten über die ethische Bewertung der männlichen Homosexualität bei germanischen Stämmen'' ("Ancient sources on the ethical evaluation of male homosexuality by Germanic tribes"), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg mainly discusses many ancient European writers (mostly Greek and Roman) denouncingly accusing other tribes and nations across Europe as tolerant towards same-sex activities as was a common form of slander in Classical Antiquity, the absurdity of which is emphasized by the fact that writers of accused groups often accused the accuser's nation of the same thing even if ignorant of the original accusation hauled towards themselves. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg thereby also demonstrates the strong [[numinous]] taboo regarding same-sex activities making them a near-unmentionable vice, as no rational explanation for this ostracization is ever provided, these activities are invariably depicted as negative ''in themselves''.

Only three exceptions are mentioned where the purpose of slander is not immediately obvious: Greek philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] in the third volume of his ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' mentioned a tribe of ''Karmans'' among whom "lewdness between men ''[...]'', as is said, is not regarded as abominable but just like any ordinary thing". Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg identifies it as one of many examples of Sextus Empiricus's often-used rhethoric device of applying the most absurd properties to people, places, and other objects simply for the purpose of demonstrating basic rules of logic. The second exception is a note by [[Posidonius]], quoted in [[Diodorus Siculus]]'s ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', on [[Celts|Celtic]] sleeping customs which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg attributes to a misunderstanding of traditional separation of the sexes in daily life.

The third is an analysis of the common modern scholarly debate around the ritual killing of criminals regarded as altogether ''ignavi et imbellis et corpore infames'' ("cowardly, unbelligerent, and perverted") by proto-historic [[Germanic peoples|Germanics]] as mentioned by [[Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', whereupon Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg first remarks that the complex issue of common Western homophobia as apparent in the presented material must be analyzed at a wider, more interdisciplinarian scope.

=== Ethnic and cultural background: The Three Strata of Indo-European society ===

According to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's socio-psychological, socio-historical interdisciplinary approach to the topic of homophobia, drawing from research fields such as cultural anthropology, religious studies, ethnology, philology, and linguistics, the ethnocentric prejudice towards particularly male same-sex attraction and activities in the history of Western, Indo-European cultures is intrinsically identical to misogyny, thus originally gave rise to, and until the modern age maintained, patriarchal structures of Indo-European society.

Its roots and cultural elements can be traced back several millennia into Eurasian culture, and were originally based on the subsequent overlapping and conflict-ridden superimposition of the three basic ethnic and cultural [[stratum|strata]] (see [[stratification (archeology)]], [[social stratification]], and [[archaeological horizon]]) underlying all modern Indo-European cultures. These three successive strata were the following:

*The Stone Age ''Subarctic Shamanic Culture'' of the [[last glacial period]] (called ''Würm'' regarding the Alps region, ''Weichsel'' regarding Scandinavia, and ''Devensian'' regarding the British Isles) ending c. 9,000 BCE,
*the ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' of European and Middle East [[Bronze Age]], introducing farming and practicing [[fertility rite|fertility cults]] including sexual rites (c. 9.000 BCE to c. 3.000 BCE; roughly equivalent to Gimbutas's ''"[[Old European culture|Old Europe]]"''),
*and the violent West-bound conquest of these regions by belligerent Proto-Indo-European tribes from Asia (see [[Bronze Age collapse]], [[Kurgan hypothesis]], and [[Æsir-Vanir War#Theories]]), beginning around the end of the fourth millennium BCE, introducing domestication of animals (particularly horses for purposes of work, mobility, and especially warfare) and cattle breeding, and initiating the Indo-European [[Iron Age]] in Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Not all subsequent Indo-European or Indo-European-influenced cultures adopted or retained Indo-European languages. For instance, Semitic cultures never adopted an Indo-European language in spite of the obvious belligerent, sensually repressive Indo-European influence found in Abrahamitic and Semitic cultures. See Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's 1990 work ''Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt'' based in this respect mainly on [[:de:Reinhard Schmoeckel|Reinhard Schmoeckel]]'s ''Indogermanistik'' research.&lt;/ref&gt;

See also [[Three-age system]]. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg interprets these three strata as relating to the [[trifunctional hypothesis]] by [[Georges Dumézil]], of classic Indo-European society consisting of three distinct classes, clerical (= Shamanic), agricultural, and warrior. Yet other than Dumézil, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg does not regard all three of these components as genuinely Indo-European or Proto-Indo-European. Instead, in regard of the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] and what Gimbutas saw as "[[Old European culture|Old Europe]]", Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg considers these three components as the result of successive superimposition of what originally were the above-mentioned three different cultures, with Indo-European culture in Europe and the Middle East since the Iron Age as the result. See [[Proto-Indo-European society]] for details.

The immediate cause of Indo-European homophobia, misogyny, and patriarchy was an ethnocentric culture shock when Proto-Indo-European tribes encountered the highly sensual ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' in general, and particularly last traces of Shamanic ritual transvestism and sex change absorbed within this culture. In proto-historic Norse culture for instance, the resulting [[religious stratification]] emerged as the cultural strata of the subdued and marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' and the subsequently dominant Indo-European influence respectively transformed into maternal, fertility [[Vanir]] and belligerent, patriarchal [[Æsir]] religion, with the mythological [[Æsir-Vanir War]] as a distorted cultural memory of Europe's Indo-Europeanization, similar to the story of [[The Rape of the Sabine Women]] in ancient Italy potentially recalling the same proto-historical process.

=== Subsequent derivations within Indo-European societies ===

From there, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg traces the genesis of homophobia via a number of historical derivations which exhibited increasing levels of rationalization:

*'''Chapter IV, ''Interdependenzen zwischen religiösen Werten und sozialen Normen bei den Germanen'' ("Interdependencies between religious values and social norms in Germanic culture"):''' Within subsequently dominant Indo-European culture, the originally highly regarded Shamanic priest of the subdued and marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' was ethnocentrically re-interpreted as an evil figure, and the former fertility rites as evil lewd magic. The least rationalized version of the resultant negative archetype of a lewd, non-human freak as apparent in sufficiently surviving artifacts and records is to be found in Norse sources, as the mythological, demonic ''[[Níð|nithing]]'' creature. Due to this lack of rationalization of the archetype's Norse version, it is the most pure, primordial version available to modern research, and the attributes of the ''nithing'' are thus the most easily identifiable among all the archetype's local variations as a negative ethnocentric, mythological re-interpretation of the ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' stratum under the circumstances of Indo-European cultural dominance. As explained in further chapters, this socio-cultural archetype of an evil, lewd non-human freak became a profound influence for every aspect about ubiquitous ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' (repression of sensuality) that followed from it in Western civilization.
*'''Chapter V, ''Tendenzen der Beurteilung homosexuellen Verhaltens von der Christianisierung bis zum Beginn der Ketzer- und Hexenverfolgungen'' ("Tendencies in evaluation of homosexual behaviour between Christianisation and the beginning inquisitorial persecution of witches and heretics"), section 1, ''Die römische Gesetzgebung'' ("Roman laws"):''' Capital homophobic tendencies in Ancient Rome as apparent for instance in ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' (Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg does not cover Ancient Greece in depth until her 1990 book ''Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt'', only emphasizing in ''Tabu Homosexualität'' and later works that [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greek pederasty]] does not meet her primary focus for ''Tabu Homosexualität'' of same-sex activities among adult males, as in Ancient Greece, these relations took place between fertile and infertile individuals, by quoting, among other modern scholars and ancient sources, [[Kenneth Dover]]).
*'''Chapter V, section 2, ''Die kirchlichen Bestimmungen'' ("Ecclesiastical regulations"):''' Homophobia apparent in the ancient Jewish culture ([[Leviticus 18]]) and in Early Christianity ([[Saint Paul]], early [[Church Fathers]], and [[penitential]]s) up to the ninth century CE. Here, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg debunks the Biblical origin of the common ''Sodom myth'' created by Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 500s CE who was the first person in the world to claim that [[Genesis 19]] would in any way relate to same-sex activities.
*'''Chapter V, section 3, ''Die gefälschten Kapitulare des Benedictus Levita'' ("The forged capitularies of Benedictus Levita"):''' The Medieval ecclesiastical concept of ''[[sodomy]]'' brought forth by the forged ''[[Benedictus Levita|Capitularia Benedicti Levitae]]'' within ''[[Pseudo-Isidore]]'' (a collection of persuasive false material on theological, legal, and political matters fabricated by [[Franks|Frankish]] monks around 850 CE). During proto-historic Iron Age, the religious fertility rites of the marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' stratum had been ethnocentrically interpreted as the evil, lewd ''seid'' magic of a ''nithing'' in proto-historic Norse and Germanic sources. Referencing Justinian's ''Sodom myth'', Frankish monk Benedictus Levita as the author of the ''Capitularia Benedicti Levitae'' obviously appealed to these prevailing folk beliefs when he strongly associated his idea of ''sodomy'' with evil sorcery, satanism, heathenism, and heresy. Thereby, he also originally incorporated the common Germanic practice of burning ''nithings'' into ecclesiastical law as burning ''sodomites'' and ''witches'' alike at the stake. Prior to Levita, church dogma had denounced belief in witches and burning people out of these pagan beliefs as sinful.
*'''Chapter VI, ''Die Pönalisierung der Homosexualität im Rahmen der Ketzer- und Hexenprozesse des Mittelalters'' ("The penalisation of homosexuality within the Medieval heresy and witch trials"):''' How Levita's ideas were put into practice by creating the Inquisition. Also discusses in-depth the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' as an extension and further popularization of Levita's original ideas on ''sodomites'' and ''witches''.
*'''Chapter VII, ''Weiterentwicklung und Modifizierung des Vorurteils gegen die Homosexualität bis 1870'' ("Further developments and modifications of homophobic prejudice up until 1870"):''' Arriving at the theories of pathology (Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg specifically mentions the concept of ''[[moral insanity]]''), corruption, and downfall of the state brought fourth by the [[Age of Reason]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the history of these pseudo-scientific ideologies, and how they were instrumental in prolonging the traditional persecution of sexual deviants, especially homosexuals, in the Western world from the 17th to the 20th century.
*'''Chapter VIII, ''Beeinträchtigung der Erforschung des Vorurteils gegenüber der männlichen Homosexualität durch das Vorurteil selbst'' ("Obliteration of research into homophobic prejudice caused by the very prejudice itself"):''' Socio-psychological analyses of patterns and social dynamics of general and specifically homophobic prejudice and discrimination in Western society, building upon the facts, patterns, and concepts demonstrated in earlier chapters, emphasizing again the cultural impact and significance of Indo-European influence and the Three Strata of Western culture in general. In further detail than in this one chapter, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg would re-visit this academic field of general ''Vorurteilsforschung'' (''prejudice studies'') in her later work ''[[Angst und Vorurteil]]'' (1989), in-depth analyzing in full the common patterns of prejudice and discrimination in modern Western society following from the cultural evolution described in ''Tabu Homosexualität''.

=== Relations to other works, by Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg and others ===

In ''Mannbarkeitsriten'' (1980) and ''[[Angst und Vorurteil]]'' (1989), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg further chronicles the re-enforcing influence of Western [[colonialism]] when Indo-European cultures began globally expanding from the [[Age of Discovery]] and [[First European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|Age of Conquests]] on, thus explorers and conquerors again came upon Shamanic cultures partly involving ritual fertility and sexual cults, and Europe simultaneously encountered the wide spread of [[syphilis]] through these new cross-cultural contacts just when modern science began to dawn.

These processes also fostered ethnocentric beliefs of Indo-European moral superiority over "uncivilized", sensual, and "filthy" "savages" (see for instance the saying of the ''[[White man's burden]]'' of being morally obliged to "civilize" non-Westerners), social and ethnic "aliens", and marginalized minorities in a complex process of interior socio-psychological, cultural structuring of human sensual desires on the one hand, and foreign political and military colonialism of these desires on the other hand. Thus, in all three books (''Tabu Homosexualität'', ''Mannbarkeitsriten'', and ''Angst und Vorurteil'') Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg alludes to cultural anthropology works such as ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' by [[Hannah Arendt]], Freud's ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', Critical Theory's ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' and ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', or ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' by [[Norbert Elias]].

Finally, as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg relates in ''Angst und Vorurteil'', just as colonialism and the rise of syphilis had compromised the [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|scientific Enlightenment]] approach to sexuality, the impact of [[HIV]] corrupted [[Counterculture of the 1960s|post-WWII progressive counterculture]]'s influence on Western society's attitudes towards sexuality.

'''Technology dynamics''' is broad and relatively new scientific field that has been developed in the framework of the postwar [[science and technology studies]] field. It studies the process of [[technological change]]. Under the field of Technology Dynamics the process of technological change is explained by taking into account influences from "internal factors" as well as from "external factors". Internal factors relate technological change to unsolved technical problems and the established modes of solving technological problems and external factors relate it to various (changing) characteristics of the [[social environment]], in which a particular [[technology]] is embedded.

==Overview==

For the last three decades, it has been argued that [[technology development]] is neither an autonomous process, determined by the "inherent progress" of human history, nor a process completely determined by external conditions like the prices of the resources that are needed to operate (develop) a technology, as it is theorized in neoclassical economic thinking. In mainstream neoclassical economic thinking, technology is seen as an exogenous factor: at the moment a technology is required, the most appropriate version can be taken down from the shelf based on costs of labor, capital and eventually raw materials.

Conversely, modern technology dynamics studies generally advocate that technologies are not "self-evident" or market-demanded, but are the upshot of a particular path of technology development and are shaped by social, economic and political factors. in this sense, technology dynamics aims at overcoming distinct "internal" and "external" points of views by presenting co-evolutionary approach regarding technology development.

In general, technology dynamics studies, besides giving a "thick description" of technology development, uses constructivist viewpoints emphasizing that technology is the outcome of particular social context. Accordingly, Technology Dynamics emphasizes the significance and possibility of regaining [[social control]] of technology, and also provides mechanisms needed to adapt to and steer the development of certain technologies. In that respect, it uses insights from retrospective studies to formulate hypotheses of a prospective nature on technology development of emerging technologies, besides formulating prescriptive policy recommendations.

An important feature of relevant theories of technological change therein is that they underline the quasi-evolutionary character of technological change: change based on technological variation and social selection in which technological knowledge, systems and [[institutions]] develop in interaction with each other. Processes of 'path dependence' are crucial in explaining technological change.

Following these lines, there have been different approaches and concepts used under the field of technology dynamics.

==Different frameworks to analyze the dynamics of technology==
*[[Social construction of technology]]
*[[Actor–network theory]]
*[[Systems theory]]
*[[Normalization process theory]]
*Quasi-evolutionary theories
*[[Innovation system]]
*[[Technological innovation system]]

Based on the analysis of the various perspectives, one can aim at developing interventions in the dynamics of a technology. Some approaches have been developed targeting on interventions in technological change:

*[[Technology assessment]]
*[[Backcasting]]
*Strategic niche management 
*[[Transition management (governance)]]

'''Terribilità''', the spelling in modern Italian, or '''terribiltà''', as [[Michelangelo]]'s 16th century contemporaries tended to spell it, is a quality of provoking  terror (the literal meaning), awe, or a sense of the sublime, in the viewer, that is ascribed to his art.  It is perhaps especially applied to his [[sculpture]]s, such as his figures of [[David (Michelangelo)|''David'']] or in [[Moses (Michelangelo)|''Moses'']].

[[Pope Julius II]] was apparently the first to describe Michelangelo as a ''uomo terribile'' ("terror-inducing man"), apparently describing his difficult character as much as his art. This ''terribilità'', also references the [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonics]] of humanists such as [[Marsilio Ficino]], who had known Michelangelo in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Lleó Cañal, Vicente, Revista de Libros:Tintoretto 2, 2 Abril 2007, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelangelo's friend and collaborator [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] reported in a letter to him of 15 October 1520 on a private audience with [[Pope Leo X]].  After praising Michelangelo's work, the pope continued "But he is ''terribile'', as you see; one cannot deal with him".  Sebastiano responded "that your ''terribile'' character did not harm anyone, and that you appear ''terribile'' for love of the great works you carry out."&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition handlist for "Michelangelo &amp; Sebastiano", 2017, National Gallery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3425">The '''Wiesbaden manifesto''' is a document written and signed by members of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives]] (MFAA) organization rejecting the plundering and removal of cultural items as spoils of war. The Allies created special commissions, such as the MFAA, to help protect famous European monuments from destruction, and after the war, to travel to territories previously occupied by the Germans to find Nazi art repositories. The allies found these plundered artworks in over 1,050 repositories in Germany and [[Austria]] at the end of [[World War II]]. The book ''The Safekeepers: Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II'' by former [[Walter Farmer|Capt. Walter I. Farmer]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] during World War II, chronicles the recovery of and restitution of discovered hidden loot of the [[Nazi plunder]], that were stolen from museums, private collections and libraries and individual [[Jewish]] emigrants and [[death camp]] prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;The Safekeepers: A Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II By Walter Ings Farmer, Klaus Goldmann Published by Walter de Gruyter, 2000 {{ISBN|978-3-11-016897-6}}, 242 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 1945, Capt. Walter Farmer became the collecting point's first director. The first shipment of artworks arriving at Wiesbaden included cases of antiquities, Egyptian art, Islamic artifacts, and paintings from the [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]]. The collecting point also received materials from the [[Reichsbank]] and [[Nazi]] looted [[Poles|Polish]] liturgical collections. At its height, Wiesbaden stored, identified, and restituted approximately 700,000 individual objects, including paintings and sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=10388&lt;/ref&gt; The collecting point not only cataloged and restitutued items, but also kept them away from the [[Soviet Army]] and wartime reparations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=10388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Opritsa D.

Farmer and 35 others who were in charge of the Wiesbaden collection point gathered to draw up what has become known as the Wiesbaden Manifesto on November 7, 1945, declaring "We wish to state that, from our own knowledge, no historical grievance will rankle so long or be the cause of so much justified bitterness as the removal for any reason of a part of the heritage of any nation even if that heritage may be interpreted as a prize of war." Among the co-signers was Lieutenant [[Charles Percy Parkhurst]] of the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Walter I. Farmer. The Safekeepers: A Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II. Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2000. x + 242 pp., {{ISBN|978-3-11-016897-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
