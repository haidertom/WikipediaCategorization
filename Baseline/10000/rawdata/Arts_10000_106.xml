 [[File:Aberlemnokirkyardcropped.jpg|thumb|300px|The Class II Kirkyard stone c. 800, [[Aberlemno]]]]
'''Art in Medieval Scotland''' includes all forms of [[Scottish art|artistic production]] within the modern borders of Scotland, between the fifth century and the adoption of the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]] in the early sixteenth century. In the [[early Middle Ages]], there were distinct material cultures evident in the different federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland. [[Pictish art]] was the only uniquely Scottish Medieval style; it can be seen in the extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns. It can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hoards. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of [[Dál Riata]] suggests that it was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed.

[[Insular art]] is the name given to the common style that developed in Britain and Ireland from the eighth century and which became highly influential in continental Europe and contributed to the development of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles. It can be seen in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of semi-precious stones, in the heavily carved [[high cross]]es found particularly in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the [[Book of Kells]], which may have been begun, or wholly created at the monastic centre of [[Iona]].

Scotland adopted the Romanesque style relatively late and retained and revived elements of its style after the Gothic style had become dominant from the thirteenth century. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork, and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors. From the thirteenth century there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies. Native craftsmanship can be seen in a variety of items. Visual illustration can be seen in the illumination of charters and occasional survivals of church paintings. Surviving copies of individual portraits are relatively crude, but more impressive are the works or artists commissioned from the continent, particularly the Netherlands.

===Pictish stones===

[[File:DunnichenMeffan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Dunnichen Stone]], a Class I incised stone, with [[Double disc (Pictish symbol)|double disc and z-rod]], [[Mirror and comb (Pictish symbol)|mirror and comb]] and flower Pictish symbols]]
About 250 Pictish stones survive and have been assigned by scholars to three classes.&lt;ref&gt;J. N. G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1991), {{ISBN|0748602917}}, pp. 161–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Class I stones are those thought to date to the period up to the seventh century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals such as fish and the [[Pictish beast]], everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V-rod, double disc and Z-rod. They are found between from the [[Firth of Forth]] to [[Shetland]]. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the [[Dunrobin Castle|Dunrobin]] (Sutherland) and [[Aberlemno]] stones ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]).&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8&gt;[[James Graham-Campbell|J. Graham-Campbell]] and C. E. Batey, ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0748606416}}, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a cross on one face and a wide range of symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include [[Glamis]] 2, which contains a finely executed [[Celtic cross]] on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow.&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/&gt; Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones.&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/&gt; Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas.&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/&gt;

===Pictish metalwork===
Items of metalwork have been found throughout Pictland. The earlier Picts appear to have had a considerable amount of silver available, probably from raiding further south, or the payment of subsidies to keep them from doing so. The very large hoard of late Roman [[hacksilver]] found at [[Traprain Law]] may have originated in either way. The largest hoard of early Pictish metalwork was found in 1819 at Norrie's Law in Fife, but unfortunately much was dispersed and melted down.&lt;ref name=Youngs1989pp26-8&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th–9th centuries AD'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 26–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Over ten heavy silver chains, some over {{convert|0.5|m|ft}} long, have been found from this period; the double-linked [[Whitecleuch Chain]] is one of only two that have a penannular ring, with symbol decoration including enamel, which shows how these were probably used as "choker" necklaces.&lt;ref name=Youngs1989pp26-8/&gt; The [[St Ninian's Isle]] Treasure of 28 silver and silver-gilt objects, contains perhaps the best collection of late Pictish forms, from the Christian period, when Pictish metalwork style, as with stone-carving, gradually merged with Insular, Anglo-Saxon and Viking styles.&lt;ref&gt;L. R. Laing, ''Later Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland'' (London: Osprey Publishing, 1987), {{ISBN|0852638744}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish-Scots art===

[[File:Hunterston BroochDSCF6363.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The front of the [[Hunterston Brooch]], found near [[Hunterston]], [[North Ayrshire]], which shows Irish elements of style and may have been made in the kingdom of [[Dál Riata]]]]
[[Thomas Charles-Edwards]] has suggested that the kingdom of Dál Riata was a cross-roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland, with which the Scots settlers in what is now Argyll kept close contacts. This can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of Dunadd, which combine Pictish and Irish elements.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0521363950}}, pp. 331–2.&lt;/ref&gt; This included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the seventh century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the [[Hunterston brooch]], found in Ayrshire, which may have been made in Dál Riata, but with elements that suggest Irish origins. These and other finds, including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration (or pressblech), perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn, indicate the ways in which Dál Riata was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed.&lt;ref name=Lane2001&gt;A.

Retrieved 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighth and ninth centuries the Pictish elite adopted true penannular [[brooch]]es with lobed terminals from Ireland. Some older Irish [[pseudo-penannular]] brooches were adapted to the Pictish style, for example the Breadalbane Brooch (British Museum). The eighth century [[Monymusk Reliquary]] has elements of Pictish and Irish style.&lt;ref name=Youngs1989pp109-1123&gt;S.

===Early Anglo-Saxon art===
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon art}}
Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art are largely metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional items such as the intricately carved whalebone [[Franks Casket]], thought to have been produced in [[Northumbria]] in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reginald Dodwell|C. R. Dodwell]], ''Anglo-Saxon Art: A New Perspective'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1982), {{ISBN|071900926X}}, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one known pagan burial in Scotland, at [[Dalmeny]] Midlothian, which contains a necklace of beads similar to those found in mid-seventh-century southern England. Other isolated finds include a gold object from Dalmeny, shaped like a truncated pyramid, with [[filigree]] and [[garnet]], similar to sword harness mounts found at [[Sutton Hoo]]. There is also a bun-shaped loom from [[Yetholm]], Roxburghshire and a ring with an Anglian [[runes|runic]] inscription. From eastern Scotland there is a seventh-century sword [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]] from [[Culbin Sands]], Moray and the [[Burghead]] drinking horn mount.&lt;ref&gt;L. Laing, ''The Archaeology of Late Celtic Britain and Ireland C. 400–1200 AD'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1975), {{ISBN|0416823602}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Christianisation of Scotland|Christianisation]] in the seventh century artistic styles in Northumbria, which then reached to the Firth of Forth, interacted with those in Ireland and what is now Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon.&lt;ref&gt;C. E Karkov, ''The Art of Anglo-Saxon England'' (Boydell Press, 2011), {{ISBN|1843836289}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insular art===
{{Main|Insular art}}
[[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The opening page from the [[Gospel of John]] from the [[Book of Kells]], usually thought to have been made in [[Iona]].]]
Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art, is the name given to the common style produced in Scotland, Britain and Anglo-Saxon England from the seventh century, with the combining of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon forms.&lt;ref&gt;H. Honour and J. Fleming, ''A World History of Art'' (London: Macmillan), {{ISBN|0333371852}}, pp. 244–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving examples of Insular art are found in metalwork, carving, but mainly in [[illuminated manuscript]]s. In manuscripts surfaces are highly decorated with intricate patterning, with no attempt to give an impression of depth, volume or recession. The best examples include the [[Book of Kells]], which may have been wholly or partly created in Iona, and the [[Book of Durrow]], which may be from Ireland or Northumbria. [[Carpet pages]] are a characteristic feature of Insular manuscripts, although [[historiated initial]]s (an Insular invention), [[canon table]]s and figurative miniatures, especially [[Evangelist portrait]]s, are also common. The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the Viking raids in the late eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Dodwell, ''The Pictorial Arts of the West, 800–1200'' (Yale UP, 1993), {{ISBN|0300064934}}, pp. 85 and 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity discouraged the burial of grave goods so the majority of examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period have been found in archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Dodwell, ''Anglo-Saxon Art, a New Perspective''  (Manchester:Manchester University Press, 1982), {{ISBN|071900926X}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few exceptions, notably portable [[shrine]]s ("[[cumdach]]s") for books or [[relic]]s, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the [[Monymusk Reliquary]] has always been in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 134–140.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, tableware or altarware. The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops.&lt;ref&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with [[amber]] and [[rock crystal]] among the commonest, and some [[garnet]]s. Coloured glass, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[millefiori]] glass, probably imported, are also used.&lt;ref&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 72–115, and 170–174 and D. M. Wilson, ''Anglo-Saxon Art: From The Seventh Century To The Norman Conquest'' (Overlook Press, 1984), pp. 113–114 and 120–130.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the major insular manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Calkins, ''Illuminated Books of the Middle Ages'' (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press 1983), pp. 57–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monymusk ReliquaryDSCF6383.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Monymusk Reliquary]], made c. 750]]
The most significant survivals in sculpture are in [[High cross]]es, large free-standing stone crosses, usually carved in relief with patterns, biblical iconography and occasionally inscriptions. The tradition may have begun in Ireland or Anglo-Saxon England and then spread to Scotland.&lt;ref name=Koch2006pp915-19&gt;J. T. Koch, ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1–5'' (ABC-CLIO, 2006), {{ISBN|1851094407}}, pp. 915–19.&lt;/ref&gt; They are found throughout the British Isles and often feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a [[Celtic cross]], apparently an innovation of Celtic Christianity, that may have begun at [[Iona]].&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Wilson, ''Anglo-Saxon Art: From The Seventh Century To The Norman Conquest'' (Overlook Press), 1984, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution in Scotland is heaviest in the Highlands and Islands and they can be dated to the period c. 750 to 1150.&lt;ref name=Koch2006pp915-19/&gt; All the surviving crosses are of stone, but there are indications that large numbers of wooden crosses may also have existed. In Scotland biblical iconography is less common than in Ireland, but the subject of [[King David]] is relatively frequently depicted. In the east the influence of Pictish sculpture can be seen, in areas of Viking occupation and settlement, crosses for the tenth to the twelfth centuries have distinctive Scandinavian patterns, often mixed with native styles. Important examples dated to the eighth century include St Martin's Cross on Iona, the [[Kildalton Cross]] from the Hebrides and the Anglo-Saxon [[Ruthwell Cross]].&lt;ref name=Koch2006pp915-19/&gt; Through the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] to the continent, insular art was highly influential on subsequent European Medieval art, especially the decorative elements of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;G. Henderson, ''Early Medieval Art'' (London: Penguin, 1972), pp. 63–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viking age art===
{{See also|Viking Age art}}
[[File:UigChessmen SelectionOfKings.jpg|thumb|Some of the [[Lewis chessmen]]]]
Viking art avoided naturalism, favouring stylised animal motifs to create its ornamental patterns. Ribbon-interlace was important and plant motifs became fashionable in the tenth and eleventh centuries.&lt;ref&gt;J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey, ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0748606416}}, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Scottish artefacts come from 130 "pagan" burials in the north and west from the mid-ninth to the mid-tenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carver, ''The Cross Goes North: Processes of Conversion in Northern Europe, AD 300–1300'' (Boydell Press, 2006), {{ISBN|1843831252}}, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; These include jewellery, weapons and occasional elaborate high status items.&lt;ref&gt;J. Jesch, ''Women in the Viking Age'' (Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1991), {{ISBN|0851153607}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the most impressive of these is the [[Scar boat burial]], on Orkney, which contained an elaborate sword, quiver with arrows, a brooch, bone comb, gaming pieces and the Scar Dragon Plaque, made from whalebone, most of which were probably made in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;K. Holman, ''The Northern [I. E. Northern] Conquest: Vikings in Britain and Ireland'' (Signal Books, 2007), {{ISBN|1904955347}}, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; From the west, another boat burial at Kiloron Bay in [[Colonsay]] revealed a sword, shield, iron cauldron and enamelled scales, which may be Celtic in origin.&lt;ref&gt;L. Laing, ''The Archaeology of Late Celtic Britain and Ireland C. 400–1200 AD'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1975), {{ISBN|0416823602}}, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of Viking and Celtic styles can be see in a [[penannular brooch]] from Pierowall in Orkney, which has a Pictish-style looped pin. It is about two inches in diameter, with traces of gilding, and probably housed a piece of amber surrounded by interweaving ribbons.&lt;ref&gt;W. Nolan, L. Ronayne and M. Dunlevy, eds, ''Donegal: History &amp; Society: Interdisciplinary Essays on the History of an Irish County'' (Geography, 1995), {{ISBN|0906602459}}, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; After the conversion to Christianity, from the tenth to the twelfth centuries, stone crosses and cross-slabs in Viking occupied areas of the Highlands and Islands were carved with successive styles of Viking ornament.&lt;ref&gt;J. Koch, ''Celtic Culture: Aberdeen Breviary-Celticism'' (ABC-CLIO, 2006), {{ISBN|1851094407}}. p. 918.&lt;/ref&gt; They were frequently mixed with native interlace and animal patterns. Examples include the eleventh-century cross-slab from Dóid Mhàiri on the island of [[Islay]], where the plant motifs on either side of the cross-shaft are based upon the [[Ringerike style]] of Viking art.&lt;ref&gt;J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey. ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0748606416}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous artistic find from modern Scotland, the [[Lewis Chessmen]], from [[Uig, Lewis|Uig]], were probably made in [[Trondheim]] in Norway, but contain some decoration that may have been influenced by Celtic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;M.

Architectural evidence suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked in much of Europe in the later eleventh and early twelfth century, it was still reaching Scotland in the second half of the twelfth century&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Swanson, ''The Twelfth-Century Renaissance'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1999), {{ISBN|0719042569}}, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; and was revived in the late fifteenth century, perhaps as a reaction to the [[English Gothic architecture|English perpendicular]] style that had come to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0191624330}}, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and, for the end of the period, there is evidence of painting, particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the Low Countries and France.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt;

The interiors of churches were often more elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell.&lt;ref name=Whyte&amp;Whyte1991p117&gt;I.

Many were founders and patrons of churches and chapels, including members of the clergy, knights and often their wives. In contrast to England, where the fashion for stone-carved monuments gave way to brass etchings, they continued to be produced until the end of the Medieval period, with the largest group dating from the fifteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;R.

===Decorative arts===

[[File:Financrozier2.jpg|thumb|upright|The 12th century "Loch Shiel Crozier Drop", hollow for a relic, with the bust of a king.&lt;ref&gt;V. Glenn, ''Romanesque and Gothic: Decorative Metalwork and Ivory Carvings in the Museum of Scotland'' (National Museums of Scotland, 2003), {{ISBN|1901663558}}, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Survivals from late Medieval church fittings and objects in Scotland are exceptionally rare even compared to those from comparable areas like England or Norway, probably because of the thoroughness of their destruction in the [[Scottish Reformation]]. The Scottish elite and church now participated in a culture stretching across Europe, and many objects that do survive are imported, such as [[Limoges enamel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 1–4; Chapter III on enamels&lt;/ref&gt; It is often difficult to decide the country of creation of others, as work in international styles was produced in Scotland, along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles.

Two secular small chests with carved whalebone panels and metal fittings illustrate some aspects of the Scottish arts. The Eglington and Fife Caskets are very similar and were probably made by the same workshop around 1500, as boxes for valuables such as jewellery or documents. The overall form of the caskets follows French examples, and the locks and metal bands are decorated in Gothic style with "simple decorations of [[fleuron (architectural)|fleuron]]s and debased [[egg and dart]]" while the whalebone panels are carved in [[relief]] with a late form of Insular interwoven [[strapwork]] characteristic of late Medieval West Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 147, 186–191; both now [[Museum of Scotland]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Key examples of native craftsmanship on items include the [[Bute mazer]], the earliest surviving drinking cup of its type, made of maple-wood and with elaborate silver-gilt ornamentation, dated to around 1320.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 34–38, and 16th century cover, 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; The Savernake Horn was probably made for the earl of Moray in the fourteenth century and looted by the English in the mid-sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9&gt;B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (St. Martin's Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0333567617}}, pp. 127–9.&lt;/ref&gt; A few significant [[reliquaries]] survive from West Scotland, examples of the habit of the [[Celtic church]] of treating the possessions rather than the bones of saints as [[relic]]s. As in Irish examples these were partly reworked and elaborated at intervals over a long period. These are St Fillan's Crozier and its "Coigreach" or [[reliquary]], between them with elements from each century from the eleventh to the fifteenth, the [[Guthrie, Angus|Guthrie]] Bell Shrine, Iona, twelfth to fifteenth century, and the Kilmichael Glassary Bell Shrine, Argyll, mid-twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 92–115, all Museum of Scotland; MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The Skye Chess piece is a single elaborate piece in carved [[walrus]] ivory, with two warriors carrying heraldic shields in a framework of openwork vegetation. It is thought to be Scottish, of the mid-thirteenth century, with aspects similar to both English and Norwegian pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 146–147, 178–181; now Museum of Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest groups of surviving works of art are the seal matrices that appear to have entered Scottish usage with feudalism in the reign of David I, beginning at the royal court and among his Anglo-Norman vassals and then by about 1250 they began to spread to the [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] areas of the country. They would be made compulsory for barons of the king in a statute of 1401&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 116–144; C. J. Neville, ''Land, Law and People in Medieval Scotland'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748639586}}, pp. 83–99.&lt;/ref&gt; and seal matrices show very high standards of skill and artistry.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; Examples of items that were probably the work of continental artists include the delicate hanging lamp in St. John's Kirk in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], the vestments and hangings in Holyrood&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; and the Medieval maces of the Universities of [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]] and [[Glasgow university|Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt;

'''Arthur Paunzen''' (4 February 1890 &amp;ndash; 9 August 1940?) was a [[Jewish]] [[Austria]]n artist.

==Biography==

Paunzen was born on 4 February in [[fin de siecle]], [[Vienna]], to Leopold Paunzen and Hermine née Kuhn. His parents were [[Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;Vienna index of Jewish records&lt;/ref&gt; He studied with [[Ludwig Koch (painter)|Ludwig Koch]] in Vienna. He also studied in [[France]] at [[Académie Julian]] under [[Jean Pierre Laurens]] and traveled [[Italy]] studying art and architecture, which was very common for his time. In 1918 Paunzen married the [[Jewish]] Cornelia Westreich in Vienna.
Paunzen created a number of works that make bold symbolic attempts to convey music as images. For instance, depicting [[Beethoven]]’s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]] (Third) Symphony as nude horse backed trumpeters in the sky surrounded by clouds, flanked by a "stony faced" trumpeter who might very well be death. Also, his series based on [[Gustav Mahler]]'s song cycle, the "[[Song of the Earth]]" or the etchings he created for [[Raskolnikov]].

Many of his pieces were collected by the [[British Museum]], the [[Stockholm Engraving Collection]] and the [[Albertina Museum]] in Vienna.

In 1938, as [[Hitler]] rose to power, Paunzen moved to [[Great Britain]].

==Later life and death==

Arthur Paunzen died on 9 August 1940, in [[Central Internment Camp]], Douglas, Isle of Man. (In a panic measure, the British authorities interned all [[German people|German]] and [[Austrian people|Austrian]] citizens in the country, including all those who were Jews fleeing Nazi oppression, in May 1940.) His death is described by his friend and fellow-internee, the composer [[Hans Gál]], in his internment diary.&lt;ref&gt;'Musik hinter Stacheldraht', Peter Lang, Bern, 2003, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; He died of severe [[bronchial pneumonia]], exacerbated, according to Gál's account, by neglect on the part of the authorities. He is buried in the Jewish section of Douglas Borough Cemetery, Isle of Man &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishgen.org/JCR-uk/community/Iom/Isle_of_Man_Cemetery.htm&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Early career ==

He was the project-leader of the exhibition ''Initatief 86'' which took place in the St. Pieters Abbey and the Museum of Contemporary Art of Ghent in 1986. 
This was an exhibition on Belgian art for which [[Kasper König]], [[Jan Hoet]], [[Jean-Hubert Martin]] and Gosse Oosterhof made the selection. The exhibition included a.o. works by [[Chantal Akerman]], [[Guillaume Bijl]], Jacques Charlier, [[Luc Deleu]], [[Lili Dujourie]], [[Jef Geys]], René Heyvaert, [[Raoul De Keyser]], [[Marie-Jo Lafontaine]], [[Panamarenko]], Guy Rombouts, [[Walter Swennen]], Narcisse Tordoir, [[Jan Vercruysse]] and Didier Vermeiren,…&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://primo.getty.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=GRI&amp;search_scope=default_scope&amp;docId=GETTY_ALMA21167959280001551&amp;fn=permalink|title=Initiatief 1986|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|last2=Martin|first2=Jean-Hubert|last3=König|first3=Kasper|last4=Oosterhof|first4=Gosse|last5=Hoet|first5=Jan|date=|publisher=Imschoot|year=1986|isbn=|location=Gent, Belgium|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 1986 until the end of 1988, Bart Cassiman was curator for Contemporary Art at the [[Palais des Beaux Arts|Palais des Beaux-Arts (BOZAR)]] in Brussels where he organized (in collaboration with the director Jan Debbaut) several exhibitions of contemporary art (Didier Vermeiren &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Didier Vermeiren|last=Debbaut|first=Jan|publisher=Vereniging voor Tentoonstellingen van het Paleis voor Schone Kunsten|year=1987|isbn=|location=Brussel|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Narcisse Tordoir &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Narcisse Tordoir|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|publisher=Vereniging voor tentoonstellingen van het Paleis voor Schone Kunsten Brussel|year=1987|isbn=|location=Brussel|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Art &amp; Language]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art &amp; Language: de schilderijen|last=Harrison|first=Charles|last2=Roberts|first2=John|publisher=Vereniging voor Tentoonstellingen van het Paleis voor Schone Kunsten|year=1987|isbn=|location=Brussel|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Jan Vercruysse]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jan Vercruysse|last=Brouwer|first=Marianne|publisher=Vereniging voor tentoonstellingen van het Paleis voor Schone Kunsten|year=1988|isbn=|location=Brussel|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;,…) 

== Curatorial practice ==
As a free-lance curator he organized several exhibitions between 1989 and 1991. Amongst others: 

* ''Rombouts and Tordoir'', Douglas Hyde Gallery, Dublin, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/guy-rombouts-narcisse-tordoir/oclc/21078454|title=Guy Rombouts, Narcisse Tordoir|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|publisher=Douglas Hyde Gallery|year=1989|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The solo-exhibitions of ''Lili Dujourie'', Kunstverein, Bonn, 1989; Le Magasin, Grenoble, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/23212241|title=Lili Dujourie.|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|date=|publisher=Centre national d'art contemporain|year=1989|isbn=2906732214|location=Grenoble|pages=|oclc=23212241}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Espacio Mental'' with [[René Daniëls]], [[Thierry De Cordier]], [[Isa Genzken]], [[Cristina Iglesias]], [[Thomas Schütte]] and [[Jan Vercruysse]] at Valencia, [[Institut Valencià d'Art Modern|IVAM]]-El Carme in 1991 was his first major group show. The exhibition contained about 80 artworks, was complex and layered so that the different interrelations between the artworks became almost endless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47715801|title=Espacio mental|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|date=|publisher=Generalitat Valenciana|others=|year=1991|isbn=8478904808|location=Valencia|pages=|oclc=47715801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bart Cassiman was the project-leader of the section Contemporary Visual Art of Antwerp 93, [[European Capital of Culture]]. For this temporary organization he realized three major projects which differed in terms of intent and content. 

For the [[Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Museum|Middelheim Museum]] he invited ten artists ([[Per Kirkeby]], [[Richard Deacon (sculptor)|Richard Deacon]], [[Panamarenko]], [[Thomas Schütte]], [[Juan Muñoz]], [[Matt Mullican]], Bernd Lohaus, Harald Klingelhöller, Didier Vermeiren, [[Isa Genzken]]) to make a work, which was bought by ''Antwerp 93'' for the permanent collection. They were placed on Middelheim Low, which became by doing so the section of contemporary art of the museum. A section invented by Cassiman and realized with the support of Bob Cools (The Mayor), Eric Antonis (the intendant of ''Antwerp 93'') and Hans Nieuwdorp (the director of the Art Historical Museums of the City of Antwerp). This project became known as ''New Sculptures''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nieuwe beelden : Openluchtmuseum voor Beeldhouwkunst Middelheim|last=Pauwels|first=Hilde|publisher=Antwerpen|year=1993|isbn=9074759017|location=Antwerpen|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, the [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp|Royal Museum of Fine Arts]] hosted contemporary artists who gave form to entwining of remembrance and imagination in the creative process. This project (exhibition and book), ''The Sublime Void (on the memory of the imagination)'',  included the artists [[Jean-Marc Bustamante]], [[Jan Vercruysse]], [[Rachel Whiteread]], [[Juan Muñoz]], [[Niek Kemps]], John Murphy, Mitja Tušek, [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Luc Tuymans]], [[Robert Gober]], [[Cristina Iglesias]], Harald Klingelhöller, Didier Vermeiren, [[Thomas Schütte]], [[Ettore Spalletti]], [[Luciano Fabro]], [[Jeff Wall]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[René Daniëls|René Daniels]], [[Franz West]], Fortuyn/O’Brien, [[James Welling]], [[Lili Dujourie]] and [[Thierry De Cordier]]. The accompanying publication contains texts, essays, poems etc. by a.o. [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinus]], [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]], [[Maurice Blanchot|Blanchot]], [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]], [[Hermann Broch|Broch]], [[Elias Canetti|Canetti]], [[Peter Handke|Handke]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Julia Kristeva|Kristeva]], [[Alois Musil|Musil]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], Pascal, [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]], Valery, Wenders, [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]]…It has been rewarded with the Gouden penning van Plantijn-Moretus, an award for the best book published in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30447842|title=The sublime void : on the memory of the imagination|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|last2=Ramael|first2=Greet|last3=Vande Veire|first3=Frank|date=|publisher=Ludion|others=|year=1993|isbn=9055440027|location=Ghent|pages=|oclc=30447842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the third project, he invited after conscientiously research and several workshops three colleagues-curators ([[Iwona Blazwick]], Yves Aupetitallot and [[Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev|Carolyn-Christov Bakargiev]]) to make an exhibition with artists from different cultural backgrounds to produce a new work in the extended [[Museum of Modern Art, Antwerp|M HKA]]. The for a long time underestimated exhibition ''On taking a normal situation and translating it into overlapping and multiple readings of conditions past and present'' which included at that time a few well-known artists (such as Jimmy Durham, [[Mark Dion]], Eugenio Dittborn, [[Judith Barry]] and [[Renée Green]]) in combination with a lot of artists who were at the beginning of their public life and have since then co- determined the international discourse for years (Maria Eichhorn, [[Zarina Bhimji]], [[Ann Veronica Janssens]], [[Andrea Fraser]],…)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32009921|title=On taking a normal situation ...|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|date=|publisher=Antwerpen 1993 v.z.w. / Museum van Hedendaagse Kunst, Antwerpen.|others=|year=1993|isbn=907475905X|location=Antwerpen|pages=|oclc=32009921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994 until 1998 he was member of the advisory-committee of the [[Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Museum|Middelheim Museum]], Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.middelheimmuseum.be/sites/middelheim/files/Historiek_ENG.PDF|title=The Middelheim Museum.

In 1995 he realized an exhibition with [[Dora García|Dora Garcia]], Dianne Hagen, Gert Verhoeven, Lisa May Post, Anne-Marie Schneider and Stephen Wilks, at Galerie Nelson, Paris. In the same year he co-ordinated the project ''Arte Habitable'' with [[Alicia Framis]]. He wrote the essay for the catalogue which he edited too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/313140460|title=Arte Habitable|last=Cassiman|first=Bart|date=|publisher=|others=|year=1995|isbn=9090100644|location=Amsterdam|pages=|oclc=313140460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stan Douglas]], [[Franz West]], Herbert Brandl, [[Lili Dujourie]], [[Cristina Iglesias]], [[Thomas Schütte]], Harald Klingelhöller, [[Allan McCollum]], Narcisse Tordoir, Helmut Dorner, [[Luc Tuymans]], [[Jan Fabre]], Bazilebustamante, [[Jean-Marc Bustamante]], [[Thierry De Cordier]], [[James Welling]], [[Juan Muñoz]], [[Jan Vercruysse]], Mitja Tušek, Gert Verhoeven, Stephen Wilks, Dianne Hagen, [[Jan Van Imschoot]], Robert Suermondt, Carla Klein, [[Niek Kemps]], [[Alicia Framis]], [[Isa Genzken]], Ebru Özseçen, [[Gregor Schneider]], Valerie Mannaerts, [[Bjarne Melgaard]], [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], [[Carlos Amorales]], [[Mirosław Bałka|Miroslav Balka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bacob &amp; Art|last=Michel|first=Mast|publisher=Bacob&amp;Art|year=1996|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a severe illness Bart Cassiman was forced to stop all his professional activities at the end of the nineties. Without any doubt one can say that he was one of the most active and energized persons of the artworld between the mid-eighties and the end of the nineties. With colleagues such as Saskia Bos, Ulrich Loock, Julian Heynen, Dennis Zacharopoulos and a few others he was responsible  for the visualization of a generation by making exhibitions and writing texts and convincing many museums and collectors to buy their works. 

The bank for which he collected more than a decade bought as a result of his engagement and advise the well-known Vanderborght building in the heart of Brussels, at the end of the nineties. Everything was prepared to open the first private (corporate) museum on this scale in Western Europe. The opening was planned for the spring of 2002. But because the engine of this whole operation fell silent the project died a quiet dead. Big parts of the collection were sold and so stays the capital of Europe deprived of an urgently needed Museum of Contemporary Art…

The '''Boston Camera Club''' is the leading amateur photographic organization in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and immediate vicinity. Founded in 1881,  it offers activities of interest to amateur photographers, particularly digital photography. It meets weekly and is open to the public.

==History==

[[Photography]] was introduced to the public in 1839.  For some decades, practice was limited largely to professionals because it involved laborious [[Collodion process|wet-plate]] processes.  Amateur photography in the United States received major impetus in 1880, when the future [[Eastman Kodak Co.|Eastman Kodak&amp;nbsp;Co.]], and others, introduced [[dry plate]]s&amp;mdash;[[Photographic plate|glass plates]] with chemical emulsion already applied.  In 1888 Kodak introduced the first flexible roll photographic medium&amp;mdash;first paper and soon [[Photographic film|film]]&amp;mdash;and third-party [[photographic processing|processing]]. These innovations brought photography to the masses. Still, photography practiced in camera cubs (and among professionals as well) typically used glass plates until the early 20th century, when film was finally accepted. During the chemistry-based era, third-party processing and printing were typically prohibited in camera clubs, except later in the 20th century for [[color photography|color photographs]].

===Boston Society of Amateur Photographers, 1881===

The club known today as the Boston Camera Club was founded October 7, 1881 in Boston, Massachusetts as the Boston Society of Amateur Photographers.  It is the second-oldest camera club continuously extant in the United States founded at least in part by amateurs.&lt;ref&gt;The oldest continuously extant camera club in the United States founded at least in part by amateurs is the [http://phillyphotosociety.com Photographic Society of Philadelphia], founded in 1862 and hence 19 years older than BCC. The first amateur photographic entity in the United States was the Amateur Photographic Exchange Club, New York City, extant 1861&amp;ndash;1863 and revived twice in the later 20th century. "In 1880 there were fewer than 10 photographic clubs in the United States, most of which were populated by professionals."  Patricia J. Fanning, ''Through an Uncommon Lens: The Life and Photography of F. Holland Day.'' Amherst, MA: Univ. of Mass. Press, 2008, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was founded by F. H. Blair, James M. Codman, W. C. Greenough, A. P. Howard, Lucius L. Hubbard, Frederick Ober, and John H. Thurston, with Thurston having the most influential role. At first temporary officers were elected.  The seven men were joined on November 18, 1881 by James F. Babcock, William T. Brigham, Wilfred A. French, and William A. Hovey, at which time permanent officers were elected&amp;mdash;Brigham president, Babcock vice president, and French secretary and treasurer. At first the club met in the offices of the Boston ''Sunday Budget.'' Later it met at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], at the time located in Boston.

===Boston Camera Club, 1886===

As amateur photography in the United States became more widespread, in 1886 the club changed its name to Boston Camera Club. On April 6, 1887 it incorporated in the [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] under the new name, stating as its purpose the furthering of "the knowledge of photography in all its branches and the promotion of social intercourse among the amateur photographers of Boston and vicinity."&lt;ref&gt;BCC, ''Notice of First Meeting,'' February 3, 1887.  Commonwealth of Mass, "Religious, etc. Corporations / Certificate of Organization" under Mass. Public Statutes, ch. 115, sec. 4, etc., February 25, 1887.  BCC, "Constitution, By-Laws and Rules," 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 the Boston Camera Club rented permanent headquarters at 50 Bromfield Street, Boston.  It may have been selected by being the place of business of both club founder John H. Thurston and early vice president Charles Henry Currier.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Boston Almanac and Business Directory]],'' 1891.  ''King's How to See Boston: A Trustworthy Guide Book,'' 1895.  Steele and Polito, p. 171.  From the late 19th to nearly the end of the 20th century, Bromfield Street was Boston's prime camera retail district.&lt;/ref&gt;  The club had eight rooms:

[[Image:1896 BostonTypes byWalterChase BostonCameraClub.png|thumb|right|200px|"Boston Types &amp;mdash; Miss H" by Walter G. Chase, Boston Camera Club, circa 1896. Exhibited in the 1896 Washington Salon and Art Photographic Exhibition, Washington DC.]]

:There is a well-selected library ...; a large exhibition gallery ...; a studio ... fitted with screens, cameras, and 2 of the finest [[John Henry Dallmeyer|Dallmeyer]] portrait lenses, also a fine double [[stereoscopy|stereopticon]]; an enlarging room, with apparatus for making [[Bromide paper|bromide]] [[Enlarger|enlargements]], enlarged [[Negative (photography)|negatives]] and [[Magic lantern (projector)|lantern slides]] by the use of an electric [[Arc lamp|arc light]]; [[Darkroom|dark rooms]] ...&lt;ref&gt;''The Photographic Times: An Illustrated Monthly,'' February 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 50 Bromfield the club held public exhibitions of photography featuring works by its members and guest photographers.

===Early 20th-century difficulties===

For reasons begging further research, in 1913 difficulties arose.  Minutes of that year by longtime club secretary John&amp;nbsp;H. Thurston show membership in the club had fallen off, and the club's uncertain future was under discussion.  Thenceforth business, but apparently far fewer regular, meetings were held. The club was kept alive, at least administratively, by Frank Roy Fraprie (FRAY-pree), Phineas Hubbard (president 1908&amp;ndash;1913 and possibly longer), Horace&amp;nbsp;A. Latimer, and the aging Thurston. The club, it is believed in 1924, left its longstanding 50&amp;nbsp;Bromfield Street location, and for some years it met at the [[Boston Young Men's Christian Union]] (YMCU).  Amateur photography in Boston now seems to have been dominated by the Boston YMCU Camera Club (a different entity than Boston Camera Club's meetings at YMCU), extant from 1908 to at least the 1920s;&lt;ref&gt;As of 1920 Boston YMCU Camera Club had 82&amp;nbsp;members. ''Photo-Era,'' v. 44, n. 4, April 1920, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Boston Photo-Clan, extant by 1912 but apparently defunct by about 1921, dominated by Boston professional photographer John&amp;nbsp;H. Garo at whose studio it met;&lt;ref&gt;''American Photography,'' v. 8, n. 12, December, 1914, p. 742, ''Google Books.''&lt;/ref&gt; and the Boston Arts and Crafts Society.

===Horace A. Latimer bequest, 1931===

In 1931 a bequest by longtime club member Horace A. Latimer (1860&amp;ndash;1931) of Boston, an independently wealthy amateur photographer of some renown, for reasons not fully understood as well, profoundly reinvigorated the Boston Camera Club.&lt;ref&gt;State of Maine. ''Last Will and Testament of Horace A. Latimer'', October 19, 1931. Latimer also bequeathed money to the [http://www.portlandcameraclub.org Portland (Maine) Camera Club], founded in 1899, as a result of which, as with BCC, it prospered and is still extant.&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership rebounded, for example reaching 286 in 1946.  With the funds the club would purchase new headquarters. First, however, it moved to 330 [[Newbury Street (Boston)|Newbury Street]], in the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] section of Boston.

===351A Newbury Street, 1934&amp;ndash;1980===

In 1934, with part of Horace Latimer's bequest the Boston Camera Club purchased a building at nearby 351A Newbury Street, Back Bay. The club occupied three floors. There were a large and small exhibition gallery, darkroom, library and kitchen. Public exhibitions of photography resumed.  For tax purposes, in 1946 the club decided to sell no. 351A and remain in the building as a lessee.&lt;ref&gt;BCC, succession of 5-year leases, June&amp;nbsp;1, 1946 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Growth continued apace, reaching 555 in 1959&amp;mdash;492 regular, 51 associate&lt;ref&gt;Starting probably in the 19th and ending in the early 21st century, the club had regular and associate membership. Associates were corresponding members living beyond a 25-mile radius of Boston and paid half dues.&lt;/ref&gt; and 4 honorary members&amp;mdash;a level maintained for some two decades. Besides post-war prosperity, the growth is attributable to introduction of [[135 film|35mm film]] by Kodak in the 1930s, and [[single lens reflex camera|single lens reflex]] (SLR) 35mm cameras by [[Nikon]], [[Pentax]] and others in the 1960s.  Enthusiasts often sought instruction in their camera use by joining a camera club.

===Brookline, Massachusetts, 1980–present===

In 1980 the 351A Newbury Street building was sold and the Boston Camera Club moved from Boston to the adjacent town of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline, Mass]].  In 1997 it moved across town to its current location in Brookline.

In the 1980s and 1990s membership again declined dramatically, a trend attributable to a number of factors including camera automation, for example [[autofocus]] and programmed [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] reducing the need for user instruction; the advent of consumer video; and changing social habits.  Since 2000 membership has increased again to about 150 today, due in large part to the club's emphasis on [[digital photography]].&lt;ref&gt;The first discussion and vote by the club on whether to allow digital images in its competitions were held in June 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==

The exhibition history of the Boston Camera Club is long and somewhat complex.  The club has hosted several species of shows: exhibitions by its members, joint shows with other camera clubs, exhibitions by outside photographers and camera clubs, and ''salons''&amp;mdash;judged competitive exhibitions of photography open to the international public.

===Member exhibitions, 1880s&amp;ndash;1910===

About 1883 the Boston Society of Amateur Photographers, as the club was first known, held its first exhibition at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], an unusually large show of some 700 photographic prints.  The third exhibition in 1885 included male nudes, raising eyebrows in conservative Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892 the club exhibited in the long-running triennial exhibition of the [[Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Club exhibitors in the 1892 Mass. Charitable Mechanic Assn. exhibition were Francis Blake, Jr., Walter G. Chase, E. L. Drexel, Owen&amp;nbsp;A. Eames, Sarah Jane Eddy, Wilfred A. French, John C. Holman, John C. Lee, James L. Little, George M. Morgan, Frederick Alcott Pratt and A. R. Wilmarth. Mass. Charitable Mechanic Assn., [https://books.google.com/books?id=0SwAAAAAMAAJ Report of the Eighteenth Triennial Exhibition], Boston, 1893, pp.&amp;nbsp;175&amp;ndash;181.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the club's seventh and tenth member exhibitions, in 1895 and 1898, member Emma D. Sewall received the top award.&lt;ref&gt;"Boston Camera Club," ''New York Times,'' April 14, 1895, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1898 show [[Sarah J. Eddy|Sarah Jane Eddy]], and painter and [[Photo-Secession]] member [[Sarah Choate Sears]], was prominent.&lt;ref&gt;W. Albert Hickman, "A Recent Exhibition: Tenth Annual Composition Exhibition, 1898. Boston Camera Club," ''Photo-Era,'' v. 1, n. 1, May 1898, pp. 11&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1900 the Boston Camera Club held an exhibition by member [[Fred Holland Day]]. In 1904 it exhibited its members' work at Day's studio in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Fanning, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year the club helped organize, and exhibited in, a photograph exhibition at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]], the St. Louis World's Fair.  The club's annual show of 1910, which photographic journal ''Photo-Era'' called the club's "best for many years," had prints by Eddy, Frank R. Fraprie, Horace A. Latimer, and Joseph Prince Loud.&lt;ref&gt;''Photo-Era,'' v. 25, n. 1, July 1910, pp. 48&amp;ndash;49. Highlights from the show in: v. 25, n. 2, August 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1910 exhibition is the last known to be held by the club until 1932, when it launched the Boston Salon.

===Joint Exhibitions of Photography, 1887&amp;ndash;1894===

During this period, the Joint Exhibitions of Photography were held, sponsored jointly by the Boston Camera Club, Photographic Society of Philadelphia, and Society of Amateur Photographers of New York.&lt;ref&gt;In 1896 subsumed into [[The Camera Club of New York]].&lt;/ref&gt; The venue rotated annually among the three cities. The Boston club participated in the first seven exhibitions, from 1887 to 1894. At first all three clubs shared in the preparation for each show.  In the first Joint Exhibition, held in New York City in 1887, Joseph Prince Loud and Horace&amp;nbsp;A. Latimer received the Boston club's only diplomas. In the third Joint Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1889, Boston was represented by Wilfred&amp;nbsp;A. French; Horace Latimer, the club's only award winner; and William Garrison Reed.&lt;ref&gt;Loud, club president 1897&amp;ndash;1901.  In 1884 Reed, club treasurer 1886&amp;ndash;1890, photographed [http://newbern.cpclib.org/digital/reed sites in eastern North Carolina] of interest to the [[List of Massachusetts Civil War units|44th Massachusetts Regiment]], in which he served in the Civil War. He also participated in the club's [https://www.flickr.com/photos/boston_public_library/sets/72157607471461913/comments Old Boston project] of photographing Boston's historic buildings.&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting with the fourth Joint Exhibition in New York City in 1891, collaborative preparation ended and each club individually ran the exhibition in the city in which it was held. In the 1891 exhibition Latimer exhibited the most prints from the Boston club.  The fifth Joint Exhibition, held at the [[Boston Art Club]] in 1892, included 18 prints by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] (1864&amp;ndash;1946) and 45 prints by Boston Camera Club member and Bell telephone pioneer [[Francis Blake (telephone)|Francis Blake, Jr.]] (1850&amp;ndash;1913).  Of the sixth Joint Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1893, Stieglitz said, "It was, without doubt, the finest exhibition of photographs ever held in the United States, and probably was but once excelled in any country."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Stieglitz, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=W13QAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA201 The Joint Exhibition at Philadelphia,"] ''The American Amateur Photographer,'' v. 5, 1893, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the seventh exhibition in 1894, the Boston Camera Club withdrew from the Joint Exhibitions, citing lack of manpower.

===Salon (1900s); Boston Salon (International Exhibition) of Photography, 1932&amp;ndash;1981===

The Boston Camera Club had two series of photography salons, or competitive exhibitions. The first series was held in the first decade of the 20th century, probably for only a few years. Presently only the second salon, held in 1906, has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;"Second Salon of the Boston Camera Club," ''Boston Daily Globe,'' May 13, 1906, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its revival by Horace Latimer's 1931 bequest, in 1932 the club launched a new international competition, the Boston Salon of Photography, held almost annually for the better part of the next five decades.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Art Club and BCC, ''Catalogue of the Third (First International) Salon,'' 1934. The title suggests the salon started in 1932 and had its first overseas competitors in 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1953 it was renamed the Boston International Exhibition of Photography, although informally often still called the Boston Salon. In 1953 as well, the Frank&amp;nbsp;R. Fraprie Memorial Medal was created in recognition of Fraprie's role, along with Horace Latimer, in having kept the club alive in the problem years of 1913&amp;ndash;1930.

Heretofore Boston Camera Club competitions were limited to [[black-and-white]] prints.  Starting in 1954 [[reversal film|color slides]] were accepted in the Boston International Exhibition. From 1959 color prints were admitted.  The 43rd and last exhibition was held in 1981, the club's centenary year. In discontinuing the international exhibitions, again the club cited lack of manpower.  Whereas earlier salons typically received hundreds of entries each, the 1981 exhibition required a man-year of labor to process a total of almost 3,300 prints and slides.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the 1940 9th salon, the club received 1,747 prints from 457 entrants, from which 397 prints by 259 persons were accepted&amp;mdash;although the introductory remarks note these figures were far higher than the norm.  By contrast, in 1981 3,291 entries were received from 788 entrants, of which 768 entries by 457 persons were accepted. The effort was led by former club president (1976&amp;ndash;1979) and honorary member David&amp;nbsp;F. Rodd (1948&amp;ndash;2017) and then-president (1980&amp;ndash;1982) Daniel&amp;nbsp;D.&amp;nbsp;R. Charbonnet.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted entrants in the Boston Salon and International Exhibition over the years included [[A. Aubrey Bodine]] (1906&amp;ndash;1960), who began competing by 1944 and won the Fraprie medal in 1953, 1955 and 1959; Eleanor Parke Custis who was competing by the 9th Salon in 1940; Croatian photographer [[Tošo Dabac]], the 1937 medal winner; Hong Kong-American photography prodigy, actor and director [[Ho Fan]] (Fan Ho) (b. 1937) who first competed in 1954 at age 17; 1940s pictorialist Rowena Fruth (1896&amp;ndash;1983), competing by 1944; lifelong amateur photographer, future United States Senator and Presidential candidate [[Barry Goldwater]] (1909&amp;ndash;1998) who submitted a print in 1940; Wellington Lee who competed 1950&amp;ndash;1981; and Mexican cinema director José Lorenzo Zakany Almada who won the Boston Camera Club Medal in 1968. Exhibition judges included Cecil&amp;nbsp;B. Atwater (1886&amp;ndash;1981); Bodine; [[Leonard Craske]]; Custis; John&amp;nbsp;W. Doscher (d. after 1971); Adolf Fassbender; etcher Arthur William Heintzelman (1891&amp;ndash;1965), first keeper of prints at [[Boston Public Library]]; Franklin&amp;nbsp;I. Jordan; L.&amp;nbsp;Whitney Standish; John&amp;nbsp;H. Vondell (d. circa 1967); and Henry&amp;nbsp;F. Weisenburger.&lt;ref&gt;Atwater was club president from 1942 to at least 1944.

===Guest exhibitors===

From the late 19th to at least the mid-20th century, the Boston Camera Club had exhibitions by prominent outside photographers.  About 1890 it exhibited the work of English photographic pioneer [[Henry Peach Robinson]] (1830&amp;ndash;1901).  In 1896 the club showed work by Alfred Stieglitz, later founder of the [[Photo-Secession]]. Also in 1906, it exhibited 150 photographs by [[Gertrude Käsebier]] (1852&amp;ndash;1934).&lt;ref&gt;''Anthony's Photographic Bulletin,'' 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1899 the club showed work by [[Frances Benjamin Johnston]] (1864–1952).&lt;ref&gt;''Photo Era,'' v. 2, n. 4, March 1899, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; That year it also exhibited the work of [[Clarence White]] (1871&amp;ndash;1925), organized and hung by Fred Holland Day.&lt;ref&gt;Fanning, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;  About this time the club exhibited work by Rudolph Dührkoop (1848&amp;ndash;1918). There were other exhibitions by lesser-known photographers.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 1907 there were exhibitions by C. F. Clarke; Wendell G. Corthell; and Frederick Haven Pratt (1873&amp;ndash;1958) of Worcester, Mass., a physiologist who, like the club's Sarah Choate Sears, was a ''Member'' of the Photo-Secession. See [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830903502.html encycloopedia.com]; Fanning, p. 150. Also shown in 1907 were Civil War photographs by Capt. D.&amp;nbsp;Eldredge. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CfdIAAAAMAAJ American Amateur Photographer and Camera &amp; Dark-room,]'' 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries U.S. camera clubs mounted exhibitions of each other's work.  For example, in 1908 the Boston club exhibited works from the Buffalo (New York), Capitol (Washington DC), and Portland (Maine) Camera Clubs.

In 1940 the Boston Camera Club exhibited the work of [[Edward Weston]] (1886&amp;ndash;1958).&lt;ref&gt;''American Photography.'' January 1941, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1950 it showed work by [[Paul Gittings|Paul Gittings, Sr.]]  In 1953 it exhibited photographs from 1843&amp;ndash;1848 of Scottish pioneers [[David Octavius Hill]] (1802&amp;ndash;1870) and [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] (1821&amp;ndash;1848) ([[Hill &amp; Adamson|Hill and Adamson]]).

===Later exhibitions===

After the Boston Camera Club's revival in 1931, it moved temporarily to 330 Newbury Street, Boston.  It is unknown whether this space had an exhibition room.  The club's permanent facility at 351A Newbury Street, purchased in 1934, had a large gallery.  Public exhibitions of outsiders' work in this period were mentioned; member shows have not been identified.  Since 1980 when the club left no. 351A, it has had no gallery space, all member shows being held at other venues in the Boston area. The Boston Camera Club has had exhibitions at [[Boston City Hall]] in 1993, Griffin Museum of Photography, 1997, Boston's [[Hynes Convention Center]], 2004, art and photo studios,&lt;ref&gt;"Brookline Arts Center Welcomes the Boston Camera Club in a Member Showcase Exhibition," ''Brookline HUB'', Tuesday, March 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and camera stores in the Boston area.

==Education==

In discharging the mandate of its 1887 state charter to promulgate "the knowledge of photography," for most of its existence the Boston Camera Club has sponsored lectures, courses and programs by expert members and guests.  In 1890 member [[Francis Blake (telephone)|Francis Blake,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]] read to the club an important paper on camera [[Shutter (photography)|shutters]], in which he did pioneering work.&lt;ref name="Blake1"&gt;Francis Blake,&amp;nbsp;Jr. "Photographic Shutters." The paper, read before the Boston Camera Club April 14, 1890, is believed to have been Blake's first public description of his achievements in high-speed photography. See Further reading, below.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1895 member Owen A. Eames presented his Eames Animatoscope, an early motion picture device (although one source said: "It is unlikely that projection was attempted.")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorian-cinema.net/when_chrono Who's Who of Victorian Cinema.]  Eames, BCC treasurer 1894&amp;ndash;1896.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1897 Friedrich von Voigtländer, head of the [[Voigtländer|Austrian optical firm]] of that surname, spoke to the club.  In 1904 [[Fred Holland Day]] presented a paper for which he was well known, "Is Photography a Fine Art?"  There were many other lecturers in the club's early years.&lt;ref&gt;Early lecturers at the club included Charles Currier of the Pacific Coast Amateur Photographic Assn. and S. Henry Hooper in 1890,  Philip Clarkson in 1906, animal photographer Ernest Harold Baynes in 1908, and H. R. Jackson in 1909.

Records identifying guest speakers for much of the 20th century have not been studied. In the 1970s and 1980s the Boston Camera Club had presentations by [[Marie Cosindas]] and [[Minor White]]. In the 1990s it sponsored day-long courses by [[Lou Jones (photographer)|Lou Jones]], [[Frans Lanting]], [[John Sexton (photographer)|John Sexton]], and others.  Boston-area professionals such as staff photographers of [[Boston Globe|''The Boston Globe'']] and [[Boston Herald|''The Boston Herald'']], and instructors in Boston's photography colleges, have long been regular club presenters and competition judges. Since the latter 1990s the Boston Camera Club regularly has lectures and field trips in digital photography.

===Other activities===

About 1888 a group of photographers, possibly William Garrison Reed and other members of the Boston Camera Club, undertook the Old Boston project, a "survey of buildings and farms for local archives," whose photographs, owned by the [[Boston Public Library]], were rediscovered in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Marsha Peters and Bernard Mergen, "Doing the Rest: The Uses of Photographs in American Studies," ''American Quarterl,.'' v. 29, n. 3, 1977, p. 281. See a [https://www.flickr.com/photos/boston_public_library/sets/72157607471461913/comments description and illustrations] by the Boston Public Library of several of the Old Boston photos.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1890s members of the club pursued [[stereoscopy]]. [[Magic lantern (projector)|Lantern slides]], the forerunner of 20th-century [[Reversal film|color slides]], were popular as well.  In the 1940s the club undertook "entertainment and instruction of disabled veterans of World War II ... sponsor[ing] a camera club at one of the large Army convalescent hospitals nearby."&lt;ref&gt;Hillyer; see Further reading.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1950s and 1960s the club had a [[Film|movie]] group and owned a [[Böwe Bell &amp; Howell|Bell&amp;nbsp;&amp; Howell]] movie projector.

==Prominent members==

Because the club was founded before amateur photography was widespread, many early members were more advanced practitioners, a handful even making modest advances in photo technology. Even after more consumer-friendly processes came online in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some club members continued to attract notice. Starting no later than the early 1890s, the Boston Camera Club has awarded honorary life membership on two classes of deserving individuals: its own members having given extraordinary service to the club, and outside personalities in the Boston area for signal photographic achievement.

===19th century===

Among the founders of the Boston Society of Amateur Photographers, as the Boston Camera Club was known until 1886, some were noted locally, even nationally.  First permanent vice president of the club James F. Babcock (1844&amp;ndash;1897) was a well-known Boston chemist and science lecturer who held several U.S. patents.  First permanent secretary and treasurer Wilfred A. French, son of [[daguerreotype|daguerreotypist]] Benjamin French, was a Boston photographer and photo supplier, later editor and publisher of ''Photo-Era: The American Journal of Photography,'' one of the leading journals in the field, and a founding member of a group called the National Historic Picture Guild.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred A. French was editor of ''Photo-Era'' from no later than 1908 until 1921. Robinson, p. 126; Steele and Polito, pp. 63, 167.  In 1899 ''Photo-Era'' stated it would be the official organ of both the Boston Camera Club and Harvard University Camera Club. The effort seems to have been short-lived; announcements of BCC activities stopped by 1910. ''Photo-Era,'' v. 2, n. 2, January 1899, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Club co-founder John H. Thurston, whose business was in the same building as the club at 50 Bromfield Street, was a Boston photographic supplier as well.&lt;ref&gt;Steele and Polito, pp. 171, 176.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early vice president Charles Henry Currier (1851&amp;ndash;1938) was a Boston jeweler and commercial photographer also based at 50 Bromfield.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 135 claims: "Of all New England's commercial photographers, the most gifted was Charles H. Currier …"  See also pp. 135&amp;ndash;137, 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent in the early club were Emma J. Fitz,&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Emma J. Fitz," Richard Hines, Jr., "Women and Photography," ''The American Amateur Photographer,'' v. 11, n. 3, March 1899, pp. 122&amp;ndash;123.&lt;/ref&gt; Maine photographic pioneer Emma D. Sewall (1836&amp;ndash;1919),&lt;ref&gt;Abbie Sewall. ''Message through Time: The Photographs of Emma D. Sewall, 1836&amp;ndash;1919.'' Gardiner, ME: Harpwell Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and painter [[Sarah J. Eddy|Sarah Jane Eddy]] (1851&amp;ndash;1945).&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Sarah J. Eddy," Hines, pp. 121&amp;ndash;122.  Eddy, a friend of [[Susan B. Anthony]], painted portraits of her (1901 or 1902) and [[Frederick Douglass]].&lt;/ref&gt; Boston-area electric car manufacturer George Edward Cabot (1861&amp;ndash;1946), an honorary member, was president of the club in 1886&amp;ndash;1890. Another early honorary member was late-19th century traveling lecturer Antonie Stölle, who presented innovative color slide-illustrated lectures on artworks.&lt;ref&gt;"Colored Lantern Slides: Fraulein Stolle's Reproduction of Famous Works of Art: Tones and Colors All Preserved: Process Discovered by Accident after Unavailing Study: Interesting Reminiscences of Work Abroad,"'' [https://www.nytimes.com/1895/11/24/archives/colored-lantern-slides-fraeulein-stolles-reproduction-of-famous.html New York Times,]'' November 24, 1895, p. A20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boston Camera Club counted two astronomers among its members, [[Percival Lowell]] (1855&amp;ndash;1916) and honorary member [[William Henry Pickering]] (1858&amp;ndash;1938), the latter an [[astrophotography|astrophotographer]] who discovered Saturn's moon [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]], worked on faster shutters for nighttime work, and furthered the cause of [[List of women astronomers|women in astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;See Lowell in ''Clark's Boston Blue Book,'' 1895.  For Pickering see Robinson, pp. 106&amp;ndash;107, 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

Painter, photographer, Boston arts patron and club member [[Sarah Choate Sears]] (1858&amp;ndash;1935) was named a ''Member'' of the Photo-Secession by Alfred Stieglitz. In 1899 she had a solo exhibition at the club that included a portrait of [[Julia Ward Howe]]. The same year she showed in the second Boston Arts and Crafts Exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;''Member'' was the lowest of three ranks of Photo-Secession membership, beneath ''Associate'' and ''Fellow.'' See also ''Photo-Era.'' v. 2, n. 4, March 1899. pp. 260&amp;ndash;261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two collaborators of [[Alexander Graham Bell]] were honorary members of the Boston Camera Club.  One is the club's earliest (1892) known honorary member, Prof. Charles "Charlie" Robert Cross (1848–1921), believed to have taught the first [[electrical engineering]] course in the United States, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1882&amp;ndash;1883.  The other was inventor and club vice president [[Francis Blake (telephone)|Francis Blake, Jr.]] (1850&amp;ndash;1913), believed to have substantially helped the club financially in its early years.  Blake's 1877 microphone was critical to Bell's telephone technology; as a camera shutter pioneer he achieved speeds of 1/2,000 second by 1890.&lt;ref&gt;See a portrait of, and a photograph by, Blake in Steele and Polito, facing p. 497.  See also The Francis Blake Laboratory Collection at [http://www.techantiques.com/blake_home_page.htm Techantiques.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515072006/http://www.techantiques.com/blake_home_page.htm# |date=2008-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896 a photographic print by Horace A. Latimer was shown in an exhibition at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. Latimer is the only known Boston Camera Club member published in ''[[Camera Notes]],'' the official publication of [[The Camera Club of New York]], of which he was a member as well.&lt;ref&gt;Two photos by Latimer appeared in ''Camera Notes,'' edited by Alfred Stieglitz&amp;mdash;one in October 1901; the other, "Water Carrier, Cuba" was the frontispiece in October 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthy amateur Boston photographer whose 1931 bequest revived the fortunes of the Boston Camera Club, Latimer is the club's best-remembered early member today. Among his interests were yachting photography and international travel photography.

Boston photographer, publisher, esthete and Boston Camera Club member [[Fred Holland Day]] (1864&amp;ndash;1933), associated for a while with the Photo-Secession, judged at least one exhibition at the Boston Camera Club, in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;An interesting artifact is a photograph copy of a circa-1891 receipt for $15 dues for club membership from Fred Holland Day, signed by F. Alcott Pratt. Collection BCC. Frederick Alcott Pratt (1863&amp;ndash;1910), treasurer of the club (1891&amp;ndash;1893), was a nephew of [[Louisa May Alcott]] and trustee of her literary estate. F. Alcott Pratt. "An Experience with Paper Negatives." ''The American Amateur Photographer,'' v. 1, n. 6, December 1889, pp. 256&amp;ndash;257. See also Fanning, p. 157; Steele and Polito, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===

In the early 20th century three members of the Boston Camera Club were well-known photographic authors and publishers.  Wilfred&amp;nbsp;A. French was mentioned.  The prolific Frank Roy Fraprie (1874&amp;ndash;1951) was head of American Photographic Publishing Co. and editor of annuals [https://books.google.com/books?id=De1IAAAAMAAJ ''The American Amateur Photographer''] and ''American Annual of Photography.''  Honorary member Franklin Ingalls "Pop" Jordan (1876&amp;ndash;1956) was a photographic author and editor.  Another personality, Adolf "Papa" Fassbender (1884&amp;ndash;1980), the German-born New York City-based educator called a "one-man photographic institution," had a career of 72 years training thousands in photography.  Another noted photographer was [[Lillian Baynes Griffin]], an ''associate,'' or corresponding, member of the club, who joined in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;For Fraprie see Robinson, pp. 185, 186. For Fassbender see Christian A. Peterson [et al.?], ''The Pictorial Artistry of Adolf Fassbender.'' [Intl. Photography Hall of Fame and Museum?], 1994.  BCC minutes, 1906, record Griffin joining the club.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boston Camera Club had members who were non-photographic artists of note practicing photography secondarily. They included [[Gloucester Fisherman's Memorial]] sculptor [[Leonard Craske]] (KRASK) (1882&amp;ndash;1950); honorary member and prolific Cape Ann, Massachusetts artist, photographer and author Samuel V. Chamberlain (1895&amp;ndash;1975) who wrote at least 45 photograph-illustrated travel books;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, pp. 193&amp;ndash;194, 221.&lt;/ref&gt; painter [[Emil Gruppe|Emil Albert Gruppé]] (1896&amp;ndash;1978); and post-Secessionist photographer and watercolorist Eleanor Parke Custis (1897&amp;ndash;1983).&lt;ref&gt;Jack Wright. "PSA Personalities: Eleanor Parke Custis, FPSA." ''Journal of the Photographic Soc. of America,'' v. 11, n. 10, December 1945, pp. 549&amp;ndash;550.  ''Eleanor Parke Custis, 1897&amp;ndash;1983: Retrospective Exhibition, May 24 &amp;ndash; June 21, 1986,'' Cambridge, MA: James R. Bakker Antiques, circa 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur photographer, photographic author and publisher, and honorary club member Arthur Hammond (1880–1962) won top prize from organizers of the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] for his photo of the fair's icons, the [[Trylon and Perisphere]].  Architect, amateur photographer, author and honorary member L. Whitney "Whit" Standish (1919&amp;ndash;?) was an influential member of the club who helped organize its weekly meetings, competitions, educational courses, and newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Hammond, "Semi-Lunar," silver gelatin print, circa 1939, collection BCC.  L.&amp;nbsp;Whitney Standish, club president 1939&amp;ndash;1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most well-known figures in 20th century photography, U.S. [[List of National Medal of Science laureates|National Medal of Science]] (1973) recipient, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, and Boston Camera Club honorary member [[Harold Eugene Edgerton|Harold Eugene "Doc" Edgerton]] (1903&amp;ndash;1990) greatly advanced the photographic [[Strobe light|strobe]], achieving exposure times of one-millionth of a second, and took the well-known [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine photographs of a bullet penetrating an apple and an impact crown of milk droplets. Lesser known are his night aerial strobe work for the Allied [[Normandy invasion|D-Day]] invasion in World War II, co-founding defense contractor [[EG&amp;G]], and undersea explorations with [[Jacques Cousteau]].&lt;ref&gt;Harold Eugene Edgerton, ''[http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Harold_E._Edgerton Engineering and Technology History Wiki.]''  Roger R.

EG&amp;G, the 'E' in whose name denoted 'E'dgerton, is now [[URS Corporation|URS Federal Services]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At least five persons named Boston Camera Club honorary members in the 1970s&amp;ndash;2000s had achievements of note.  [[Bradford Washburn|H. Bradford Washburn, Jr.]] (1910&amp;ndash;2007) was a mountaineer, cartographer, aerial photographer, and longtime first director of the [[Boston Museum of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Katharine Wroth, "High Art: The Astonishing Life &amp; Work of Brad Washburn," ''Appalachian Mountain Club Outdoors (AMC Outdoors),'' March 2004, pp. 26&amp;ndash;33.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Photojournalism|Photojournalist]] Arthur Leo Griffin (1903&amp;ndash;2001) was the best-known photographer of New England scenes in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Griffin had photographs on the cover of [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] and [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]; had the first color photos in [[Boston Globe|''The Boston Globe'']], [[Saturday Evening Post|''The Saturday Evening Post'']] and [[Yankee (magazine)|''Yankee'']]; published photograph books on New England in collaboration with well-known authors; and in 1992 opened his Boston-area [http://griffinmuseum.org Griffin Museum of Photography].&lt;/ref&gt; Aeronautical engineer Henry&amp;nbsp;F. Weisenburger (b. 1924), who has practiced photography since the 1940s and who joined the club in 1954, is arguably the longest-active living exponent of amateur photography in New England, having instructed many in the field.  In 1959 Leslie&amp;nbsp;A. Campbell was founder of Massachusetts Camera Naturalists. Lou Jones (b. 1945) is a Boston-based commercial, [[Olympic Games]] and jazz photographer; photojournalist whose books include ''Final Exposure: Portraits from Death Row'' (1996); and photography educator.&lt;ref&gt;Henry&amp;nbsp;F. Weisenburger, club president 1965&amp;ndash;1967.  Lou Jones, "Final Exposure: Portraits from Death Row," [http://www.ncaaa.org The Museum of The National Center of Afro-American Artists], 2003.

==Today==

As it has for most of its existence, the Boston Camera Club meets weekly. Meetings are held at 1773 Beacon Street, Brookline, Massachusetts every Tuesday evening from September to June. Guests are welcome.

The club's primary emphasis is on [[digital photography]]. Activities range from beginner to advanced and comprise education, print competitions and critique,&lt;ref&gt;In gratitude to Horace A. Latimer's 1931 bequest, the club's print critiques are held under the name Horace A. Latimer Print Group.&lt;/ref&gt; a live-model portrait studio, field trips, and inter-club competitions. Outside speakers and competition judges are regularly invited.  The club communicates through its website and newsletter, ''The Reflector,'' launched in 1938 and now published electronically.

The Boston Camera Club, a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit educational corporation registered in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is a member of [http://neccc.org New England Camera Club Council] (NECCC) and [http://www.psa-photo.org Photographic Society of America] (PSA).

Early records of the Boston Camera Club, from 1881 to 1942, are held by the [[Boston Athenaeum]] and are available to researchers by appointment.

The '''Centenary of Western Australia Women's Suffrage Memorial''' is located in the Western Australia Botanic Garden, within [[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park]] in [[Perth, Western Australia]]. It commemorates the hundredth anniversary of women achieving the right to vote equally with men in Western Australian elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.net.au/2010/07/26/centenary-of-wa-womens-suffrage-memorial/|title=Centenary of WA Women’s Suffrage Memorial|last=AWHF|website=Australian Women's History Forum|access-date=2016-03-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311131254/http://womenshistory.net.au/2010/07/26/centenary-of-wa-womens-suffrage-memorial/|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial was commissioned during plans for commemorating the centenary of women's suffrage in Western Australia, and was designed by artist Tony Jones.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/culture/community/display/102021-centenary-of-women%2560s-suffrage-|title=Centenary of Women`s Suffrage Monument Australia|last=Design|first=UBC Web|website=monumentaustralia.org.au|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed by students from the Western Australia School of Art and Design and installed in 1999.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Chase Vault''' is a [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]] in the cemetery of the [[Christ Church Parish Church]] in [[Oistins]], [[Christ Church Parish, Barbados|Christ Church]], [[Barbados]], best known for a widespread legend of "mysterious moving [[coffin]]s". According to the story, each time the heavily sealed vault was opened in the early 19th century for burial of a family member, all of the lead coffins had changed position. The facts of the story are unverified, and skeptics call the tale "historically dubious".&lt;ref name=Skeptoid&gt;{{Skeptoid | id=4399 | number= 399| title=The Moving Coffins of Barbados|date=2014-01-28|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The story==
The first published version of the story appeared in 1833 in [[James Edward Alexander]]'s ''Transatlantic Sketches''. According to Alexander, a Mrs. Goddard was buried in the vault in 1807, followed in 1808 by Ann Maria Chase, and in 1812 by Dorcas Chase. When the vault was opened in late 1812 for the burial of Thomas Chase, the caskets of the Chase girls were said to be found "in a confused state, having been apparently tossed from their places." Alexander wrote that when the vault was later opened "to receive the body of another infant, the four coffins, all of lead, all very heavy, were much disturbed" and that similar disturbances were found when opening the vault for burials in 1816 and 1819:&lt;ref name="Alexander1833"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir James Edward Alexander|title=Transatlantic sketches, comprising visits to the most interesting scenes in North and South America, and the West Indies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t74NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=24 July 2012|year=1833|publisher=R. Bentley|pages=162–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Each time that the vault was opened the coffins were replaced in their proper situations, that is, three on the ground side by side, and the others laid on them. The vault was then regularly closed; the door (a massive stone which required six or seven men to move) was cemented by masons; and though the floor was of sand there were no marks of footsteps or water. The last time the vault was opened was in 1819. [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Lord Combermere]] was then present, and the coffins were found confusedly thrown about the vault, some with their heads down and others up. What could have occasioned this phenomenon? In no other vault in the island has this ever occurred. Was it an earthquake which occasioned it, or the effects of an inundation in the vault?}}

Different versions of the story appeared over the years, with other accounts published in 1844 and 1860.&lt;ref name="Clark1999" /&gt;

==The origins==
According to author [[Jerome Clark]], the story of the Chase Vault appears to originate from anecdotes told by Thomas H. Orderson, Rector of Christ Church during the 1800s. Orderson gave "conflicting accounts" of the tale, each containing variations. Clark says the story was subsequently repeated in Alexander's 1833 ''Transatlantic Sketches,'' and further repeated the same year in the "Anecdote Gallery" section of [[Reuben Percy]]'s ''The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.''&lt;ref name="Percy1833"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reuben Percy|title=The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7boRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=14 May 2012|year=1833|publisher=J. Limbird|pages=51–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1999"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark says that most stories that proliferated about the Chase Vault referred back to sources that could be traced to one of Orderson's accounts, and that folklorist [[Andrew Lang]] identified the differing versions told by Orderson in a December 1907 article published in ''[[The Folklore Society#Publications|Folk-Lore Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TkgKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP15&amp;dq=December+1907+issue+of+Folklore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W1DZUtiBDcWTyQHJiIGwDA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=December%201907%20issue%20of%20Folklore&amp;f=false A Lang "Death's Deeds A bi-located Story" Folk Lore December 1907 pp. 376–90]]&lt;/ref&gt; After combing through existing documentation to determine the veracity of the Chase Vault stories, Lang reported that he could find nothing to substantiate them, either in the burial register of Christ Church or in contemporary [[List of newspapers in Barbados|newspapers]] on Barbados, aside from an "unpublished firsthand account" by a Nathan Lucas, who claimed to be present at the opening of the vault in April 1820.&lt;ref name="Clark1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerome Clark|title=Unexplained!: Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences &amp; Puzzling Physical Phenomena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szFLs6pQmsQC&amp;pg=PA573|accessdate=14 May 2012|year=1999|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=978-1-57859-070-4|pages=573–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masonic allegory==
[[Skepticism|Skeptical]] investigator [[Joe Nickell]] said that stories about the Chase Vault were often repeated, but he called them "historically dubious."&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe; 1982. "Barbados' restless coffins laid to rest." ''[[Fate Magazine|Fate]],'' Part I, 35.4 (April): 50–56; Part II, 35.5 (May): 79–86&lt;/ref&gt; Nickell, who had investigated an earlier alleged Masonic hoax involving a tale of buried treasure at [[Oak Island]], contended that the Barbados story was fashioned around the Masonic allegory of a "secret vault" which, according to a Masonic text, "was ... in the ancient mysteries, symbolic of death, where alone Divine Truth is to be found." Nickell wrote that two of the men named in the Chase Vault story were [[Freemasonry|members of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons]], and that a similar tale of "restless coffins" was circulated in 1943 that specifically included a party of Freemasons and a vault containing the founder of Freemasonry in Barbados.&lt;ref name="Nickell2001"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nickell noted that Chase Vault stories were loaded with symbols and phrases which [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] would have recognized.&lt;ref name="Nickell2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Nickell|title=Real-Life X-Files: Investigating the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Bm-EjjG3AwC|accessdate=14 May 2012|date=24 October 2001|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2210-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chew Chew Baby''''' is a Harveytoon banned short in the [[Noveltoons|Noveltoon]] series made by [[Famous Studios]] for release in 1958. It was directed by [[Isadore Sparber]] from a story by [[Irving Spector]]. [[Jackson Beck]] and [[Jack Mercer]] provide uncredited voices. [[Cannibalism]] is the theme of this film, in which seven characters are attacked (six get swallowed) by a [[pygmy]] after he tracks a tourist to [[Cincinnati]].

This cartoon was syndicated to television several years after it was released to theaters. It appeared on children's programs until protests about its violence induced station managers to keep it off the air. It has since achieved [[cult classic]] status.

This film shows a strong [[Tex Avery]] influence, and copies Avery's [[blood transfusion]] gag from ''[[Crazy Mixed Up Pup]]''.

[[Image:Corpod'aria.jpg|thumb|260px|"Corpo d'Aria", 1960.]]
'''''Corpo d'aria''''' ("Body of Air"; plural ''Corpi d'aria'') is an [[artist's multiple]] by the Italian artist [[Piero Manzoni]]. Manufactured between October 1959 and March 1960, the pieces are a box, a tripod base, a deflated balloon and a mouthpiece. 45 copies were made and sold at 30,000 [[Italian lira|lire]] each.  Originally, any buyer could ask Manzoni to inflate the balloon himself, but would be charged an extra [[Deutschmark]] for every litre of air expanded. When fully expanded, the balloons measured 80&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Piero Manzoni Catalogue Raisoné, Battino &amp; Palazzoli&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public presentation==
The ''Corpi d'aria'' were first exhibited at the Galleria Azimut, run by Manzoni and his friend, the Italian artist Enrico Castellani, from May 3 to May 9, 1960. Manzoni organised an elaborate photo shoot  and a short film to publicise the event. He was to write later in the year that the bodies had sold well.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Heinz Mack, quoted in ''Piero Manzoni Catalog Generale'', vol 1, Celant, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

By making a purely transient work, that would deflate before the buyer’s eyes, Manzoni was parodying the traditional sculptural emphasis on permanence and mocking the traditional emphasis on the artist’s creative force. He was also using modern materials to suggest an aggressively modern aesthetic whilst creating a poetic metaphor for the transience of life itself.

== Related works==

===''Fiato d’artista''===

The most famous related work is the ''Fiato d’artista'' (''Artist’s Breath''), involving red, blue or white balloons inflated by Manzoni himself, closed with string and lead, with the name "Piero Manzoni" punched into it, then attached to a wooden base with a plaque on it using [[gesso]]. The pieces were made in 1960, and 11 examples are known to have survived, although all are now in an extreme state of decomposure. When exhibited now, the works inevitably assume the aura of a modern [[memento mori]],&lt;ref&gt;''Manzoni at the Serpentine Gallery'', London, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a rotting plastic membrane stuck to a polished wooden base, with a brass plaque commemorating the original act.

===Placentarium===
The largest variation on the theme was a giant double-skinned Placentarium, filled with compressed air to keep the balloon inflated. Manzoni designed especially for the projection of [[Otto Piene]]'s ''Light Ballets'', but also referred to the building housing a giant maze, made up of 60 cells controlled by "an electric brain".&lt;ref&gt;"Placentarium" typescript published in ''Piero Manzoni, Catalogo Generale'', Celant, Prearo Editions&lt;/ref&gt; Equipped with 73 alcoves for viewers, the Placentarium was intended to be silver on the outside and white internally. Designs and a photograph of a small architectural model survive.&lt;ref&gt;''Manzoni'', Celant, Electa 2007 pp. 242-245&lt;/ref&gt;

Manzoni simultaneously planned a series of public sculptures, of balloons 2.5&amp;nbsp;m diameter, to be installed in parks. These were to be fitted with air compressor to slowly pulsate ‘with a slow unsynchronized rhythm of breathing.’ He never took this idea further than a small experimental version.

The final experiment was for a sphere held suspended by a jet of air. Again, this never advanced beyond a small experimental [[maquette]], but emphasises Manzoni’s conception of balloons representing freedom and weightlessness.

== Influences ==

Manzoni is known to have been heavily influenced by [[Yves Klein]],&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p82&lt;/ref&gt; who had released 1001 blue balloons on the opening night of his "Proposition: Monochrome" exhibition at [[Iris Clert]]’s gallery, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Weitemeier, Taschen 2001, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andy Warhol]] would later use balloons in a similar way, but filled with helium rather than suspended in a stream of compressed air. Indeed, his first balloon, made in 1965, corresponded to an unfulfilled project described by Manzoni in a letter as ‘a cluster of pneumatic cylinders, elongated in shape, like steel, which would vibrate in the blowing of the wind.’&lt;ref&gt;''Paintings &amp; Sculptures, The Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonne'' 02B, Phaidon, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; [[Damien Hirst]] has used ping pong balls suspended in compressed air, but within the context of floating above a bed of sharp knives or a skeleton.

His most lasting influence, however, was on [[Arte Povera]], a group of Italian artists, including [[Luciano Fabro]] and [[Alighiero e Boetti]], who brought everyday materials into their work in a movement analogous to contemporary radical politics. (see [[Protests of 1968]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10454 MoMA.org | The Collection | Arte Povera&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cosmatesque''', or Cosmati, is a style of geometric decorative [[inlay]] stonework typical of the architecture of [[Medieval]] [[Italy]], and especially of [[Rome]] and its surroundings, and derived from that of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. It was used most extensively for the decoration of church floors, but was also used to decorate church walls, [[pulpit]]s, and [[Cathedra|bishop's thrones]]. The name derives from the [[Cosmati]], the leading family workshop of [[marble]] craftsmen in Rome who created such geometrical decorations. The style spread across Europe, where it was used in the most prestigious churches; the high altar of [[Westminster Abbey]], for example, is decorated with a Cosmatesque marble floor.&lt;ref&gt;Maev Kennedy, 'Carpet of stone: medieval mosaic pavement revealed' [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/05/archaeology.art], [[The Guardian]], 5 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cultureshow/videos/2009/08/s6_e5_cosmati/index.shtml BBC - The Culture Show - Cosmati Pavement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description and early history ==
[[File:TerracinaDuomoInternoPavimentoCosmatesco1.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Typical ''opus alexandrinum'' [[guilloche]] floor in Cosmati style from the Cathedral at [[Terracina]].]]
The Cosmatesque style takes its name from the family of the [[Cosmati]], which flourished in Rome during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and practiced the art of mosaic. The Cosmati work has this peculiarity, that it is a glass mosaic used in combination with marble. At times it is inlaid on the white marble [[architrave]]s of doors, on the [[frieze]]s of [[cloisters]], the [[Fluting (architecture)|fluting]]s of columns, and on [[sepulchral]] monuments. Again, it frames panels, of [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] or other marbles, on pulpits, [[Cathedra|episcopal chairs]], screens, etc., or is itself used as a panel. The color is brilliant — gold [[tesserae]] being freely used. While more frequent in Rome than elsewhere, its use is not confined to that city. Among other places it is found in the [[Cappella Palatina]] in [[Palermo]]. Just what its connection may be with the southern art of Sicily has yet to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpted from ''A dictionary of architecture and building, biographical, historical, and descriptive'' by [[Russell Sturgis]] (1836-1909), published 1901 and out of copyright [https://archive.org/details/adictionaryarch02sturgoog]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Cosmati of 12th Century Rome are the [[eponym]]ous craftsmen of the style, they do not seem to have been the first to develop the art. A similar style may be seen in the pavement of the [[Benedictine]] abbey of [[Monte Cassino]] (1066-1071), built using workers from [[Constantinople]], making it likely that the geometric style was heavily influenced by [[Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East|Byzantine floor mosaics]]. However, the technique is different because Cosmati floors were made from many different size and shape pieces of stone, a technique quite different from [[opus tessellatum]] mosaics where the patterns are made from small units which are all the same size and shape. The stone used by the cosmati artists were salvaged material from the ruins of ancient Roman buildings, the large roundels being the carefully cut cross sections of Roman [[columns]].&lt;ref&gt;Paloma Pajares-Ayuela: ''Cosmatesque Ornament'', W. W. Norton, 2002, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, this style of inlaid ornamental mosaic was "introduced into the decorative art of Europe during the twelfth century by a marble-worker named Laurentius [also known as "Lorenzo Cosmati"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RdkjAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA393&amp;dq=A+dictionary+of+architecture+and+building:+biographical+...,+Volume+1++By+Russell+Sturgis&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A dictionary of architecture and building'', p.691 ''Cosmati'']&lt;/ref&gt;], a native of Anagni, a small hill-town thirty-seven miles east-south-east of Rome. Laurentius acquired his craft from Greek masters and for a time followed their method of work, but early in his career developed an original style. Freeing himself from Byzantine traditions and influences, Laurentius's style evolved into a decorative architectural mosaic, vigorous in colour and design, which he employed in conjunction with plain or sculpted marble surfaces.

"As a rule he used white or light-coloured marbles for his backgrounds; these he inlaid with squares, parallelograms, and circles of darker marble, porphyry, or serpentine, surrounding them with ribbons of mosaic composed of coloured and gold-glass tesseræ. These harlequinads he separated one from another with marble mouldings, carvings, and flat bands, and further enriched them with mosaic. His earliest recorded work was executed for a church at Fabieri in 1190, and the earliest existing example is to be seen in the church of Ara Coeli at Rome. It consists of an epistle and gospel ambo, a chair, screen, and pavement.

"In much of his work he was assisted by his son, Jacobus, who was not only a sculptor and mosaic-worker, but also an architect of ability, as witness the architectural alterations carried out by him in the [[cathedral of Civita Castellana]], a foreshadowing of the Renaissance. This was a work in which other members of his family took part, and they were all followers of the craft for four generations. Those attaining eminence in their art are named in the following genealogical epitome: Laurentius (1140-1210); Jacobus (1165-1234); Luca (1221-1240); Jacobus (1213-1293); Deodatus (1225-1294); Johannes (1231-1303)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]], ''Cosmati Mosaic''.

==Terminology==
[[File:Raffael Stanza della Segnatura.jpg|thumb|260px|Stanza della Segnatura.]]
Cosmatesque work is also known as '''''opus alexandrinum'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Paloma Pajares-Ayuela: ''Cosmatesque Ornament'', W. W. Norton, 2002, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Definitions of this term, and the distinction between it and ''[[opus sectile]]'', vary somewhat. Some restrict ''opus alexandrinum'' to the typical large designs, especially for floors, using white [[guilloche]] patterns filled in with roundels and bands in coloured designs using small pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, Jane, ''Historic floors: their history and conservation'', Butterworth-Heinemann, 1998, {{ISBN|0-7506-2765-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7506-2765-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BLmUOhBgmawC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=Laurentius+of+Anagni&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rbtYcv5ZYf&amp;sig=bxfu4KabhbniH2in8AhNhmHAabs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=catvSqizDZ3SjAffyfCZBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others include any geometric design including large pieces, as in the picture from Spoleto (right side) below, whereas ''opus sectile'' also includes figurative designs made in the same technique.

''Opus alexandrinum'' is another form of ''[[opus sectile]]'', where but few colors are used, such as white and black, or dark green on a red ground, or vice versa. This term is particularly employed to designate a species of geometrical mosaic, found in combination with large slabs of marble, much used on the pavements of medieval Roman churches and even in Renaissance times, as, for instance, on the pavements of the [[Sistine Chapel]] and the stanza of the [[Raphael Rooms#Stanza della Segnatura|Segnatura]].

==Examples in Rome==
Among the churches decorated in cosmatesque style in Rome, the most noteworthy are [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[St. John Lateran]], [[San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]], [[San Saba (Rome)|San Saba]], [[San Paolo fuori le Mura]], [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli]], [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]], [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], [[San Crisogono]],&lt;ref&gt;MIchela Cigola, Mosaici pavimentali cosmateschi. Segni, disegni e simboli, in "Palladio" Nuova serie anno VI n. 11, giugno 1993; pp. 101-110.&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Clemente]], [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]], and the [[Sixtine Chapel]] and the [[Stanza della Segnatura]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Outside Rome, [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]], [[Subiaco, Lazio|Subiaco]], [[Anagni]], [[Ferentino]], [[Terracina]] and [[Tarquinia]] contain remarkable cosmatesque works. Also, Cosmati built innovative decoration for the [[Cathedral of Civita Castellana]].

'''The Edison Awards''' are a set of 16 awards that honor excellence in technological innovation, new product and service development, marketing, and human-centered design. The Edison awards are sometimes referred to as "The Oscars of Innovation" and are given annually by Edison Universe, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to fostering innovators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Edison Awards Honor Innovation in Technology|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sebastian-howard/edison-awards-innovation_b_846402.html|website = Huffington Post|accessdate = 2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Awards are named after innovator [[Thomas Alva Edison]] (1847-1931) and symbolize the persistence and excellence in innovation personified by him. Award winners represent game-changing products, services and excellence and leadership in innovation around four criteria: Concept, Value, Delivery and Impact. Additionally, Edison Green Awards and Edison Achievement Awards are bestowed each year. Originally established in 1987 by the [[American Marketing Association]], The Edison Awards became an independent organization and part of the Edison Universe non-profit organization in 2008. 

==The Edison Award==
Annually, beginning in September, nominations are sought from product and service innovators in fifteen categories. A nomination fee of ~$1000 is required, and then nominations are vetted by members of the Edison Award Steering Committee, who present a slate of finalists to the Panel of Judges. The panel is composed of over 3,000 senior business executives and academics from across the nation, whose votes acknowledge excellence in meeting the award criteria - concept, value, delivery and impact.

Awards are presented at an annual black-tie gala event, usually held each April. Past gala events have been held in New York, NY, Chicago, IL, and San Francisco, CA. Gold, Silver, and Bronze awards are given in each category.&lt;ref&gt;Sonali Basak, [http://techli.com/2013/04/edison-awards-highlight-innovation-across-american-industry-titans/ "Edison awards highlight innovation across American industry titans"], ''Techli.com'', April 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edison Universe Scholarships==
A percentage of every Edison Awards nomination and gala event goes to fund '''Edison Universe Scholarships''', a non-profit program focused on fostering innovation of youth by promoting innovation concepts through curriculum and educational programs. Additionally, the organization connects representatives from past Edison Award winning companies and Edison Achievement Award honorees with students to provide mentoring and internship opportunities.

{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}}
The bibliographical definition of an '''edition''' includes all copies of a [[book]] printed “from substantially the same setting of [[typesetting|type]],” including all minor [[typography|typographical]] variants.

The numbering of book editions is a special case of the wider field of [[revision control]]. The traditional conventions for numbering book editions evolved spontaneously for several centuries before any greater [[applied science]] of revision control became important to humanity, which did not occur until the era of widespread [[computing]] had arrived (when [[software]] and [[electronic publishing]] came into existence). The old and new aspects of book edition numbering (from before and since the advent of computing) are discussed below. 

=={{anchor|first}} First edition &lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt;==
{{Redirect|First edition}}
[[File:UncleTomsCabinCover.jpg|thumb|rioght|180px|Title-page illustration by [[Hammatt Billings]] for ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', First Edition: Boston: [[John P. Jewett]] and Company, 1852]]

According to the definition of ''edition'' above, a book printed today, by the same [[publisher]], and from the same type as when it was first published, is still the ''first edition'' of that book to a [[bibliographer]]. However, [[book collector]]s generally use the term ''first edition'' to mean specifically the first [[#Print run|print run]] of the first edition (aka "first edition, first impression"). Since World War II, books often include a number line ([[printer's key]]) that indicates the print run.

A "first edition" per se is not a valuable collectible book. A popular work may be published and reprinted over time by many publishers, and in a variety of formats. There will be a first edition of each, which the publisher may cite on the copyright page, such as: "First mass market paperback edition". The first edition of a facsimile reprint is the reprint publisher's first edition, but not the first edition of the work itself.

The Independent Online Booksellers Association has a [http://www.ioba.org/pages/resources/first-edition-primer/ A First Edition Primer ] which discusses several aspects of identifying first editions including publishing and specific publishers way of designating first editions.

===Bibliographical definition===
The classic explanation of edition was given by [[Fredson Bowers]] in ''Principles of Bibliographical Description'' (1949). Bowers wrote that an edition is “the whole number of copies printed at any time or times from substantially the same setting of type-pages,” including “all issues and variant states existing within its basic type-setting, as well as all impressions.”

Publishers often use the same typesetting for the [[hardcover]] and [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] versions of a book. These books have different covers, the [[title page]] and copyright page may differ, and the page margin sizes may differ (same ''type area'', smaller ''trim''), but to a bibliographer they are the same edition.

From time to time, readers may observe an error in the text (or, in the days of metal type, a piece of broken type), and report these to the publisher. The publisher typically keeps these "reprint corrections" in a file pending demand for a new print run of the edition, and before the new run is printed, they will be entered.

The method of entry, obviously, depends on the method of typesetting. For [[Letterpress printing|letterpress metal]], it typically meant resetting a few characters or a line or two. For [[Linotype machine|linotype]], it meant casting a new line for any line with a change in it. With film, it involved cutting out a bit of the film and inserting a new bit. In an electronic file, it means entering the changes digitally.

Such minor changes do not constitute a new edition, but introduce typographical variations within an edition, which are of interest to collectors.

===Collectors' definition===
[[File:Tristram Shandy First edition spines.jpg|thumb|First editions of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]] ]]
A common complaint of book collectors is that the bibliographer's definition is used in a book-collecting context. For example, [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' {{asof|2016|lc=y}} remains in print in hardcover. The type is the same as the 1951 first printing, therefore all hardcover copies are, for the bibliographer, the first edition. Collectors would use the term for the first printing only.

First edition most often refers to the first commercial publication of a work between its own covers, even if it was first printed in a periodical: the complete text of [[Ernest Hemingway]]’s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' appeared in the September 1, 1952 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', yet the generally accepted “first” edition is the hardcover book [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]’s published on September 8, 1952.

The term "first trade edition," refers to the earliest edition of a book offered for sale to the general public in book stores. For example, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' was published in two variant forms. A "Sustainers' Edition", published by the Jungle Publishing Company, was sent to subscribers who had advanced funds to Sinclair. The first trade edition was published by [[Doubleday, Page]] to be sold in bookstores.

Many book collectors place maximum value on the earliest bound copies of a book—promotional [[advance copy|advance copies]], bound galleys, uncorrected proofs, and advance reading copies sent by publishers to book reviewers and [[bookstore|booksellers]]. It is true that these are rarer than the production copies; but given that these were not printed from a different setting of type (just the opposite; the main purpose of galleys and proofs is to double-check the typeset matter that will be used for production), they are not different editions.

===Publishers' definitions===
Publishers use "first edition" according to their own purposes, and consequently among them the designation is used very inconsistently. The "first edition" of a trade book may be the first iteration of the work printed by the publisher in question or the first iteration of the work that includes a specific set of illustrations or editorial commentary.

Publishers of non-fiction, academic works, and [[textbook]]s generally distinguish between revisions of the text of the work, by typically citing the dates of the first and latest editions of the work in the copyright page. Exceptions to this [[rule of thumb]] include denominating as a "second edition" a new textbook that has a different format, title, and/or author(s) because a previous textbook that shares only the same subject matter as the "second edition" is considered the first edition. The reason for this stretch of the definition is often for the short-term marketing advantage of the new textbook, because, although first editions are often considered more valuable than later editions to book collectors, being a subsequent edition of a previous textbook gives the impression that the textbook denominated as a subsequent edition is more authoritative.

==Other types of editions==

=== Revised edition ===
Publishers sometimes denominate a new iteration of a work a "revised edition" or the "(N)th edition, revised" when the previous iteration has been editorially revised or updated yet the author or publisher does not want to denominate it the "(N+1)th edition" ("N" being the number of the previous edition) for some subjective reason. Conversely, a new iteration of a work that is not substantially different may be denominated a "new edition" or the "(N+1)th edition".

The qualitative difference between a "revised edition" and a "new edition" is subjective. This is analogous to the way that software publishers may denominate an iteration "version 3.7" and the subsequent updated iteration "version 4" instead of "version 3.8". The subjective judgment of the ''degree'' of [[Software versioning#Change significance|the significance of the change]] made with the new iteration or the perceived marketing advantage of designating the new iteration as a specific number determines how the new iteration is numbered.

Therefore, the designation "revised edition" does not designate any quality or quantity of revision with certainty.

===Revised and updated edition===
When a non-fiction book is first published it sometimes instigates more research on its subject. The author may determine that new information justifies the revision of the book. A new iteration of the book would be published as a new edition, which may be denominated a "revised and updated edition". However, as with the denomination of "revised edition", the use of "revised and updated edition" manifests only the subjective choice of the publisher, which may be different from the publisher of a previous "revised edition" of the same work.

=== Co-edition &lt;!-- Section linked from Horus Heresy (novels) --&gt; ===
The basic definition of a ''co-edition'' is when two publishing houses publish the same edition of a book (or equivalent versions of an edition, for example, translated versions), simultaneously or near-simultaneously, usually in different countries. English and American editions may [[American and British English spelling differences|differ in spelling]], and they [[list of works with different titles in the United Kingdom and United States|sometimes have different titles]]. Some examples:
* An English-language edition, from the same plates, films, or files, may be published in different anglophone countries by different publishing companies. For example, Arms &amp; Armour Press in the UK and Stackpole Books in the U.S. published co-editions of various monographs on military matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leventhal|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A French-language novel published in France this year by a French publisher could become an English-language translation published in the U.S. next year by a U.S. publisher.

The logic of co-editions has often been to use the existing distribution systems of the different publishers in each country rather than establishing new distribution systems.

Advancing [[Information technology|IT]] and the globalization of publishing have been blurring the lines of what ''co-edition'' means. For example, anything published online is effectively published worldwide. Also, large multinational publishers now have existing distribution systems for their hardcopy books in many countries, so they don't need to partner with other companies. They may issue a book under a different imprint for each country, but the imprints are parts of the same parent corporation. The actual manufacturing of the books may be done in China regardless of where the copies will be sold.

=== e-dition ===
The term ''e-dition'', a play on the [[Internet-related prefixes#"E-"|''e-''for-electronic prefix]], has been used by various publishers to refer to various ideas, which include:
* The hardcopy book's content posted online, fully searchable
* Supplemental online-only content for buyers of the hardcopy book
* Online-only publishing (no hardcopy distribution)
* Proprietary-format digital publication ([[e-book]]s) for use in specialized hardware for reading the book ([[e-book reader]]s)

===Library edition===
A library edition may appear to be the same as copies appearing in shops and almost certainly uses the same setting. However, the binding and hinges are made extra strong to allow for the greater wear and tear in library books. This is analogous to the "police and taxi" packages for automobiles, in which heavier brakes and other upgrades are made to withstand harsher-than-standard use and longer [[duty cycle]]s.

===Book club edition===
A popular book is sometimes re-issued under the imprint of a [[Book sales club|book club]]. Often it is a new setting and with cheaper paper and binding. Any photographic illustrations in the original are either absent or reduced in number. Book club editions are sold to members at a good discount compared with the original issue price.

===Cheap edition===
After a book has exhausted the market at the high original price a publisher may issue a cheap edition themselves or sell the rights on to another publisher who will produce the book. A cheap edition typically uses a low-cost paper and is a paperback but they can be hardback. Also typically the size of the font is reduced to fit more words on a page to reduce the overall cost of the book. Naturally, for a cheap edition the author will receive a lower royalty but that may be compensated for by a greater volume of sales.

===Colonial edition===

During the peak of the [[British Empire]], cheap editions of novels published in Britain would often be produced for sale in the colonies before other editions of the books were sold. The rationale was that books took a long time to export to the colonies, that readership in those settlements was avid, and that books were an effective means to disseminate British values. Australia was by far the largest consumer of colonial editions. [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] (London) published the largest number of colonial edition titles. They began in 1843 and persisted (in terms of pricing and trade) until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Johanson, ''A study of colonial editions in Australia, 1843-1972''. Elibank Press, Wellington, New Zealand. {{ISBN|0958349630}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cadet edition===
A cadet edition is a cut down version of a book which is more simply written. It is intended for young readers rather than adults.

===Large print edition===
These editions are typically library editions but the font size of the text is much larger than usual so that persons with poor eyesight (often older persons) can more easily read the book. The [[large print]] books tend to be of a uniform size.

===Critical edition===
A critical edition is a scholarly publication, containing commentary, critique, and sometimes a full developmental history of the work from all available sources.

&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Krishnamurti's Notebook#Publication history]] [[The First and Last Freedom#Publication history]] ([[MOS:HEAD]]).--&gt;
A batch of identical copies of an iteration/edition of a work that is printed in the same, single execution of the production set-up is denominated a "print run", "printing run", "printing", "impression", or "press run" according to the subjective choice of the publisher. All these denominations denote the action of applying pressure to paper in order to produce the book, and therefore are interchangeable. One edition of a work may have any number of printings, e. g. first edition, first impression; first edition, second impression; and second edition, first impression. Books that sell poorly may have only one. Very successful books may have 50 or more. If present, the [[printer's key]] in the copyright page of a book can be used to identify the number of the printing in which it was produced. In [[printmaking]], however, an "impression" only denotes an individual copy of a specific printing of the work.

A publisher hopes to recoup a large amount of the initial costs of publishing a book from the sale of the copies/impressions produced in the first printing of the book. A variety of commercial and logistic factors are thus considered in deciding the number of books to be produced in a specific printing and their individual price.

Demand for additional printings after the first is always hoped for, because they increase a book's profitability. Once the [[fixed costs]] of developing, editing, typesetting, etc. have been covered by the revenue of the first sales, any additional revenue tends to add to the profit margin, minus, of course, the costs of the additional materials, printing, binding, and distribution.

Sometimes a printing will be unsatisfactory for various reasons, especially printings of artistic and photography books in which the quality of reproduction is paramount. A defective printing is usually destroyed by being [[Pulping|pulped]], yet occasionally a defective printing is shipped to a distant overseas market and there sold cheaply, contingent on the costs of shipping.

If sales of a book do not meet expectations, the remaining stock of a printing will be [[Remaindered book|remaindered]]. When all copies/impressions of a printing are sold, the book is either [[reprint]]ed or becomes [[out of print]]. Some [[print on demand]] and [[e-book]] publishers keep all their books perpetually "in print".

A "second" is an imperfect or damaged copy/impression which is set aside from the other copies/impressions of a printing. These will usually have their [[dust jacket]] clipped or marked in some way to designate their inferiority.

Sometimes readers may observe an error in the text of a book and report it to the publisher. The publisher usually records these '''reprint corrections''' in a file pending demand for a new printing, before which they are incorporated into the revised text. This is one of the factors that inserts the "substantially" into the definition of "substantially the same setting of type".

== Republication == &lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[Republication]] redirects here. --&gt;
Many commercially successful books have been republished, either by their original or other imprints. For this reason if a popular book is searched for in a large bookseller such as [[Amazon.com]] or a large library catalog such as WorldCat, often an array of different copyright years, publishers, editions, formats (hardcover, softcover, trade, and mass market), and so forth are observed. Because no universal authority or convention determines the exact distinction between a "reprinting" and "republishing" and whether a republishing is a different "edition", the denotation of such denominations is ambiguous, at least at first glance.

==Legal status==

===UK===
Since 1956, typographical arrangements of published editions are protected by copyright law. ''[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]'' defines a published edition to mean ''a published edition of the whole or any part of one or more literary, dramatic or musical works''.{{efn|Duration [[Directive (European Union)|Directive of the EU]] permits member states to create a publishers' right in critical and scientific works which have fallen into the [[public domain]].}}

It thus protects the publisher's investment in typesetting, as well as the processes of design and selection that are reflected in the appearance of the text.{{efn|See ''[[Newspaper Licensing Agency]] v. [[Marks &amp; Spencer]]'' [2000].}} It also covers modern editions of public domain works (such as the complete works of Shakespeare), and prohibits the reproduction of the layout (but not the work itself).

In [[printmaking]], an '''edition''' is a number of prints struck from one plate, usually at the same time. This may be a ''limited edition'', with a fixed number of impressions produced on the understanding that no further impressions (copies) will be produced later, or an ''open edition'' limited only by the number that can be sold or produced before the plate wears. Most modern artists produce only limited editions, normally signed by the artist in pencil, and numbered as say 67/100 to show the unique number of that impression and the total edition size.

== Original or reproduction? ==
An important and often confused distinction is that between editions of original prints, produced in the same medium as the artist worked (e.g., etching, or lithography), and reproduction prints (or paintings), which are photographic reproductions of the original work, essentially in the same category as a picture in a book or magazine, though better printed and on better paper.  These may be marketed as "limited editions" with investment potential (which is rarely realized), and even signed and numbered by the artist. Some knowledge is often required to tell the difference.

== Development of the concept ==
[[File:Rembrandt House Museum, printing studioDSCF7277.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rembrandt House Museum]], printing studio]]

One of the main reasons for the development of printmaking was the desire of artists to make more money from their work by selling multiple copies; printmaking satisfies this motive. The production of multiple copies also tends to reduce production costs and market price when compared to a single or unique image. Until the 19th century, in the period of the [[Old master print]] the concept of an edition did not really apply to prints, unlike books.  Prints were often run off as demand allowed, and often worn-out plates were reworked by the original artist or another, to produce a new [[State (printmaking)|state]]. The art market attempts to distinguish between "lifetime impressions" and "late impressions", which were produced after the death of the artist. This can be done to some extent by the study of the [[paper]] involved, and its [[watermark]], and the condition of the plate as revealed by the printed image.  But it remains a difficult area.   
[[File:Goya - Befreit uns niemand von unseren Fesseln ca 1799.jpeg|thumb|left|180px|[[Aquatint]] by [[Francisco de Goya|Goya]], from the Cycle "[[Los Caprichos]]": Can't Anyone Untie Us?]]
The [[aquatint]]s of [[Goya]], which are done in a technique that wears out quickly on the plate, were the first important prints to be published initially in limited editions, which however were not signed or numbered. In fact the plates survived, and since Goya's death several further editions have been published, showing a progressive and drastic decline in quality of the image, despite some rework. Because of this and other cases, "posthumous editions" produced after the death of an artist, and obviously not signed by him, are usually far less sought after. The plates of later prints are often "cancelled" by defacing the image, with a couple of impressions of the cancelled plate taken to document it. This is now expected by collectors and investors, who want the prints they buy to retain their value.

== Modern practice ==
Prints by artists today may potentially retain their financial value as art (i.e., as an appreciating investment) because they are created by an artistic process rather than by a strictly mechanical one, and may become scarce because the number of multiples is limited. In [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]]'s time, the limit on the size of an edition was practical: a plate degrades through use, putting an upper limit on the number of images to be struck. Plates can be reworked and restored to some degree, but it is generally not possible to create more than a thousand prints from any process except lithography or woodcut. A few hundred is a more practical upper limit, and even that allows for significant variation in the quality of the image. In drypoint, 10 or 20 may be the maximum number of top-quality impressions possible.

Today, artists will sometimes refer to a print as a "one-off," meaning that the artist has made a unique print and no reproductions of it from the original matrix, often not even a proof. In this category one sometimes finds monotypes, monoprints, collagraphs, altered prints with collage or chine colle additions, or even hand-colored prints. There remain artists who are strong advocates of "artist's prints" which are conceived, printed, signed, and given the edition number 1/1 by the artist. One contemporary printmaker says that she believes that "there is a natural sequence of actions and thoughts which cannot be approximated by the substitution of an artist/printer collaboration unless the artist is truly involved with the printer or assistant in every step of the decision-making and mark-making processes." &lt;ref&gt;Mitzi Humphrey, ''In Search of the Meandering Absolute: The Prints of Mitzi Humphrey''. Thesis (M.F.A.)Department of Painting and Printmaking,Virginia Commonwealth University, 1997. p.1, Abstract, 64 pp. https://www.worldcat.org/title/in-search-of-the-meandering-absolute-the-prints-of-mitzi-humphrey/oclc/41232924&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

== Numbering ==
Because of the variation in quality, lower-numbered prints in an edition are sometimes favored as superior, especially with older works where the image was struck until the plate wore out. However the numbering of impressions in fact may well not equate at all to the sequence in which they were printed, and may often be the reverse of it.

In later times, printmakers recognized the value of limiting the size of an edition and including the volume of the edition in the print number (e.g., "15/30" for the 15th print in an edition of 30). Tight controls on the process to limit or eliminate variation in quality have become the norm. In [[monotyping]], a technique where only two impressions at most can be taken, prints may be numbered 1/1, or marked "unique". Artists usually print an edition much smaller than the plate allows, both for marketing reasons and to keep the edition comfortably within the lifespan of the plate. Specific steps may also be taken to strengthen the plate, such as electroplating [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] images, which uses an electric process to put a very thin coat of a stronger metal onto a plate of a weaker metal. 

The conventions for numbering prints are well-established, but other marks may indicate that a print has been made in addition to the numbered prints of an edition. [[Artist's proof]]s are marked "A. P." or "P/A", sometimes E. A. or E. d'A. (épreuve d'artiste); monoprints and uniquely hand-altered prints are marked "unique"; prints that are given to someone or are for some reason unsuitable for sale are marked "H. C." or "H/C", meaning "hors de commerce", not for sale. These are usually prints reserved for the publisher, like Artist's Proofs.  The printer is also often allowed to retain some proof impressions; these are marked "P. P." Finally, a master image may be printed against which the members of the edition are compared for quality: these are marked as "bon à tirer" or "BAT" ("good to print" in French). In all, the number of the main edition can represent 50% or less of the total number of good impressions taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Terms: Printmaking|url=http://www.artcellarexchange.com/glossary_printmaking.html|publisher=Art Cellar Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional artist printmakers will sometimes limit an edition to several [[artist's proof]] copies, including a "bon a tirer" print and then one unique copy designated as a "[[one-off]]" or "1/1" or "one/off".

==Consumer protection laws==
California became the first state to regulate the sale of limited edition art prints with the "California Print Law" of 1971. The state of Illinois later expanded on the California statute. However, it was not until 1986 that more comprehensive provisions, still in place today, were enacted with the passage of the "Georgia Print Law". That law became the template for statutes subsequently enacted by other states.

The '''Georgia Print Law''' written by (former) State Representative [[Chesley V. Morton]], became effective July 1, 1986. The law requires art dealers, artists, or auctioneers to supply information to prospective purchasers about the nature of the print, the number of prints and editions (including HC editions) produced, and the involvement (if any) of the artist in the creation of the print. The penalty for violation of the law ranges from simple reimbursement to treble damages, in the case of a willful violation. Those found to be in violation of the law are also liable for court costs, expenses, and attorney fees. The law applies to works of art valued at more than $100.00 (not including frame). Charitable organizations are specifically exempt from the provision of the law.  The statute of limitations is one year after discovery, and, if discovery of the violation is not made within three years of the sale, then the purchaser’s remedies are extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artsgeorgia.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ga-Limited-Edition-Reproduction-Act.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617081914/http://artsgeorgia.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ga-Limited-Edition-Reproduction-Act.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genre art''' is the pictorial representation in any of various media of scenes or events from everyday life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=genre&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300139140 Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, s.v. "genre"]. Accessed 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; such as markets, domestic settings, interiors, parties, inn scenes, and street scenes. Such representations (also called '''genre works''', '''genre scenes''', or '''genre views''') may be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Some variations of the term ''genre art'' specify the medium or type of visual work, as in ''genre painting'', ''genre prints'', ''genre photographs'', and so on.

Rather confusingly, the normal meaning of [[genre]], covering any particular combination of an artistic medium and a type of subject matter (as, for example, in the [[romance novel]]), is also used in the [[visual arts]].  Thus, genre works, especially when referring to the [[painting of the Dutch Golden Age]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]]—the great periods of genre works—may also be used as an umbrella term for painting in various specialized categories such as [[still-life]], [[marine painting]], [[architectural painting]] and animal painting, as well as genre scenes proper where the emphasis is on human figures. Painting was divided into a [[hierarchy of genres]], with [[history painting]] at the top, as the most difficult and therefore prestigious, and still life and architectural painting at the bottom. But history paintings are a genre in painting, not genre works.

The following concentrates on painting, but genre motifs were also extremely popular in many forms of the [[decorative arts]], especially from the [[Rococo]] of the early 18th century onwards. Single figures or small groups decorated a huge variety of objects such as [[porcelain]], furniture, [[wallpaper]] and textiles.

==Genre painting==
[[Image:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, oil on wood, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder]]

''Genre painting'', also called ''genre scene'' or ''petit genre'', depicts aspects of [[everyday life]] by portraying ordinary people engaged in common activities. One common definition of a genre scene is that it shows figures to whom no identity can be attached either individually or collectively—thus distinguishing ''petit genre'' from [[history painting]]s (also called ''grand genre'') and [[portrait]]s. A work would often be considered as a genre work even if it could be shown that the artist had used a known person—a member of his family, say—as a model. In this case it would depend on whether the work was likely to have been intended by the artist to be perceived as a portrait—sometimes a subjective question. The depictions can be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Because of their familiar and frequently sentimental subject matter, genre paintings have often proven popular with the [[bourgeoisie]], or [[middle class]].  Genre themes appear in nearly all art traditions. Painted decorations in ancient [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs often depict banquets, recreation, and agrarian scenes, and [[Peiraikos]] is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] as a [[Hellenistic]] panel painter of "low" subjects, such as survive in [[mosaic]] versions and provincial wall-paintings at [[Pompeii]]: "barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Book XXXV.112 of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] often illustrated scenes of everyday peasant life, especially in the ''[[Labours of the Months]]'' in the calendar section of [[books of hours]], most famously [[Les Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].

===To 1800===
[[File:Merry company, by Dirck Hals.jpg|thumb|''[[Merry company]]'', by Dirck Hals]]
The [[Low Countries]] dominated the field until the 18th century, and in the 17th century both [[Flemish Baroque painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] produced numerous specialists who mostly painted genre scenes.  In the previous century, the Flemish [[Renaissance]] painter [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]] painted innovative large-scale genre scenes, sometimes including a moral theme or a religious scene in the background in the first half of the 16th century.  These were part of a pattern of "[[Mannerist]] inversion" in [[Antwerp]] painting, giving "low" elements previously in the decorative background of images prominent emphasis.  [[Joachim Patinir]] expanded [[landscape painting|his landscapes]], making the figures a small element, and [[Pieter Aertsen]] painted works dominated by spreads of [[still life]] food and genre figures of cooks or market-sellers, with small religious scenes in spaces in the background.  [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] made peasants and their activities, very naturalistically treated, the subject of many of his paintings, and genre painting was to flourish in Northern Europe in Brueghel's wake.
[[File:Wybrand Hendriks - Interieur met naaiende vrouw.jpg|thumb|Interior with woman by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] ]] [[Adriaen van Ostade|Adriaen]] and [[Isaac van Ostade]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Adriaan Brouwer]], [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]], [[Aelbert Cuyp]], [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]] were among the many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Low Countries during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists' paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers. Often the subject of a genre painting was based on a popular ''emblem'' from an [[Emblem book]]. This can give the painting a double meaning, such as in [[Gabriel Metsu]]'s [[:Image:Gabriel Metsu 003.jpg|''The Poultry seller'', 1662]], showing an old man offering a [[rooster]] in a symbolic pose that is based on a lewd engraving by Gillis van Breen (1595–1622), with the same scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/jong076erot01_01/jong076erot01_01_0001.htm|title=E. de Jongh, 'Erotica in vogelperspectief. De dubbelzinnigheid van een reeks zeventiende-eeuwse genrevoorstellingen' |date=|website=DBNL|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[merry company]]'' showed a group of figures at a party, whether making music at home or just drinking in a tavern. Other common types of scenes showed markets or fairs, village festivities ("kermesse"), or soldiers in camp.
[[File:Jean-Baptiste Greuze - Filial Piety - WGA10664.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]], ''Filial Piety'', 1765]]

In [[Italy]], a "school" of genre painting was stimulated by the arrival in [[Rome]] of the Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] in 1625. He acquired the nickname "Il Bamboccio" and his followers were called the ''[[Bamboccianti]]'', whose works would inspire [[Giacomo Ceruti]], [[Antonio Cifrondi]], and [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] among many others.

[[Le Nain|Louis le Nain]] was an important exponent of genre painting in 17th-century France, painting groups of peasants at home, where the 18th century would bring a heightened interest in the depiction of everyday life, whether through the [[romanticism|romanticized]] paintings of [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], or the careful [[realism (arts)|realism]] of [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin|Chardin]]. [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (1725-1805) and others painted detailed and rather sentimental groups or individual portraits of peasants that were to be influential on 19th-century painting.

In England, [[William Hogarth]] (1697–1764) conveyed comedy, social criticism and moral lessons through canvases that told stories of ordinary people ful of narrative detail (aided by long sub-titles), often in serial form, as in his ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', first painted in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1735.

Spain had a tradition predating [[The Book of Good Love]] of social observation and commentary based on the Old Roman Latin tradition, practiced by many of its painters and [[illuminated manuscript|illuminators]].  At the height of the Spanish Empire and the beginning of its slow decline, many [[picaresque]] genre scenes of street life—as well as the kitchen scenes known as [[bodegones]]—were painted by the artists of The [[Spanish Golden Age]], notably [[Velázquez]] (1599–1660) and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] (1617–82). More than a century later, the Spanish artist [[Francisco de Goya]] (1746–1828) used genre scenes in painting and [[printmaking]] as a medium for dark commentary on the human condition. His ''[[The Disasters of War]]'', a series of 82 genre incidents from the [[Peninsular War]], took genre art to unprecedented heights of expressiveness.

==19th century==
[[File:Wassilij Grigorjewitsch Perow 004.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Vasily Perov]], ''The Hunters at Rest'' (1871)]]
[[File:Jagerswoning Rijksmuseum SK-A-1157.jpeg|thumbnail|280px|Hunter's home, by Henry Voordecker, 1826]]
[[File:1820-Country-Wedding-John-Lewis-Krimmel.jpg|thumb|280px|[[John Lewis Krimmel]], ''Country Wedding'' (1820)]]

With the decline of religious and historical painting in the 19th century, artists increasingly found their subject matter in the life around them. [[Realism (art)|Realists]] such as [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–77) upset expectations by depicting everyday scenes in huge paintings—at the scale traditionally reserved for "important" subjects—thus blurring the boundary which had set genre painting apart as a "minor" category. [[History painting]] itself shifted from the exclusive depiction of events of great public importance to the depiction of genre scenes in historical times, both the private moments of great figures, and the everyday life of ordinary people. In French art this was known as the [[Troubador style]].  This trend, already apparent by 1817 when [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] painted ''Henri IV Playing with His Children'', culminated in the [[pompier]] art of French academicians such as [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) and [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]] (1815–91).  In the second half of the century interest in genre scenes, often in historical settings or with pointed social or moral comment, greatly increased across Europe.

[[William Powell Frith]] (1819–1909) was perhaps the most famous English genre painter of the Victorian era, painting large and extremely crowded scenes; the expansion in size and ambition in 19th-century genre painting was a common trend. Other 19th-century English genre painters include [[Augustus Leopold Egg]], [[Frederick Daniel Hardy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hardy Family of Artists: Frederick Daniel, George, Heywood, James and their descendants|last=Hardy|first=Kimber|publisher=ACC Art Books|year=2016|isbn=978-185149-826-0|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk UK|pages=12–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Elgar Hicks]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]].  Scotland produced two influential genre painters, [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744–96) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] (1785–1841). Wilkie's ''The Cottar's Saturday Night'' (1837) inspired a major work by the French painter [[Gustave Courbet]], ''[[After Dinner at Ornans]]'' (1849). Famous [[Russia]]n realist painters like [[Pavel Fedotov]], [[Vasily Perov]], and [[Ilya Repin]] also produced genre paintings.

In Germany, [[Carl Spitzweg]] (1808–85) specialized in gently humorous genre scenes, and in Italy [[Gerolamo Induno]] (1825–90) painted scenes of military life. Subsequently, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], as well as such 20th-century artists as [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Itshak Holtz]], [[Edward Hopper]], and [[David Park (painter)|David Park]] painted scenes of daily life. But in the context of modern art the term "genre painting" has come to be associated mainly with painting of an especially anecdotal or sentimental nature, painted in a traditionally realistic technique.

The first true genre painter in the United States was the German immigrant [[John Lewis Krimmel]], who learning from Wilkie and Hogarth, produced gently humorous scenes of life in Philadelphia from 1812–21. Other notable 19th-century genre painters from the United States include [[George Caleb Bingham]], [[William Sidney Mount]], and [[Eastman Johnson]].

The works of American painter [[Ernie Barnes]] (1938–2009) and those of illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]] (1894–1978) could exemplify a more modern type of genre painting.

While genre painting began, in the 17th century, with representations by Europeans of European life, the invention and early development of photography coincided with the most expansive and aggressive era of European imperialism, in the mid-to-late 19th century, and so genre photographs, typically made in the proximity of military, scientific and commercial expeditions, often also depict the people of other cultures that Europeans encountered throughout the world.

Although the distinctions are not clear, genre works should be distinguished from [[Ethnography|ethnographic studies]], which are pictorial representations resulting from direct observation and descriptive study of the culture and way of life of particular societies, and which constitute one class of products of such disciplines as [[anthropology]] and the [[behavioural sciences]].

The development of photographic technology to make cameras portable and exposures instantaneous enabled photographers to venture beyond the studio to follow other art forms in the depiction of everyday life. This category has come to be known as [[street photography]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bystander: A History of Street Photography'' by [[Joel Meyerowitz]] and [[Colin Westerbeck]], Boston: [[Bulfinch Press]], 1994. {{ISBN|0-82121-755-0}}.

The '''Hastings School of Art''' was an [[art school]] in [[Hastings]], England, located at the Brassey Institute on the top two floors of the library building at Claremont.

==Background and history==
This applies to Hastings College of Art in Hastings Nebraska&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hastings.edu/about-hastings-college/facts-about-hastings/our-history&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hastings School of Art was established in 1882 as a private college, coeducational, and focused on the liberal arts. 

In August 1873, the proposal for a Christian college directed towards the liberal arts was presented to the Kearney Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church, having been approved by the community. 

On 13 September 1882, the first class of 44 students with five teachers entered the new college located on the second floor of the old Post Office. It took two years to complete the first building of Hastings Art School called the McCormick Hall.&lt;ref name=HISTORY&gt;{{cite web|title=Full History|url=http://www.hastings.edu/igsbase/igstemplate.cfm/SRC=DB/SRCN=/GnavID=18/SnavID=128|publisher=Hastings College|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school had many Victorian casts for the students to work from including a Vatican reproduction of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Madonna and Child]]'' relief, which is still on show at the current art department. The art department was moved to the main college campus in Archery Road, [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] in 1982.

'''''In the Night Kitchen''''' is a popular and controversial children's [[picture book]], written and illustrated by [[Maurice Sendak]], and first published in 1970. The book depicts a young boy's dream journey through a [[surrealism|surreal]] baker's kitchen where he assists in the creation of a cake to be ready by the morning. ''In the Night Kitchen'' has been described by Sendak as part of a trilogy of books based on psychological development from ''In the Night Kitchen'' (toddler) to ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'' (pre-school) to ''[[Outside Over There]]'' (pre-adolescent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLcBV9ghpuAC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186 |title=Maurice Sendak's Trilogy: Disappointment, Fury, and Their Transformation through Art |journal=[[Psychoanalytic Study of the Child]] |first=Richard M. |last=Gottlieb |volume=63 |pages=186–217 |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-300-14099-6 |pmid=19449794}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[Caldecott Medal|Caldecott Honor]] recipient in 1971. It was adapted into a five-minute animated short film in 1987 by [[Gene Deitch]].

==Plot summary==
A young boy named Mickey sleeps in his [[bed]] when he is disturbed by noise on a lower floor. Suddenly, he begins to float, and loses all of his clothes as he drifts into a surreal world called the "Night Kitchen".

He falls naked into a giant mixing pot that contains the [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] for the "morning cake". While Mickey is buried in the mass, three identical bakers (who closely resemble [[Oliver Hardy]]) mix the batter and prepare it for baking, unaware (or unconcerned) that there is a little boy inside. Just before the baking pan is placed into the oven, the boy emerges from the pan, protesting that he is not the batter's milk.

To make up for the baking ingredient deficiency, Mickey (now covered in batter from the neck down) constructs an [[airplane]] out of [[bread]] [[dough]] so he can use the [[measuring cup]] as a [[hat]] and fly to the [[mouth]] of a gigantic [[milk]] [[bottle]]. Upon reaching the bottle's opening, he dives in and briefly revels in the [[liquid]]. After his covering of batter disintegrates, making him naked again, he pours the needed milk in a cascade down to the bakers who joyfully finish making their morning cake.

With dawn breaking, the naked Mickey crows like a [[rooster]] and slides down the side of the bottle, back into his bed, where he is magically clothed again, "cake free and dried". 
==Controversy==
When Mickey (who looks to be about three years old) enters the Night Kitchen, he loses his pajamas and is fully naked in some parts of the story. Critics object to Mickey's nudity which depicts not only his [[buttocks]], but also his genitals. Some also interpret sexual innuendo in the events, with the [[nudity]], free-flowing milky fluids, and a giant (allegedly [[Phallus|phallic]]) milk bottle.&lt;ref name="NNDB"&gt;{{cite web|last=NNDB|title=Maurice Sendak|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/275/000023206/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the book proved controversial in the United States on its release and has continued to be so. The inclusion of child nudity has been frequently raised as morally problematic; consequently, this book remains on lists of books either challenged or banned.&lt;ref name="blisstree.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blisstree.com/live/the-15-most-controversial-picture-books-366/ |title=The 15 Most Controversial Picture Books |publisher=Blisstree.com |date=2008-08-18 |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been ranked 25th place on the "100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000" list compiled by the [[American Library Association]].&lt;ref name="100most"&gt;{{cite web|last=American Library Association |title=The 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000 |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/banned/frequentlychallenged/challengedbydecade/1990_2000.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sC3hcGt2?url=http://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/banned/frequentlychallenged/challengedbydecade/1990_2000.cfm |archivedate=2010-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork==
Sendak's illustrations here are rather different in style from ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'', his best known book, which makes much use of [[Hatching|cross hatching]] not found here. However, Sendak continues to utilize specific color tones and drawing a dream environment around a young child. Sendak's unique style captures the spirit and feeling of a dream, as Mickey floats, flies and dances from one panel to the next.

The book may be defined as a [[comics|comic story]], at least if one uses the definition of comics proposed in [[Scott McCloud]]'s acclaimed ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' — the storytelling is mainly pictorial (albeit clarified by captions) and the images mainly [[sequential art|sequential]], and [[speech balloons]] are used throughout the entire book.

In fact, the imagery is very similar to [[Winsor McCay]]'s [[Sunday page|Sunday comic strip]] series ''[[Little Nemo]]'' from the early 20th century. Maurice Sendak has cited these comics as influential in his work, and on page five of ''Night Kitchen'', one of the ingredients shown has a subtitle saying "Chicken Little, Nemo, mass", a nod to this influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://springlakemccay.blogspot.com/2007/12/maurice-sendaks-homage.html Some examples of similarities between Little Nemo and Sendak's ''In the Night Kitchen''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on [[NPR]]'s ''Fresh Air'', Sendak said that his depiction of the cooks in ''In the Night Kitchen'' (with their [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]-esque mustaches) and the fact that they tried to cook the boy in their ovens were references to [[the Holocaust]], a subject high in his thoughts especially due to his Jewish heritage. Sendak also said the story dealt with the things that happen after a child goes to bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gross|first1=Terry |title=Sendak on Adapting 'Brundibar' for Theater|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/2006/05/05/13001512/|website=npr|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Bolton''' (1735 – 7 January 1799) was an English [[naturalist]],  [[botanist]], [[mycologist]], and [[illustrator]].

==Background==
James Bolton was born near [[Warley Town|Warley]] in the [[West Riding]] of [[Yorkshire]] in 1735, the son of William Bolton, a [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]]. James initially followed in his father's trade, but later became a self-taught art teacher and finally a [[public house|publican]] in his home village of Warley.&lt;ref name = Mycologist&gt;Edmondson, J. (1995) New insights into James Bolton of Halifax. ''Mycologist'' 9: 174-178&lt;/ref&gt;  He married Sarah Blackburn in 1768 and the couple had four children. He and his family lived all their lives in the [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] area.&lt;ref name = Oxon&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=2803|title=Bolton, James|first=Mark|last=Seaward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and his older brother, '''Thomas Bolton''' (1722–1778), were keen naturalists, Thomas having a particular interest in [[entomology]] and [[ornithology]].&lt;ref name = Mycologist/&gt; [[Edward Donovan]] named the dragonfly ''[[Cordulegaster boltonii]]'' after a specimen collected by Thomas Bolton.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Zweigestreifte Quelljungfer]] (mistakenly as "William" Bolton)&lt;/ref&gt;  The two brothers contributed to the natural history section in ''The History and Antiquities of the Parish of Halifax in Yorkshire'', published in 1775 by [[John Watson (antiquary)|John Watson]].&lt;ref name = Oxon/&gt; James Bolton subsequently developed his interest further by writing or illustrating a number of important natural history books.

==Ferns and flowering plants==
In 1785, Bolton provided the illustrations for [[Richard Relhan]]'s ''Flora Cantabrigiensis''. In the same year, he also published the first of his own works, part one of  '''''Filices Britannicae''''', an illustrated account of British [[fern]]s in two volumes. James Bolton not only drew the illustrations, but etched them himself. Moreover, he did not merely collate existing information on ferns, but undertook original research and field work. The book includes a description and illustration of a new fern species, now known as ''[[Woodsia alpina]]'' (Bolton) Gray. At this time, Bolton was commissioned by the wealthy [[Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland]] (1715–1785) to illustrate plants in her museum collection.&lt;ref name=Mycologist/&gt;

James Bolton's additional illustrations of native and exotic flowering plants were never published. A number of his original watercolours, however, are extant, including ''Fifty Flowers Drawn from Nature at Halifax'' (1785–1787) at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]],&lt;ref name = NHM&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/mils/index.dsml?x=9&amp;beginIndex=0&amp;action=textsearch&amp;searchword=James+Bolton&amp;y=6&amp; ]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an album from 1794 called "Twelve Posies Gathered in the Fields" held at [[Liverpool Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/wml/naturalworld/botany/ |title=Zoology collection - World Museum, Liverpool museums |publisher=Liverpoolmuseums.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a collection of botanical paintings in the [[Lindley Library]] at the [[Royal Horticultural Society]].

In 1788 the genus ''[[Boltonia]]'' (''[[Compositae]]'') was named in his honour by [[Charles Louis L'Héritier de Brutelle]].&lt;ref name = Oxon/&gt;

==Fungi==
Bolton's chief interest was in [[fungi]], which he assiduously collected, carried home in his [[vasculum]] and illustrated. He also corresponded with many of the notable mycologists of his day, including [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard|Jean Bulliard]], [[James Dickson (biologist)|James Dickson]], [[John Lightfoot (biologist)|John Lightfoot]], and [[Carl Ludwig Willdenow|Carl Willdenow]]. The result was the publication of the first English-language work devoted to fungi, Bolton's three-volume '''''An History of Fungusses growing about Halifax''''', published 1788-1790, with a supplement in 1791.&lt;ref name = Oxon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolton&gt;{{cite book |author =James Bolton |title=An history of fungusses, growing about Halifax |publisher=James Bolton |location=Halifax |year=1788 |volume=2 |page=58 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/5394#/summary |doi=10.5962/bhl.title.5394 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was dedicated to Henry Noel, 6th [[Earl of Gainsborough]] (1743–1798), who was one of Bolton's patrons and helped fund the project.&lt;ref name = Fungus&gt;{{cite web|author=Bolton, J.|year=1788|title=An History of Fungusses growing about Halifax. Vol. 1|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/25501#7|accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with the earlier book on ferns, Bolton not only undertook the illustrations, but also did the etchings for the work, which were then hand-coloured. Among the species covered, many were newly described, including such familiar fungi as the Wood Woollyfoot ''[[Gymnopus peronatus]]'' (Bolton) P. Kumm., the inkcap ''[[Coprinellus domesticus]]'' (Bolton) Vilgalys ''et al.'', the Cramp Ball ''[[Daldinia concentrica]]'' (Bolton) Ces. &amp; De Not., the bracket ''[[Daedaleopsis confragosa]]'' (Bolton) J. Schröt., the agaric ''[[Lepiota cristata]]'' (Bolton) P. Kumm., and the Fairy-Ring Champignon ''[[Marasmius oreades]]'' (Bolton) Fr.&lt;ref name = Fungus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/Names.asp |title=Search Page |publisher=Index Fungorum |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was translated into German, as ''Geschichte der merkwürdigsten Pilze'', and published in four volumes (1795–1820) with notes by Willdenow.

An additional album of 233 unpublished paintings of fungi, known as ''Icones fungorum circa Halifax nascentium'', is held in the Special Collections Library of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. A collection of 36 "fungi illustrations" (c. 1780) is also held at the Natural History Museum&lt;ref name = NHM/&gt;  and some additional sketches are in the library of the [[Earl of Derby]] at [[Knowsley Hall]].&lt;ref name = Mycologist/&gt;

Few of Bolton's fungal collections survive, but some of his specimens are in the mycological herbarium at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, P.J. &amp; Legon, N.W. (2003). Fungal specimens of James Bolton at Kew. ''Kew Bulletin'' 58: 759-761&lt;/ref&gt; and others in the Edward Robson herbarium at [[Sunderland Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Legg, A. W. (1997).

Bolton's final published work was '''''Harmonia ruralis''''', an "essay towards a natural history of British songbirds", issued in two volumes (1794–6). Birds and their nests were drawn from life, whilst the text contained many of Bolton's first-hand observations. The popularity of the subject matter led to two subsequent but posthumous editions in 1830 and 1845.

==James Bolton today==
An exhibition devoted to James Bolton and his works was held at the Liverpool Museum in 1995-6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fungus.org.uk/nwfg/bolton.htm |title=James Bolton of Halifax |publisher=Fungus.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was one of the artists featured in the ''Nature Observed'' exhibition at the [[University of London]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/iss/library/speccoll/exhibitions/botex/britflora.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601141530/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/iss/library/speccoll/exhibitions/botex/britflora.html |date=1 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolton's fern and fungi books, with their descriptions of new species, remain of scientific value today, whilst his bird studies from ''Harmonia ruralis'' have retained their attraction - and have been reproduced as prints, on table mats and coasters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumselection.co.uk/product-MS-Harmonia-Ruralis-Tablemats-and-Coasters-6896/ |title=Invalid Characters |publisher=Museumselection.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even on tea towels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historicalgifts.best.gotdns.com/2-harmonia-ruralis-tea-towels/] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25767">{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of series run in ''Shōnen Book''}}
This list contains all of the series that have run in the monthly [[Shōnen]] manga magazine, {{nihongo|''[[Shōnen Book]]''|少年ブック|Shōnen Bukku|lit. "Boy Book"}}. ''Shōnen Book'' was known for featuring many popular manga by many popular [[Mangaka|manga artists]]. Some found their way into the US in the 1970s, although the magazine remains little known there.

*Manga titles with a shade of light green appeared in the last issue.

==Manga series==
===1950s===
====1958–1959====
''Shōnen Book'' had a very few amount of series at its start because it started as an offshoot of the already successful ''Omoshiro Book''. ''Shōnen Book'' is starting to gain more series, as it eases its way into a separate publication.

'''Lydia Goehr''' is a Professor of Philosophy at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=obio&gt;{{cite web|title=Lydia Goehr {{!}} Department of Philosophy|url=http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/lydia-goehr|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her research specialties include the [[philosophy of music]], [[aesthetics]], [[critical theory]], the [[philosophy of history]], and [[19th-century philosophy|19th]]- and [[20th-century philosophy]].

==Biography==
Goehr was born in [[London]], on January 10, 1960. She is the daughter of the composer [[Alexander Goehr]] and granddaughter of [[Walter Goehr]]. She received her Ph.D. from [[Cambridge University]], where her dissertation on the ontology of music was supervised by [[Bernard Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Jacobs, et al. "Goehr." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 30 Mar. 2013 &lt;http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/53781pg3&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her permanent appointment at Columbia, Goehr has accepted a number of visiting appointments, including a position as Visiting Ernest Bloch Professor at [[UC Berkeley]]'s music department in 1997, as the visiting Aby Warburg Professor at the [[University of Hamburg]] in 2002-2003, as a visiting professor at the [[Free University of Berlin|Freie Universität]] in [[Berlin]] in 2008, and as a visiting professor in the Fu-Berlin SFB Theater und Fest in 2009.&lt;ref name=obio/&gt;

Goehr has written three books, co-edited a fourth, and has published numerous articles in the philosophy of music and critical theory. Her first book, ''The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford), was published in 1992, and has since been translated into Greek, Chinese and Italian. Her second book, ''A Quest for Voice: On Music, Politics, and the Limits of Philosophy'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford), is based on the Bloch Lectures, delivered at the University of California, Berkeley in 1997. Her third book, published in 2008, is ''Elective Affinities: Musical Essays on the History of Aesthetic Theory'' (Columbia University Press).

Goehr's work focuses on the history of aesthetic theory, attempting to understand the relational nature of norms and power dynamics with the structure that confines them and regulates their practice.&lt;ref name=apacsw&gt;{{cite web|last=DesAutels|first=Peggy|title=Lydia Goehr: November 2013|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/lydiagoehrnovember|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her work has focused on the musical arts, and some of it has explored the complicated and often hostile relationship between the various arts, and between the arts and philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;  She has also engaged with ideas about the legitimacy of war from a [[critical theory]] standpoint, as well as dealt with the [[philosophy of history]] and the [[history of philosophy]].

Goehr has received several awards for her research as well as for her teaching of undergraduate students and mentoring of graduate students. She has been a recipient of the Getty and Guggenheim Fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/search?search=goehr&amp;x=-1119&amp;y=-67 |title= Guggenheim Fellowships |publisher= Guggenheim Foundation |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/lydiagoehrnovember |title=The American Philosophical Association's Committee on the Status of Women |publisher=APA |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Goehr was awarded the H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13915">A '''magician's assistant''' is  a performer in a [[magic (illusion)|magic act]] who is not billed as the magician or principal name in the act. The role of an assistant can include holding the [[theatrical property|prop]]s that are used by a [[Magician (illusion)|magician]], shifting props onto and off the stage, and serving as a living prop in illusions that involve manipulation of the human body. Other aspects of the role can include dancing or acting as visual ornamentation, sometimes for simple aesthetic purposes and sometimes to misdirect audience attention. The figure of the glamorous female assistant has become a stereotype or icon in art, popular media and fiction.&lt;ref name="johnstone"&gt;{{cite journal

Although magician's assistants appear to play a supporting role and receive a lesser [[Billing (film)|billing]] than the magician who appears to be the source of illusions, the assistant is often the one making the mechanics of the illusions work. In the words of [[Joanie Spina]], who worked for 11 years as principal assistant, choreographer and artistic consultant to illusionist [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...I did find fault with the term "assistant" because it sounds like someone rolling props on and off stage when many of us were highly trained actors and dancers.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History and critiques==

[[File:FarlaAssistents.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Sabrina and Vanessa with illusionist [[Christian Farla]]]]
Assistants have been part of magic shows for most of the recorded [[Timeline of magic|history of magic]] as a performance art. Despite their often crucial role in magic acts they, and the work they do, have suffered from negative public perceptions. The assistant's role has often been stereotyped as consisting of menial tasks and having the primary purpose of adding a visually aesthetic element to an act. This is associated with the perception that assistants are usually female and often dressed in revealing costumes. Although there have been plenty of instances of male assistants throughout the history of magic, the glamorous female stereotype has made a particular impact because female assistants were a prominent feature of illusion shows during the 20th century, when magic began to reach huge new audiences, first through the burgeoning of live [[vaudeville]] and [[variety shows]] and then through television. The glamorous female assistant has become an iconic image that continues in modern media and literature.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="womeninboxes"&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.womeninboxes.com
 |title = ''Women in Boxes''
 |publisher = WIB, LLC
 |accessdate = 2007-04-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable feature of the glamorous female assistant iconography is the frequency with which assistants play the role of "victim" in illusions where they are tied up, apparently cut with blades, penetrated with spikes or swords or otherwise tortured or imperilled. Examples include ''[[Aztec Lady]]'', ''[[Devil's Torture Chamber]]'', ''[[Mismade Girl]]'', ''[[Radium Girl]]'', ''[[Zig Zag Girl]]'', and, perhaps most famous of all, ''[[Sawing a woman in half]]''.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The topic of assistants portrayed as victims in violent illusions was featured in "Violent magic" the final episode of the six-part [[BBC]] television documentary series ''Magic'' in 2004, see {{cite web
 |url = http://www.magicweek.co.uk/backissues_0200-0249/0230.htm

 |date = 20 November 2004
 |accessdate = 2007-04-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted illusion designer and historian [[Jim Steinmeyer]] has identified the advent of the sawing illusion as a turning point in magic history and a moment which, more than any other, marks the origin of the cliche of the female assistant as victim. It is generally agreed that a "sawing" type illusion was first performed publicly by [[P. T. Selbit]] in January 1921. His presentations of what he titled "''Sawing through a woman''" made an enormous impact and greatly affected public expectations of stage magic for decades afterwards. Steinmeyer has explained:&lt;ref name="hiding"&gt;{{cite book
 |title = Hiding the Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible

 |last = Steinmeyer
 |publisher = William Heinemann/Random House
 |year = 2003
 |pages = 277–295
 |isbn = 0-434-01325-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before Selbit's illusion, it was not a cliche that pretty ladies were teased and tortured by magicians. Since the days of [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin|Robert-Houdin]], both men and women were used as the subjects for magic illusions. Victorian gowns often made it unrealistic for a lady to take part in an illusion or be pressed into a tight space.&lt;ref name="hiding2"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:DietrichKlein.jpg|thumb|Magician Dorothy Dietrich sawing celebrity assistant and comedian Robert Klein in half on TV]] One female magician [[Dorothy Dietrich]] has turned the tables and used men as assistants, sawing them in half.  

Changes in fashion and great social upheavals during the first decades of the 20th century made Selbit's choice of "victim" both practical and popular. Steinmeyer notes: "During the 1900s, as a shapely leg became not only acceptable on the stage but admired, it was fashionable to perform magic with a cast of attractive ladies".&lt;ref name="hiding2"/&gt;

That was only part of the story, however. The trauma of war had helped to desensitize the public to violence and the emancipation of women had changed attitudes to them. Audiences were also tiring of the gentler forms of magic represented by the likes of [[John Nevil Maskelyne]]. It took something more shocking, such as the horrific productions of the [[Grand Guignol]] theatre, to cause a sensation in this age. Steinmeyer concludes that: "...beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment".&lt;ref name="hiding2"/&gt;

In contrast to the publicity given to Selbit, the names of the assistants who made this influential act work have received almost no publicity. There were two premieres of the illusion. Selbit first presented it to an audience in December 1920; however, on that occasion the spectators were a small group of invited theatrical agents and promoters who Selbit hoped would book the act. The public premiere then occurred on 17 January 1921 at the [[Finsbury Park]] Empire music hall after Selbit was hired by the Moss Empire group. According to Steinmeyer, the assistant at the 1920 preview was Jan Glenrose, Selbit's main assistant at that time. The public performances featured principal assistant Betty Barker.&lt;ref name="hiding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artandartifice"&gt;{{cite book

Many of these illusions, together with others that involve appearances, disappearances or escapes, involve assistants being shut in boxes of one sort or another. This has led to the nickname "box jumper" which, although it could be applied to a male assistant, is usually inferred to be a female assistant.&lt;ref name="boxjumpers1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason that has been given for the predominance of women in this role is that the illusions sometimes require an assistant that can fit into cramped spaces and women have an advantage in that they tend to be smaller and more limber than men.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hiding2"/&gt;

[[Feminist]] critics have taken the above aspects of illusions and performances as evidence to support claims that magic is [[misogynist]]ic, but this view has been contested by some magicians and assistants. However, a few prominent assistants have stated that they deserve better recognition for their efforts and achievements (see "[[#Documentaries|Documentaries]]" below).&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;

Some modern magic acts have preserved the glamorous elements of the female assistant iconography while attempting to give full recognition to female performers by billing women as equal partners in acts. A notable example was the husband and wife act [[Pendragons|The Pendragons]], for which Charlotte Pendragon wore very revealing costumes and did traditional "box jumping" roles yet received equal billing with her husband. She was also honored in her own right as a top professional magician. Another example, although with more modest and conservative costuming, is [[Kristen Johnson (escape artist)|Kristen Johnson]], who receives equal billing with her husband Kevin Ridgeway when they perform together as a magic act and often stars in her own right as an [[escapology|escape artist]].

'''Mauricio Raúl Kagel''' ({{IPA-es|mauˈɾisjo ˈkaɣel}}; December 24, 1931 – September 18, 2008) was a [[Germans|German]]-[[Argentina|Argentine]] [[composer]] notable for developing the [[theatrical]] side of musical [[performance]] {{harv|Grimshaw|2009}}. He spent his last fifty years in Germany, dying after a long illness at the age of 76 {{harv|Nonnenmann|2008}}.

==Biography==
Kagel was born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], into an Ashkenazi Jewish family that had fled from Russia in the 1920s {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}. He studied music, history of [[literature]], and [[philosophy]] in [[Buenos Aires]] {{harv|Grimshaw|2009}}. In 1957 he moved as a scholar to [[Cologne]], Germany, where he lived until his death.

===As teacher===

From 1960–66 and 1972–76 he taught at the [[Darmstädter Ferienkurse|International Summer School at Darmstadt]] {{harv|Attinello|2001}}. He also taught from 1964–65 at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] as [[Slee Professor of music theory]]. At the [[Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin|Berlin Film and Television Academy]] he was a visiting lecturer. He served as director of courses for new music in [[Gothenburg]] and Cologne {{harv|Attinello|2001}}. He was professor for new music theatre at the [[Cologne Conservatory]] from 1974–97.&lt;!--Attinello 2001 would cover this as well, except he does not give the terminal date.--&gt; Among his students were [[Maria de Alvear]], [[Carola Bauckholt]], [[Branimir Krstić]], [[David Sawer]], {{ill|Rickard Scheffer|sv}}, [[Juan Maria Solare]], [[Gerald Barry (composer)|Gerald Barry]], and [[Chao-Ming Tung]]. {{See LMST|Mauricio|Kagel}}

===As composer===

Some of his pieces give specific theatrical instructions to the performers {{harv|Kennedy and Bourne|2006}}, such as to adopt certain facial expressions while playing, to make their stage entrances in a particular way, to physically interact with other performers, and so on. For this reason commentators at times related his work to the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} He has been regarded by music historians as deploying a critical intelligence interrogating the position of music in society {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}}.&lt;!--Is this a quote or paraphrase?--&gt; He was also active in the fields of film and photography, proving that the possibilities of music are inexhaustible.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 1991 Kagel was invited by [[Walter Fink]] as the second composer featured in the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenporträt]] of the [[Rheingau Musik Festival]]. In 2000 he received the [[Ernst von Siemens Music Prize]].

==Works==
''Staatstheater'' (1970) remains, probably, Kagel’s best-known work. It is the piece that most clearly shows his absurdist tendency.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} He described it as a “[[ballet]] for non-dancers,”{{Cite quote|date=September 2008}} although it is in many ways more like an [[opera]]; the devices it uses as [[musical instrument]]s include [[chamber pot]]s and [[enema]] equipment. As the work progresses, the piece itself, and opera and ballet in general, becomes its own subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Similar is the [[radio]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''Ein Aufnahmezustand'' (1969) which is about the incidents surrounding the recording of a radio play. In ''Con voce'' (With Voice), a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. ''Match'' (1964), is a “tennis game” for cellists with a percussionist as umpire {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}} (for [[Siegfried Palm]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;!--Formerly offered citation, [http://www.bertdekkers.nl/klassiek/kagel_list.html Kagel: Match], lists a recording made by Palm, but does not confirm the work was written for him.--&gt;), also the subject of one of Kagel's films and perhaps the best-known of his works of instrumental theatre {{harv|Griffiths|1981|loc=812}}.

But Kagel wrote a large number of more conventional “pure” pieces too, including [[orchestra]]l music, [[chamber music]]. Many of these make references to music of the past by, among others, Beethoven, Brahms, Bach and Liszt ({{harvnb|Warnaby|1981|loc=38}}; {{harvnb|Decarsin|1985|loc=260}}).

Kagel also made [[film]]s, with one of the best known being ''[[Ludwig van (film)|Ludwig van]]'' (1970), a critical interrogation of the uses of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s music made during the bicentenary of that composer's birth {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}}. In it, a reproduction of Beethoven's studio is seen, as part of a fictive visit of the [[Beethoven House]] in [[Bonn]]. Everything in it is papered with sheet music of Beethoven's pieces. The soundtrack of the film is a [[piano]] playing the music as it appears in each shot. Because the music has been wrapped around curves and edges, it is somewhat distorted, but Beethovenian motifs can still be heard. In other parts, the film contains parodies of radio or TV broadcasts connected with the "Beethoven Year 1770". Kagel later turned the film into a piece of sheet music itself which could be performed in a concert without the film—the score consists of close-ups of various areas of the studio, which are to be interpreted by the performing [[pianist]].

[[File:Jean + Brigitte Soubeyran Im Zirkus.JPG|thumb|200px|Mime artists Jean Soubeyran and Brigitte Soubeyran in 1950]]
A '''mime''' or '''mime artist'''  (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] μῖμος, ''mimos'', "imitator, actor")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmi%3Dmos μῖμος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; is a person who uses mime as a theatrical medium or as a [[performance art]]. Miming involves acting out a story through body motions, without the use of [[speech]]. In earlier times, in English, such a performer would typically be referred to as a [[mummer]]. Miming is distinguished from [[silent comedy]], in which the artist is a seamless character in a film or sketch.

[[Jacques Copeau]], strongly influenced by [[Commedia dell'arte]] and Japanese [[Noh]] theatre, used masks in the training of his actors. His pupil [[Étienne Decroux]] was highly influenced by this, started exploring and developing the possibilities of mime, and developed [[corporeal mime]] into a highly sculptural form, taking it outside the realms of naturalism. [[Jacques Lecoq]] contributed significantly to the development of mime and [[physical theatre]] with his training methods.&lt;ref name=Callery&gt;{{cite book

==History==
=== In Western theatre traditions ===
The performance of mime originates at its earliest in [[Ancient Greece]]; the name is taken from a single masked dancer called ''Pantomimus'', although performances were not necessarily silent. In Medieval Europe, early forms of mime such as [[Mummers Play|mummer play]]s and later [[dumbshow]]s evolved. In early nineteenth-century Paris, [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]] solidified the many attributes that have come to be known in modern times—the silent figure in whiteface.

==== Greek and Roman mime ====
{{Main|Ancient Greek comedy}}
[[File:PANTOMIME-PABLO.jpg|thumb|200px|Mime Pablo Zibes]]
The first recorded mime was Telestēs in the play ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]'' by [[Aeschylus]]. Tragic mime was developed by Puladēs of Kilikia; comic mime was developed by Bathullos of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Lust, Annette. [https://www.mime.info/history-lust.html "The Origins and Development of the Art of Mime".] ''From the Greek Mimes to Marcel Marceau and Beyond: Mimes, Actors, Pierrots and Clowns: A Chronicle of the Many Visages of Mime in the Theatre''. 9 March 2000. Retrieved 14 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Theatre of ancient Rome#Roman comedy}}
Mime (Mimius) was an aspect of Roman theatre from its earliest times,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/mime-and-pantomime Mime and pantomime]&lt;/ref&gt; paralleling the [[Atellan farce]] in its improvisation (if without the latter’s stock characters).&lt;ref name="nettle 393"&gt;H Nettleship ed., ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (London 1894) p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; It gradually began to replace the Atellanae as interludes [embolium] or postscripts [exodium] on the main theatre stages;&lt;ref&gt;H J Rose, ''A Handbook of Latin Literature'' (London 1967) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; became the sole dramatic event at the [[Floralia]] in the second century BC; and in the following century received technical advances at the hands of [[Publius Syrus]] and [[Decimus Laberius]].&lt;ref name="nettle 393"/&gt;

Under the Empire mime became the predominant Roman drama,&lt;ref name="nettle 393"/&gt; if with mixed fortunes under different emperors.  [[Trajan]] banished mime artists; [[Caligula]] favored them; [[Marcus Aurelius]] made them priests of [[Apollo]]. [[Nero]] himself acted as a mime.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, R. J. (1901) [http://www.mime.info/history-broadbent.html#2HCH0006 ''A History of Pantomime'', Chapter VI.] London. Retrieved 14 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mime was distinguished from other dramas by its absence of masks, and by the presence of female as well as male performers. &lt;ref&gt;H J Rose, ''A Handbook of Latin Literature'' (London 1967) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Stock characters included the lead (or archimimus[a]), the stooge or stupidus,&lt;ref name="nettle 393"/&gt; and the [[gigolo]], or cultus adulter.&lt;ref&gt;G Highet, ''Juvenal the Satirist'' (Oxford 1962) p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In non-Western theatre traditions ===
While most of this article has treated mime as a constellation of related and historically linked Western theatre genres and performance techniques, analogous performances are evident in the theatrical traditions of other civilizations.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

[[Classical Indian musical theatre]], although often erroneously labeled a "dance," is a group of theatrical forms in which the performer presents a narrative via stylized gesture, an array of hand positions, and mime illusions to play different characters, actions, and landscapes. Recitation, music, and even percussive footwork sometimes accompany the performance. The [[Natya Shastra]], an ancient treatise on theatre by [[Bharata Muni]], mentions silent performance, or ''mukabhinaya''.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

In [[Kathakali]], stories from Indian epics are told with facial expressions, hand signals and body motions. Performances are accompanied by songs narrating the story while the actors act out the scene, followed by actor detailing without background support of narrative song.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

The Japanese [[Noh]] tradition has greatly influenced many contemporary mime and theatre practitioners including [[Jacques Copeau]] and [[Jacques Lecoq]] because of its use of mask work and highly physical performance style.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

[[Butoh]], though often referred to as a dance form, has been adopted by various theatre practitioners as well.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

==Formats==
=== In film ===
[[File:Chaplin A Dogs Life.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[A Dog's Life]]'' (1918), [[Charlie Chaplin]]]]
Prior to the work of [[Étienne Decroux]] there was no major treatise on the art of mime, and so any recreation of mime as performed prior to the twentieth century is largely conjecture, based on interpretation of diverse sources.  However, the twentieth century also brought a new [[Mass media|medium]] into widespread usage: the motion picture.

The restrictions of early motion picture technology meant that stories had to be told with minimal dialogue, which was largely restricted to [[intertitle]]s.  This often demanded a highly stylized form of physical acting largely derived from the stage.  Thus, mime played an important role in films prior to advent of [[talkies]] (films with sound or speech).  The mimetic style of film acting was used to great effect in [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] film. 

[[Silent film]] comedians like [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Harold Lloyd]], and [[Buster Keaton]] learned the craft of mime in the theatre, but through film, they would have a profound influence on mimes working in live theatre decades after their deaths.  Indeed, Chaplin may be the best-documented mime in history.

The famous French comedian, writer, and director [[Jacques Tati]] achieved his initial popularity working as a mime, and indeed his later films had only minimal dialogue, relying instead on many subtle expertly choreographed visual gags.  Tati, like Chaplin before him, would mime out the movements of every single character in his films and ask his actors to repeat them.

===On stage and street===
[[File:Mimes in Boston.jpg|thumb|Whitefaced mime on Boston Common in 1980]]
Mime has been performed on stage, with [[Marcel Marceau]] and his character "Bip" being the most famous.  Mime is also a popular art form in [[street theatre]] and [[busking]].  Traditionally, these sorts of performances involve the actor/actress wearing tight black and white clothing with white facial makeup.  However, contemporary mimes often perform without whiteface.  Similarly, while traditional mimes have been completely silent, contemporary mimes, while refraining from speaking, sometimes employ vocal sounds when they perform. Mime acts are often comical, but some can be very serious.

On the stage, Mime Artist [[Nithor Mahbub]] from Bangladesh introduced the first practice of teaching through humor with group Mimo Drama troupe Mime Art. 

=== In literature ===
Canadian author Michael Jacot's first novel, ''The Last Butterfly'', tells the story of a mime artist in Nazi-occupied Europe who is forced by his oppressors to perform for a team of Red Cross observers.&lt;ref&gt;Broyard, Anatole. "A Laugh Before Dying." ''The New York Times''. 7 March 1974. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel laureate [[Heinrich Böll]]'s ''The Clown'' relates the downfall of a mime artist, Hans Schneir, who has descended into poverty and drunkenness after being abandoned by his beloved.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Daniel. "Without Shmerz." ''The New York Times''. 4 January 1965. Book Review. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Appel's Pushcart short-listed story, "Coulrophobia", depicts the tragedy of a landlord whose marriage slowly collapses after he rents a spare apartment to an intrusive mime artist.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bellevue Literary Review]]'', Vol 5, No. 2, Fall 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Space Shuttle America.jpg|thumb|The shuttle sitting outside the [[Space Shuttle America]] ride is an example of a mockup]]
[[File:CCC-Google StreetView Attrappe - FSA09.jpg|thumb|[[Google Street View]] mockup in [[Freiheit statt Angst]] demonstration, Berlin, September 11, 2010]]

In [[manufacturing]] and [[design]], a '''mockup''', or '''mock-up''', is a [[scale model|scale]] or full-size model &lt;!-- NOTE: Don't link "model"; it is a disambiguation page, and there is no Wikipedia article with the breadht required for this usage of "model" --&gt; of a design or device, used for teaching, demonstration, design evaluation, promotion, and other purposes. A mockup is a ''[[prototype]]'' if it provides at least part of the functionality of a system and enables testing of a design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Vieru, Tudor |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/KSC-Gets-Orion-Mock-Up-for-Testing-103300.shtml |title=KSC Gets Orion Mock-Up for Testing |publisher=News.softpedia.com|date= 30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mock-ups are used by designers mainly to acquire feedback from users. Mock-ups address the idea captured in a popular engineering one-liner: You can fix it now on the drafting board with an eraser or you can fix it later on the construction site with a sledge hammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/mock-ups.html |title=Mock-ups |publisher=Interaction-design.org |date=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Mockups are used as [[design tool]]s virtually everywhere a new product is designed.

[[File:Boeing 2707 mock-up.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boeing 2707]] mockup at the [[Hiller Aviation Museum]] ]]Mockups are used in the automotive device industry as part of the product development process, where dimensions, overall impression, and shapes are tested in a [[wind tunnel]] experiment. They can also be used to test consumer reaction.

== Systems engineering ==
Mockups, [[website wireframe|wireframes]] and prototypes are not so cleanly distinguished in [[Software engineering|software]] and [[systems engineering]], where mockups are a way of designing [[user interface]]s on paper or in computer images. A software mockup will thus look like the real thing, but will not do useful work beyond what the user sees. A software prototype, on the other hand, will look and work just like the real thing. In many cases it is best to design or prototype the user interface before [[source code]] is written or hardware is built, to avoid having to go back and make expensive changes.

Early layouts of a World Wide Web site or pages are often called ''mockups''. A large selection of [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] or [[Open-source software|open-source]] software tools are available for this purpose.

== Military acquisition ==
Mockups are part of the [[military acquisition]] process.  Mockups are often used to test [[human factors]] and [[aerodynamics]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Todd, [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA490527&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf "Lessons Learned From Product Manager (PM) Infantry Combat Vehicle (ICV) Using Soldier Evaluation in the Design Phase"], ''ARMY AL&amp;T Magazine'', April–June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, mockups include [[wire-frame model]]s. They can also be used for public display and demonstration purposes prior to the development of a prototype, as with the case of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] mock-up aircraft.

== Consumer goods==
Mockups are used in the consumer goods industry as part of the product development process, where dimensions, human factors, overall impression, and [[commercial art]] are tested in [[marketing research]].

== Furniture and cabinetry ==
Mockups are commonly required by designers, architects, and end users for custom furniture and cabinetry.&lt;ref&gt;Jesberger, Lee A., [http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Mock_Ups.html "Mock Ups"], ''Pro Woodworking Tips'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Consumer Product Safety Commission|United States Consumer Product Safety Commission]], [http://www.cpsc.gov/LIBRARY/FOIA/meetings/mtg08/smoldering7_14.pdf "Log of Meeting: Demonstration of the Proposed Smoldering Test Procedures"], 14 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The intention is often to produce a full-sized replica, using inexpensive materials in order to verify a design. Mockups are often used to determine the proportions of the piece, relating to various dimensions of the piece itself, or to fit the piece into a specific space or room. The ability to see how the design of the piece relates to the rest of the space is also an important factor in determining size and design.

When designing a functional piece of furniture, such as a desk or table, mockups can be used to test whether they suit typical human shapes and sizes. Designs that fail to consider these issues may not be practical to use. Mockups can also be used to test color, finish, and design details which cannot be visualized from the initial drawings and sketches. Mockups used for this purpose can be on a reduced scale.

The cost of making mockups is often more than repaid by the savings made by avoiding going into production with a design which needs improvement.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

== Software engineering ==
The most common use of mockups in software development is to create user interfaces that show the end user what the software will look like without having to build the software or the underlying functionality. Software UI mockups can range from very simple hand drawn screen layouts, through realistic bitmaps, to semi functional user interfaces developed in a software development tool.

Mockups are often used to create [[Unit testing|unit tests]] - there they are usually called [[mock object]]s. The main reasons to create such mockups is to be able to test one part of a software system (a unit) without having to use dependent modules. The function of these dependencies is then "faked" using mock objects.

This is especially important if the functions that are simulated like this are difficult to obtain (for example because it involves complex computation) or if the result is non-deterministic, such as the readout of a sensor.

A common style of software design is [[Service-oriented architecture]] (SOA), where many components communicate via [[Communications_protocol|protocols]] such as [[HTTP]]. [[Service virtualization]] and [[Comparison of API simulation tools|API mocks and simulators]] are examples of implementations of mockups or so called over-the-wire [[Test_double|test doubles]] in [[Software system|software systems]] that are modelling dependent [[Component-based software engineering|components]] or [[Microservices|microservices]] in SOA environments.

Mockup software can also be used for micro level evaluation, for example to check a single function, and derive results from the tests to enhance the products power and usability on the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prototypingtool.com/mockups |title=Mockups |publisher=Prototypingtool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[File:Architectural Mockup.jpg|thumb|Architectural mockup for a new urbanist community in McKinney, Texas, US]]
At the beginning of a project's construction, architects will often direct contractors to provide material mockups for review.  These allow the design team to review material and color selections, and make modifications before product orders are placed. Architectural mockups can also be used for performance testing (such as water penetration at window installations, for example) and help inform the subcontractors how details are to be installed.

[[File:Philip-michael-faraday-1921.jpg|thumb|right|Philip Michael Faraday in 1921]]
'''Philip Michael Faraday''' (1 January 1875 – 6 February 1944) was an English lawyer, surveyor, composer, organist and theatrical producer.  He composed one of the last [[Savoy operas]], staged several long-running shows in the [[West End theatre|West End]] of London, and wrote a book about local taxation that was for many years the standard work on the subject.  After sustaining financial losses on shows that he produced in the 1910s, Faraday declared bankruptcy in 1914.  In later years, however, he rebuilt his fortune through his legal and valuation work and resumed theatrical production.

Faraday was born in Upper Holloway, London, the youngest of five children of Charles Adkins Faraday (1835–1913) and his wife Maria ''nee'' Bragg (1836–1930).   He married Elizabeth Mary Gale (1872–1950) in 1900, and the couple had four children: Stanley Michael (1902–1942), Yolande (b. 1904), Thelma (b. 1907) and Katharine Miriam.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Stephen Alan. [http://stephenandanji.co.uk/fam739.html "Family of Philip Michael Faraday and Elizabeth Mary Gale]. ''The Family History of Stephen Alan Fuller'', accessed 27 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early success===
Faraday first came to public notice in his capacity as a lawyer and valuation expert.  In 1896, at the age of 21, he published ''Rating:  Principles, Practice, Procedure'', a study of local property tax.&lt;ref&gt;Published by the ''[[Estates Gazette]]'', 1896, OCLC 559503771&lt;/ref&gt; This work became the standard book on its subject;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 19 July 1934, p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; there were three new editions in Faraday's lifetime and a further edition seven years after his death, revised by [[Arthur Comyns Carr|Sir Arthur Comyns Carr]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;New editions were published in 1903, 1910, 1934 and 1951&lt;/ref&gt; Faraday published other papers early in his career.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://books.google.com/books?id=EkXOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=%22Philip+Michael+Faraday%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jIFw5fQj28&amp;sig=oFtHMZ0OuAwDGm8IEs5IoKYaPHc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GOB3TJfdDYH7lwf02qHtCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Philip%20Michael%20Faraday%22&amp;f=false "The Rating of Engineering Undertakings"]. The Society of Engineers Journal, 5 April 1897, pp. 43–66, accessed 17 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and theatre===
Alongside his work as a specialist in property valuation, Faraday began to compose songs and light operas.  His songs include "Little princess, look up!" (1906), "Lovely woman" (1907), "I love somebody" (1910), "Jack the handy Man" (1910), "Maid o' mine" (1910) and "The Orphan Ward" (1910).  With the librettist Frederick Fenn, he composed ''Amāsis; or An Egyptian Princess'', a [[comic opera]] that opened in August 1906 at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kxYRAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Philip+Michael+Faraday%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z9Zt6cj7al&amp;sig=zlhWntnaTJAlPMwcsokn9mFqK6E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GOB3TJfdDYH7lwf02qHtCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Amāsis'' vocal score], showing the original cast list.  Metzler &amp; Co. (1906), accessed 27 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Fenn's libretto was rated above average, and ''[[The Times]]'' said of Faraday, "He has a sense of humour, and uses his orchestra ingeniously and artistically; his melodies are nearly always individual, sometimes extremely pleasant, and always well scored and supported."&lt;ref name=times&gt;''The Times'', 10 August 1906, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The English Illustrated Magazine'' wrote, "Mr. Faraday's work is admirable throughout, perhaps a trifle too reminiscent at times, and often very suggestive of [[Arthur Sullivan|Sir Arthur Sullivan]]'s work in this field ... but it is imaginative and vigorous."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QwMaGT17vPgC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=%22Philip+Michael+Faraday%22+compose&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PZpMF1mwkh&amp;sig=c9P3FsaMTbu6mFJlXWciy0z0z9w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L-d3TKiSIYWClAf5v5G0Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The London Stage"]. ''The English illustrated magazine'', Volume 36, p. 46, Macmillan and Co., 1907, accessed 27 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The cast included two popular former stars of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas, [[Ruth Vincent]] and [[Rutland Barrington]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; It ran for 200 performances, transferring to the [[Criterion Theatre]] during the run.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 3 February 1907, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; After it closed in London, the production was taken on tour.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'', 24 April 1907, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The-islander-scene.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Scene from ''The Islander'', 1910]]
Fenn and Faraday next collaborated on a one-act opera, ''[[A Welsh Sunset]]'', described by ''The Times'' as "a sentimental, even a sickly little piece."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 18 July 1908, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the libretto nor the score won critical approval.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 18 July 1908, p. 10; and ''The Manchester Guardian'', 18 July 1908, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was presented at the [[Savoy Theatre]] on 15 July 1908 as a [[curtain raiser (drama)|curtain raiser]] to ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' and later to ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', for a total of 85 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Walters and Lowe&lt;/ref&gt; Faraday's next stage piece was a [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]], ''The Islander'', staged at the [[Apollo Theatre]], with a libretto by Major Marshall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/playgoersocietyi02londuoft/playgoersocietyi02londuoft_djvu.txt ''The Playgoer and Society Illustrated''], Vol. 2, No. 8, p. 60, London: The Kinghurst Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;  The music received some praise from reviewers, but Marshall's libretto was thought inferior to Fenn's work.&lt;ref&gt;"At The Play – The Islander", ''[[The Observer]]'', 24 April 1910, p. 8; and ''The Times'', 25 April 1910, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The piece ran from 23 April to 6 August 1910.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 August 1910, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Another musical activity of Faraday's was as "Grand Organist of England" for the [[Freemasons]], a position to which he was appointed in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Henshaw&lt;/ref&gt;

As a producer, Faraday presented ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'' (1910), ''Nightbirds'' (1912), ''The Five Frankforters'' (described as a "Viennese banking comedy", 1912), ''[[The Girl in the Taxi]]'' (1912), ''The Girl Who Didn't'' (1913), and ''Mamzelle Tralala'' (1914), all at the [[Lyric Theatre, London|Lyric Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 29 April 1912, p. 12; and 12 February 1915, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Faraday's other theatrical ventures of this period included a melodrama, ''Within the Law'' (1913), co-produced with [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]],&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Monday, 26 May 1913, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Pink Lady'' (1912), a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show, which he presented in the British provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/09/19/100549123.pdf "Slap at Our Actors"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 19 September 1912, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'' and ''[[The Girl in the Taxi]]'' made large profits, other shows were produced at a loss.  Faraday sold his interest in the Lyric and was declared bankrupt in August 1914.  The bankruptcy was discharged in February 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 February 1915, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Faraday restored his fortunes by his successful work as an expert on rating and taxation. He became senior partner of Michael Faraday, Rodgers and Eller of [[Chancery Lane]], London, acting for large corporations such as the [[Port of London Authority]] and the Durham Coal Owners' Association.&lt;ref&gt;''Notable Londoners,'' p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; By 1921 he was sufficiently recovered financially to resume his theatrical activities, presenting ''The Wrong Number'', starring [[Yvonne Arnaud]] at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 13 August 1921, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he became licensee of the Duke of York's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 7 December 1921, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 he co-produced [[Arthur Wing Pinero|Sir Arthur Pinero]]'s new play, ''The Enchanted Cottage'', described by ''[[The Times]]'' as the most important theatrical event of the year.&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres. Sir A. Pinero's New Play", ''The Times'', 27 February 1922, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The play ran for only seven weeks, however, and Faraday gave up the tenancy of the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres. Future of The Duke of York's," ''The Times'', 20 April 1922, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Faraday continued his activities as a property valuer, working as a specialist for, among other companies, [[Harrods]] into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 March 1936, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in London at the age of 69.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 11 February 1944, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">The theme of '''poet as legislator''' reached its [[Grandiosity|grandiose]] peak in the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]],&lt;ref&gt;C. Prendergast ed., ''Cultural Materialism'' (1995) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; epitomised in the view of the lonely, alienated poet as 'unacknowledged legislator' to the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Holmes, ''Dr Johnson and Mr Savage'' (1994) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

However the concept had a long prehistory in Western culture, with classical figures like [[Orpheus]] or [[Solon]] being appealed to as precedents for the poet's civilising role.&lt;ref&gt;D. Griffin, ''Patriotism and Poetry in Eighteenth-Century Britain'' (2005) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical origins==

[[Plato]]'s opposition to poets in his ideal Republic was predicated on the contemporary existence of [[Homer]]ic expounders who claimed that "a man ought to regulate the tenour of his whole life by this poet's directions".&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Davies/D. J. Vaughan trans., ''The Republic of Plato'' (1908) p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Plato only allowed the already censured poet to guide the young, to be an acknowledged legislator at the price of total external control.&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Castle, ''Ancient Education and Today'' (1969) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Less threatened by the poetic role, the Romans by contrast saw poetry, with [[Horace]], as primarily pleasing, and only secondarily as instructive.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance and Augustan views==

Building the view of the fifteenth century Florentine [[Neoplatonism in the Renaissance|Neoplatonists]] on the poet as seer,&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; however, [[Sir Philip Sidney]] developed a more powerful concept of the poet as overtopping the philosopher, historian and lawyer to stand out as "the monarch...of all sciences.&lt;ref&gt;J. A van Dorsten ed, ''Sidney: A Defence of Poetry'' (1984) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a viewpoint was more or less institutionalised in [[Augustan literature]], Johnson's [[Rasselas]] maintaining for example that the poet "must write as the interpreter of nature and the legislator of mankind"&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Johnson, ''Rasselas'' (1905) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; – a fully public, even patriotic role moreover&lt;ref&gt;D. Griffin, ''Patriotism and Poetry in Eighteenth-Century Britain'' (2005) p. 71-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic peaks==

By contrast the Romantic view of the poet as ''unackowledged'' legislator emerges at the turm of the century in the writing of [[William Godwin]], with his anarchic view of the poet as "the legislator of generations and the moral instructor of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. A. Carlson, ''England's First Family of Writers'' (2007) p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

It received its most memorable formulation however in [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s 1820 "[[A Defence of Poetry]]".&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley maintained that, through their powers of imaginative understanding, 'Poets' (in the widest sense, of ancient Greece) were able to identify and formulate emerging socio-cultural trends; and were as a result "the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration...the unacknowledged legislators of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernist irony==

The grand claims of the Romantics began to give way in the twentieth century to a more ironic stance&lt;ref&gt;S. Chatterji, ''Memories of a Lost War'' (2001) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Yeats]] speaking for his calling in general when he wrote "We have no gift to set a statesman right".&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'' (1984) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

What remained of the Shelley claim was to be further diminished by [[Postmodernism]]'s distrust for grand narratives, if not perhaps destroyed entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/node/33792 Tools of the Sacred]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Smalltrade.JPG|thumbnail|right|400px|Early Scottish Trades Gravestone. Irvine.]]
The '''Scottish''' or '''Lowland Scottish gravestone''' is unique to the north of the [[British Isles]]. The study of [[Scottish Lowlands|Scottish Lowland]] [[Gravestones]] is essential to the overall study of British [[monumental inscription]]s. The level of symbolism and detail on Scottish stones reached a peak during the 18th century.

== Early tombs ==
The earliest [[tombs]] in Scotland are now lost. If [[Palaeolithic]] man ever set foot in that country, all traces have been wiped away. However, numerous [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] tombs, [[cairn]]s, [[chambered cairns]] and burial mounds have been discovered and studied. The [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s may have pioneered the concept of a modern [[graveyard]] for their remains have been found grouped together in much the same manner as today. In addition to using traditional burial methods, they would also create allotments for their dead. Iron Age burials are, however currently rare in Britain.

== Early church burials ==
[[Image:Ayr coffin.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|Medieval Stone Coffin on open-air display in Ayrshire]]British archaeological evidence indicates that the custom of burying the dead in or around a church began as early as the 8th century. By the early 12th century, [[Saxons]], [[Normans]] and [[County of Flanders|Flemish]] knights were given lands throughout [[Scotland]]. The new lords built chapels and churches on their new estates. With so many servants, beneficiaries and eventually Tenants, the Church land was soon used to bury the dead of the surrounding village.

== Pre-Reformation ==
[[Image:16thcent.JPG|thumbnail|left|100px|Slab stone dated 1586. Dreghorn Old Kirkyard.]]Very few pre-[[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] stones exist today and those that do are often removed from their original position and given care and shelter in a local museum. Medieval stone [[coffins]], or sarcophagi, are more abundant. 

Since 1457, it had been the habit to organise the local ''[[Wappenshaw]]'' (presenting [[weapon]]ry for inspection) in the local graveyards. The resulting wounds on the fine sandstone of many rare stones has left them defaced by the continuous bombardment of missiles.

== Post-Reformation ==
The 16th century, the century in which Scotland played host to her own [[Protestant Reformation]], was a quiet one for Scottish gravestones. It seems that they were seldom produced and are indeed a rare sight today in our old graveyards. More stones were produced in the 17th and 18th centuries.

== 17th-century stones ==
[[Image:Trade tools.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Trade Tools depicted on a 17th-century lowland Paisley Gravestone]]By the early 17th century, many ancient graveyards had become swollen with so many bodies that their lands were recognisable as burial grounds. Some sites have been subjected to an increase of several feet in height. By the middle of the century, we begin to see more identification marks on the stones. [[Heraldic devices]], [[craft tools]], symbols of [[Death|mortality]] and the name, date of birth and often the address of the deceased began to be crammed onto the limited surfaces of the stone.

One side of the headstone was dedicated to written identification while the other was to be used for symbolic expression. The symbolic elements would usually reveal the man's occupation while reminding the living viewer that he or she too must depart this earth sooner or later.

== 18th-century stones ==
[[Image:Dreghorn 2.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|18th-century Lowland Gravestone.]]Perhaps the most ambitious period of Headstone carving. Indeed, it was this century that the traditional headstone came to be used as standard. One fact that marks the Lowland Scottish Headstone as unique is that the Headstone took almost a century to penetrate into the highlands, where the older slab and table grave markers were still being used until shortly before the 19th century. The height of 18th-century Scottish Lowland Gravestones can be anywhere between 60&amp;nbsp;cm and 100&amp;nbsp;cm. Also unique to the Scottish Lowland gravestone are the materials. Sandstone is an easily carved but easily weathered rock but it was used as the standard gravestone material in the north of Britain. In the south, where marbles and granite were the preferred medium, we see an understandable hesitation on the part of the stonemason to overly decorate the hard stones of England.

18th-century Scottish gravestones are almost always oriented east to west. The part which contains the identification of the cadaver usually faces towards the [[Holy Land]]. Since most 18th-century were left relatively unadorned, the rear side of stone was frequently left unmarked. This is the side that invariably faced away from the Holy Land, towards the west. However, in many lowland graveyards, the side usually left unmarked is covered with extravagant designs.

[[File:19th century scottish gravestone.JPG|thumbnail|right|250px|19th-century ornate stone]]
In the mid-18th century, tradesman, craftsmen and tenant farmers found themselves in a time of prosperity. A direct result of this was the increase in carefully inscribed gravestones for the common folk.

== 19th-century stones ==
The 19th century saw almost all memorial permutations of the past come back with gusto. Wall monuments, crypts, headstones, table and slab stones and even replica Hog Backs were all common designs in Victorian Scotland. The introduction of the Cast-Iron Grave Marker would simply add yet another embellishment to an already decorative art form.

[[Image:stewart-perowne-writer.jpg|thumb|right|Stewart Perowne]]
'''Stewart Henry Perowne''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Venerable Order of Saint John|KStJ]], [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]], [[Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]] (17 June 1901 – 10 May 1989) was a British diplomat, archaeologist, explorer and historian who wrote books on the history and antiquities of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Despite his [[homosexuality]], in 1947 he married the explorer and travel writer [[Freya Stark]]. The marriage was dissolved in 1952.

==Early life==
Born in [[Hallow, Worcestershire]], into a distinguished ecclesiastical family, Stewart Perowne was the grandson of [[John Perowne]], the [[Bishop of Worcester]], and the son of Helena Frances (née Oldnall-Russell) (1869–1922) and [[Arthur William Thomson Perowne]], who was the first [[Bishop of Bradford (diocese)|Bishop of Bradford]] and subsequently also [[Bishop of Worcester]]. His older brother was Francis Edward Perowne (1898–1988). His younger brother, Leslie Arthur Perowne (1906–1997), was Head of Music at the [[BBC]] and was responsible for bringing [[Albert Ketèlbey]] out of retirement to conduct a huge BBC Ketèlbey Concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] prior to [[World War II]].

Perowne was educated at [[Haileybury College]], where he was a champion sprinter, and at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], where he studied Classical Archaeology and Architecture&lt;ref&gt;.[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUOvl9E3DRcC&amp;pg=PA295 Geniesse, Jane Fletcher ''Freya Stark Passionate Nomad'' Random House, Inc (2000) (p. 328) ''[[Google Books]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; He then studied at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he gained a graduate degree in Classics. He went to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1927 under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], as Head of Education in the Palestine Government Education Service, teaching at the [[Anglican]] St George's School in [[Jerusalem]]. He became fluent in spoken and written [[Arabic]]. In 1930 Perowne transferred to the administrative branch of the Palestine Government, working for a time as Assistant District Commissioner for [[Galilee]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;E. C. Hodgkin, 'Perowne, Stewart Henry (1901–1989)', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], [[Oxford University Press]] (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/57383, accessed 26 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 he was appointed an Officer of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/33728/pages/4072 Perowne in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' 23 June 1931 (p. 4072)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic career==
[[Image:stark-perowne-1947.jpg|thumb|right|Perowne and [[Freya Stark]] on their wedding day in 1947]]
He later served in Malta, Aden, Iraq, Barbados, Libya and Israel.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/16/obituaries/stewart-perowne-87-diplomat-and-author.html Perowne's obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' 16 May 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[King George VI Coronation Medal|Coronation Medal]] in 1937. In 1938 Perowne worked for the [[BBC]], preparing talks and features for transmission by the overseas Arabic service. In the same year he deposited a collection of [[potsherd]]s with the [[British Museum]], most of which are of [[Bronze Age]] type and probably derive from the ancient site of Subr.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt; In 1939 he was appointed Public Information Officer in Aden, where he developed a passion for archaeology, and where he discovered the seventh century BC sites of Imadiya and [[Beihan]].&lt;ref&gt;Perowne, Stewart 'Im'adiya and Beihan, Aden Protectorate', ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' No. 13 (1939), pp. 133–37)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 Perowne was appointed Public Relations Officer to the British embassy in [[Baghdad]]. In 1944 he succeeded the scholar [[Vyvyan Holt]] as oriental counsellor.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

During his diplomatic postings he designed stamps for [[Malta]] (1936), the [[Aden Protectorate]] (1938), [[Barbados]] (1949), [[Libya]] (1951), and currency notes for the [[West Indies Federation]] (1949) and Libya (1951).&lt;ref name=BM/&gt;

==Marriage==
Because of his career as a diplomat it was expected that Perowne should marry. As a homosexual he decided to embark on a [[mariage blanc]], and on 7 October 1947 he married the explorer and travel writer [[Freya Stark]] at St Margaret's church in [[Westminster]]. She was his senior by eight years and had been his assistant in [[Yemen]] when he was Information Officer. Stark's biographer has argued that she may not have known of Perowne's homosexuality, and of his taste for men in uniform.&lt;ref&gt;M. Izzard, Freya Stark: a biography (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geniesse, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/dec/05/biography2 'Travelling tales of a reluctant virgin' ''[[The Observer]]'' 5 December 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; "In 1947 people's sexual proclivities were still part of their private lives and … no one among Freya's friends seemed able to warn her of the pitfalls of marriage to a homosexual."&lt;ref&gt;Izzard, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Confused as to why Perowne would not sleep with her, she wrote to him, "I think you have left something lying between us, untold. Whatever it is, it will not make me think less of you or care less for you." Eventually, after skirting around the subject, he wrote to her:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is difficult to say what "normal" is – my friend a counsellor of St. George's Hospital always refuses to use the word and in both men and women, you have a wide and graded range from ultra-male to ultra-female with naturally most people in the middle ranges ... Now for myself, I put myself in the middle group. I have ordinary male abilities. I like male sports some of them, and I love the company of women. In fact, I find it hard to exist without it. At the same time, I am occasionally attracted by members of my own sex – generally. For some even pleasurable reason – by wearers of uniform.&lt;ref&gt;Geniesse, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite their similar interests the marriage could not survive and they divorced in 1952. There were no children.

'''Street painting''', also known '''pavement art''', '''street art''', and '''sidewalk art''', is the [[performance art]] of rendering artistic designs on [[Road surface|pavement]] such as streets, sidewalks, and town squares with impermanent and semi-permanent materials such as [[chalk]].

==Origin==
The origins of modern street painting can be traced to Britain. Pavement artists were found all over the United Kingdom and by 1890 it was estimated that more than 500 artists were making a full-time living from pavement art in London alone.

The British term for pavement artist is "screever". The term is derived from the writing style, often Copperplate, that typically accompanied the works of pavement artists since the 1700s. The term screever is most commonly cited as Shakespearean [[slang]] dating from around 1500.

The works of screevers often were accompanied by poems and proverbs, lessons on morality, and political commentary on the day’s events. They were described as "producing a topical, pictorial newspaper of current event."{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} They appealed to both the working people, who (on the whole) could not read or write, but understood the visual images; and to the educated members of the middle-classes who appreciated the moral lessons and comments. It was important for a screever to catch the eye of the ‘well to do’ and in turn attract the pennies donated for their efforts.

Street painters, (also called chalk artists) a name these performance artists are most commonly called in the United States are called ''I Madonnari'' in [[Italy]] (singular form: '''madonnaro''' or '''madonnara''') because they recreated images of [[the Madonna]]. In Germany '''''Strassenmaler''''' (streets: straßen, painter: maler).

The Italian Madonnari have been traced to the sixteenth century. They were itinerant artists, many of whom had been brought into the cities to work on the huge cathedrals.  When the work was completed, they needed to find another way to make a living, and thus often would recreate the paintings from the church onto the pavement. Aware of festivals and holy days held in each province and town, they traveled to join in the festivities to make a living from observers who would throw coins if they approved of the artist's work. For centuries, many Madonnari were folk artists, reproducing simple images with crude materials such as tiles, coal, and chalk. Others, such as [[El Greco]], would go on to become household names.

In 1973, street painting was being promoted in Italy by the formation of a two-day festival in [[Curtatone|Grazie di Curtatone]] in the Province of [[Mantua]].

In the 1980s, [[Kurt Wenner]] practiced '3-D pavement art', or one-point perspective art, otherwise known as anamorphic art, a 500-year-old technique, which appears in proper perspective only when viewed from a specific angle.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Festivals==

The first recorded street-painting competition and 'festival' was held in London in 1906.

In 1972 the first 'Italian' International Street Painting Competition was held in Grazie di [[Curtatone]], Italy. It is part of festival celebrating the Assumption with the streets of the city being turned over to the festival.

In 1987, Wenner and Manfred Stader introduced street painting to [[Mission Santa Barbara|Old Mission Santa Barbara]], California.

One of the largest events in the United States is the Lake Worth Street Painting Festival, held in Lake Worth Florida.  Started in 1994, it attracts 100,000 visitors over the weekend to see 250 works of art by over 400 artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetpaintingfestivalinc.org Lake Worth Street Painting Festival website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Rosy Loyola created Festival Bella Via in Monterrey, Mexico, which has launched several Mexican artists into the international street painting field.  Within the years it has become the most important street painting festival in Latin America.

Started in 2002, The Denver Chalk Art Festival on Larimer Square, located in Downtown Denver, is a free two-day street-painting festival. More than 200 artists spend hours during the weekend turning the streets of Larimer Square, into a museum of chalk art. The Festival is produced by the Larimer Arts Association, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting arts awareness and education in Denver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverchalkart.org/festival_info/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416020432/http://www.denverchalkart.org/festival_info/index.php |archivedate=2012-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Mark Wagner and 6,000 people (over 4,000 elementary school kids from Alameda, CA) set a Guinness World Record for the World's largest Pavement Art covering over 90,000 sq. ft. (8,361 sq. meters). A satellite photograph was taken of the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drawingonearth.org Drawing on Earth's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the First International Street Painting Festival held in the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pelicanpressonline.com/afterhours/features/105871718.html Walter, Nick, ''Ground-breaking street painting" Pelican Press,  October 27, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110614212534/http://www.pelicanpressonline.com/afterhours/features/105871718.html |date=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/americas-1st-international-street-painting-festival-brings-250-artists-from-around-the-world-to-downtown-sarasota-104793859.html ''America's 1st International Street-Painting Festival Brings 250 Artists From Around the World to Downtown Sarasota'']&lt;/ref&gt; was organized by Denise Kowal, president of the [[Avenida de Colores, Inc.]] 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation that produces the [[Sarasota Chalk Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chalkfestival.com Sarasota Chalk Festival website]&lt;/ref&gt; More than 250 street painters attended the [[Halloween]]-themed festival of 2010 that featured street painters from around the world and ran for eight and a half days.

At Sarasota's 2011 chalk festival Dutch artist Leon Keer and the team of Planet Streetpainting created the 3-D street painting of the Lego Terracotta Army.&lt;ref name="3d chalk drawing"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2061268/Artist-draws-Chinas-terracotta-army-chalk-street-art-LEGO-men.html], Artist Leon Keer created the eye-catching image of China's terracotta army, featuring soldiers made from Lego.&lt;/ref&gt; The chalk painting was inspired by Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang's [[Terracotta Army]] "in honor of the arrival of [[Ego Leonard]] and to support his release out of his custody.&lt;ref name="Free Ego"&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2011/11/07/lego-army-invades-chalkfestival-to-free-ego-leonard.html], Lego army invades Chalkfestival to "Free" Ego Leonard.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the 3-Way-Split Project produced the First Annual in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, United Kingdom. The city of Lake Worth Florida is cited as the source of inspiration, by the project director. Nine street artists from the United States came to Southend-on-Sea to support the launch of this new annual event. In 2012 the festival will be held on the second Saturday in September.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.streetpainting-southend.org {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924092524/http://www.streetpainting-southend.org/ |date=2012-09-24 }} International Street Painting &amp; Festival of the Arts&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daniel Hughes at Skywalker.JPG|thumb|200px|Daniel Hughes, conductor]]
[[File:The Choral Project at Skywalker.jpg|thumb|400px|Conductor Daniel Hughes and The Choral Project recording at [[Skywalker Sound]].]]
Based in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]], '''The Choral Project''' is a mixed-voice [[choir]] founded in 1996 by artistic director and conductor Daniel D. Hughes [http://danielhughesmusic.com].  The group's vision is ''"to heal our world through music and words,"'' while their mission is ''"to connect to one another through choral theater, education and musical excellence."''

The Choral Project's repertoire is broad and diverse, ranging from [[Bach]], [[Debussy]], and [[Brahms]] to modern composers like [[Kirke Mechem]], Rene Clausen, [[Michael Ostrzyga]], Stephen Jackson and [[Eric Whitacre]].  They have performed in Washington D.C.'s [[National Cathedral]], San Francisco's [[Mission Dolores]] Basilica, Mission Santa Clara de Asís, Santa Cruz' [[Mission Santa Cruz|Holy Cross Church]], and multiple venues in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Costa Rica]], and [[Mexico]].  During their 2001 tour, The Choral Project appeared live on Mexican National Radio. In 2004, the ensemble competed in the Mixed Choir division of the Llangollen International Eisteddfod in Wales, coming away with a second-place finish. In 2007, while competing against six choirs from around the world at the California International Choral Festival &amp; Competition in San Luis Obispo, CA, the group placed in all three categories - 1st place in the Choir's Choice category, 2nd place in the Required Music category and 3rd in the Folk Music category.

Every season, The Choral Project uses one concert to focus on an important social issue. For example, in February 2017 the choir performed [[Street Requiem]] with mezzo soprano [[Frederica von Stade]] to highlight the issue of homelessness. The [[Santa Cruz Sentinel]] wrote, "The piece, said the 53-voice Choral Project’s artistic director Daniel Hughes, addresses issues of what it’s like to live on the streets and assumes the voice of the homeless in confronting the audience, 'Why do you ignore me when you leave the concert hall?'”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/arts-and-entertainment/20170215/choral-project-presents-meditation-on-homelessness|title=Choral Project presents meditation on homelessness|date=15 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, The Choral Project has released eight albums: ''The Cycle of Life'', ''Of Christmastide'', ''Americana'', ''Water &amp; Light'' (the group’s #1 best seller on the Clarion label), ''Winter'', ''One is the All'', ''Tell the World'', and most recently ''Yuletide'', a festive collection of holiday favorites.

The Choral Project also performs on the San José Chamber Orchestra recording of the dramatic oratorio ''[[Choose Life, Uvacharta Bachayim]]'', by composer [[Mona Lyn Reese]] and librettist Delores Dufner, OSB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sjco.org/collaborations/|title=Collaborations – San Jose Chamber Orchestra|website=sjco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Choral Project is also a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]] organization involved in community outreach, including a choral mentorship program for local high school students, joint performances with visiting choirs and an annual Choral Composition Contest for high school students and undergraduates.

'''''The Gruffalo's Child''''' by [[Julia Donaldson]] and [[Axel Scheffler]] is the bestselling sequel to ''[[The Gruffalo]]''.

The story is about the Gruffalo's child (a daughter) who, despite her father's warning, sets off into the "deep dark wood" to find the "big bad mouse", the only thing her father is afraid of.

During her winter journey, she encounters the tracks of snake, owl, and fox from ''The Gruffalo'', each of whom she first suspects to be the "big bad mouse", but who in turn tell her where she can find the real "big bad mouse". Eventually, concluding she has been tricked by the animals (and perhaps her father), she sadly admits that she "doesn't believe in the 'big bad mouse{{'"}}.

At this point, she encounters the little mouse from ''The Gruffalo'', who previously tricked her father. The mouse invites her to meet the "big bad mouse", which he re-creates by using moonlight to project a tremendously enlarged, fearsome shadow. Believing the shadow to belong to the real "big bad mouse", the Gruffalo's child flees and returns to the Gruffalo cave with faith in her father restored.

The story repeats the "brains over brawn" theme, the creatures, and the easily flowing rhyme scheme ([[tetrameter]]) of its predecessor, ''The Gruffalo''.

'''''The Love Letter''''' ({{lang-nl|De liefdesbrief}}) is a 17th-century [[genre painting]] by [[Jan Vermeer]].  The painting shows a servant maid handing a letter to a young woman with a [[cittern]].  The painting is in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]].

==Description==
The tied-up [[curtain]] in the foreground creates the impression that the viewer is looking at an intensely private, personal scene.  There is also an element of [[trompe l'oeil]] as Dutch paintings were often hung with little curtains to conserve them, and the device of painted curtains is seen in other Dutch works of the period.  The [[diagonal]]s on the chequered floor create the impression of depth and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensionality]]. The fact that it is a [[love letter]] that the woman has received is made clear by the fact that she is carrying a lute (more specifically, a [[cittern]], a member of the lute/guitar family).  The lute was a symbol of love - often carnal love; ''luit'' was also a slang term for [[vagina]].  This idea is further reinforced by the [[slipper]]s at the very bottom of the picture.  The removed slipper was another symbol of sex.  The [[brush|floor brush]] would appear to represent domesticity, and its placement at the side of the painting may suggest that domestic concerns have been forgotten or pushed aside.

The colors blue and gold are important in the composition of the painting - the gold is located on the woman's dress, the top of the fireplace, and many of the objects, which complements the blue on the floor, the maid's dress, the picture frames, etc. Classical influence is also apparent in the ionic columns of the fireplace.

The two [[painting]]s on the wall are also significant.  The lower painting is of a stormy [[sea]], a clear metaphor for tempestuous love.  Above it is a landscape painting of a traveler on a sandy road.  This may refer to the absence of the man who is writing to the lady.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick de Rynck, How to Read a Painting: Lessons from the Old Masters (Abrams: New York, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
In the second half of the 17th century, the painting probably found its place in the collection of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s monarch [[John III Sobieski]].&lt;ref name=Drecka/&gt; The 1696 inventory of the [[Wilanów Palace]] in [[Warsaw]] lists among Dutch paintings "a painting of a lady, playing a lute in a golden robe, while a girl gives her a letter in the black frames (obraz damy, grającej na lutni w złotej szacie, a dziewczyna list jey oddaje w ramach czarnych)".&lt;ref name=Drecka/&gt;

==Theft==
On September 23, 1971, the painting was stolen from its display at The [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels]], where it was on loan from the Rijksmuseum. The thief, 21-year-old Mario Pierre Roymans, had locked himself in an electrical closet till the museum was closed. He then took the painting off the wall and tried to escape out of a window. However, when the frame failed to fit through the window, he cut the canvas from its frame with a potato peeler and hid the strip in his back pocket. Roymans first concealed the painting in his room at his place of work, The Soetewey (or Soete-Wey) Hotel. Later he buried it in a forest, but when it started to rain, he recovered it and hid it in his room inside his pillowcase.

Roymans is thought to have been motivated by news of the bloodshed, rape, and murder in the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]]. On October 3, 1971, using the name "Tijl van Limburg" (a character similar to [[Robin Hood]]), Roymans contacted the Brussels newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'' and asked for a reporter to meet him in a forest with a camera. He drove the reporter, blindfolded, to a church and unveiled the painting from a white cloth cover. After letting the reporter take photos of the canvas in the car's headlights, he drove him back. He told the reporter that he actually loved art, but also loved humanity. After the encounter, the pictures were published, alongside Roymans' conditions: 200 million Belgian francs to be given to famine-stricken Bengali refugees in East Pakistan. Roymans also requested the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels organize campaigns in their respective countries to raise money to combat world famine. Roymans set the deadline for Wednesday, October 6.

The police took the photographs as evidence and asked an art expert to validate that they were of the actual painting. It was confirmed they were, but immediately after the confirmation, the director of the Rijksmuseum, [[Arthur van Schendel]] said that the photos were not sufficient proof of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/fakes_thefts_school_of_delft_lost_sp/vermeer_theft_01.html#.WPUAG1MrLVo|title=Vermeer Thefts: The Love Letter|first=Jonathan|last=Janson|website=www.essentialvermeer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days Roymans continued to make contact with the media; when he was finally apprehended by police, on the day of his deadline, he was trying to call a news station. 

The painting was returned to the Rijksmuseum on October 8 but wasn't announced to the public until October 11. It was in very poor condition after being cut out of its stretcher bars and frame. The restoration took almost a year. Roymans was given a court fine and sentenced to two years in prison, but only served six months in the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/wide-angle/vermeer-thefts-1971-the-love-letter-137680|title=Vermeer Thefts: 1971-The Love Letter|date=4 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Odyssey Symphony''''' is [[Robert W. Smith (musician)|Robert W. Smith]]'s second [[symphonic band]] [[symphony]].  Smith had studied both the [[Odyssey]] and [[Dante]]'s [[Divine Comedy]] at Troy University.  

The symphony contains, in total, four movements, each being noted for having intricate and imaginitive percussive and wind effects.  They are as follows:

==Movement One:  "The Iliad"==
Subtitled "...in the 10th Year of the Trojan War", this piece retells the story of the incredible victory of the Greeks against the Trojans, using the famous "Trojan Horse".  The movement opens with call-and-response horn duet and motif that is prominent in both this and the fourth movement.  This quickly broadens into a majestic fanfare, another recurring theme in the piece, which in reality serves as a sort of theme for Odysseus.  The final sustained note of the fanfare decrescendoes into yet another motif:  a flute/horn duet backed by a harp (usually on synthesizer), playing their own call-and-response/echo theme.  The full band returns with the fanfare before entering an aggressive section:  the woodwinds play rapid alternating triplet patterns while the brass re-enter with an entirely new, even more menacing theme.  This new theme reaches its climax and quickly repeats its first part before a rapid woodwind descent which sets the tone for the second part of the movement, "The Trojan Horse".  Like in many of his pieces, Smith has used unusual percussion instruments and effects to achieve a certain mode and image.  In this piece, he has instructed the cymbal players to grind the edge of one cymbal into the inner dome of the other, producing the sound of the squeaky wheel.  While the Greeks wheel the horse into the city, the flute/duet melody returns briefly, highlighted by an ominous clarinet choir.  The music eventually fades away, and a second effect initiates:  The "Fire" effect involves members of the band crinkling paper gently while brake drums provoke a sword fight.  The "fire" quickly spreads across the band, eventually coming to the crescendo which reintroduces the "Aggressive" theme, albeit with  more triumphant feel.  This slightly-modified theme brings the band to its final, victorious climax.  If the band is transitioning to movement II, "The Winds of Poseidon", an optional ''fine'' is supplied, in which the flute/horn duet is repeated one more time with a different ending.

==Movement Two: "The Winds of Poseidon"==

{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

==Movement Three: "The Isle of Calypso"==
This movement picks up with Odysseus lamenting as he is stranded on the strange island belonging to the goddess Calypso.  Here, he can have anything he wants, even immortality, but he is never truly happy, as he remembers that he promised his beloved Penelope that they would grow old and die together.  After a full year, Zeus and Hermes finally persuade the saddened Calypso to let Odysseus go free, so that he can once more rule Ithaca.  This song captures the hero's woes during his time on the island.

This lyrical piece, the emotional climax of the symphony, opens with a special "Clock" effect, which can be achieved in various ways (knocking pieces of wood back and forth against each other, amplifying the sounds of a real antique clock, etc.).  A prominent cymbal scrape leads to the entrance of an Ocean drum, while the piano begins the background theme.  A mournful English Horn solo introduces the main theme of the piece, and is soon joined by a euphonium duet and the rest of the winds.  The song reaches a fake climax, before descending back into the original English Horn melody.  A flashback to the flute/horn duet in the first movement is featured, and this leads into the buildup of the band.  Finally, the climax is reached, with "soaring" woodwind lines coupled by the brass/saxophone solo.  The band joins together for a final melancholy re-statement of the English horn solo, which resumes after a dramatic fermata.  Finally, this, too, lets go, and all that is left is the waves lapping on the shore (the ocean drum) the clock ticking away (the "Clock" effect) and the tolls of the clock bells (these can either be made by tubular bells, handbells, a synthesizer, or cut helium tanks).

==Movement Four: Ithaca==
The final movement of Symphony No. 2 sharply contrasts "The Isle of Calypso" in various ways, bringing about a conclusion to the work.  The piece opens with a tense, suspenseful piano/chimes/triangle trio, interrupted at certain points by the return of the English Horn from movement 3.  After a few seconds, the tense mood subsides as the ocean drums enter and a horn duo repeat the motif that opened the symphony itself.  However, this familiarity subsides almost as quickly as the tenseness of the opening, giving way to a dramatic brass melody.  The horns continue this melody, accentuated by blasts from the rest of the band, and then all parts crescendo into the upbeat, adventurous first section.  This section is made even more epic by the fact that various parts pass the melodies between them, from the horns and saxophones to the oboes to the euphoniums.  The entire section is constantly punctuated by "biting" brass lines and unique flute/piccolo melodies which soar over the rest of the melodies and draw them back into the original dramatic theme.  Finished off by a triumphant, very short fanfare, the sections decrescendo much like they did in movements 1 and 2 as the piece enters its second section.  Smith uses a spring drum, wind wands, and wind whistles to simulate the sound of a bow being strung and arrows being released, all topped off by repetitions of "Odysseus' Theme" (the horn duet).  As the winds whistles and wind wands continue playing, [[Bodhrán|bodhráns]] and brake drums simulate the sounds of battle, which lead into the third section.  The third section begins with a repeat of the "Aggressive" theme, once again modified, from the first movement.  Although the brass play a melody reminiscent of the first part of the song, a series of chromatic triplets lead the band back into the "Victorious" theme from movement 1.  As the chimes mimic the sound of "all the bells of Ithaca", the roaring fanfare that originally opened the symphony returns to close it, with a modified ending in which the whole band brings the song to a roaring conclusion.

==Notes==
* Like many of Smith's compositions, three of the four movements follow a distinct pattern:  an opening solo, followed by a fast theme, a slow theme, and another fast theme (similar to an overture).
*All four movements feature at least one distinct percussive effect that gives the piece added emotion.
*All four movements also begin and end in either the key of B-flat or its relative minor, with few key changes during the piece.
*In his programming notes, Mr. Smith acknowledges that the continuity of the piece compared to Homer's original epic has been altered slightly, with "The Winds of Poseidon" coming before "The Isle of Calypso".  He notes that he did this to provide further contrast between the mournful third movement and the action-filled fourth movement, and states that the order of the two middle movements may be switched should the conductor desire to do so.

==Percussive Effects==
# The Iliad
#; The "Groaning and Squeaky Wheel" effect
#: In order to simulate the giant Trojan Horse being wheeled into the city, two cymbals are placed in a perpendicular arrangement while the percussionist grinds the edge of one into the inner dome of the other. Two pairs of cymbals are scored in order to produce the sound of wheels on either end of the stage.
#; The "Fire" effect
#: As the city of Troy burns, the band softly crumples pieces of paper, "sweeping across the band" as necessary to produce a realistic "fire".
# The Winds of Poseidon
#; "Lightning" effect
#: Smith advises that an extra-large thundersheet be used during the first part of the second movement in order to enhance the effect of deep, rumbling thunder and flashing lightning.
#; "Siren" effect
#: When Odysseus hears the singing of the sirens, the percussion section uses toy "spinning tubes" cut to produce the B-flat, E-flat and F pitches in order to create an eerie effect.
# The Isle of Calypso
#; "Clock" effect
#: Used to symbolize the passing of time on Calypso's island, there are various ways of producing this effect. Smith suggests knocking a piece of wood between two wooden boxes with holes cut in them, or amplifying the ticking of an antique clock. The tolling of the bells may be produced by a set of chimes, a synthesizer, or even two helium tanks cut to sound a third apart.
# Ithaca
#; "Odysseus and the Arrow"
#: To produce the sound of arrows being released/flying by, the percussion section strikes a spring drum with a large triangle beater and bends a timpani pitch up as the bow is strung. When the arrows fly by, wind whistles and wind wands play in rapid succession, creating the illusion of arrows whizzing by at high speeds.

'''''Time orders Old Age to destroy Beauty''''' is a 1746 [[allegory|allegorical]] oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist [[Pompeo Batoni]]. It was commissioned from him by Bartolomeo Talenti, a collector from [[Lucca]], as a pendant for ''La lascivia'', now in the [[Hermitage Museum]]. It shows personifications of Time as an old man with a scythe, Old Age as an old woman and Beauty as a young woman. It came into the collection of the Russian count [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Kushelev-Bezborodko]], before being acquired in 1961 by the [[National Gallery, London]] where it now hangs.

'''''View of the World from 9th Avenue''''' (sometimes '''''A [[parochialism|Parochial]] New Yorker's View of the World''''', '''''A New Yorker's View of the World''''' or simply '''''View of the World''''') is a 1976 illustration by [[Saul Steinberg]] that served as the cover of the March 29, 1976, edition of ''[[The New Yorker]]''. The work presents the view from [[Manhattan]] of the rest of the world showing Manhattan as the center of the world.

''View of the World'' has been parodied by [[Ted Rall]], [[Columbia Pictures]], ''The New Yorker'', ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Mad Magazine]]'', among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/printedition/2009-03-21|title=How China sees the world|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work has been imitated and printed without authorization in a variety of ways. The Columbia parody led to a ruling by the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] in ''[[Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.]]'' in favor of Steinberg because of [[copyright]] violations by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The work is regarded as one of the greatest magazine covers of recent generations and is studied by art students around the world.

==Background==
Saul Steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and illustrations for ''The New Yorker'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/14/news/mn-37147|title=Saul Steinberg; Artist Best Known for Covers and Cartoons in the New Yorker|accessdate=October 4, 2012|date=May 14, 1999|author=Woo, Elaine|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; including its March 29, 1976 cover, titled "View of the World from [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|9th Avenue]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/The-New-Yorker-Cover-View-of-the-World-from-9th-Avenue-March-29-1976-Prints_i8553097_.htm|title=The New Yorker Cover, View of the World from 9th Avenue|accessdate=October 4, 2012|date=March 29, 1976|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]] and Art.com, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is regarded as his most famous work. It is considered an example of unintentional fame: Steinberg has noted that the type of fame that resulted from the work has diminished his significance to "the man who did that poster".&lt;ref name=LaM&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjB-myUQCegC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=view+of+the+world+from+9th+avenue+poster&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KXu_E4fVKr&amp;sig=h2joJfj-zO-TS7w1GAcLNOYQrqA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UMttUOXfC4bY9ATQiYGQAQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=view%20of%20the%20world%20from%209th%20avenue%20poster&amp;f=false|title=Look at Me!: The Fame Motive from Childhood to Death|publisher=University of Michigan Press|author=Brim, Orville Gilber|year=2009|page=41|isbn=978-0472050703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is sometimes referred to as ''A [[parochialism|Parochial]] New Yorker's View of the World'' or ''A New Yorker's View of the World'' because it depicts a map of the world as seen by [[narcissism|self-absorbed]] New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2008/07/15/DI2008071501374.html|title=The New Yorker Cover and the Challenge of Satire|accessdate=October 4, 2012|date=July 15, 2008|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Kennicott, Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LEAtVA&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8AddekkdZ8C&amp;pg=PA548&amp;lpg=PA548&amp;dq=%22A+Parochial+New+Yorker%27s+View+of+the+World%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CXrwlEXSj0&amp;sig=_1QGJJSP1A8sVz45S_r5UcrgVM0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=stBtUNb0OoKW8gTgmIGQAw&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Parochial%20New%20Yorker%27s%20View%20of%20the%20World%22&amp;f=false|title=Law, Ethics, And the Visual Arts|year=2007|author=Merryman, John Henry, Albert Edward Elsen, and Stephen K. Urice|isbn=978-9041125187|page=548|publisher=Kluwer Law International}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point ''The New Yorker'' applied for a copyright from the [[United States Copyright Office]] for the work. It assigned the copyright to Steinberg and subsequently reproduced posters of the painting.&lt;ref name=LEAtVA/&gt;

==Detail==
The illustration is split in two parts, with the bottom half of the image showing [[Manhattan]]'s 9th Avenue, [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|10th Avenue]], and the [[Hudson River]] (appropriately labeled), and the top half depicting the rest of the world. It is a westward view over 10th Avenue.  The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a rectangle bounded by North American neighbors [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]], with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing [[New Jersey|"Jersey"]], the names of five cities ([[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]; [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]; and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]) and three states ([[Texas]], [[Utah]], and [[Nebraska]]) scattered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey, which is in bolder font than the rest of the country beyond the Hudson. Washington, D.C. is depicted as a remote location near Mexico. The Pacific Ocean, slightly wider than the Hudson, separates the United States from three flattened land masses labeled China, Japan and Russia. The image depicts the world with a back turned to [[Europe]], which is absent from the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/72-the-world-as-seen-from-new-yorks-9th-avenue|title=72 - The World As Seen From New York's 9th Avenue |accessdate=October 4, 2012|date=February 7, 2007|work=big think|author=Jacobs, Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is composed in ink, pencil, [[colored pencil]], and [[watercolor]] on paper and measures {{convert|28|x|19|in|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saulsteinbergfoundation.org/gallery_24_viewofworld.html|title=View of the World from 9th Avenue, 1976|accessdate=October 4, 2012|publisher=SaulSteinbergFoundation.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129120540/http://www.saulsteinbergfoundation.org/gallery_24_viewofworld.html|archive-date=November 29, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When exhibiting this work along with alternate versions and sketches, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] summarized the work as a "bird's-eye view of the city from Ninth Avenue in a straight line westward, with space becoming ever more condensed..." They also described the work as a [[tongue-in-cheek]] view of the world.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/v42/n11/back.html|title=Saul Steinberg|accessdate=October 4, 2012|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|work=Almanac|author=Leymarie, Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''  interpreted the New York-centric mind's view of the rest of the world as a set of [[outer boroughs]] as iconic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=65opAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22view+of+the+world+from+9th+avenue%22+poster&amp;dq=%22view+of+the+world+from+9th+avenue%22+poster&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kzQVCCFMX8&amp;sig=1hEMEhqXYJS270Ta40V8tdP89-E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OY5uUPP7HIq69QS49YHQAw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ|title=New York|volume=39|page=96|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[National Post]]'' journalist [[Robert Fulford (journalist)|Robert Fulford]] described the perspective as one in which the entire world is a suburb of Manhattan.&lt;ref name=Apot/&gt;

==Parodies==
''View of the World'' has been imitated without authorization in a variety of ways.&lt;ref name=LaM/&gt; The work has been imitated in postcard format by numerous municipalities, states and nations.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt; Steinberg had stated that he could have retired on royalties from the many parodies made of the painting, had they been paid, a motivation for his eventual copyright lawsuit for the ''Moscow on the Hudson'' use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boxer |first1=Sarah |title=Saul Steinberg, Epic Doodler, Dies at 84 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/13/arts/saul-steinberg-epic-doodler-dies-at-84.html?pagewanted=3 |accessdate=March 19, 2015 |work=New York Times|date=May 13, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fulford, writing in The ''[[National Post]]'', noted that the metaphor of the world as a suburb of Manhattan was "understood and borrowed" by the whole world. Local artists, especially poster artists, presented similarly compelling depictions of their own provincial perceptions. Fulford demonstrated the prominence of this work by mentioning that a high school in suburban [[Ottawa]] made imitating ''View of the World'' an assignment in its [[graphic arts]] class. He also noted that the result of this assignment was a worldwide variety of global foci from which the students viewed the world.&lt;ref name=Apot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertfulford.com/2005-06-21-steinberg.html|title=A 'parody of talent': A new book posits that Saul Steinberg did for art what James Joyce did for literature |accessdate=October 5, 2012|date=June 21, 2005|publisher=RobertFulford.com|author=Fulford, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illustration—humorously depicting New Yorkers' self-image of their place in the world, or perhaps outsiders' view of New Yorkers' self-image—inspired many similar works, including the poster for the [[1984 in film|1984 film]] ''[[Moscow on the Hudson]]''; that movie poster led to a lawsuit, ''[[Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.]]'', 663 F. Supp. 706 ([[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|S.D.N.Y.]] 1987), which held that [[Columbia Pictures]] violated the [[copyright]] Steinberg held on his work.

On June 5, 2003, during the first term of [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Presidency of George W. Bush|presidency]], [[Ted Rall]] presented ''A View of the World from Pennsylvania Avenue'' as a parody of ''View of the World from 9th Avenue'' in a [[Universal Press Syndicate]] [[editorial cartoon]]. He replaced the letters representing ''The New Yorker'' with ''The Bushie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilpost.it/2012/04/05/steinberg-new-yorker/a-view-of-the-world-from-pennsylvania-avenue/|title=A View of the World from Pennsylvania Avenue|publisher=[[Universal Press Syndicate]]/[[:it:Il Post|Il Post]]|author=Rall, Ted|accessdate=October 5, 2012|date=June 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover was later satirized by Barry Blitt for the cover of ''The New Yorker'' on October 6, 2008. The cover featured [[Sarah Palin]] looking out of her window seeing only Alaska, with Russia in the far background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=New Yorker Cover – June 10, 2008|url=http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/The-New-Yorker-Cover-October-6-2008-Prints_i8482999_.htm|title=New Yorker Cover – 10/6/2008 at The New Yorker Store|publisher=Newyorkerstore.com|date=October 6, 2008|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The March 21, 2009 ''[[The Economist]]'' included a story entitled "How China sees the World"  that presents a parody that is also an homage to the original image, but depicting the viewpoint from Beijing's [[Chang'an Avenue]] instead of Manhattan. A caption above the illustration reads "Illustration by [[Jon Berkeley]] (with apologies to steinberg and ''The New Yorker'')". It accompanied an article that discussed the burgeoning Chinese economy at the time of [[2007–2012 global financial crisis|the contemporary financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13326106|title=How China sees the world: And how the world should see China |publisher=Economist.com|date=March 21, 2009|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The October 1, 2012 cover of ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' satirized the problems with the September release of [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iOS 6]] [[mobile operating system]] which included [[Apple Maps]], a replacement for [[Google Maps]].&lt;ref name=VotWf9AasoAM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2012/10/02/mad-magazine-apple-maps-parody/|title=View of the World from 9th Avenue... as seen on Apple Maps|accessdate=October 4, 2012|date=October 2, 2012|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Busis, Hillary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AMWHwNYC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madmagazine.com/blog/2012/10/01/apple-maps-wreak-havoc-with-new-yorker-cover|title=Apple Maps Wreak Havoc with New Yorker Cover|accessdate=October 4, 2012|date=October 1, 2012|work=[[Mad Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work presents what ''View of the World'' might look like if one had relied upon the September 2012 version of Apple Maps to locate various landmarks.&lt;ref name=VotWf9AasoAM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57524671-1/the-new-yorkers-view-from-9th-avenue-via-apple-maps/|title=The New Yorker's view from 9th Avenue -- via Apple Maps|accessdate=October 5, 2012|date=October 2, 2012|publisher=[[CNET]]|author=Mack, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical review==
On October 17, 2005, [[American Society of Magazine Editors]] unveiled its list of the top 40 magazine covers of the prior 40 years and ranked ''View of the World from 9th Avenue'' in fourth place. The listing stated that the work "...has come to represent Manhattan's telescoped perception of the country beyond the Hudson River. The cartoon showed the supposed limited mental geography of Manhattanites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magazine.org/asme/magazine-cover-contests/asmes-top-40-magazine-covers-last-40-years|title=ASME's Top 40 Magazine Covers of the Last 40 Years|accessdate=October 4, 2012|date=October 17, 2005|publisher=[[American Society of Magazine Editors]]|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Hansen, Chad. (1983). (see above). There are no articles in Chinese, so the nouns must be read as collectives, mass nouns or plurals. The argument is about the use of terms hence belongs to the school of names. It is not about the color of horses.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13196">'''When A White Horse Is Not A Horse''' ({{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|w=''Pai-ma fei ma''|l=white horse not horse}}), also known as the '''White Horse Dialogue''' ({{zh|c=白馬論|p=''Báimǎ Lùn''|w=''Pai-ma Lun''|l=white horse discourse}}), is a famous paradox in [[Chinese philosophy]]. [[Gongsun Long]] wrote this circa 300 BC dialectic analysis of the question 'Is "white horse not horse" permissibly assertible?'.

==The original text==
[[File:Cabalo044eue.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Is it a horse?]]
The White Horse Dialogue (''Baima Lun'') constitutes chapter 2 of the [[eponymous]] ''Gongsun Longzi'' "Master Gongsun Long", who was counted among the "[[School of Names]]" (aka "Logicians" or "Dialecticians") in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]. Most of Gongsun's writings have been lost and the received ''Gongsun Longzi'' text only contains 6 of the supposedly 14 original chapters. Parts of the text are dislocated and some commentators and translators rearrange them for clarity. The dialogue is between two unnamed speakers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is "{{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|l=white horse not horse}}" assertible?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: It is.&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: How?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: "Horse" is that by means of which one names the shape. "White" is that by means of which one names the color. What names the color is not what names the shape. Hence, one may "white horse not horse."&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: If there are white horses, one cannot say that there are no horses. If one cannot say that there are no horses, doesn't that mean that there are horses? For there to be white horses is for there to be horses. How could it be that the white ones are not horses?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: If one wants horses, that extends to yellow or black horses. But if one wants white horses, that does not extend to a yellow or black horses. Suppose that white horses were horses. Then what one wants [in the two cases] would be the same. If what one wants were the same, then 'white' would not differ from 'horse.' If what one wants does not differ, then how is it that yellow or black horses are acceptable in one case and unacceptable in the other case? It is clear that acceptable and unacceptable are mutually contrary. Hence, yellow and black horses are the same, one can respond that there are horses, but one cannot respond that there are white horses. Thus, it is evident that white horses are not horses.&lt;ref name="readings"&gt;[[Gongsun Long]]zi. (2005). {{Google books|5PL9hSUiVEoC|''Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy,'' pp. 364–365|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This dialogue continues with deliberations over colored and colorless horses and whether "white" and "horse" can be separated from "white horse".

Other ''Gongsun longzi'' chapters discuss ''Baima''-related concepts of ''jian'' [[Wikt:堅|堅]] "hard; hardness" and ''bai'' [[Wikt:白|白]] "white; whiteness", ''ming'' [[Wikt:名|名]] "name; term" and ''shi'' [[Wikt:實|實]] "solid; true, actual; fact, reality", and abstract ''zhi'' [[Wikt:指|指]] "finger; pointing; designation; [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]" like "whiteness" and concrete ''wu'' [[Wikt:物|物]] "thing; object; [[particular]]" like a "white horse".

==Difficulties of interpretation==
The Chinese of "a white horse is not a horse" is ''bai ma fei ma'' 白馬非馬, whose meaning hinges upon the [[Negation (rhetoric)|negative]] ''fei'' [[Wikt:非|非]] "not, is not; no, negative; oppose; wrong". The Classical construction "A ''fei'' B" "A非B" can ambiguously mean either "A is not a member of the class B" or "A is not identical to B".&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this [[equivocation]] fallacy, [[A.C. Graham]] says this "white horse" vs. "horse" paradox plays upon the ambiguity of whether "is" means:
# "Is a member of the [[Class (philosophy)|class]] (x)"
# "Is identical to  (x)"&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"/&gt;

In other words, the expression "a white horse is not a horse" is ambiguous between "a white horse is not identical with a horse" (true, because "white horse" is more specific than "horse"), and "a white horse is not a member of the set of horses" (obviously false). The Advocate in the dialogue is asserting that "a white horse is not [identical with] a horse," while the Objector is interpreting the Advocate's statement as "a white horse is not [a member of the group of] horses."

An illustration of the alternative uses of "fei" may be found in the widely known "Happiness of Fish" dialogue in ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (17, tr. Watson 1968:188-9). Huizi says "You're not a fish [子非魚] &amp;mdash; how do you know what fish enjoy?" (denying that Zhuangzi is a member of the class of fish) and Zhuangzi replies "You're not I [子非我], so how do you know I don't know what fish enjoy?" (denying that the individuals Huizi and Zhuangzi are identical).

Beyond the inherent semantic ambiguities of ''Baima fei ma'', the first line obscurely asks ''ke hu'' [[Wikt:可|可]][[Wikt:乎|乎]] "Can it be that …?". This dialogue could be an attempted proof that a white horse is not a horse, or a question if such a statement is possible, or both. [[Bryan W. Van Norden]] suggests that "the Advocate is only arguing that 'a white horse is not a horse' ''could'' be true, given a certain interpretation. He might acknowledge that, in another interpretation, 'a white horse ''is'' a horse.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Norden|first1=Bryan|title=Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy|date=2011|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|location=Indianapolis|isbn=9781603844680|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation is offered in [[Feng Youlan]]'s ''History of Chinese Philosophy ''(translated in 1952 by [[Derk Bodde]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strictly speaking, names or terms are divided into those that are abstract and those that are concrete. The abstract term denotes the universal, the concrete term the particular. The particular is the denotation, and the universal the connotation, of the term. In western inflected languages there is no difficulty in distinguishing between the particular ('white' or 'horse') and the abstract ('whiteness' or 'horseness'). In Chinese, however, owing to the fact that the written characters are ideographic and pictorial and lack all inflection, there is no possible way, as far as the form of individual words is concerned, of distinguishing between abstract and concrete terms. Thus in Chinese the word designating a particular horse and that designating the universal, 'horseness,' are written and pronounced in the same way. Similarly with other terms, so that such words as 'horse' and 'white', being used to designate both the concrete particular and the abstract universal, thus hold two values.&lt;ref&gt;Fung Yu-lan. (1953). ''A History of Chinese Philosophy,'' p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, there are no contemporary histories of Chinese philosophy that subscribe to [[Feng Youlan]]'s interpretation. Other philosophers and sinologists who have analyzed the dialogue include Graham,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1989). ''Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China,'' pp.75-95;  Graham, (1990). {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies,'' pp. 125–216.|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad. 1976. "Mass Nouns and 'A White Horse Is Not a Horse'", ''[[Philosophy East and West]],'' 26.2:189-209; Hansen, Chad. (1983). ''Language and Logic in Ancient China,'' p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Harbsmeier,&lt;ref&gt;Harbsmeier, Christoph. (1998). "Language and Logic in Traditional China". Volume 7, Part I of ''Science and Civilisation in China,'' pp. 298–321.&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Kirill Ole. 1995. "When a 'White Horse' Is Not a 'Horse'", ''Philosophy East and West'' 45.4:481-499.&lt;/ref&gt; and Van Norden.&lt;ref name="readings"/&gt;

==Historic influence==
In the Chinese philosophical tradition, the ''Baima Lun'''s significance is evident from how many [[Chinese classic texts]] directly or indirectly discuss it. The ''[[Liezi]]'', which lists and criticizes the paradoxes of Gongsun Long as "perversions of reason and sense", explains "'A white horse is not a horse', because the name diverges from the shape."&lt;ref name="Graham-studies80"&gt;Graham, {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|p. 80.|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' chapters (17 and 33) mock Gongsun Long, and another (2) combines his ''zhi'' 指 "attribute" and ''ma'' 馬 "horse" notions in the same context.
&lt;blockquote&gt;To use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes is not as good as using a nonattribute to show that attributes are not attributes. To use a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to show that a horse is not a horse, Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand things are one horse.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuangzi. (2003). {{Google books|IKLsWSbCAWQC|''Zhuangzi: basic writings,'' p. 35.|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Mengzi'' (6A4) notes that ''bai'' 白 "white" has different connotations whether we are using it to refer to a graying person (who is worthy of respect because of his age) or a white horse (which should be treated like any other animal):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, 'There is no difference between our pronouncing a white horse to be white and our pronouncing a white man to be white. But is there no difference between the regard with which we acknowledge the age of an old horse and that with which we acknowledge the age of an old man? And what is it which is called righteousness? The fact of a man's being old? Or the fact of our giving honour to his age?'&lt;ref&gt;Legge, James. (1895). {{Google books|4L0TAAAAYAAJ|''The Chinese Classics: a Translation;'' Part 2, ''The Works of Mencius,'' p. 398.|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other early "A white horse is not a horse" references are found in the ''[[Hanfeizi]]'' (32), ''[[Mozi]]'' (11B), and ''[[Zhanguoce]]'' (4).
