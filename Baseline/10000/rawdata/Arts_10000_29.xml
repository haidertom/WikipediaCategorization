'''Art in Odd Places (AiOP)''' is a public [[art]]project based in [[New York City]] exploring connections between [[public space]]s, [[pedestrian]] traffic, and ephemeral transient [[Art intervention|interventions]].

== Background ==
=== History ===
Founded in 1996 as part of the [[Cultural Olympiad Public Arts Program]] of the [[1996 Olympics]] in Atlanta,&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Jane Jacob]] and Michael Brenson, ''Conversations at The Castle'', MIT Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-262-10072-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[wikt:hiatus|hiatus]] from 1998–2005, AiOP curates one large-scale project each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://artinoddplaces.org/2005/ | title = Art in Odd Places: 2005 |  accessdate = 2009-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://artinoddplaces.org/2006/ | title = Art in Odd Places: 2006 |  accessdate = 2009-03-16 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090202180831/http://www.artinoddplaces.org/2006/| archivedate= 2 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://artinoddplaces.org/2007/ | title = Art in Odd Places: 2007 |  accessdate = 2009-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://artinoddplaces.org/2008/ | title = Art in Odd Places: 2008 |  accessdate = 2009-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the program New York pedestrians happen upon the artwork by coincidence while others (like a [[scavenger hunt]]) use a map to discover art in unexpected places.

Art in Odd Places was founded by and is currently directed by Ed Woodham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://artinoddplaces.org/#abouts | title = Art in Odd Places web site |  accessdate = 2009-03-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090210035449/http://www.artinoddplaces.org/| archivedate= 10 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a current project of GOH Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gohproductions.org/gohcurrent.htm |title=GOH Productions: Current |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705201030/http://www.gohproductions.org/gohcurrent.htm |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mission ===
Art in Odd Places aims to stretch the boundaries of communication in the public realm by presenting artworks in all disciplines outside the confines of traditional public space regulations. AiOP reminds us that public spaces function as the epicenter for diverse social interactions and the unfettered exchange of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gohproductions.org/gohcurrent.htm |title=GOH Productions |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705201030/http://www.gohproductions.org/gohcurrent.htm |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects have included a performance addressing the issues of public vs. private as it applies to the public restroom, to art teams activating space by cleaning the sidewalks of 14th Street in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://artinoddplaces.org/#28 | title = Art in Odd Places : ''Meaning Cleaning'' |  accessdate = 2009-03-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090210035449/http://www.artinoddplaces.org/| archivedate= 10 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Art in Odd Places presented "Imagining New Public Space", a panel to discuss alternative public places for art. The panel was presented in collaboration with Radhika Subramaniam, founder of interdisciplinary art journal, Connect:art.politics.theory.practice and [[Setha Low]], president of the [[American Anthropological Association]], with panelist: Bill Brown of Surveillance Media Players; Clarinda MacLow, choreographer and performer; and [[Paul Carter (academic)|Paul Carter]], philosopher and artist from the [[Lab Architecture Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmcc.net/art/programs/2006.9.20imaginingpublicspace/index.html |title=Lower Manhattan Cultural Council: ''Imagining New Public Space'' |accessdate=2009-03-16 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collaborations ==
Collaborations have included partnerships with [[Lincoln Center]], [[School of Visual Arts]] (SVA), Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, and The Public Space Research Group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28142">[[Image:Thap Mam Shiva 12th c.jpg|thumb|right|350px|This late 11th- or 12th-century sculpture illustrates both the preferred medium of the Cham artists (stone sculpture in high [[relief]]), and the most popular subject-matter, the god [[Shiva]] and themes associated with the god.  Shiva can be recognized by the third eye in the middle of his forehead and by the attribute of the trident.  The hands above his head are making the gesture called uttarabodhi [[mudra]], which is regarded as a symbol of perfection.]]

[[Champa]] was an Indic civilization that flourished along the coasts of what is now central and southern [[Vietnam]] for roughly a one thousand-year period between 500 and 1500 AD.  The original Chams were probably colonists from the [[Indonesia]]n islands, who adopted as their principal vocations those of trade, shipping, and piracy.  Their cities were ports of call on important trade routes linking India, China and the [[Indonesia]]n islands. The history of Champa was one of intermittent conflict and cooperation with the people of [[Java]], the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] of [[Angkor]] in [[Cambodia]] and the [[Đại Việt]] of what is now northern Vietnam. It was to the Đại Việt that Champa finally lost its independence.

The artistic legacy of Champa consists primarily of sandstone sculptures - both sculpture in the round and relief sculpture - and brick buildings.  Some metal statues and decorative items have also survived.  Much of the remaining art expresses religious themes, and though some pieces would have been purely decorative, others would have served important functions in the religious life of the Chams, which synthesized elements of Hinduism (especially [[Saivism]]), [[Buddhism]] and indigenous cults.

This artistic legacy has been decimated by neglect, war, and vandalism.  Much of the damage has been done in the 20th century. Some French scholars such as [[Henri Parmentier]] and [[Jean Boisselier]] were able to take photographs, create drawings, and pen descriptions of works which have been destroyed in the meantime.  Neglect continues to endanger the legacy of Champa to this day, especially the neglect of the inscribed stone [[stele]]s, the source of much valuable information on the history of Champa.  The participants in the [[Vietnam War]] wrought their share of devastation, wiping out for example the vestiges of the Buddhist monastery at Dong Duong ([[Quảng Nam]]).&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Willful vandalism and pilfering are an ongoing concern.

The largest collection of Cham art is on exhibit at the [[Museum of Cham Sculpture]] in [[Da Nang]].  Substantial collections are housed in the [[Guimet Museum]] in Paris, the [[Museum of Vietnamese History]] in [[Saigon]], and the Museum of History in [[Hanoi]].  Smaller collections may be found in the Museum of Fine Arts in Saigon and the Museum of Fine Arts in Hanoi.

== Forms of visual art ==

The remnants of classical Cham art extant today consist mainly in temples of brick, sandstone sculptures in the round, and sandstone sculptures in high and low relief.  A few bronze sculptures and decorative items made of metal remain as well.  There are no works of marble or other higher quality stone.  Likewise there are no paintings or sketches.  The people of Champa wrote, and perhaps also sketched, on leaves, which have not withstood the hot and humid climate of coastal Vietnam.  Items made of perishable materials, such as wood, for the most part have not survived.

=== Metal statues and jewelry ===

The remaining works of art made of metal include bronze statues of the [[Mahayana|Mahayanist]] deities [[Lokesvara]] and [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] dated approximately 900 AD and associated with the Buddhist art of Dong Duong.  An even older bronze statue of the [[Buddha]] bears a strong resemblance to Indian Buddhist statues of the Amaravati style; scholars doubt that it was originally from Champa, surmising instead that it must have come into the country as part of the maritime trade that linked India with Southeast Asia and China.&lt;ref&gt;Boisselier, "Un Bronze de Tara", p.319-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Shiva Kosa from Champa.jpg|right|thumb|This Cham ''kosa'', or metal sleeve to be fitted over a [[linga]], is the face of [[Shiva|Siva]], as can be recognized from the third eye in the center of the forehead and the chignon hairstyle known as ''jatamukuta''.]]
We have abundant textual evidence of much classical Cham art that once existed that has been lost to the ravages of time and the depredations of human vandals, looters, and conquerors.  For example, the early 14th-century Chinese historian [[Ma Duanlin]] reported the existence of a large statue of the Buddha made of gold and silver; the current whereabouts of this statue are unknown.  The Cham kings themselves have left us stone inscriptions describing the gifts of now lost precious objects they made to the shrines and sanctuaries of the realm.  Especially noteworthy was the practice of donating decorated metallic sleeves (''kosa'') and diadems (''mukuta'') to important [[linga]]s and the divinities with which they were affiliated.  For example, an inscription on a stone [[stele]] dated approximately 1080 and found at [[Mỹ Sơn]] reports that King Harivarman donated a "large, resplendent golden ''kosa'' adorned with the most beautiful jewels, more brilliant than the sun, illuminated day and night by the rays of shining gems, decorated by four faces" to the deity Srisanabhadresvara, a local embodiment of [[Shiva|Siva]].  A few years later, around 1088, Harivarman may have been outdone by his successor Indravarman, who donated a golden ''kosa'' with six faces (facing in the four cardinal directions, toward the Northeast and the Southeast) topped off by a ''nagaraja'' (serpent-king) ornament, and decorated with precious gemstones including a ruby, a sapphire, a topaz, and a pearl.&lt;ref&gt;Finot, "Notes d'Epigraphie: XI. Les inscriptions de My-Son."&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither of these treasures has survived.

The written sources, including the Chinese books of history and the Cham inscriptions, also report on some of the catastrophic events, primarily acts of war, that led to the loss of Cham art.  In the second quarter of the 5th century AD, according to the historian [[Ma Duanlin]], a Chinese general named Yuen Kan sacked the capital of Champa, making off with many "rare and precious objects", including "tens of thousands of pounds of gold in ingots coming from statues which he had smelted."  Similarly, at the beginning of the 7th century a marauding Chinese general named [[Liu Fang]] made off with "eighteen massive tablets of gold" commemorating the 18 previous kings of Champa.&lt;ref&gt;Hervey, ''Ma-Touan-Lin'', Volume 2, Chapter entitled "Lin-y."  The Chinese recognized a succession of Cham states: first Lin-yi (from the late 2nd century to the 8th century), then Huan-wang (from the 8th to the 10th century), and finally Chen-ching (from the 10th century onward).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is to be assumed that in the centuries that followed, frequent raids and conquests by [[Khmer people|Khmer]] and Vietnamese armies, which led to the eventual destruction of Champa as an independent political entity, likewise resulted in the removal of any portable works of art, including of course any works made of precious metals.

=== Temples of brick ===
[[Image:Po Klong Garai.jpg|right|350px|thumb|The profile of the 13th-century temple [[Po Klong Garai]] near Phan Rang includes all the buildings typical of a Cham temple. From left to right one can see the ''kalan'', the attached ''mandapa'', the saddle-shaped ''kosgrha'', and the ''gopura''.]]
Unlike the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] of [[Angkor]], who for the most part employed a grey [[sandstone]] to construct their religious buildings, the Cham built their temples from reddish [[brick]]s.  Some of these brick structures can be still be visited in the Vietnamese countryside.  The most important remaining sites include [[Mỹ Sơn]] near [[Da Nang]], [[Po Nagar]] near [[Nha Trang]], and [[Po Klong Garai]] near Phan Rang.

==== Buildings constituting a temple ====
Typically, a Cham temple complex consisted of several different kinds of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Tran Ky Phuong, ''Vestiges of Champa Civilization''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''kalan'' was the brick sanctuary, typically in the form of a tower, used to house the deity.
* The ''mandapa'' was an entry hallway contiguous with a sanctuary.
* The ''kosagrha'' or "fire-house" was the construction, typically with a saddle-shaped roof, used to house the valuables belonging to the deity or to cook for the deity.
* The ''gopura'' was a gate-tower leading into a walled temple complex.
These building types are typical for Hindu temples in general; the classification is valid not only for the architecture of Champa, but also for other architectural traditions of [[Greater India]].

==== Most significant temples ====
[[Image:PoNagar.jpg|right|thumb|The temple of [[Po Nagar]] is near [[Nha Trang]].]]
The culturally most important temples of historical Champa were the temple of Bhadresvara located at [[Mỹ Sơn]] near modern [[Da Nang]], and the [[Po Nagar|temple of the goddess]] known as [[Bhagavati]] (her Hindu name) or Yan Po Nagar (her Cham name) located just outside modern [[Nha Trang]].
* The temple of Bhadresvara was the principle religious foundations of northern Champa (known as ''Campadesa'', ''Campapura'' or ''nagara Campa'' in the inscriptions).  Scholars have identified the temple of Bhadresvara, a local incarnation of the universal deity [[Shiva|Siva]], with the edifice "A1" at Mỹ Sơn.  Though today A1 is in the process of devolving into a pile of rubble, it still existed as a magnificent tower when French scholars described it at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tran Ky Phuong, ''Vestiges of Champa Civilization'', p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The temple of Yan Po Nagar was the principal religious foundation of southern Champa (or ''Panduranga'', a word that is the basis for the modern name "Phan Rang.")  Its buildings date from between the 8th and 13th centuries.  The temple remains standing to this day across the Cai River from Nha Trang, and is in relatively good condition.&lt;ref&gt;Tran Ky Phuong, ''Vestiges of Champa Civilization'', p.95 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sandstone sculptures ===
[[Image:Cham Naga.png|thumb|left|A decorative theme that originated in [[Java]], and from there emanated to other parts of [[Greater India]], is that of the [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] sea monster disgorging some other being.  In this 10th- or 11th-century Cham sculpture, the makara disgorges a [[Nāga|naga]].]]
The Cham created freestanding sandstone sculptures in the round, as well as high and [[bas-relief]] carvings of sandstone.  In general, they appear to have preferred sculpting in [[relief]], and they excelled especially at sculpture in high relief.  Cham sculpture went through a marked succession of historical styles, the foremost of which produced some of the best works of Southeast Asian art.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject-matter of Cham sculpture is drawn mostly from the legends and religion of Indian civilization.  Many of the sculptures are representations of particular Hindu and Buddhist deities, most prominently [[Shiva|Siva]], but also [[Lokesvara]], [[Visnu]], [[Brahma]], [[Devi]], and [[Shakti]].  Such sculptures may have served a religious purpose rather than being purely decorative.  Any sculpture in the round of an important deity that is completely forward-oriented, not engaged in any particular action, and equipped with symbolic paraphernalia, would have been a candidate for ritual or devotional use.  Cham sculptors also created numerous [[linga]]s, phallic posts linked symbolically with Siva (if the cross-section is a circle) or with the [[trimurti]] (if the post is segmented, consisting of a lower square section symbolic of Brahma, a middle octagonal section symbolic of Visnu, and a top circular section symbolic of Siva).  The ritual uses of the linga are familiar from modern Hinduism.

[[Image:Elephant on bas relief.jpg|right|thumb|This carving of an elephant is found on a pedestal belonging to the Mỹ Sơn A1 style.]]
A few of the sculptures in the art of Champa depart from the Indian subject-matter to reveal something of the life of the historical Cham people.  An example are the especially well-executed representations of elephants that serve as decorative details in some pieces: from written sources we know that the Cham relied on elephants for military and other purposes, since they lacked a steady supply of horses.  Other sculptures reflect the cultural legacy of [[Greater India]] and express legendary themes more typical of [[Javanese people|Javanese]] or [[Culture of Cambodia|Cambodian]] art than the art of India.  An example of such a theme is the motif of the [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] sea-monster, which came to Champa from Java, where it is prominent in the art of the [[Borobudur]] and other temples of the same period.

== Periods and styles of Cham art ==
Scholars agree that it is possible to analyze the art of Champa in terms of distinct "styles" typical for various historical periods and different locations.  Several have attempted through their study to set down a classification of historical styles.  Perhaps the most influential of these attempts are those of the French scholars Philippe Stern (''The Art of Champa (formerly Annam) and its Evolution'', 1942) and Jean Boisselier (''Statuary of Champa'', 1963).&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, ''The Art of Champa'', p.39 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Summarizing the conclusions of these scholars, art historian Jean-François Hubert has concluded that it is possible to distinguish at least the following styles and sub-styles:&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, ''The Art of Champa'', pp.33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mỹ Sơn E1 (7th to 8th century)
* Dong Duong (9th to 10th century)
* Mỹ Sơn A1 (10th century)
** Khuong My (first half of 10th century)
** Trà Kiệu (second half of 10th century)
** Chanh Lo (end of 10th century to mid-11th century)
* Thap Mam (11th to 14th century)
Each style is named after a place in Vietnam at which works exemplative of that style have been found.

=== Mỹ Sơn E1 Style ===
The ruins at [[Mỹ Sơn]] are not all of the same style and do not all belong to the same period of Cham history.  Scholars have coded the ruins to reflect the diversity of periods and styles.  The earliest identifiable style has been dubbed the Mỹ Sơn E1 Style. It is named after a particular structure, which scholars refer to as Mỹ Sơn E1.  Works of this style reflect foreign influence from a variety of sources, primarily from the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] of pre-[[Angkor]]ian [[Cambodia]], but also from the [[Dvaravati art|art of Dvaravati]], the [[Medang Kingdom#Culture and society|Javanese art]] of [[Indonesia]], and of southern India.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.33 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most famous work of the Mỹ Sơn E1 style is a large sandstone pedestal dated from the second half of the 7th century.  Originally, the pedestal had a religious function, and was used to support a huge [[lingam]] as a symbol for [[Shiva|Siva]], the primary deity in Cham religion.  The pedestal itself is decorated with [[relief]] carvings featuring scenes from the lives of ascetics: ascetics playing various musical instrument, an ascetic preaching to animals, an ascetic receiving a massage.  To the Cham, the pedestal symbolized Mount Kailasa, the mythological abode of Siva which also accommodated numerous forest- and cave-dwelling ascetics, just as the lingam it supported represented the god himself.&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', p.50ff.; Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important work of the Mỹ Sơn E1 style is the unfinished sandstone [[pediment]] that was once affixed over the main entrance to the temple at Mỹ Sơn E1.  The pediment shows the dawn of the present era according to [[Hindu mythology]]. [[Vishnu]] is reclining at the bottom of the ocean.  His bed is [[Sesha]] the serpent.  A lotus grows upwards from Vishnu's navel, and [[Brahma]] emerges from the lotus in order to recreate the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Dong Duong Style ===
In 875, the Cham king Indravarman II founded a new dynasty at Indrapura, in what is now the [[Quảng Nam]] region of central [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Departing from the religious traditions of his predecessors, who were predominantly [[Shaivism|Shaivists]], he founded the [[Mahayana Buddhist]] monastery of Dong Duong, and dedicated the central temple to [[Lokesvara]].&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple complex at Dong Duong having been devastated by bombing during the Vietnam War, our knowledge of its appearance is limited to the photographs and descriptions created by French scholars earlier in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.36 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  A fair number of sculptures of the period have survived, however, in the museums of Vietnam, and collectively they are known as the works of the Dong Duong Style.  The style lasted until well into the 10th century.

The Dong Duong style of sculpture has been described as a highly original style of "artistic extremism", "with exaggerated, almost excessively stylized features."&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.40.&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures are characterized by their thick noses and lips and by the fact that they do not smile.&lt;ref name="Hubert, p.43"&gt;Hubert, ''The Art of Champa'', p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent motifs include scenes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], Buddhist monks, [[dharmapalas]] (guardians of the Buddhist law), [[Architecture of Cambodia|dvarapalas]] (armed temple guardians), the [[bodhisattva]] [[Avalokiteshvara]], and the goddess of compassion [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], who was also regarded as the [[shakti]] or spouse of Avalokiteshvara.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.81 ff.; Huynh Thi Duoc, ''Cham Sculpture'', p.66 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Mỹ Sơn A1 Style ===
The art of the Mỹ Sơn A1 style belongs to the 10th and 11th centuries, a period of [[Hindu]] revival following the [[Buddhist]] period of Dong Duong, and also a period of renewed influence from [[Java]].  This period has been called the "golden age" of Cham Art.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The style is named after a temple at [[Mỹ Sơn]], "the most perfect expression of Cham architecture" according to art historian Emmanuel Guillon, that fell victim to the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s.  Most of the remaining monuments at Mỹ Sơn also belong to the Mỹ Sơn A1 style, including most of the constructions of groups B, C, and D.&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Mỹ Sơn Relics'', p.140-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the sculpture of the Mỹ Sơn A1 style, it is known as being light and graceful, in contrast with the more severe style of Dong Duong.  According to Guillon, "It is an art of dance and movement, of grace, and of faces which sometimes wear a slight, almost ironic style, as though surprised by their own beauty."  Indeed, dancers were a favorite motif of the Mỹ Sơn A1 sculptors.  The style is also known for its fine relief images of real and mythical animals such as elephants, lions and garudas.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.128 ff.; Huynh Thi Duoc, ''Cham Sculpture'', pp.55 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mỹ Sơn A1 style encompasses not only works of art found at Mỹ Sơn, but also works found at Khuong My and Trà Kiệu, though the latter are sometimes treated as representing distinct styles. The works of Khuong My in particular are frequently treated as transitional between the styles of Dong Duong and Mỹ Sơn A1.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.45, 105 f.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, works found at Chanh Lo are sometimes treated as belonging to the Mỹ Sơn A1 style and sometimes treated as transitional between the Mỹ Sơn A1 and Thap Mam styles.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Khuong My Style ====
In the village of Khuong My in the Vietnamese province of [[Quảng Nam]] stands a group of three Cham towers dating from the 10th century. The style of the towers and the artwork associated with them is transitional between the powerful style of Dong Duong and the more charming and delicate Mỹ Sơn A1 style.  The style of Khuong My also exhibits Khmer and Javanese influence.&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', Ch.5: "Khuong My", p.95 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trà Kiệu Style ====
Although the Cham monuments at Trà Kiệu in [[Quảng Nam Province]] have been destroyed, a number of magnificent pieces of sculpture associated with the site remain and are preserved in museums.  Especially noteworthy are a large pedestal serving as a base for a lingam that is known simply as the "Trà Kiệu Pedestal" and another pedestal known as the "Dancers' Pedestal."&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.110 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trà Kiệu Pedestal, consisting of a base decorated with friezes in [[bas relief]], an ablutionary cistern, and a massive [[lingam]], is regarded as one of the masterpieces of Cham art.  The figures on the friezes are especially beautiful, and represent episodes from the life of [[Krishna]] as related in the [[Bhagavata Purana]].  At each corner of the pedestal, a leonine [[atlas (architecture)|atlas]] appears to support the weight of the structure above him.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.110-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dancers' Pedestal, likewise, is regarded as a masterpiece. The purpose and function of the pedestal, which has the shape of a corner piece, remain obscure.  Each side of the corner is graced by a dancing [[apsara]] and a music-playing [[gandharva]].  The base underneath these figures is adorned with leonine heads and [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.120-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Thap Mam Style ===
After the 10th century, Cham art went into gradual decline.  Both architecture, as exemplified by the temples of [[Po Nagar]] and [[Po Klong Garai]], and sculpture became more stereotyped and less original.  Only the sculptures of mythical animals, such as the makara or the [[garuda]], could rival their counterparts of the earlier styles.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.54 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thap Mam Style of the 11th through the 14th centuries is named for an archaeological site in [[Bình Định Province]], formerly [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]].  The sculpture of this style is characterized by "a return to hieratic formalism and the simplification of shape, leading to a certain loss of vitality."&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.57.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculptors seem to have been concerned more with the detail of ornamentation than with the grace and motion of the figures themselves.  Indeed, the style has been characterized as "baroque", in reference to the proliferation of ornamental details that distinguishes it from its more "classical" predecessors.&lt;ref name="Hubert, p.43" /&gt;

One of the most original motifs of the Thap Mam period was the sculpting in stone of a row of female breasts around the base of a pedestal.  The motif first emerged in the 10th century (the Trà Kiệu Pedestal at one point had such a row of breasts) and became characteristic of the Thap Mam Style.  It appears to have no counterpart in the art of other Southeast Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.147 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars have identified this theme with figure of Uroja ("breasts"), the mythical ancestor of an 11th-century dynasty at Mỹ Sơn, and claim a connection between this Uroja and the goddess venerated at [[Po Nagar]].&lt;ref&gt;Tran Ky Phuong, ''Vestiges of Champa Civilization'', p.146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ordinary '''Bondi–Metzner–Sachs (BMS) group''' B is the common asymptotic [[symmetry group]] of all radiating, [[Asymptotically flat spacetime|asymptotically flat]], Lorentzian [[spacetime]]s. This means that B is currently the best candidate for the universal symmetry group of [[General Relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/33/1/028/meta |title=Generalizations of the BMS group and results}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally proposed in 1962 by H. Bondi, M. G. van der Burg, and A. W. Metzner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.5803.pdf |title=Notes on the BMS group in three dimensions: I. Induced representations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' Boyacá International Cultural Festival&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spanishincolombia.gov.co/pagina/vida-urbana_tunja_-vida-cultural&lt;/ref&gt;''' (Spanish: '''''Festival Internacional de la Cultura de Boyacá''''' or just '''''FIC''''') is one of the major international cultural events held annually in [[Colombia]]. The festival presents works in various arts such as music, theater, dance, literature, Academy, Visual Arts, Cinema - Audiovisual, Cultural Heritage cultural exchanges and meetings at various stages in the city of [[Tunja]] since 1973. Artists from different corners of the world intertwine their knowledge and their cultures into one universal feeling, through the medium of art, the best mechanism to achieve peace and brotherhood of people. The FIC gathers thousands of artists and has more than 300,000 visits to about 500 events per version. The festival is considered to be one of the most representative of music, dance, the arts, theater, cultural heritage, literature, cinema and expressions of human sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://colombiareports.com/colombia-celebrates-40th-international-culture-festival-video/&lt;/ref&gt;

The 44th version of the Boyacá International Cultural Festival will take place from 27 October – 5 November 2016.

==History==

The Festival was created in 1973 under the name of "International Culture Week". In 1981, name as the Boyacá International Cultural Festival, it became one of the most important cultural events in Latin America. The FIC gathers thousands of artists and has more than 300,000 visits to about 500 events per version. The Festival was conceived to meet different cultural and artistic events of international order.
In the 1990s the event was held during two weeks with concerts of symphony and chamber orchestras, choirs, soloists and equally folk and classical ballet, traditional groups and street theater and puppet shows, conferences and cinema, art exhibitions, folk art, book fair and conferences.
Over four decades, the biggest cultural event of the department has developed and grown into a design which educates and shares diverse and exciting cultures from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://colombiareports.com/colombia-celebrates-40th-international-culture-festival-video/&lt;/ref&gt;

The great receptivity of the city has been essential in the success of the event, and no doubt the cultural level that old tradition has identified the local population, year after year, increased their attendance and participation at all levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7372">The '''Cinema of the Russian Empire''' ([[History of the Russian language|Pre-reform Russian orthography]]: Синематографъ Россійской Имперіи) roughly spans the period 1907 - 1920, during which time a strong infrastructure was created.  From the over 2,700 art films created in Russia before 1920, around 300 remain to this day.

==The beginning of cinema in Russia==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
In April 1896, just four months after the first films were shown in [[Paris]], the first cinematic apparatus appeared in Russia. The first films seen in the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]] were via the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]], in Moscow and St. Petersburg in May 1896.  In the same month, the first film was shot in Russia, by Lumière cameraman [[Camille Cerf (filmmaker)|Camille Cerf]], a record of the coronation of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] in [[Moscow]].   The first permanent cinema was opened in [[St Petersburg]] in 1896 at [[Nevsky Prospect]], No. 46.

The first Russian movies were shown in the Moscow [[Korsh Theatre]] by artist Vladimir Sashin. After purchasing a Vitagraph projector, Sashin started to make short films, which  by August 1896 were being demonstrated to theatre audiences after the theatre performance had ended.

==Development==
Film in Russia became a staple of fairs or rented auditoriums.  After the Lumières came representatives from [[Pathé]] and [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] to open offices, after the turn of the century, to make motion pictures on location for Russian audiences.  Theatres were already built, and film renting [[film distributor|distributors]] had already replaced direct sales to [[film exhibitor|exhibitor]]s, when, in 1908, [[Alexander Drankov]] produced the first Russian narrative film, ''[[Stenka Razin (film)|Stenka Razin]]'', based on events told in a popular folk song and directed by [[Vladimir Romashkov]].  At the same time as Drankov was making his film, the Moscow cinema entrepreneur [[Alexander Khanzhonkov]] began to operate.

In 1907, the journal Kino was first published. Kino was the first Russian periodical devoted to the cinema.

[[Ladislas Starevich]] made the first Russian animated film (and the first [[stop motion]] puppet film with a story) in [[1910 in film|1910]] - ''Lucanus Cervus''.  He continued making animated films (some of which can now be bought on DVD) until his [[emigration]] to [[France]] following the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]].  He was decorated by the Tsar for his work in 1911.
[[File:Sevastopoldefence.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Defence of Sevastopol]]'' (1911)]]

Competition from French, American, German, Danish, British and Italian companies, distributing their country's wares to the eager Russians, developed, but the indigenous industry made such strides over the next five years that 129 fully Russian films - even if many of them were comparatively short - were produced in 1918 alone.  In 1912, the [[Aleksandr Khanzhonkov|Khanzhonkov]] [[film studio]] was operational, and [[Ivan Mozzhukhin]] had made his first film there, a [[feature film]] of 2000 meters entitled "[[Oborona Sevastopolya]]" ("The Defense of Sevastopol").  The same year, a German concern filming in Russia introduced the director [[Yakov Protazanov]] to the world with its "[[Ukhod Velikovo Startsa]]" ("Departure of the Grand Old Man"), a [[biographical film]] about [[Lev Tolstoy]].  Tsar Nicholas himself made some [[home movies]] and appointed an official Court Cinematographer, although he is purported to have written in 1913 that film was "an empty matter...even something harmful...silliness...we should not attribute any significance to such trifles".

Tsar Nicholas gave some special assistance to the makers of "The Defence of Sevastopol" and a few similar films, but the industry was not nationalized nor governmentally subsidized or otherwise controlled.  There were also only a few rules of censorship on a national level - such as not making the Tsars characters in a dramatized film - but the filmmakers were largely free to produce for the mass audience; local officials might be more stringent in censoring or banning films.  [[Detective fiction|Detective films]] were popular, and various forms of [[melodrama]].   [[File:Moszhuserge.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Ivan Mozzhukhin]] as Father Sergius in [[Yakov Protazanov]]'s [[Father Sergius (film)|1917 film]].]]

The arrival of [[World War I]] in Russia in 1914 sparked a change.  Imports dropped drastically, especially insofar as films from Germany and its allies left the market rapidly.  Russian filmmakers early on turned to anti-German, "patriotic" films, often hastily made, even being filmed while the scripts were still being written, filling in the gap:  in 1916, Russia produced 499 films, over three times the number of just three years earlier, and more of feature length.  Russia's allies, in turn, began to import some of the more striking product, including further films by Protazanov and [[Yevgeni Bauer]], a specialist in [[Psychological thriller|psychological film]], who both impacted, among others, the burgeoning American film industry.  Adversely, Russian companies were forbidden to send cameramen to the "front", and war footage had to be imported from France and England:  some Russian concerns combined footage from these with enacted war material to create faux [[documentary film|documentaries]].  Also, the [[Skobolev Committee]] was established by the government to oversee the making of [[newsreel]] and [[propaganda film]]s.

And then came the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], on top of the ongoing international War. With audiences turning against the Tsar, film producers began turning out, after the [[February Revolution]], a number of films with anti-Tsarist themes.  These, along with the usual retinue of detective films and melodramas, filled theaters when the streets were not filled with revolutionaries.  However, the destruction of the infrastructure in the major cities, the failing war-drained economy, the takeover of rural cinemas by local [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s, and the aversion of some in the film industry to [[communism]], caused the Russian film industry per se to effectively die out by the time Lenin on November 8, 1917 proclaimed a new country, the [[Russian SFSR|Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]].

Ironically, the last significant Russian film completed, in 1917, ''[[Father Sergius (film)|Father Sergius]]'' would become the first new film release a year later, in the new country of the Soviets.

A '''coloring book''' (or '''colouring book''', or '''colouring page''') is a type of book containing [[line art]] to which people are intended to add color using [[crayon]]s, [[Pencil|colored pencil]]s, [[marker pen]]s, [[paint]] or other artistic media. Traditional coloring books and coloring pages are printed on paper or card. Some coloring books have [[Perforation|perforated edge]]s so their pages can be removed from the books and used as individual sheets. Others may include a [[Narrative|story]] line and so are intended to be left intact. Today many children's coloring books feature popular [[character (arts)|cartoon character]]s. They are often used as promotional materials for animated motion pictures. Coloring books may also incorporate other activities such as [[connect the dots]], [[maze]]s and other [[puzzle]]s. Some also incorporate the use of [[stickers]].

==History==
[[Image:The Little Folks Paint Book.jpg|thumb|150px|''The Little Folks Painting Book'', 1879]]
Paint books and coloring books emerged in the United States as part of the "democratization of art" process, inspired by a series of lectures by British artist [[Joshua Reynolds]], and the works of Swiss educator [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and his student [[Friedrich Fröbel]]. Many educators concluded that all, regardless of background, students stood to benefit from [[art education]] as a means of enhancing their conceptual understanding of the tangible, developing their cognitive abilities, and improving skills that would be useful in finding a profession, as well as for the children's spiritual edification.&lt;ref name="Absolutearts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2003/08/04/31263.html|title=Drawn to Art: Art Education and the American Experience, 1800–1950|year=2003|publisher=absolutearts.com|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[McLoughlin Brothers]] are credited as the inventors of the coloring book, when, in the 1880s, they produced ''The Little Folks' Painting Book'', in collaboration with [[Kate Greenaway]]. They continued to publish coloring books until the 1920s, when the McLoughlin Brothers became part of the [[Milton Bradley Company]].

Another pioneer in the genre was [[Richard F. Outcault]]. He authored ''Buster's Paint Book'' in 1907, featuring the character of [[Buster Brown]], which he had invented in 1902. It was published by the Stokes Company. This launched a trend to use coloring books to advertise a wide variety of products, including coffee and pianos.&lt;ref name="Absolutearts" /&gt; Until the 1930s, books were designed with the intent for them to be painted instead of colored. Even when [[crayon]]s came into wide use in the 1930s, books were still designed so that they could be painted or colored.&lt;ref name="PatJacobs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loti.com/then_now/Coloring_Books.htm|last=Jacobs|first=Pat|title=Coloring Books|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coloring books are widely used in schooling for young children for various reasons.  For example, children are often more interested in coloring books rather than using other learning methods; pictures may also be more memorable than simply words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloringpagesonline.net/coloring-pages-online-a-helping-hand-for-parents-and-teachers/|title=A Helping Hand for Parents and Teachers|date=February 5, 2012|publisher=Coloring Pages Online|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coloring may also increase creativity in painting, according to some research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colorkid.net/benefits_of_coloring research]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a predominantly non-verbal medium, coloring books have also seen wide applications in education where a target group does not speak and understand the primary language of instruction or communication. Examples of this include the use of coloring books in [[Guatemala]] to teach children about hieroglyphs and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] artist patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Perspectives of Children's Literature in Guatemala | jstor=344988 | journal=Hispania | first=Sue | last=Misheff |date=September 1994 | volume=77 | issue=3 | pages=524–531 | doi=10.2307/344988}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the production of coloring books to educate the children of farm workers about "the pathway by which agricultural pesticides are transferred from work to home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1289/ehp.5203 | title=Nuclear Waste Transportation: Case Studies of Identifying Stakeholder Risk Information Needs |date=March 2003 | journal=Environmental Health Perspectives | volume=111 | issue=3 | pages=263–272 | last=Drew | first=Christina H. |author2=Deirdre A.

Faustman  | pmid=12611653 | pmc=1241381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coloring books are also said to help to motivate students' understanding of concepts that they would otherwise be uninterested in.

They have been used as teaching aids for developing creativity and knowledge of geometry, such as in [[Roger Burrows]]' ''Altair Designs''.

Since the 1980s, several publishers have produced educational coloring books intended for studying graduate-level topics such as anatomy and physiology, where color-coding of many detailed diagrams are used as a learning aid. Examples include ''The Anatomy Coloring Book'' and subsequent book series, by Wynn Kapit and Lawrence Elson, published by [[HarperCollins]] (1990s) and [[Benjamin Cummings]] (2000s).&lt;ref&gt;''The Anatomy Coloring Book'', Wynn Kapit and Lawrence M. Elson. HarperCollins, 1993, second revised and expanded edition, {{ISBN|0-06-455016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some examples of educators using coloring books to better explain complicated topics, like math&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Vn3GLf-4YkEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=coloring+book&amp;ots=mWvrVhWoy2&amp;sig=MVSjMedFtE-tFSCApYpacxV-AYE#v=onepage&amp;q=coloring%20book&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0045794979900622]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some publishers have specialized in coloring books with an explicit educational purpose, both for children and for adults. The books often have extensive text accompanying each image. These publishers include [[Dover Books]], [[Really Big Coloring Books]], [[Running Press]], and [[Malcolm Whyte|Troubador Press]].

==Health and therapeutic uses==
Coloring books have seen wide application in the health professions as educational tools. One nurse, trying to limit the trauma of surgery, described in an academic publication how the use of a coloring book "might help [the child] to understand what was going to happen to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Tonsil Season | first=Carolyn | jstor=3451768 | last=Harris | journal=The American Journal of Nursing | volume=61 | issue=1 |date=January 1961 | pages=91–92 | doi=10.2307/3451768}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in rehabilitation of accident victims to aid recovery of [[hand–eye coordination]], and they are used with [[Autism|autistic]] children both for entertainment and for their soothing effect. Coloring books have been used to explain complicated medical conditions to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=R. |last1=McDonald |first2=A. |last2=Thomsen |first3=Y. |last3=Belessis |first4=A. |last4=Jaffe |date=June 2007 |title=292 CF and Me – a colouring book for children |journal=Journal of Cystic Fibrosis |volume=6 |issue=Suppl 1 |page=S71 |doi=10.1016/S1569-1993(07)60267-7 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569199307602677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the appeals of adult coloring books is that they help users relax and de-stress.&lt;ref name="Toronto Star"&gt;{{cite news|title=Colouring books designed for adults topping bestseller lists (Books by illustrator Johanna Basford (Secret Garden and Enchanted Forest) created as a way to de-stress) |date= April 6, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2015|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/04/06/colouring-books-designed-for-adults-topping-bestseller-lists.html|work=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political uses==
In 1962, cartoonist [[Mort Drucker]] teamed with humorist [[Paul Laikin]] in creating the ''[[John F. Kennedy]] Coloring Book'', a satirical introduction to Kennedy, his family and administration, told from the point of view of his daughter [[Caroline Kennedy|Caroline]]. The book sold 2,500,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic

In 1968 the ''Black Panther Coloring Book'' began circulating in the United States; the book features black men and children killing [[List of slang terms for police officers#P|pigs dressed as police officers]].  It was argued to have been made not by the [[Black Panther Party]] but by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s [[COINTELPRO]] program to discredit the organization, a claim which other sources dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Some commentators have alleged that the book was a piece of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[agitprop]]. See {{cite journal | first=Carl | last=Jorgenson | title=Blacks in the 60s: A Centennial Reprise | journal=Social Text |date=Spring–Summer 1984 | issue=9/10 | pages=313–317 | doi=10.2307/466577 | jstor=466577}} Others accept the text as genuine.

The term and concept of the "coloring book" was adopted by the [[feminism|feminist]] artist [[Tee Corinne]] as a tool of female empowerment. Corinne made pencil sketches of female genitalia, which she then inked and printed on card stock. She published a collection of them in 1975 as ''The Cunt Coloring Book.''
{{quote|No other name seemed really to fit, although the word "cunt" was not one with which I was particularly comfortable. The alliteration, though, was nice. I also liked the idea of combining a street term for genitalia with a coloring book, because both are ways that, as children, we get to know the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Tee | last=Corinne | title=Artist's Statement: On Sexual Art | authorlink=Tee Corinne | journal=Feminist Studies |date=Summer 1993 | volume=19 | issue=2 | pages=369–376  | doi=10.2307/3178374 | jstor=3178374}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In August 2011, American publisher Really Big Coloring Books released ''We Shall Never Forget: The Kids Book of Freedom'' detailing specific drawings in the accounting of [[SEAL Team 6]] shooting [[Osama bin Laden]] in his home. The book was criticized by some for portraying Muslims in a negative manner. The company has also published ''The Tea Party Coloring Book for Kids'', ''Ted Cruz To The Future'' (2013) and a book about President [[Barack Obama|Barack Obama's]] inauguration (2008).&lt;ref name="kenyonstar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallace|first1=Kenyon|title=9/11 children’s colouring book sparks controversy over portrayal of Muslims|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2011/08/30/911_childrens_colouring_book_sparks_controversy_over_portrayal_of_muslims.html|website=thestar.com|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.|accessdate=22 February 2016|date=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cruzcoloring"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/12/ted-cruz-coloring-book_n_4434114.html|title=Ted Cruz Coloring Book Selling Fast|last1=Weissert|first1=Will|publisher=Huffington Post|website=www.huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=22 February 2016|date=12 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305001258/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/12/ted-cruz-coloring-book_n_4434114.html|archivedate=March 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Photographer Jno Cook produced line drawings based on [[Robert Frank]]'s ''[[The Americans (photography)|The Americans]]'', and in 1983 published them in a limited edition as ''The Robert Frank Coloring Book''. In 1994, the [[National Gallery of Art]] used the images as [[party favor]]s for writers working on the catalog for a retrospective of Frank's work.&lt;ref name="jnocook"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Jno|title=The Robert Frank Coloring Book|url=http://jnocook.net/frank/rfcolor1.htm|website=jnocook.net|accessdate=22 February 2016|date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coloring books are a form of adult [[therapy]] that have seen a growth in popularity in the 2010s. They reportedly bring people a sense of their [[childhood]],&lt;ref name="MedicalDaily"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dovey|first1=Dana|title=The Therapeutic Science Of Adult Coloring Books: How This Childhood Pastime Helps Adults Relieve Stress|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/therapeutic-science-adult-coloring-books-how-childhood-pastime-helps-adults-356280|accessdate=13 April 2016|publisher=Medical Daily|date=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and help with developing fine motor skills and vision, reducing anxiety and creating focus, and relieving stress and anxiety in a manner similar to [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/06/health/adult-coloring-books-popularity-mental-health/index.html|title=Why adult coloring books are good for you|website=CNN|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrating on coloring may facilitate the replacement of negative thoughts and images with pleasant ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/therapeutic-science-adult-coloring-books-how-childhood-pastime-helps-adults-356280|title=The Therapeutic Science Of Adult Coloring Books|website=Medical Daily|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coloring books can be used in daily activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloringnotebook.com|title=Paper notebook with adult coloring pages|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books are also a way to get away from technology, which some regard as beneficial to people's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bratskeir|first1=Kate|title=Unplug From Technology: 19 Ways To Spend Time Off The Grid|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/27/unplug-from-technology_n_2762116.html|accessdate=13 April 2016 |publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com |date=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used by people who are uncomfortable with more creatively expressive forms of art.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;

While coloring books for adults were popular in the early 1960s, those were satirical works rather than the therapeutic works that define the adult coloring book form today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/126580/radical-history-1960s-adult-coloring-books|title=The Radical History of 1960s Adult Coloring Books|publisher=''The New Republic''|date=December 28, 2015|first=Laura|last=Marsh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially successful adult coloring books were published in 2012 and 2013,&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt; and began increasing in popularity in 2015.

By 2016, [[Faber-Castell]], a worldwide color pencil supplier, was reported to have trouble keeping up with demand for their products due to the craze,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryall|first1=Jenni|title=All the adults colouring is leading to huge sales for pencil companies|url=http://mashable.com/2016/04/10/colouring-trend/#OD9Gr_TPMgqb|website=Mashable|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Blue Star Coloring]] sold over a million titles in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/02/10/books-how-adult-coloring-books-became-popular|title=How adult coloring books became a million-dollar trend|work=MPR News|date=February 10, 2016|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Author [[Susan Jacoby]] has criticized adult coloring books, along with the popularity among adults of [[young adult fiction]], as "an artifact of a broader cultural shift. And that cultural shift is a bad thing.”&lt;ref name="newyorkerraphael"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raphael|first1=Adrienne|title=Why Adults Are Buying Coloring Books (for Themselves)|url=http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-adults-are-buying-coloring-books-for-themselves|website=The New Yorker|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=21 February 2016|date=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes the [[Great Recession]] has contributed to this shift, as adults unable to find employment have moved home to live with their parents. New York City [[futurist]] and blogger Dominic Bulsuto describes adult coloring book fans as "stuck in The Shallows, mindfully coloring books to counter the existential angst of living in a digital society." He goes on to say that "...the endless Internet parade of silly cat photos, infantile comments and adolescent [[Internet meme|meme]]s has dumbed us down." However, Bulsuto ultimately sees the trend as a good thing, noting that adults are increasingly buying books they want to buy, rather than books they are supposed to buy.&lt;ref name=Coloringpost/&gt;

==Coloring book software==
Coloring books can also be found digitally in the form of coloring book websites and applications. Coloring book software often has features such as color mixing, [[Flood Fill|flood filling]], and paintbrush tools that allow for more accurate and detailed drawings than regular coloring books.

[[File:Deer park, Powderham Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1416619.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Fallow deer]] in the park of [[Powderham Castle]], Devon]]

In [[Middle ages|medieval]] and [[Early Modern period|Early Modern]] [[Kingdom of England|England]], a '''deer park''' was an enclosed area containing deer. It was bounded by a ditch and bank with a wooden park [[Palisade|pale]] on top of the bank, or by a stone or brick wall.&lt;ref&gt;Dry stone wall at [[Dyrham Park]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ditch was on the inside&lt;ref name=Trees&amp;Woodland150&gt;{{cite book |last=Rackham |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Rackham |title=Trees and Woodland in the British Landscape |series=Archaeology in the Field Series |year=1976 |publisher=[[J. M. Dent]] &amp; Sons Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-460-04183-5 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing the effective height. Some parks had deer "leaps", where there was an external ramp and the inner ditch was constructed on a grander scale, thus allowing deer to enter the park but preventing them from leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The NEW Reading the Landscape|first=Richard|last=Muir|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=200|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some deer parks were established in the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon era]] and are mentioned in [[Anglo-Saxon Charters]]; these were often called hays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Sykes| first1 = Naomi  | editor-last=Liddiard  | editor-first=Robert  | year = 2007  | chapter = Animal Bones and Animal Parks | title = The Medieval Park: New Perspectives  |  publisher = Windgather Press  | location= Macclesfield, UK  | ISBN = 9781905119165 | page=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] seized existing game reserves. Deer parks flourished and proliferated under the Normans,&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Deer Park |volume=7 |page=924}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming a forerunner of the deer parks that became popular among England's landed gentry. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 records thirty-six of them.

Initially the [[Norman dynasty|Norman kings]] maintained an exclusive right to keep and hunt deer and established [[Royal forest|forest law]] for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/forests/glossary.htm Forests and Chases of England and Wales: A Glossary.] St John's College, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; In due course they also allowed members of the nobility and senior clergy to maintain deer parks. At their peak at the turn of the 14th century, deer parks may have covered 2% of the land area of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Rackham| first1 = Oliver  | editor-last=  | editor-first= | year = 2003  | chapter = Wood-Pasture | title = The Illustrated History of the Countryside  |  publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicolson  | location= London, UK  | ISBN = 9780297843351 | page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James I of England|James I]] was an enthusiast for hunting but it became less fashionable and popular after the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. The number of deer parks then declined, contemporary books documenting other more profitable uses for such an estate.&lt;ref&gt;An example is the planting for woods for firewood and shipbuilding in John Evelyn's ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber]]''&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century many deer parks were landscaped, where deer then became optional within larger country parks, several of which were created or enlarged from wealth from trade and colonization in the [[British Empire]]. These later mostly gave way to profitable agriculture dependent on crop prices, with large parts of the workforce having been attracted elsewhere following increasing [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]]. This created pressure to sell off parts or divide such estates while rural population growth pushed up poor law rates (particularly [[outdoor relief]] and the [[Labour Rate]]) and urban poverty led to the introduction of lump sum [[capital (economics)|capital taxation]] such as [[Inheritance Tax (United Kingdom)|inheritance tax]] and a shift in power away from the [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Estate Landscapes: Design, Improvements and Power in the Post-Medieval Landscape| editor1-last=Finch|editor1-first=Jonathan|editor2-last= Giles|editor2-first=Kate|year= 2007|publisher= Boydell and Brewer, Woodbridge and New York |pages=19–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deer parks are notable landscape features in their own right.  However, where they have survived into the 20th century, the lack of ploughing or development has often preserved other features within the park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beresford |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Beresford |title=History on the Ground |origyear=1957 |year=1998 |publisher=[[The History Press|Sutton Publishing]] |location= |isbn=0-7509-1884-5 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Tumulus|barrows (tumuli)]], [[Roman road]]s and [[abandoned village#United Kingdom|abandoned village]]s.

==Status==
To establish a deer park a royal licence was required, known as a "licence to empark"&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;—especially if the park was in or near a royal forest. Because of their cost and exclusivity, deer parks became status symbols. Deer were almost all kept within exclusive reserves with the larger ones often used as aristocratic playgrounds, for hunting, often with deer being driven into nets; and, there was no legitimate market for [[venison]] without an established provenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rackham |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Rackham |title=The History of the Countryside |origyear=1975 |year=1997|publisher=[[Phoenix Books|Phoenix Giant Paperback]] |location= |isbn= |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the ability to eat venison or give it to others was also a status symbol. Consequently, many deer parks were maintained for the supply of venison, rather than hunting the deer. Small deer parks which functioned primarily as household larders were attached to many smaller manors, such as at [[Umberleigh]] in Devon.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.) ''The Lisle Letters'', 6 vols., University of Chicago Press, Chicago &amp; London, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Owners would grant to their friends or to others to whom they owed a favour, a signed warrant for a specified number of deer, usually one only, specified as buck or doe, which the recipient would present to the park keeper who would select and kill one and hand the carcass to the grantee. The [[Lisle Papers]] dating from the 1530s contains many such letters from prospective grantees requesting such gifts from the park of [[Honor Grenville]], the lady of the manor of [[Umberleigh]] in Devon, and also contains reports to her from her [[bailiff]] listing grants of venison made from her park during the past year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Such grants acted as common features of the mediaeval social machinery.

==Licence to empark==
[[File:DyrhamLicence1511.jpg|thumb|200px|Royal licence to empark Dyrham granted by King Henry VIII to Sir [[William Denys]] (1470–1533), [[Esquire of the Body]], 5 June 1511. Appended is a rare perfect example of the Great Seal of Henry VIII. Collection of Dyrham Park, National Trust]]

King Henry VIII appointed Sir [[William Denys]] (1470–1533) an [[Esquire of the Body]] at some date before 5 June 1511. It was perhaps at the very time of William's appointment to that position at court that the King promised him the honour of a licence to empark 500 acres of his [[manor]] of [[Manor of Dyrham|Dyrham]] in Gloucestershire, which is to say to enclose the land with a wall or hedgebank and to establish a captive herd of deer within, with exclusive hunting rights. This grant is witnessed by a charter on parchment, to which is affixed a rare example of a perfect great seal of Henry VIII, now hanging in a frame beneath the main staircase of [[Dyrham Park]]. It clearly was handed down with the deeds of the manor on the termination of the Denys era at Dyrham. The charter is of exceptional interest as it is signed as witnesses by men of the greatest importance in the state, who were at the King's side at that moment, at the Palace of Westminster. The text of the document, translated from Latin is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Translation provided by information sheet by National Trust, at Dyrham Park; A summary of the charter was retained in the royal records, Charter Roll 200, no. 20, printed in ''Letters &amp; Papers of Henry VIII, Foreign &amp; Domestic, 1509–1514'', vol. 1, 5 June 1511, summarized as follows: "William Denys, Esquire for the Body, license by charter to impark 500 acres at Le Worthy within his manor of ''Dereham'' Gloucestershire &amp; to have [[Warren (free)|free-warren]] in all the [[demesne]]s of that manor. Witnesses:
W. Archbishop of Canterbury, Chancellor
R. Bishop of Winchester, Privy Seal
Thomas, Bishop of Durham, Secretary
Edward, Duke of Buckingham
Thomas, Marquis of Dorset
Thomas, Earl of Surrey, Treasurer
George, Earl of Shrewsbury, Steward of the Household
Charles Somerset, Chamberlain, Baron
George Nevile of Bergavenny, Baron
Sir Thomas Lovell, Treasurer of the Household
Sir Edward Poynings, Controller of the Household
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Henry by the grace of God King of England and France and Lord of Ireland sends greetings to his archbishops, bishops, abbotts, priors, dukes, marquises, earls, barons, judges, sheriffs, reeves, ministers and all our bailiffs and faithful subjects. Let it be known that we, motivated by our especial grace and certain knowledge of him, have granted for us and our heirs to our faithful servant William Denys, esquire of the Royal Body, to him, his heirs and assigns, the right to empark 500 acres of land, meadow, pasture and wood together with appurtenance at ''Le Worthy'' within the manor of ''Dereham'' in the county of Gloucestershire and enclose them with fences and hedges in order to make a park there. Also that they may have [[free warren]] in all their [[demesne]] lands within the said manor. No other person may enter this park or warren to hunt or catch anything which might belong to that park or warren without permission from William, his heirs or assigns under penalty of £10, provided that the land is not within our [[Royal forest|forest]].

Witnessed by:
* The most reverend in Christ father [[William Warham|William]] Canterbury our chancellor and archbishop
* The reverend in Christ fathers [[Richard Foxe|Richard]] Winchester, Keeper of the Privy Purse and
* [[Thomas Ruthall|Thomas]] Durham, our secretary, bishops.
* [[Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk|Thomas]] Surrey, Treasurer of England and
* George Shrewsbury, steward of our household, earls.
* Charles Somerset Lord Herbert, our chamberlain and
* George Neville of Abergavenny, barons.
* Thomas Lovell, treasurer of our household and
* Edward Poynings, comptroller of our household, knights, and many others.

Given by our hand at Westminster on the 5th day of June in the 3rd year of our reign. (1511)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{wide image|Dyrham Park deer under trees, panorama.jpg|800px|The herd of fallow deer in 2009 in the park at [[Dyrham Park|Dyrham]], Gloucestershire, established in 1511}}

From the size of the present park it appears that only about 250 acres were ultimately enclosed. The grant of emparkment was separate from and in addition to the grant of [[free warren]] in his [[demesne]] lands. This latter allowed him to hunt exclusively on his unemparked other untenanted lands which were managed by his own staff. High dry-stone walls, typical of Gloucestershire, still survive around parts of the present parkland, which is still stocked with a herd of fallow deer. The park was thus an area in which Denys's deer would be at his own disposal and would be safe from being hunted or otherwise taken by any other person, including his neighbours and the king himself. The king when on royal progress throughout his kingdom was accompanied by an enormous entourage which needed daily feeding and entertainment, both of which functions were achieved by holding driven game shoots, in which an area of ground several miles in area would be surrounded and any deer within would be  driven towards a specified exit where the king and his favoured courtiers would be awaiting with bows and arrows to kill them. Thus several dozen if not hundreds of deer could be killed in a single day, to the impoverishment of the local countryside for several months if not years into the future.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Thus any landowner with a licensed park, even if within the circuit of such a drive, would be immune from the entry of such beaters into his park, and his deer would remain untouched.

Early historical records are replete with instances of noblemen breaking into each other's parks and killing deer therein, often as a result of a local territorial dispute or vendetta or merely from high spirits. The penalties inflicted by royal justice were severe in such instances. For example, in 1523 Sir William St Loe (d. 1556) of [[Sutton Court]], [[Chew Magna]], Somerset, together with 16 others, armed with bows and arrows, crossbows and swords, broke into Banwell Park in Somerset, attached to [[Banwell|Banwell Abbey]], a residence belonging to [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] [[William Barlow (bishop of Chichester)|William Barlow]], and killed 4 bucks and other deer. In the following August he made a similar raid and killed more than 20 deer, the heads of which he stuck on the boundary palings. He was ordered to appear before a magistrate, but the record of his punishment if any has not survived. However, after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] a short while later, in 1552 Sir William obtained for himself from the crown the office of Keeper of Banwell Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banwellhistory.org.uk/deerpark.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812201701/http://www.banwellhistory.org.uk/deerpark.html |date=12 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
Deer parks could vary in size from a circumference of many miles down to what amounted to little more than a deer paddock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ukeconet.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Ecology_economics_Sept_2007.pdf |format=PDF |author=Rotherham, I.D |date=2007 |title=The ecology and economics of medieval deer parks |journal=Landscape Archaeology and Ecology |volume=6 |pages=86–102 |accessdate=16 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730034358/http://www.ukeconet.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Ecology_economics_Sept_2007.pdf |archivedate=30 July 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape within a deer park was manipulated to produce a habitat that was both suitable for the deer and also provided space for hunting. "Tree dotted lawns, tree clumps and compact woods"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Muir |first=Richard |authorlink= |title=Be Your Own Landscape Detective: Investigating Where You Are |year=2007 |publisher=[[The History Press|Sutton Publishing]] |location= |isbn=0-7509-4333-5 |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided "launds" (pasture)&lt;ref name=Trees&amp;Woodland146&gt;{{cite book |last=Rackham |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Rackham |title=Trees and Woodland in the British Landscape |series=Archaeology in the Field Series |year=1976 |publisher=[[J.

The landscape was intended to be visually attractive as well as functional.

==Identifying former deer parks==
[[William George Hoskins|W. G. Hoskins]] remarked that "the reconstruction of medieval parks and their boundaries is one of the many useful tasks awaiting the field-worker with patience and a good local knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoskins |first=W. G. |authorlink=William George Hoskins |title=The Making of the English Landscape |origyear=1955 |year=1985 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location= |isbn=0-14-007964-5 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most deer parks were bounded by significant [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] topped by a park [[Palisade|pale]], typically of cleft oak stakes.&lt;ref name=Trees&amp;Woodland144&gt;{{cite book |last=Rackham |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Rackham |title=Trees and Woodland in the British Landscape |series=Archaeology in the Field Series |year=1976 |publisher=[[J. M. Dent]] &amp; Sons Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-460-04183-5 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; These boundaries typically have a curving, rounded plan, possibly to economise on the materials and work involved in fencing&lt;ref name=Trees&amp;Woodland144/&gt; and ditching.

A few deer parks in areas with plentiful building stone had stone walls instead of a park pale.&lt;ref name=Trees&amp;Woodland144/&gt; Examples include [[Barnsdale]] in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Burghley House|Burghley]] on the [[Cambridgeshire]]/[[Lincolnshire]] border.&lt;ref name=Trees&amp;Woodland144/&gt;

Boundary earthworks have survived "in considerable numbers and a good state of preservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crawford |first=O.G.S. |authorlink=O. G. S. Crawford |title=Archaeology in the Field |year=1953 |publisher=Phoenix House |location=London |isbn= |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even where the bank and ditch do not survive, their former course can sometimes still be traced in modern field boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liddiard |first=R. |authorlink= |title=The Medieval Deer Park: New Perspectives |year=2007 |publisher=Windgather Press |location= |isbn= |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundaries of early deer parks often formed parish boundaries. Where the deer park reverted to agriculture, the newly established [[field system]] was often rectilinear, clearly contrasting with the system outside the park.

'''Edmund Burke''' ({{IPAc-en|'|b|ɜr|k}}; 12 January &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[New Style|NS]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1729&lt;ref&gt;The exact year of his birth is the subject of a great deal of controversy; 1728, 1729, and 1730 have been proposed. The month and day of his birth also are subject to question, a problem compounded by the [[Julian calendar|Julian]]–[[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] changeover in 1752, during his lifetime. For a fuller treatment of the question, see F. P. Lock, ''Edmund Burke. Volume I: 1730–1784'' (Clarendon Press, 1999), pp. 16–17. [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] (2008; p. 14) questions Burke's birthplace as having been in Dublin, arguing in favour of Shanballymore, Co. Cork (in the house of his uncle, James Nagle).&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}9 July 1797) was an [[Irish people| Irish]]&lt;ref&gt;Clark 2001, p. 25: "Edmund Burke was an Irishman, born in Dublin but in an age before 'Celtic nationalism' had been constructed to make Irishness and Englishness incompatible: he was therefore free also to describe himself, without misrepresentation, as 'a loyalist being loyal to England' to denote his membership of the wider polity. He never attempted to disguise his Irishness (as some ambitious Scots in eighteenth-century England tried to anglicise their accents), did what he could in the Commons to promote the interests of his native country and was bitterly opposed to the Penal Laws against Irish Catholics."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |authorlink=Christopher Hitchens |title=Reactionary Prophet |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2004/04/hitchens.htm |newspaper=The Atlantic |location=Washington |date=April 2004 |quote=Edmund Burke was neither an Englishman nor a Tory. He was an Irishman, probably a Catholic Irishman at that (even if perhaps a secret sympathiser), and for the greater part of his life he upheld the more liberal principles of the Whig faction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC - History - Edmund Burke|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/burke_edmund.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Politician|statesman]] born in [[Dublin]], as well as an author, orator, [[political theorist]] and philosopher, who after moving to London in 1750 served as a member of parliament (MP) between 1766 and 1794 in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] with the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]].

Burke was a proponent of underpinning virtues with manners in society and of the importance of religious institutions for the moral stability and good of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bourke, ''Empire and Revolution: The Political Life of Edmund Burke'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} These views were expressed in his ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. Burke criticized British treatment of the [[British America|American colonies]], including through its taxation policies. He also supported the rights of the colonists to resist metropolitan authority, though he opposed the attempt to achieve independence. Burke is remembered for his support for [[Catholic emancipation]], the impeachment of [[Warren Hastings]] from the [[East India Company]] and for his staunch opposition to the [[French Revolution]]. In his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', Burke asserted that the revolution was destroying the fabric of good society and traditional institutions of state and society, and condemned the persecution of the [[Catholic Church]] that resulted from it. This led to his becoming the leading figure within the conservative faction of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]], which he dubbed the "Old Whigs", as opposed to the pro-French Revolution "New Whigs", led by [[Charles James Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke lived before the terms "conservative" and "liberal" were used to describe political ideologies, cf. J. C. D. Clark, ''English Society, 1660–1832'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2000), pp. 5, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, Burke was praised by both conservatives and liberals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dennis O'Keeffe |author2=John Meadowcroft |title=Edmund Burke |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVO9QuYUGwwC&amp;pg=PA93 |year=2009 |publisher=Continuum |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in the twentieth century he became widely regarded as the philosophical founder of modern [[conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Heywood, ''Political Ideologies: An Introduction. Third Edition'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Lock, ''Edmund Burke. Volume II: 1784–1797'' (Clarendon Press, 2006), p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Burke was born in [[Dublin]], Ireland. His mother Mary ''née'' Nagle (c. 1702–1770) was a Roman Catholic who hailed from a [[wikt:declasse|declasse]] [[County Cork]] family (and a cousin of [[Nano Nagle]]), whereas his father, a successful solicitor, Richard (died 1761), was a member of the [[Church of Ireland]]; it remains unclear whether this is the same Richard Burke who converted from Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Clark 2001, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Langford, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4019 Burke, Edmund (1729/30–1797)], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 18 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House of Burke|Burke dynasty]] descends from an [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[knight]] surnamed de Burgh (Latinised as ''de Burgo'') who arrived in Ireland in 1185 following [[Henry II of England]]'s 1171 [[Norman invasion of Ireland|invasion of Ireland]] and is among the chief "Gall" (or "[[Normans in Ireland#Old English|Old English]]") families that assimilated into Gaelic society, becoming "[[more Irish than the Irish themselves]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Prior (surgeon)|James Prior]], ''Life of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. Fifth Edition'' (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke adhered to his father's faith and remained a practising Anglican throughout his life, unlike his sister Juliana who was brought up as and remained a Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Brien|first1=Connor Cruise|page=10|title=The Great Melody|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, his political enemies repeatedly accused him of having been educated at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[College of St. Omer]], near [[Calais]], France, and of harbouring secret Catholic sympathies at a time when membership of the Catholic Church would disqualify him from public office (''see'' [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws in Ireland]]). As Burke told [[Frances Crewe, Lady Crewe|Frances Crewe]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Burke's Enemies often endeavoured to convince the World that he had been bred up in the Catholic Faith, &amp; that his Family were of it, &amp; that he himself had been educated at St. Omer—but this was false, as his father was a regular practitioner of the Law at Dublin, which he could not be unless of the Established Church: &amp; it so happened that though Mr. B—was twice at Paris, he never happened to go through the Town of [[Saint-Omer|St. Omer]].&lt;ref&gt;"Extracts from Mr. Burke's Table-talk, at Crewe Hall. Written down by Mrs. Crewe, pp. 62.", ''Miscellanies of the Philobiblon Society. Volume VII'' (London: Whittingham and Wilkins, 1862–63), pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After being elected to the House of Commons, Burke was required to take the [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|oath of Allegiance]] and [[Abjuration#Great Britain and Ireland|abjuration]], the [[oath of supremacy]], and declare against [[transubstantiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Although never denying his Irishness, Burke often described himself as "an Englishman". According to the historian [[J. C. D. Clark]], this was in an age "before 'Celtic nationalism' sought to make Irishness and Englishness incompatible".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child he sometimes spent time away from the unhealthy air of Dublin with his mother's family in the [[Munster Blackwater|Blackwater]] Valley in County Cork. He received his early education at a [[Quakers|Quaker]] school in [[Ballitore]], County Kildare, some {{convert|67|km|mi}} from Dublin; and possibly, like his cousin [[Nano Nagle]] at a [[Hedge school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.distancesfrom.com/ie/distance-from-Dublin-to-Baltimore-Ireland/DistanceHistory/1830632.aspx?IsHistory=1&amp;GMapHistoryID=1830632 |title=DistanceFrom.com Dublin, Ireland to Ballitore, Co. Kildare, Ireland|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=DistanceFrom.com |publisher=softusvista. |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in correspondence with his schoolmate from there, [[Mary Leadbeater]], the daughter of the school's owner, throughout his life.

In 1744, Burke started at [[Trinity College Dublin]], a Protestant [[university|establishment]], which up until 1793, did not permit Catholics to take [[academic degree|degrees]].&lt;ref name="millbanksystems"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1834/may/08/catholics-and-trinity-college-dublin|title=Catholics and Trinity College Dublin. (Hansard, 8 May 1834)|publisher=hansard.millbanksystems.com|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1747, he set up a debating society, "Edmund Burke's Club", which, in 1770, merged with TCD's Historical Club to form the [[College Historical Society]]; it is the oldest undergraduate society in the world. The minutes of the meetings of Burke's Club remain in the collection of the Historical Society. Burke graduated from Trinity in 1748. Burke's father wanted him to read Law, and with this in mind he went to London in 1750, where he entered the [[Middle Temple]], before soon giving up legal study to travel in [[Continental Europe]]. After eschewing the Law, he pursued a livelihood through writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edmund Burke|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_burke.html|publisher=The Basics of Philosophy|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early writing==
The late [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Lord Bolingbroke]]'s ''Letters on the Study and Use of History'' was published in 1752 and his collected works appeared in 1754. This provoked Burke into writing his first published work, ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society|A Vindication of Natural Society: A View of the Miseries and Evils Arising to Mankind]]'', appearing in Spring 1756. Burke imitated Bolingbroke's style and ideas in a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of his arguments for [[atheistic]] [[rationalism]], in order to demonstrate their [[absurdity]].&lt;ref name="Prior, p. 45"&gt;Prior, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim McCue, ''Edmund Burke and Our Present Discontents'' (The Claridge Press, 1997), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Edmund Burke2 c.jpg|left|thumb|"The writers against religion, whilst they oppose every system, are wisely careful never to set up any of their own." ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society]]'']]

Burke claimed that Bolingbroke's arguments against [[Revelation|revealed religion]] could apply to all social and civil institutions as well.&lt;ref name="Critical Dict"&gt;{{cite book |title=A critical dictionary of English literature and British and American authors, living and deceased, from the earliest accounts to the latter half of the nineteenth century. Containing over forty-six thousand articles (authors), with forty indexes of subjects |ol=7102188M |url=https://archive.org/details/criticaldictiona01alliuoft/page/288 |authorlink=Samuel Austin Allibone |last=Allibone |first=Samuel Austin |year=1908 |publisher=[[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.]] |volume=1 |page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] and [[William Warburton|Bishop Warburton]] (and others) initially thought that the work was genuinely by Bolingbroke rather than a [[satire]].&lt;ref name="Prior, p. 45"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; All the reviews of the work were positive, with critics especially appreciative of Burke's quality of writing. Some reviewers failed to notice the [[ironic]] nature of the book, which led to Burke stating in the preface to the second edition (1757) that it was a satire.&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. I, p. 85"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Hurd (clergyman)|Richard Hurd]] believed that Burke's imitation was near-perfect and that this defeated his purpose: an [[ironist]] "should take care by a constant exaggeration to make the ''ridicule'' shine through the Imitation. Whereas this ''Vindication'' is everywhere enforc'd, not only in the language, and on the principles of L. Bol., but with so apparent, or rather so real an earnestness, that half his purpose is sacrificed to the other".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. I, p. 85" /&gt; A minority of scholars have taken the position that, in fact, Burke did write the ''Vindication'' in earnest, later disowning it only for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard11.html |title=Edmund Burke, Anarchist |accessdate=14 October 2007 |author=Rothbard, Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Sobran|Sobran, Joseph]], [http://www.sobran.com/columns/2002/020124.shtml Anarchism, Reason, and History]: "Oddly enough, the great conservative Edmund Burke began his career with an anarchist tract, arguing that the state was naturally and historically destructive of human society, life, and liberty. Later he explained that he'd intended his argument ironically, but many have doubted this. His argument for anarchy was too powerful, passionate, and cogent to be a joke. Later, as a professional politician, Burke seems to have come to terms with the state, believing that no matter how bloody its origins, it could be tamed and civilized, as in Europe, by "the spirit of a gentleman, and the spirit of religion". But even as he wrote, the old order he loved was already breaking down. "&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1757, Burke published a treatise on [[aesthetics]], ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'', which attracted the attention of prominent Continental thinkers such as [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. It was his only purely philosophical work, and when asked by [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] and [[French Laurence]] to expand it thirty years later, Burke replied that he was no longer fit for abstract speculation (Burke had written it before he was nineteen years of age).&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February 1757, Burke signed a contract with [[Robert Dodsley]] to write a "history of England from the time of Julius Caesar to the end of the reign of Queen Anne", its length being eighty quarto sheets (640 pages), nearly 400,000 words. It was to be submitted for publication by Christmas 1758.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke completed the work to the year 1216 and stopped; it was not published until after Burke's death, being included in an 1812 collection of his works, entitled ''An Essay Towards an Abridgement of the English History''. [[G. M. Young]] did not value Burke's history and claimed that it was "demonstrably a translation from the French".&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Young, 'Burke', ''Proceedings of the British Academy'', XXIX (London, 1943), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Acton]], on commenting on the story that Burke stopped his history because [[David Hume]] published his, said "it is ever to be regretted that the reverse did not occur".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Butterfield, ''Man on His Past'' (Cambridge, 1955), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the year following that contract, with Dodsley, Burke founded the influential ''[[Annual Register]]'', a publication in which various authors evaluated the international political events of the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 52–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which Burke contributed to the ''Annual Register'' is unclear:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wellsted Copeland, 'Edmund Burke and the Book Reviews in Dodsley's Annual Register', ''Publications of the [[Modern Language Association]]'', Vol. 57, No. 2. (Jun. 1942), pp. 446–68.&lt;/ref&gt; in his biography of Burke, Robert Murray quotes the ''Register'' as evidence of Burke's opinions, yet Philip Magnus in his biography does not cite it directly as a reference.&lt;ref name="Copeland, p. 446"&gt;Copeland, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke remained the [[chief editor]] of the publication until at least 1789 and there is no evidence that any other writer contributed to it before 1766.&lt;ref name="Copeland, p. 446" /&gt;

On 12 March 1757, Burke married Jane Mary Nugent (1734–1812), daughter of Dr [[Christopher Nugent (physician)|Christopher Nugent]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/41200 www.ucl.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; a Catholic physician who had provided him with medical treatment at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. Their son [[Richard Burke Jr.|Richard]] was born on 9 February 1758; an elder son, Christopher, died in infancy. Burke also helped raise a [[Ward (law)|ward]], Edmund Nagle (''later'' [[Admiral]] [[Sir Edmund Nagle]]), the son of a maternal cousin orphaned in 1763.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19720 Nagle, Sir Edmund], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[John Knox Laughton|J. K. Laughton]], (subscription required), Retrieved 22 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

At about this same time, Burke was introduced to [[William Gerard Hamilton]] (known as "Single-speech Hamilton"). When Hamilton was appointed [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], Burke accompanied him to Dublin as his [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|private secretary]], a position he held for three years. In 1765 Burke became [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|private secretary]] to the liberal Whig statesman, [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Charles, Marquess of Rockingham]], then [[Prime Minister of Great Britain]], who remained Burke's close friend and associate until his untimely death in 1782. Rockingham also introduced Burke as a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].&lt;ref&gt;Denslow, William R., 10,000 Famous Freemasons, 4 vol., Missouri Lodge of Research, Trenton, Missouri, 1957–61. vol. 1, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/burke_e/burke_e.html |title=Edmund Burke |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca |date= |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member of Parliament==
{{The Club|size=250px|align=right}}&lt;!--the grammar in the caption is incorrect, ''who is '''who''''' should read, ''to identify each member''--&gt;

In December 1765, Burke entered the House of Commons of the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] as Member for [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]], a [[pocket borough]] in the gift of Lord Fermanagh, later [[Earl Verney|2nd Earl Verney]] and a close political ally of Rockingham. After Burke delivered his [[maiden speech]], [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] said he had "spoken in such a manner as to stop the mouths of all Europe" and that the Commons should congratulate itself on acquiring such a Member.&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first great subject Burke addressed was the controversy with the American colonies, which soon developed into [[American Revolutionary War|war]] and ultimate [[United States Declaration of Independence|separation]]; in reply to the 1769 [[George Grenville|Grenvillite]] [[pamphlet]], ''The Present State of the Nation'', he published his own pamphlet on, ''Observations on a Late State of the Nation''. Surveying the finances of France, Burke predicts "some extraordinary convulsion in that whole system".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year, with mostly borrowed money, Burke purchased ''Gregories'', a {{convert|600|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} estate near [[Beaconsfield]]. Although the [[Estate (land)|estate]] included saleable assets such as [[art work]]s by [[Titian]], ''Gregories'' proved a heavy financial burden in the following decades and Burke was never able to repay its purchase price in full. His speeches and writings, having made him famous, led to the suggestion that he was the author of the ''[[Letters of Junius]]''.

At about this time, Burke joined the circle of leading intellectuals and artists in London of whom [[Samuel Johnson]] was the central luminary. This [[Social circle|circle]] also included [[David Garrick]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], and [[Joshua Reynolds]]. [[Edward Gibbon]] described Burke as 'the most eloquent and rational madman that I ever knew'.&lt;ref&gt;''Private Letters of Edward Gibbon, II (1896)'' Prothero, P. (ed.). p. 251 cited in ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire: 1781–1998'' (2007) Brendon, Piers. Jonathan Cape, London. p. 10 {{ISBN|978-0-224-06222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Johnson admired Burke's brilliance, he found him a dishonest politician.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, ''Life of Samuel Johnson'', edited by Hill-Powell; v. II, p. 349; 7 April 1775&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, Journals, ''Boswell: The Ominous Years'', p. 134, edited by Ryskamp &amp; Pottle; McGraw Hill, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke took a leading role in the debate regarding the constitutional limits to the executive authority of the [[George III of the United Kingdom|king]]. He argued strongly against unrestrained royal power and for the role of political parties in maintaining a principled opposition capable of preventing abuses, either by the monarch, or by specific factions within the government. His most important publication in this regard was his ''Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents'' of 23 April 1770.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=Burke: Select Works of Edmund Burke, Vol. 1, Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke identified the "discontents" as stemming from the "secret influence" of a neo-Tory group he labelled as, the "king's friends", whose system "comprehending the exterior and interior administrations, is commonly called, in the technical language of the Court, ''Double Cabinet''".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain needed a party with "an unshaken adherence to principle, and attachment to connexion, against every allurement of interest". Party divisions "whether operating for good or evil, are things inseparable from free government".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gregories Estate near Beaconsfield Buckinghamshire 1792.jpg|thumb|The ''Gregories'' estate, purchased by Burke for £20,000 in 1768]]
During 1771, Burke wrote a Bill that, if passed, would have given [[jury|juries]] the right to determine what was [[libel]]. Burke spoke in favour of the Bill but it was opposed by some, including [[Charles James Fox]] thus not becoming law. Fox, when introducing [[Libel Act 1792|his own Bill]] in 1791 in Opposition, repeated almost verbatim the text of Burke's Bill without acknowledgement.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 127 + pp. 340–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke also was prominent in securing the right to publish debates held in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in a parliamentary debate on the prohibition on the export of grain on 16 November 1770, Burke argued in favour of a [[free market]] in corn: "There are no such things as a high, &amp; a low price that is encouraging, &amp; discouraging; there is nothing but a natural price, which grain brings at an universal market."&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', pp. 321–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772 Burke was instrumental in the passing of the [[Repeal of Certain Laws Act 1772]], which repealed various old laws against dealers and forestallers in corn.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Annual Register'' for 1772 (published in July 1773), Burke condemned the [[First Partition of Poland|Partition of Poland]]. He saw it as "the first very great breach in the modern political system of Europe" and as upsetting the balance of power in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brendan Simms]], ''Three Victories and a Defeat. The Rise and Fall of the First British Empire, 1714–1783'' (Allen Lane, 2007), pp. 569–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 1774, Burke was elected Member for [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol]], at the time "England's second city" and a large constituency with a genuine electoral contest. The platform on which he was elected included the ''Speech to the Electors of Bristol'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch13s7.html uchicago.edu: "Edmund Burke, Speech to the Electors of Bristol"] 3 Nov. 1774, Works 1:446--48&lt;/ref&gt; a remarkable disclaimer of the constituent-imperative form of democracy, for which he substituted his statement of the "representative mandate" form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article

In May 1778, Burke supported a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|parliamentary motion]] revising restrictions on Irish trade. His constituents, citizens of the great trading city of Bristol, however urged Burke to oppose [[free trade]] with Ireland. Burke resisted their protestations and said: "If, from this conduct, I shall forfeit their suffrages at an ensuing election, it will stand on record an example to future representatives of the Commons of England, that one man at least had dared to resist the desires of his constituents when his judgment assured him they were wrong".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke published, ''Two Letters to Gentlemen of Bristol on the Bills relative to the Trade of Ireland'', in which he espoused "some of the chief principles of commerce; such as the advantage of free intercourse between all parts of the same kingdom...the evils attending restriction and monopoly...and that the gain of others is not necessarily our loss, but on the contrary an advantage by causing a greater demand for such wares as we have for sale".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 175–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke also supported the attempts of [[Sir George Savile, 8th Baronet|Sir George Savile]] to repeal some of the [[penal laws]] against Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke also called capital punishment "the Butchery which we call justice" in 1776 and in 1780 he condemned the use of the [[pillory]] for two men convicted for attempting to practice [[sodomy]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

This support for unpopular causes, notably free trade with Ireland and [[Catholic Emancipation]], led to Burke losing his [[Legislative seat|seat]] in 1780. For the remainder of his parliamentary career, Burke represented [[Malton (UK Parliament constituency)|Malton]], another pocket borough under the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquess of Rockingham]]'s patronage.

==American War of Independence==
Burke expressed his support for the grievances of the [[American Colonies]] under the government of [[King George III]] and his appointed representatives. On 19 April 1774 Burke made a speech, "[[On American Taxation]]" (published in January 1775), on a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] to repeal the [[Tea Act|tea duty]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again and again, revert to your old principles—seek peace and ensue it; leave America, if she has taxable matter in her, to tax herself. I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor attempting to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; I hate the very sound of them. Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it... Do not burthen them with taxes... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question... If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will cast your sovereignty in your face. No body of men will be argued into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 142–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 22 March 1775, in the House of Commons, Burke delivered a speech (published during May 1775) on reconciliation with America. Burke appealed for peace as preferable to civil war and reminded the House of America's growing population, its industry, and its wealth. He warned against the notion that the Americans would back down in the face of force, since most Americans were of British descent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the people of the colonies are descendants of Englishmen... They are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to English ideas and on English principles. The people are Protestants... a persuasion not only favourable to liberty, but built upon it... My hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection. These are ties which, though light as air, are as strong as links of iron. Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your government—they will cling and grapple to you, and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance. But let it be once understood that your government may be one thing and their privileges another, that these two things may exist without any mutual relation—the cement is gone, the cohesion is loosened, and everything hastens to decay and dissolution. As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race and sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their faces towards you. The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can have anywhere. It is a weed that grows in every soil. They may have it from Spain, they may have it from Prussia. But, until you become lost to all feeling of your true interest and your natural dignity, freedom they can have from none but you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm |title=Speech on Moving Resolutions for Conciliation with America, 22 March 1775 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke prized peace with America above all else, pleading with the House of Commons to remember that the interest by way of money received from the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] was far more attractive than any sense of putting the [[colonist]]s in their place:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The proposition is peace. Not peace through the medium of war, not peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endless negotiations, not peace to arise out of universal discord... it is simple peace, sought in its natural course and in its ordinary haunts. It is peace sought in the spirit of peace, and laid in principles purely pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm |title=Speech on Moving Resolutions for Conciliation with America, 22 March 1775 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke was not merely presenting a [[Peace treaty|peace agreement]] to Parliament; rather, he stepped forward with four reasons against using force, carefully reasoned. He laid out his objections in an orderly manner, focusing on one before moving to the next. His first concern was that the use of force would have to be temporary, and that the uprisings and objections to British governance in [[British America|Colonial America]] would not be. Second, Burke worried about the uncertainty surrounding whether Britain would win a conflict in America. "An armament", Burke said, "is not a victory".&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Edmund|title=Speech to Parliament on Reconciliation with the American Colonies|url=http://americainclass.org/sources/makingrevolution/war/text1/burkereconspeech.pdf|website=America in Class|publisher=National Humanities Center|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, Burke brought up the issue of impairment; it would do the British Government no good to engage in a scorched earth war and have the object they desired (America) become damaged or even useless. The American colonists could always retreat into the mountains, but the land they left behind would most likely be unusable, whether by accident or design. The fourth and final reason to avoid the use of force was experience; the British had never attempted to rein in an unruly colony by force, and they did not know if it could be done, let alone accomplished thousands of miles away from home.&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"/&gt; Not only were all of these concerns reasonable, but some turned out to be prophetic—the American colonists did not surrender, even when things looked extremely bleak, and the British were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to win a war fought on American soil.

It was not temporary force, uncertainty, impairment, or even experience that Burke cited as the number one reason for avoiding war with the American colonies, however; it was the character of the American people themselves: "In this character of Americans, a love of freedom is the predominating feature which marks and distinguishes the whole... this fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the English colonies, probably, than in any other people of the earth... [the] men [are] acute, inquisitive, dextrous, prompt in attack, ready in defense, full of resources..."&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"/&gt; Burke concludes with another plea for peace, and a prayer that Britain might avoid actions which, in Burke's words, "may bring on the destruction of this Empire".&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"/&gt;

Burke proposed six resolutions to settle the American conflict peacefully:
# Allow the American colonists to elect their own representatives, thus settling the dispute about taxation without representation;
# Acknowledge this wrongdoing and apologise for grievances caused;
# Procure an efficient manner of choosing and sending these delegates;
# Set up a General Assembly in America itself, with powers to regulate taxes;
# Stop gathering taxes by imposition (or law), and start gathering them only when they are needed; and
# Grant needed aid to the colonies.&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"/&gt;

The effect of these resolutions, had they been passed, can never be known. Unfortunately, Burke delivered this speech just less than a month before the explosive conflict at Concord and Lexington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lexington and Concord|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/11c.asp|website=USHistory.org|publisher=Independence Hall Association in Philadelphia|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as these resolutions were not enacted, little was done that would help to dissuade conflict.

Among the reasons this speech was so greatly admired was its passage on [[Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]] (1684–1775); Burke describes an angel in 1704 prophesying to Bathurst the future greatness of England and also of America: "Young man, There is America—which at this day serves little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men, and uncouth manners; yet shall, before you taste of death, shew itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. I, p. 384"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Johnson]] was so irritated at hearing it continually praised, that he made a parody of it, where the devil appears to a young Whig and predicts that in short time, [[Whiggism]] will poison even the paradise of America!&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. I, p. 384" /&gt;

The administration of [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] (1770–1782) tried to defeat the colonist rebellion by military force. British and American forces clashed in 1775 and, in 1776, came the [[American Declaration of Independence]]. Burke was appalled by celebrations in Britain of the defeat of the Americans at New York and Pennsylvania. He claimed the English national character was being changed by this authoritarianism.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Burke wrote: "As to the good people of England, they seem to partake every day more and more of the Character of that administration which they have been induced to tolerate. I am satisfied, that within a few years there has been a great Change in the National Character. We seem no longer that eager, inquisitive, jealous, fiery people, which we have been formerly".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Burke's view, the British Government was fighting "the American English" ("our English Brethren in the Colonies"), with a [[House of Hanover|Germanic king]] employing "the hireling sword of German boors and vassals" to destroy the English liberties of the colonists.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; On [[American independence]], Burke wrote: "I do not know how to wish success to those whose Victory is to separate from us a large and noble part of our Empire. Still less do I wish success to injustice, oppression and absurdity".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Gordon Riots]] in 1780, Burke became a target of hostility and his home was placed under armed guard by the military.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert pp. 48–73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paymaster of the Forces==
[[File:Cincinnatus in retirement.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In ''Cincinnatus in Retirement'' (1782), [[James Gillray]] caricatured Burke's support of rights for Catholics.]]

The fall of North led to Rockingham being recalled to power in March 1782. Burke was appointed [[Paymaster of the Forces]] and a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]], but without a seat in Cabinet. Rockingham's unexpected death in July 1782 and replacement with Shelburne as Prime Minister, put an end to his administration after only a few months, however, Burke did manage to introduce two Acts.

The [[Paymaster General Act 1782]] ended the post as a lucrative sinecure. Previously, Paymasters had been able to draw on money from HM Treasury at their discretion. Now they were required to put the money they had requested to withdraw from the Treasury into the Bank of England, from where it was to be withdrawn for specific purposes. The Treasury would receive monthly statements of the Paymaster's balance at the Bank. This act was repealed by Shelburne's administration, but the act that replaced it repeated verbatim almost the whole text of the Burke Act.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 511 + n. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782]] was a watered down version of Burke's original intentions as outlined in his famous ''Speech on Economical Reform'' of 11 February 1780. He managed, however, to abolish 134 offices in the royal household and civil administration.&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The third [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] and the [[Board of Trade]] were abolished and pensions were limited and regulated. The Act was anticipated to save £72,368 a year.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', pp. 511–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1783, Burke resumed the post of Paymaster of the Forces when Shelburne's government fell and was replaced by a coalition headed by North that included Charles James Fox. That coalition fell in 1783, and was succeeded by the long Tory administration of [[William Pitt the Younger]], which lasted until 1801. Accordingly, having supported Fox and North, Burke was in opposition for the remainder of his political life.

==Democracy==
In 1774, Burke's ''Speech to the Electors at Bristol at the Conclusion of the Poll'' was noted for its defence of the principles of [[Representation (politics)|representative]] government against the notion that elected officials should merely be delegates:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. Volume I'' (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), pp. 446–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Political scientist [[Hanna Pitkin]] points out that Burke linked the interest of the district with the proper behaviour of its elected official, explaining, "Burke conceives of broad, relatively fixed interest, few in number and clearly defined, of which any group or locality has just one. These interests are largely economic or associated with particular localities whose livelihood they characterize, in his over-all prosperity they involve."&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Fenichel Pitkin, ''The concept of representation'' (1972) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke was a leading sceptic with respect to democracy. While admitting that theoretically, in some cases it might be desirable, he insisted a democratic government in Britain in his day would not only be inept, but also oppressive. He opposed democracy for three basic reasons. First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people. Second, he thought that if they had the vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property. Third, Burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over [[Tyranny of the majority|unpopular minorities]], who needed the protection of the upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Hamburger, "Burke, Edmund" in Seymour Martin Lipset, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of Democracy'' (Congressional Quarterly, 1995) 1:147–49&lt;/ref&gt;

==India and the impeachment of Warren Hastings==
{{main|Impeachment of Warren Hastings}}

For years Burke pursued impeachment efforts against [[Warren Hastings]], formerly Governor-General of Bengal, that resulted in the trial during 1786. His interaction with the British dominion of India began well before Hastings' impeachment trial. For two decades prior to the impeachment, Parliament had dealt with the Indian issue. This trial was the pinnacle of years of unrest and deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;Siraj Ahmed, "The Theater of the Civilized Self: Edmund Burke and the East India Trials". ''[[Representations]]'' 78 (2002): 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1781 Burke was first able to delve into the issues surrounding the [[East India Company]] when he was appointed Chairman of the Commons Select Committee on East Indian Affairs—from that point until the end of the trial; India was Burke's primary concern. This committee was charged "to investigate alleged injustices in Bengal, the war with Hyder Ali, and other Indian difficulties".&lt;ref&gt;Russell Kirk, ''Edmund Burke: A Genius Reconsidered'' (1988), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While Burke and the committee focused their attention on these matters, a second 'secret' committee was formed to assess the same issues. Both committee reports were written by Burke. Among other purposes, the reports conveyed to the [[Maharaja|Indian princes]] that Britain would not wage war on them, along with demanding that the East India Company should recall Hastings. This was Burke's first call for substantive change regarding imperial practices. When addressing the whole House of Commons regarding the committee report, Burke described the Indian issue as one that "began 'in commerce' but 'ended in empire.'"&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth D. Samet, "A Prosecutor and a Gentleman: Edmund Burke's Idiom of Impeachment", ''[[ELH]]'' 68, no. 2 (2001): 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 1785, Burke delivered a now-famous speech, ''The [[Nabob of Arcot]]'s Debts'', wherein he condemned the damage to [[India]] by the East India Company. In the province of the [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]] the Indians had constructed a system of reservoirs to make the soil fertile in a naturally dry region, and centred their society on the husbandry of water:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These are the monuments of real kings, who were the fathers of their people; testators to a posterity which they embraced as their own. These are the grand sepulchres built by ambition; but by the ambition of an insatiable benevolence, which, not contented with reigning in the dispensation of happiness during the contracted term of human life, had strained, with all the reachings and graspings of a vivacious mind, to extend the dominion of their bounty beyond the limits of nature, and to perpetuate themselves through generations of generations, the guardians, the protectors, the nourishers of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke held that the advent of British dominion, and in particular the conduct of the East India Company, had destroyed much that was good in these traditions and that, as a consequence of this, and the lack of new customs to replace them, the Indians were suffering. He set about establishing a set of British expectations, whose moral foundation would, in his opinion, warrant the empire.&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April 1786, Burke presented the Commons with the ''Article of Charge of [[High Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' against Hastings. The [[impeachment]] in Westminster Hall, which did not begin until 14 February 1788, would be the "first major public discursive event of its kind in England",&lt;ref&gt;Mithi Mukherjee, "Justice, War, and the Imperium: India and Britain in Edmund Burke's Prosecutorial Speeches", ''Law and History Review'' 23, no. 3 (2005): 589.&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the morality and duty of imperialism to the forefront of public perception. Burke already was known for his eloquent rhetorical skills and his involvement in the trial only enhanced its popularity and significance.&lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee, ''Justice, War, and the Imperium'', 590.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's indictment, fuelled by emotional indignation, branded Hastings a 'captain-general of iniquity'; who never dined without 'creating a famine'; whose heart was 'gangrened to the core', and who resembled both a 'spider of Hell' and a 'ravenous vulture devouring the carcasses of the dead'.&lt;ref&gt;Piers Brendon, ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire: 1781–1998'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2007), p. 35. {{ISBN|978-0-224-06222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Commons eventually [[Impeachment of Warren Hastings|impeached Hastings]], but subsequently, the House of Lords acquitted him of all charges.

==French Revolution: 1688 versus 1789==
[[File:Smelling out a rat.jpg|thumb|''Smelling out a Rat;—or—The Atheistical-Revolutionist disturbed in his Midnight "Calculations"'' (1790) by Gillray, depicting a caricature of Burke holding a crown and a cross; the seated man, Dr. Richard Price, is writing "On the Benefits of Anarchy Regicide Atheism" beneath a picture of the execution of [[Charles I of England]].]]
[[File:BurkeReflections.jpg|thumb|''Reflections on the Revolution in France, And on the Proceedings in Certain Societies in London Relative to that Event. In a Letter Intended to Have Been Sent to a Gentleman in Paris. By the Right Honourable Edmund Burke.'']]

Initially, Burke did not condemn the [[French Revolution]]. In a letter of 9 August 1789, he wrote: "England gazing with astonishment at a French struggle for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought I saw something like it in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The events of 5–6 October 1789, when [[Women's March on Versailles|a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles]] to compel [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In a letter to his son, Richard Burke, dated 10 October he said: "This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France—where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it—where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November Charles-Jean-François Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken "as no more than the expression of doubt" but he added: "You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month he described France as "a country undone". Burke's first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred on the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on 9 February 1790, provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the House had been prorogued in the summer much work was done in France. The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world. In that very short space of time they had completely pulled down to the ground, their monarchy; their church; their nobility; their law; their revenue; their army; their navy; their commerce; their arts; and their manufactures... [there was a danger of] an imitation of the excesses of an irrational, unprincipled, proscribing, confiscating, plundering, ferocious, bloody and tyrannical democracy... [in religion] the danger of their example is no longer from intolerance, but from Atheism; a foul, unnatural vice, foe to all the dignity and consolation of mankind; which seems in France, for a long time, to have been embodied into a faction, accredited, and almost avowed.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 1790, Burke read Dr. [[Richard Price]]'s sermon of 4 November 1789 entitled, ''[[A Discourse on the Love of Our Country]]'', to the [[Revolution Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/price/price_8.htm |title=A Discourse on the Love of our Country |publisher=Constitution.org |date= |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That society had been founded to commemorate the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. In this sermon Price espoused the philosophy of universal [[human rights|"Rights of Men"]]. Price argued that love of our country "does not imply any conviction of the superior value of it to other countries, or any particular preference of its laws and constitution of government".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Price asserted that Englishmen should see themselves "more as citizens of the world than as members of any particular community".

A debate between Price and Burke ensued that was "the classic moment at which two fundamentally different conceptions of national identity were presented to the English public".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''English Society'', p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Price claimed that the principles of the Glorious Revolution included "the right to choose our own governors, to cashier them for misconduct, and to frame a government for ourselves".

Immediately after reading Price's sermon, Burke wrote a draft of what eventually became ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/241734 |title=The Genesis of Burke's Reflections |year=1978 |author=Dreyer, Frederick |journal=[[The Journal of Modern History]] |volume=50|issue=3 |page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 February 1790, a notice in the press said that shortly, Burke would publish a pamphlet on the Revolution and its British supporters, however he spent the year revising and expanding it. On 1 November he finally published the ''Reflections'' and it was an immediate best-seller.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Priced at five shillings, it was more expensive than most political pamphlets, but by the end of 1790, it had gone through ten printings and sold approximately 17,500 copies. A French translation appeared on 29 November and on 30 November the translator, Pierre-Gaëton Dupont, wrote to Burke saying 2,500 copies had already been sold. The French translation ran to ten printings by June 1791.&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Lock, ''Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1985), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

What the Glorious Revolution had meant was as important to Burke and his contemporaries as it had been for the last one hundred years in British politics.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Reflections'', Burke argued against Price's interpretation of the Glorious Revolution and instead, gave a classic Whig defence of it.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 24–25, 34, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke argued against the idea of abstract, metaphysical rights of humans and instead advocated national tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The Revolution was made to preserve our ''antient'' indisputable laws and liberties, and that ''antient'' constitution of government which is our only security for law and liberty... The very idea of the fabrication of a new government, is enough to fill us with disgust and horror. We wished at the period of the Revolution, and do now wish, to derive all we possess as ''an inheritance from our forefathers''. Upon that body and stock of inheritance we have taken care not to inoculate any cyon [scion] alien to the nature of the original plant... Our oldest reformation is that of [[Magna Carta|Magna Charta]]. You will see that Sir [[Edward Coke]], that great oracle of our law, and indeed all the great men who follow him, to [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], are industrious to prove the pedigree of our liberties. They endeavour to prove that the ancient charter... were nothing more than a re-affirmance of the still more ancient standing law of the kingdom... In the famous law... called the ''[[Petition of Right]]'', the parliament says to the king, "Your subjects have ''inherited'' this freedom", claiming their franchises not on abstract principles "as the rights of men", but as the rights of Englishmen, and as a patrimony derived from their forefathers.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 181–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke said  "We fear God, we look up with awe to kings; with affection to parliaments; with duty to magistrates; with reverence to priests; and with respect to nobility. Why? Because when such ideas are brought before our minds, it is ''natural'' to be so affected".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke defended this prejudice on the grounds that it is "the general bank and capital of nations, and of ages" and superior to individual reason, which is small in comparison. "Prejudice", Burke claimed, "is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man's virtue his habit".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 251–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke criticised [[social contract]] theory by claiming that society is indeed, a contract, but "a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous passage in Burke's ''Reflections'' was his description of the events of 5–6 October 1789 and the part of [[Marie-Antoinette]] in them. Burke's account differs little from modern historians who have used primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', pp. 289–90.&lt;/ref&gt; His use of flowery language to describe it, however, provoked both praise and criticism. [[Philip Francis (politician)|Philip Francis]] wrote to Burke saying that what he wrote of Marie-Antoinette was "pure foppery".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]], however, reacted differently: "I adore his chivalry".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was informed by an Englishman who had talked with the [[Armand Louis de Gontaut|Duchesse de Biron]], that when Marie-Antoinette was reading the passage, she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Cobban and Robert A. Smith (eds.), ''The Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'' (Cambridge University Press, 1967), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Price had rejoiced that the French king had been "led in triumph" during the October Days, but to Burke this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror—that the ungallant assault on Marie-Antoinette—was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XVI translated the ''Reflections'' "from end to end" into French.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 313–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Whig MPs [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan]] and [[Charles James Fox]], disagreed with Burke and split with him. Fox thought the ''Reflections'' to be "in very bad taste" and "favouring Tory principles".&lt;ref&gt;L. G. Mitchell, ''Charles James Fox'' (Penguin, 1997), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Whigs such as the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] and [[William FitzWilliam, 4th Earl FitzWilliam|Earl Fitzwilliam]] privately agreed with Burke, but did not wish for a public breach with their Whig colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke wrote on 29 November 1790: "I have received from the Duke of Portland, [[Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]], the [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]], [[Lord John Cavendish]], Montagu ([[Frederick Montagu]] MP), and a long et cetera of the old Stamina of the Whiggs a most full approbation of the principles of that work and a kind indulgence to the execution".&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke of Portland said in 1791 that when anyone criticised the ''Reflections'' to him, he informed them that he had recommended the book to his sons as containing the true Whig creed.&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', p. 161, n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of [[Paul Langford]],&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Burke [[crossing the Rubicon|crossed something of a Rubicon]] when he attended a levee on 3 February 1791 to meet the king, later described by Jane Burke:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On his coming to Town for the Winter, as he generally does, he went to the Levee with the Duke of ''Portland'', who went with [[Lord William Bentinck|Lord William]] to [[Kissing hands|kiss hands]] on his going into the [[Coldstream Guards|Guards]]—while Lord William was kissing hands, The King was talking to The Duke, but his Eyes were fixed on [Burke] who was standing in the Crowd, and when He said His say to The Duke, without waiting for [Burke]'s coming up in his turn, The King went up to him, and, after the usual questions of how long have you been in Town and the weather, He said you have been very much employed of late, and very much confined. [Burke] said, no, Sir, not more than usual—You have and very well employed too, but there are none so deaf as those that w'ont hear, and none so blind as those that w'ont see—[Burke] made a low bow, Sir, I certainly now understand you, but was afraid my vanity or presumption might have led me to imagine what Your Majesty has said referred to what I have done—You cannot be vain—You have been of ''use to us all'', it is a general opinion, is it not so [[John Dalrymple, 6th Earl of Stair|Lord Stair]]? who was standing near. It is said Lord Stair;—Your Majesty's adopting it, Sir, will make the opinion general, said [Burke]—I know it is the general opinion, and I know that there is no Man who calls himself a Gentleman that must not think himself obliged to you, for you have supported the cause of the Gentlemen—You know the tone at Court is a whisper, but The King said all this loud, so as to be heard by every one at Court.&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke's ''Reflections'' sparked a [[Revolution Controversy|pamphlet war]]. [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was one of the first into print, publishing ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' a few weeks after Burke. [[Thomas Paine]] followed with the ''[[Rights of Man]]'' in 1791. [[James Mackintosh]], who wrote ''Vindiciae Gallicae'', was the first to see the ''Reflections'' as "the manifesto of a Counter Revolution". Mackintosh later agreed with Burke's views, remarking in December 1796 after meeting him, that Burke was "minutely and accurately informed, to a wonderful exactness, with respect to every fact relating to the French Revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Mackintosh later said: "Burke was one of the first thinkers as well as one of the greatest orators of his time. He is without parallel in any age, excepting perhaps Lord Bacon and Cicero; and his works contain an ampler store of political and moral wisdom than can be found in any other writer whatever".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles James Fox00.jpg|thumb|[[Charles James Fox]]]]

In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the [[National Assembly of France]], wrote to Burke, praising ''Reflections'' and requesting more "very refreshing mental food" that he could publish.&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', pp. 162–69.&lt;/ref&gt; This Burke did in April 1791 when he published ''A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly''. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed "a considerable insight into human nature" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–67 Burke was a friend of [[David Hume]], with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau "entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but ''vanity''"—which he "was possessed to a degree little short of madness". He also cited Rousseau's ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' as evidence that Rousseau had a life of "obscure and vulgar vices" that was not "chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: "a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', pp. 356–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

These events and the disagreements that arose from them within the Whig Party, led to its break-up and to the rupture of Burke's friendship with Fox. In debate in Parliament on Britain's relations with Russia, Fox praised the principles of the revolution, although Burke was not able to reply at this time as he was "overpowered by continued cries of question from his own side of the House".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; When Parliament was debating the Quebec Bill for a constitution for Canada, Fox praised the revolution and criticised some of Burke's arguments, such as hereditary power. On 6 May 1791, during another debate in Parliament on the Quebec Bill, Burke used the opportunity to answer Fox, and to condemn the new French Constitution and "the horrible consequences flowing from the French idea of the Rights of Man".&lt;ref name="McCue, p. 23"&gt;McCue, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke asserted that those ideas were the antithesis of both the British and the American constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;Frank O'Gorman, ''The Whig Party and the French Revolution'' (Macmillan, 1967), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was interrupted, and Fox intervened, saying that Burke should be allowed to carry on with his speech. A vote of censure was moved against Burke, however, for noticing the affairs of France, which was moved by [[John Baker-Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]] and seconded by Fox.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt made a speech praising Burke, and Fox made a speech—both rebuking and complimenting Burke. He questioned the sincerity of Burke, who seemed to have forgotten the lessons he had learned from him, quoting from Burke's own speeches of fourteen and fifteen years before.

Burke's response was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It certainly was indiscreet at any period, but especially at his time of life, to parade enemies, or give his friends occasion to desert him; yet if his firm and steady adherence to the British constitution placed him in such a dilemma, he would risk all, and, as public duty and public experience taught him, with his last words exclaim, "Fly from the French Constitution".&lt;ref name="McCue, p. 23" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At this point, Fox whispered that there was "no loss of friendship". "I regret to say there is", Burke replied, "I have indeed made a great sacrifice; I have done my duty though I have lost my friend. There is something in the detested French constitution that envenoms every thing it touches".&lt;ref name="Prior, p. 329"&gt;Prior, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; This provoked a reply from Fox, yet he was unable to give his speech for some time since he was overcome with tears and emotion, he appealed to Burke to remember their inalienable friendship, but also repeated his criticisms of Burke and uttered "unusually bitter sarcasms".&lt;ref name="Prior, p. 329" /&gt; This only aggravated the rupture between the two men. Burke demonstrated his separation from the party on 5 June 1791 by writing to Fitzwilliam, declining money from him.&lt;ref name="O'Gorman, p. 75"&gt;O'Gorman, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke was dismayed that some Whigs, instead of reaffirming the principles of the Whig Party he laid out in the ''Reflections'', had rejected them in favour of "French principles" and that they criticised Burke for abandoning Whig principles. Burke wanted to demonstrate his fidelity to Whig principles and feared that acquiescence to Fox and his followers would allow the Whig Party to become a vehicle for Jacobinism.

Burke knew that many members of the Whig Party did not share Fox's views and he wanted to provoke them into condemning the French Revolution. Burke wrote that he wanted to represent the whole Whig party "as tolerating, and by a toleration, countenancing those proceedings" so that he could "stimulate them to a public declaration of what every one of their acquaintance privately knows to be...their sentiments".&lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, on 3 August 1791 Burke published his ''Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs'', in which he renewed his criticism of the radical revolutionary programmes inspired by the French Revolution and attacked the Whigs who supported them, as holding principles contrary to those traditionally held by the Whig party.

Burke owned two copies of what has been called "that practical compendium of Whig political theory", ''The Tryal of Dr. [[Henry Sacheverell]]'' (1710).&lt;ref name="Clark, p. 40"&gt;Clark, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke wrote of the trial: "It rarely happens to a party to have the opportunity of a clear, authentic, recorded, declaration of their political tenets upon the subject of a great constitutional event like that of the [Glorious] Revolution".&lt;ref name="Clark, p. 40" /&gt; Writing in the third person, Burke asserted in his ''Appeal'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;... that the foundations laid down by the Commons, on the trial of Doctor Sacheverel, for justifying the revolution of 1688, are the very same laid down in Mr. Burke's Reflections; that is to say,—a breach of the ''original contract'', implied and expressed in the constitution of this country, as a scheme of government fundamentally and inviolably fixed in King, Lords and Commons.—That the fundamental subversion of this antient constitution, by one of its parts, having been attempted, and in effect accomplished, justified the Revolution. That it was justified ''only'' upon the ''necessity'' of the case; as the ''only'' means left for the recovery of that ''antient'' constitution, formed by the ''original contract'' of the British state; as well as for the future preservation of the ''same'' government. These are the points to be proved.&lt;ref name="Clark, p. 40" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke then provided quotations from Paine's ''Rights of Man'' to demonstrate what the New Whigs believed. Burke's belief that Foxite principles corresponded to Paine's was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Burke denied that a majority of "the people" had, or ought to have, the final say in politics and alter society at their pleasure. People had rights, but also duties, and these duties were not voluntary. Also, the people could not overthrow morality derived from God.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Whig [[grandee]]s such as Portland and Fitzwilliam privately agreed with Burke's ''Appeal'', they wished he had used more moderate language. Fitzwilliam saw the ''Appeal'' as containing "the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 386"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset|Francis Basset]], a backbench Whig MP, wrote to Burke: "...though for reasons which I will not now detail I did not then deliver my sentiments, I most perfectly differ from Mr. Fox &amp; from the great Body of opposition on the French Revolution".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 386" /&gt; Burke sent a copy of the ''Appeal'' to the king and the king requested a friend to communicate to Burke that he had read it "with great Satisfaction".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 386" /&gt; Burke wrote of its reception: "Not one word from one of our party. They are secretly galled. They agree with me to a title; but they dare not speak out for fear of hurting Fox. ... They leave me to myself; they see that I can do myself justice".&lt;ref name="O'Gorman, p. 75" /&gt; [[Charles Burney]] viewed it as "a most admirable book—the best &amp; most useful on political subjects that I have ever seen" but believed the differences in the Whig Party between Burke and Fox should not be aired publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', pp. 385–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, most of the Whigs sided with Burke and gave their support to Pitt's "conservative" government, which, in response to France's declaration of war against Britain, declared war on France's Revolutionary Government in 1793.

In December 1791, Burke sent Government ministers his ''Thoughts on French Affairs'' where he put forward three main points: no counter-revolution in France would come about by purely domestic causes; the longer the Revolutionary Government exists the stronger it becomes; and the Revolutionary Government's interest and aim is to disturb all of the other governments of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 357–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke, as a Whig, did not wish to see an [[absolute monarchy]] again in France after the extirpation of Jacobinism. Writing to an ''émigré'' in 1791, Burke expressed his views against a restoration of the ''ancien régime'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;When such a complete convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, or in the Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness as well as other inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', pp. 479–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke delivered a speech on the debate of the [[Aliens Act 1793|Aliens Bill]] on 28 December 1792. He supported the Bill as it would exclude "murderous atheists, who would pull down Church and state; religion and God; morality and happiness".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 439"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; The peroration included a reference to a French order for 3,000 daggers. Burke revealed a dagger he had concealed in his coat and threw it to the floor: "This is what you are to gain by an alliance with France". Burke picked up the dagger and continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When they smile, I see blood trickling down their faces; I see their insidious purposes; I see that the object of all their cajoling is—blood! I now warn my countrymen to beware of these execrable philosophers, whose only object it is to destroy every thing that is good here, and to establish immorality and murder by precept and example—'Hic niger est hunc tu Romane caveto' ['Such a man is evil; beware of him, Roman'. Horace, ''Satires'' I. 4. 85.].&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 439" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke supported the war against revolutionary France, seeing Britain as fighting on the side of the [[royalist]]s and ''émigres'' in a civil war, rather than fighting against the whole nation of France.&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 453"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke also supported the [[War in the Vendée|royalist uprising]] in [[Vendée|La Vendée]], describing it on 4 November 1793 in a letter to [[William Windham]], as "the sole affair I have much heart in".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 453" /&gt; Burke wrote to [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] on 7 October urging him to send reinforcements there, as he viewed it as the only theatre in the war that might lead to a march on Paris. Dundas did not follow Burke's advice, however.

Burke believed the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] was not taking the uprising seriously enough, a view reinforced by a letter he had received from the [[Charles X of France|Prince Charles of France]] (''S.A.R. le comte d'Artois''), dated 23 October, requesting that he intercede on behalf of the royalists to the Government. Burke was forced to reply on 6 November: "I am not in His Majesty's Service; or at all consulted in his Affairs".&lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman, pp. 168–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke published his ''Remarks on the Policy of the Allies with Respect to France'', begun in October, where he said: "I am sure every thing has shewn us that in this war with France, one Frenchman is worth twenty foreigners. La Vendée is a proof of this".&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, ''The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. Volume VII'' (F. C. and J. Rivington, 1815), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son [[Richard Burke Jr.|Richard]]. A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise,&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for [[Catholic emancipation]]). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him [[Earl of Beaconsfield]], but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of £2,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and the [[James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale|Earl of Lauderdale]], to whom Burke replied in his ''Letter to a Noble Lord'' (1796):&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 425–26.&lt;/ref&gt; "It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, ''To innovate is not to reform''".&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, ''A Letter from The Right Honourable Edmund Burke to a Noble Lord, on the Attacks made upon him and his pension, in the House of Lords, by The Duke of Bedford and The Earl of Lauderdale, Early in the present Sessions of Parliament.'' (F. and C. Rivington, 1796), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: "Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''A Letter to a Noble Lord'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke also hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary ideas were implemented, and included a description of the British constitution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But as to ''our'' country and ''our'' race, as long as the well compacted structure of our church and state, the sanctuary, the holy of holies of that ancient law, defended by reverence, defended by power, a fortress at once and a temple, shall stand inviolate on the brow of the British Sion—as long as the British Monarchy, not more limited than fenced by the orders of the State, shall, like the proud Keep of Windsor, rising in the majesty of proportion, and girt with the double belt of its kindred and coeval towers, as long as this awful structure shall oversee and guard the subjected land—so long as the mounds and dykes of the low, fat, Bedford level will have nothing to fear from all the pickaxes of all the levellers of France.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''A Letter to a Noble Lord'', pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke's last publications were the ''[[Letters on a Regicide Peace]]'' (October 1796), called forth by negotiations for peace with France by the Pitt government. Burke regarded this as [[appeasement]], injurious to national dignity and honour.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 439–40.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Second Letter'', Burke wrote of the French Revolutionary Government: "Individuality is left out of their scheme of government. The State is all in all. Everything is referred to the production of force; afterwards, everything is trusted to the use of it. It is military in its principle, in its maxims, in its spirit, and in all its movements. The State has dominion and conquest for its sole objects—dominion over minds by proselytism, over bodies by arms".&lt;ref&gt;Steven Blakemore, 'Burke and the Revolution: Bicentennial Reflections', in Blakemore (ed.), ''Burke and the French Revolution. Bicentennial Essays'' (The [[University of Georgia Press]], 1992), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is held to be the first explanation of the modern concept of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke regarded the war with France as ideological, against an "armed doctrine". He wished that France would not be partitioned due to the effect this would have on the balance of power in Europe, and that the war was not against France, but against the revolutionaries governing her.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 443–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke said: "It is not France extending a foreign empire over other nations: it is a sect aiming at universal empire, and beginning with the conquest of France".&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

==Later life==
In November 1795, there was a debate in Parliament on the high price of corn and Burke wrote a memorandum to Pitt on the subject. In December [[Samuel Whitbread (1764–1815)|Samuel Whitbread]] MP introduced a bill giving magistrates the power to fix minimum wages and Fox said he would vote for it. This debate probably led Burke to editing his memorandum, as there appeared a notice that Burke would soon publish a letter on the subject to the Secretary of the [[Board of Agriculture (1793–1822)|Board of Agriculture]], [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]; but he failed to complete it. These fragments were inserted into the memorandum after his death and published posthumously in 1800 as, ''[[Thoughts and Details on Scarcity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eccleshall, ''English Conservatism since the Restoration'' (London: Unwin Hyman, 1990), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Burke expounded "some of the doctrines of political economists bearing upon agriculture as a trade".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke criticised policies such as maximum prices and state regulation of wages, and set out what the limits of government should be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That the State ought to confine itself to what regards the State, or the creatures of the State, namely, the exterior establishment of its religion; its magistracy; its revenue; its military force by sea and land; the corporations that owe their existence to its fiat; in a word, to every thing that is ''truly and properly'' public, to the public peace, to the public safety, to the public order, to the public prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The economist [[Adam Smith]] remarked that Burke was "the only man I ever knew who thinks on economic subjects exactly as I do, without any previous communications having passed between us".&lt;ref&gt;E. G. West, ''Adam Smith'' (New York: Arlington House, 1969), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing to a friend in May 1795, Burke surveyed the causes of discontent: "I think I can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of Protestant ascendency, as they affect Ireland; or of Indianism [i.e. corporate tyranny, as practiced by the British East Indies Company], as they affect these countries, and as they affect Asia; or of Jacobinism, as they affect all Europe, and the state of human society itself. The last is the greatest evil".&lt;ref&gt;R. B. McDowell (ed.), ''The Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VIII'' (Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1796, however Burke had changed his mind: "Our Government and our Laws are beset by two different Enemies, which are sapping its foundations, Indianism, and Jacobinism. In some Cases they act separately, in some they act in conjunction: But of this I am sure; that the first is the worst by far, and the hardest to deal with; and for this amongst other reasons, that it weakens discredits, and ruins that force, which ought to be employed with the greatest Credit and Energy against the other; and that it furnishes Jacobinism with its strongest arms against all ''formal'' Government".&lt;ref&gt;McDowell (ed.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VIII'', p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than a year prior to his death, Burke knew that his 'stomach' was "irrecoverably ruind".&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; After hearing that Burke was nearing death, Fox wrote to Mrs. Burke enquiring after him. Fox received the reply the next day:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mrs. Burke presents her compliments to Mr. Fox, and thanks him for his obliging inquiries. Mrs. Burke communicated his letter to Mr. Burke, and by his desire has to inform Mr. Fox that it has cost Mr. Burke the most heart-felt pain to obey the stern voice of his duty in rending asunder a long friendship, but that he deemed this sacrifice necessary; that his principles continue the same; and that in whatever of life may yet remain to him, he conceives that he must live for others and not for himself. Mr. Burke is convinced that the principles which he has endeavoured to maintain are necessary to the welfare and dignity of his country, and that these principles can be enforced only by the general persuasion of his sincerity.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke died in [[Beaconsfield]], Buckinghamshire, on 9 July 1797,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Cavendish |first=Richard |date=1997-07-07 |title=Edmund Burke, Political Writer and Philosopher Dies  |url=https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/edmund-burke-political-writer-and-philosopher-dies |magazine=History Today |volume=47 |issue=7 |access-date=2018-07-07 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried there alongside his son and brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|12496191|Edmund Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife survived him by nearly fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, Burke.

Burke is regarded by most [[political history|political historians]] in the English-speaking world as the father of modern British conservatism.&lt;ref name="Dehsen1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christian D.

Burke believed that property was essential to human life. Because of his conviction that people desire to be ruled and controlled, the division of property formed the basis for social structure, helping develop control within a property-based hierarchy. He viewed the social changes brought on by property as the natural order of events, which should be taking place as the human race progressed. With the division of property and the class system, he also believed that it kept the monarch in check to the needs of the classes beneath the monarch. Since property largely aligned or defined divisions of social class, class too, was seen as natural—part of a social agreement that the setting of persons into different classes, is the mutual benefit of all subjects. Concern for property is not Burke's only influence. As [[Christopher Hitchens]] summarises, "If modern conservatism can be held to derive from Burke, it is not just because he appealed to property owners in behalf of stability but also because he appealed to an everyday interest in the preservation of the ancestral and the immemorial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hitchens|first1=Christopher|title=Reactionary Prophet|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/04/reactionary-prophet/302914/?single_page=true|website=www.theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic Magazine|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke's support for Irish Catholics and Indians often led him to be criticised by [[Tory (British political party)|Tories]].&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Sack, ''From Jacobite to Conservative. Reaction and orthodoxy in Britain, c. 1760–1832'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; His opposition to British imperialism in Ireland and India and his opposition to French imperialism and radicalism in Europe, made it difficult for Whig or Tory to accept Burke wholly as their own.&lt;ref&gt;Sack, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century Burke was praised by both liberals and conservatives. Burke's friend Philip Francis wrote that Burke "was a man who truly &amp; prophetically foresaw all the consequences which would rise from the adoption of the French principles" but because Burke wrote with so much passion, people were doubtful of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys, 'The ''Reflections'' refracted: the critical reception of Burke's ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' during the early 1790s', in John Whale (ed.), ''Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France. New interdisciplinary essays'' ([[Manchester University Press]], 2000), p. 55, n. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; William Windham spoke from the same bench in the House of Commons as Burke had, when he had separated from Fox, and an observer said Windham spoke "like the ghost of Burke" when he made a speech against peace with France in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Harvey, ''Britain in the early nineteenth century'' (B T Batsford Ltd, 1978), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hazlitt]], a political opponent of Burke, regarded him as amongst his three favourite writers (the others being Junius and Rousseau), and made it "a test of the sense and candour of any one belonging to the opposite party, whether he allowed Burke to be a great man".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Wordsworth]] was originally a supporter of the French Revolution and attacked Burke in 'A Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff' (1793), but by the early nineteenth century he had changed his mind and came to admire Burke. In his ''Two Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland'' Wordsworth called Burke "the most sagacious Politician of his age" whose predictions "time has verified".&lt;ref name="Lock, p. 173"&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; He later revised his poem ''[[The Prelude]]'' to include praise of Burke ("Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced/By specious wonders") and portrayed him as an old oak.&lt;ref name="Lock, p. 173" /&gt; [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] came to have a similar conversion: he had criticised Burke in ''[[The Watchman (periodical)|The Watchman]]'', but in his ''Friend'' (1809–10) Coleridge defended Burke from charges of inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', pp. 173–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'' (1817) Coleridge hails Burke as a prophet and praises Burke for referring "habitually to ''principles''. He was a ''scientific'' statesman; and therefore a ''seer''".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] wrote of Burke: "... all his predictions, save one momentary expression, had been more than fulfilled: anarchy and bloodshed had borne sway in France; conquest and convulsion had desolated Europe...the providence of mortals is not often able to penetrate so far as this into futurity".&lt;ref name="Claeys, p. 50"&gt;Claeys, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Canning]] believed that Burke's ''Reflections'' "has been justified by the course of subsequent events; and almost every prophecy has been strictly fulfilled".&lt;ref name="Claeys, p. 50" /&gt; In 1823 Canning wrote that he took Burke's "last works and words [as] the manual of my politics".&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Stapleton (ed.), ''Some Official Correspondence of George Canning. Volume I'' (London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1887), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] "was deeply penetrated with the spirit and sentiment of Burke's later writings".&lt;ref&gt;William Flavelle Monypenny and George Earle Buckle, ''The Life of Benjamin Disraeli. Earl of Beaconsfield. Volume I. 1804–1859'' (London: John Murray, 1929), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] considered Burke "a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America" and in his diary recorded: "Made many extracts from Burke—''sometimes almost divine''".&lt;ref&gt;John Morley, ''The Life of William Ewart Gladstone. Volume III (1880–1898)'' (London: Macmillan, 1903), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; The Radical MP and anti-[[Corn Law]] activist [[Richard Cobden]] often praised Burke's ''Thoughts and Details on Scarcity''.&lt;ref&gt;John Morley, ''The Life of Richard Cobden'' (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1905), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal historian [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Paul (ed.), ''Letters of Lord Acton to Mary Gladstone'' (Macmillan, 1914), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: "I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since [[John Milton|Milton]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sir George Trevelyan, ''The Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay. Volume II'' (London: Longmans, 1876), p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gladstonian Liberal MP [[John Morley]] published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Hamer, ''John Morley. Liberal Intellectual in Politics'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cobdenite Radical [[Francis Wrigley Hirst|Francis Hirst]] thought Burke deserved "a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site".&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Hirst, ''Liberty and Tyranny'' (London: Duckworth, 1935), pp. 105–06.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death, it was to become his best known and most influential work, and a [[manifesto]] for Conservative thinking.

Two contrasting assessments of Burke also were offered long after his death by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Winston Churchill]]. In ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Marx wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The sycophant—who in the pay of the English oligarchy played the romantic ''laudator temporis acti'' against the French Revolution just as, in the pay of the North American colonies at the beginning of the American troubles, he had played the liberal against the English oligarchy—was an out-and-out vulgar [[bourgeois]]. "The laws of commerce are the laws of Nature, and therefore the laws of God." (E. Burke, l.c., pp. 31, 32) No wonder that, true to the laws of God and Nature, he always sold himself in the best market.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Winston Churchill, in ''Consistency in Politics'', wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the one hand [Burke] is revealed as a foremost apostle of Liberty, on the other as the redoubtable champion of Authority. But a charge of political inconsistency applied to this life appears a mean and petty thing. History easily discerns the reasons and forces which actuated him, and the immense changes in the problems he was facing which evoked from the same profound mind and sincere spirit these entirely contrary manifestations. His soul revolted against tyranny, whether it appeared in the aspect of a domineering Monarch and a corrupt Court and Parliamentary system, or whether, mouthing the watch-words of a non-existent liberty, it towered up against him in the dictation of a brutal mob and wicked sect. No one can read the Burke of Liberty and the Burke of Authority without feeling that here was the same man pursuing the same ends, seeking the same ideals of society and Government, and defending them from assaults, now from one extreme, now from the other.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The historian [[Piers Brendon]] asserts that Burke laid the moral foundations for the [[British Empire]], epitomised in the trial of [[Warren Hastings]], that was ultimately to be its undoing: when Burke stated that "The British Empire must be governed on a plan of freedom, for it will be governed by no other",&lt;ref&gt;K. Brittlebank, ''Tipu Sultan's Search for Legitimacy'' (Delhi, 1997), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; this was "...an ideological bacillus that would prove fatal. This was Edmund Burke's paternalistic doctrine that colonial government was a trust. It was to be so exercised for the benefit of subject people that they would eventually attain their birthright—freedom".&lt;ref&gt;Brendon, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this opinion, Burke objected to the opium trade, which he called a "smuggling adventure" and condemned "the great Disgrace of the British character in India".&lt;ref&gt;F. G. Whelan, ''Edmund Burke and India'' (Pittsburgh, 1996), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Royal Society of Arts]] [[blue plaque]] commemorates Burke at [[Gerrard Street, London|37 Gerrard Street]] now in [[Chinatown, London|London's Chinatown]].&lt;ref name='EngHet'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/burke-edmund-1729-1797|title=BURKE, EDMUND (1729–1797)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Edmund Burke==
One of Burke's largest and most developed critics was [[Leo Strauss]], who was thoroughly analyzed by Steven Lenzner. Strauss in his book ''Natural Right and History'' makes a series of points in which he somewhat harshly evaluates Burke's writings.

One of the topics that he first addresses is the fact that Burke creates a definitive separation between happiness and virtue, and explains that "Burke, therefore, seeks the foundation of government 'in a conformity to our duties' and not in 'imaginary rights of man"&lt;ref name="Strauss"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strauss|first1=Leo|title=Natural Right and History|publisher=University of Chicago Publication|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/N/bo3643753.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenzner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lenzner|first1=Steven|title=Strauss's Three Burkes: The Problem of Edmund Burke in Natural Right and History|jstor=191417|publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Strauss views Burke as believing that government should focus solely on the duties that a man should have in society as opposed to trying to address any additional needs or desires. Government is simply a practicality to Burke, and not necessarily meant to function as a tool to help individuals live their best lives. Strauss also argues that in a sense, Burke's theory could be seen as opposing the very idea of forming such philosophies. Burke expresses the view that theory cannot adequately predict future occurrences, and thus, men need to have instincts that can't be practiced or derived from ideology.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenzner" /&gt;

This leads to an overarching criticism that Strauss holds regarding Burke, which is his rejection of the use of logic. Burke dismisses a widely held view amongst theorists that reason should be the primary tool in the forming of a constitution or contract.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenzner" /&gt; Burke instead believes that constitutions should be made based on 'natural processes' as opposed to rational planning for the future. Strauss points out, however, that criticising rationality actually works against Burke's original stance of returning to traditional ways because some amount human reason is inherent, and therefore is in part grounded in tradition.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; In regards to this formation of legitimate social order, Strauss does not necessarily support Burke's opinion— that order cannot be established by individual wise people, but exclusively by a culmination of individuals with historical knowledge of past functions to use as a foundation.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenzner" /&gt; Strauss notes that Burke would oppose more newly formed republics due to this thought,&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; although Lenzner adds the fact that he did seem to believe that America's constitution could be justified given the specific circumstances.&lt;ref name="Lenzner" /&gt; France's constitution, on the other hand, was much too radical as it relied too heavily on enlightened reasoning as opposed to traditional methods and values.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==Religious thought of Edmund Burke==
{{main|Religious thought of Edmund Burke}}
Burke's religious writing comprises published works and commentary on the subject of religion. Burke's religious thought was grounded in the belief that religion is the foundation of civil society.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1964), 87.&lt;/ref&gt; He sharply criticised deism and atheism, and emphasised Christianity as a vehicle of social progress.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Harris, "Burke and Religion," in David Dwan and Christopher J Insole eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Edmund Burke'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Ireland to a Catholic mother and a Protestant father, Burke vigorously defended the Anglican Church, but also demonstrated sensitivity to Catholic concerns.&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt; He linked the conservation of a state (established) religion with the preservation of citizens' constitutional liberties and highlighted Christianity's benefit not only to the believer's soul, but also to political arrangements.&lt;ref name="Ibid"&gt;Harris, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==False quotations==
===When good men do nothing===
The statement that "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing" is often attributed to Burke despite the debated origin of this quote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bromwich|title=The Intellectual Life of Edmund Burke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wWMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175|year=2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=175–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Toole|first1=Garson|title=The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/12/04/good-men-do/|website=Quote Investigator|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1770, however, it is known that in "[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents]]", Burke wrote that:
{{quote|…when bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrGAIvlkf-sC&amp;pg=PR13 |year=1990 |title=Edmund Burke: appraisals and applications |isbn=978-0-88738-328-1 |author=Daniel Ritchie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbouAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA106| title=Thoughts on the cause of the present discontents |year=1770 |author=Edmund Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Stuart Mill]] later made a similar statement in an inaugural address delivered before the University of St. Andrews during 1867:
{{quote|Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DFNAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA36 ''Inaugural Address Delivered to the University of St. Andrews, Feb. 1st 1867'' (1867)], p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Those who don't know history===
Burke is sometimes credited with [[George Santayana]]'s quote: "Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it", but scholars have not found any reliable evidence indicating that Burke actually spoke (or wrote) those words.&lt;ref&gt;It is not among the 67 authentic Burke quotes in ''Bartlett's Familiar Quotations''.

The '''flag of Adjara''' is a flag of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]'s [[autonomous republic]] of [[Adjara]]. It displays seven dark blue and white stripes, with the national [[flag of Georgia (country)|flag of Georgia]] shown in [[canton (heraldry)|canton]]. The dark blue stripes symbolize the [[Black Sea]] and the white stripes symbolize purity. The flag was adopted on 20 July 2004 by the Supreme Council of Adjara.

== Former Flags ==

Between June 2000 and July 2004, a different flag was used by the government of [[Aslan Abashidze]]. The blue background represents the [[Black Sea]], while the seven stars represent Ajaria's two cities ([[Batumi]] and [[Kobuleti]]) and five districts (Batumi, Kobuleti, [[Keda, Georgia|Keda]], [[Shuakhevi]], [[Khulo]]).

Under the [[Soviet Union]], the Ajarian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (AASSR) had its own flag between 1921-1950 and again between 1978 and 1991. This consisted of a motif very similar to that of the parent [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]], plus the initials of the AASSR in [[Georgian language|Georgian]].

{{nihongo|'''''Game Center Arashi'''''|ゲームセンターあらし|Geimu Sentā Arashi}} is a Japanese [[manga]] by [[Mitsuru Sugaya]], which ran in ''[[CoroCoro Comic]]'' from 1978 to 1984. It sold over 5 million copies {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} and won the 1983 [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for [[children's manga]].&lt;ref name="ShogakukanAward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html |script-title=ja:小学館漫画賞: 歴代受賞者 |publisher=Shogakukan |language=Japanese |accessdate=2007-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094941/http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was adapted as a popular [[anime]] television show that aired in 1982 in [[Japan]] on Mondays from 7:00pm to 7:30pm.; and in [[Hong Kong]].

In Japanese, the word "Arashi" means "storm". In [[Hong Kong]], the show aired under the title 電子神童, which translates to "Electronic Prodigy". The series was considered [[Cultural icon|iconic]] in [[Asia]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, since it came at a time when the public was being exposed to [[video games]] for the first time. The [[manga]] and TV series opened the imagination and possibilities of what gaming entertainment was about, while boosting its popularity as a new [[phenomenon]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Story==
The story is about a young boy named Arashi Ishino who is obsessed with video games. He would spend all his time trying to beat the games and conquer the local [[Arcade game|arcades]]. He would meet competitors like Satoru Daimonji and Ishii, who would try to out match him with higher scores. At a certain point in each episode, he would display his special skill of unleashing a [[top]] which will spin so fast that both the top and his hands would catch on fire. On release, the spin would land on or near the [[Arcade cabinet|cabinet]] panels, turning the ordinary button into a [[turbo button]] thus giving him a major advantage. His appearance is known for being bucktoothed, and he always wears a hat labeled "Arashi" with a picture of a [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprited]] alien.

''Game Center Arashi'' was the first animation with a [[gamer]] as the lead character and have the plot revolve around life with competitive gaming. Some of the games featured in the show include [[Space Invaders]], [[Breakout (arcade game)|Breakout]], [[Galaxian]], though they were not explicitly named. Some of Arashi's gaming techniques even have special names like "Blazed Top", "Vacuum Hurricane Shot", "Fish Stance".&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Jonathan. McCarthy Helen. [2006] (2006).

==Additional versions and appearances==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
In 1999, the series spawned a [[PlayStation]] [[novel]] called [[Game Center Arashi R]]. In 2004 [[Microsoft]] [[Tokyo]] used the character of Arashi as a mascot to boost [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] sales and image.

While the 2002 manga [[Arcade Gamer Fubuki]] reused the concept of a powerful gamer in the arcades, and also spawned a TV series of the same name, that show used entirely different characters and plots, modernizing while separating itself from the 1982 counterpart.

In 2006 the Let's TV Play Classic series of Plug and Plays used Arashi as a mascot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4184">The '''Grenfell Mission''' was a philanthropic organization that provided medical and social services to people in rural communities of northern Newfoundland and Labrador. It was founded by [[Wilfred Grenfell|Sir Wilfred Grenfell]] in 1892 as a branch of the Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen based in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Rompkey, Grenfell of Labrador: A Biography, (Montreal &amp; Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009). http://www.mqup.ca/grenfell-of-labrador-products-9780773535312.php&lt;/ref&gt;   

The medical staff and volunteers of the Grenfell Mission were from many countries in addition to Canada, such as the United States, Scotland, and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lombard|title=Adventures of a Grenfell Nurse|date=2014|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roads between settlements did not exist during much of the time that the Grenfell Mission supplied services, so in summer, nurses and doctors travelled to patients by boat, and in the winter, by dog team or (in later years) airplane. Certain drugs and medical supplies were not available in the Mission's remote setting, so staff were obliged to use inventive procedures.

Tuberculosis occurred at epidemic proportions in the 1940s in northern Newfoundland and Labrador. "The role that the Grenfell Mission played in the near eradication of tuberculosis was indeed one of its most outstanding achievements".&lt;ref&gt;Lombard, 2014, pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the Mission Incorporated as the International Grenfell Association. The organization was governed by a Board of Directors with representatives of the five supporting organizations - the Grenfell Association of America (New York), the New England Grenfell Association (Boston), the Grenfell Association of Great Britain and Ireland (London), the Grenfell Labrador Medical Mission (Ottawa), and the Grenfell Association of Newfoundland (St. John's). It functioned in this capacity until 1981, when responsibility for health services in the region transferred to the provincial government. In 2005, the Labrador-Grenfell Regional Authority was formed with the support of the provincial government to continue to provide care to around 37,000 people in northern Newfoundland and Labrador.

==Art program==

The Grenfell Mission established a Village Industry Department prior to 1930.  Artists came from abroad to support the artistic endeavors of the residents of northern Newfoundland and Labrador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bickerdike|first1=Rhonda Dawson|title=Coll-198|url=http://collections.mun.ca/cdm/ref/collection/ead/id/483|website=Archives and Special Collections|publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland - Digital Archives Initiative|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grenfell Mission was famous for its [[Rug hooking|burlap rugs]], which were sold to hospitals in the United States and Britain.  Encouraged and promoted by Dr. Grenfell, the rugmakers of the mission sometimes used designs created by Mrs. Grenfell.  Beginning in the early 20th century, the International Grenfell Association (IGA) hired Jessie Luther of Providence, Rhode Island, to set up and direct the Grenfell Industrial Department.  Grenfell established retail shops in England and in several U.S. cities.  These shops were staffed by volunteers and augmented by travelling salesmen. Following the death of Dr. Grenfell and the surge in machine-made rug production, the business gradually failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chubbcollectors.com/Vacnews/index.jsp?form=2&amp;ArticleId=165 Helaine Fendelman (2004). "Rugs to Riches: Grenfell Hooked Textiles"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120722063940/http://www.chubbcollectors.com/Vacnews/index.jsp?form=2&amp;ArticleId=165|date=2012-07-22}} Chubb Collectors website. Retrieved on 2006-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Grenfell rugs remain highly prized by [[folk art]] collectors.

In 2008 Grenfell Handicrafts appointed [[Christian Corbet]] as Artist in Residence, who created mats and rugs based on his abstracted paintings.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

'''''Hotel Lobby''''' is an [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]] by American [[Realist visual arts|realist]] painter [[Edward Hopper]]; it is held in the collection of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (IMA), in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], United States.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title=Hotel Lobby | work=Collections | publisher =[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] | url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/hotel-lobby-hopper-edward | accessdate = 14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The painting depicts two women and a man in the lobby of a hotel. On the right is a woman with blond hair and a blue dress, sitting with her legs crossed and reading a book. To the left sits an older woman with a red dress, a coat and a hat. A man stands next to her, facing forward, with a suit on and an overcoat draped over his right arm. On the left wall, above the woman, is a framed landscape painting. A clerk behind the reception desk is barely visible in the shadows.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt;

==Context==

''Hotel Lobby'' is a signature piece in Hopper's work, displaying his classic themes of [[wiktionary:alienation|alienation]] and [[wiktionary:brevity|brevity]].&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt; The Hoppers traveled frequently, staying in many motels and hotels throughout his career. This is one of two works in his catalog that depicts a hotel, the other being ''Hotel Window'' (1955). The older couple are believed to represent Hopper and his wife, at that date in their 60s.&lt;ref name="Warkel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Warkel |first=Harriet G. |coauthors= |title=Paper to Paint: Edward Hopper's ''Hotel Lobby'' |publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] |year=2009 |month= |isbn=978-0-936260-84-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel guests have been described as being "both traveling and suspended in time,"&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt; reflecting a stoic and dramatic feeling, reminiscent of the [[film noir]] movies Hopper might have seen and the complex structure and feeling of works by [[Edgar Degas]]. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hotel Lobby by Edward Hopper Detail 2.JPG| thumb| Light detail]] --&gt;
The painting utilizes harsh light and rigid lines to create a "carefully constructed" uncomfortable environment. The elevated and [[theatrical]] [[wikt:vantage point|vantage point]] of the painting may be derived from Hopper's love of [[Broadway theatre]] which he often watched from the balcony.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt;

===Sketches===

Before he created the ''Hotel Lobby'' Hopper drew ten studies of the work, which are in the collection of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], as a gift for his wife, Josephine.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtistPanel"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meyerowitz |first1=Joel |last2=Segal |first2=George |last3=Bailey |first3=William |last4=Levin |first4=Gail |year=1981 |title=Artists' Panel |journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]] |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=151–153 |publisher=[[College Art Association]] |doi= |jstor=776464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndianapolisMonth1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Indianapolis Museum of Art |journal=[[Indianapolis Monthly]] |volume= |issue=September |pages=170 |publisher=[[Emmis Communications]] |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of the ten studies are described as:

*Study one was believed to have been executed while Hopper in a hotel lobby observed two seated figures separated by a lamp and table. That wall features a curtained opening, a registration desk and a painting on the wall with the stairwell and railing on the left.
*Study two lacks the table and lamp and includes a second painting, which is separated from the other by a wall sconce, and one figure.
*Study three depicts the stairwell being moved into the background. A figure believed to be male stands in the open doorway to the left of the stairs while a woman sits to the left of the doorway with an empty chair, a painting on the wall and a tiled floor.
*Study four is more refined and has greater detail. The stairs are now removed with three people on the left: two seated figures next to a standing man. The rear doorway has a curtain, columns are on the reception desk, the ceiling appears to be beamed, a second painting is on the wall and a stripe is added to the floor.
*Study five is double sided. One side appears to be an abandoned diagram of a room. The reverse side shows the room with a more detailed revolving door and a return to a single, framed painting on the wall. The reception desk columns are more detailed, and the stripe on the floor is darkened.
*Study six is missing the seated figure from the left with only three remaining and in more detail. The figures and the elevator are in their final locations.
*Study seven shows the fourth figure reappearing by the couple. The ceiling, desk, revolving door, curtained doorway and elevator all have greater detail. The couple also appears to be having a conversation.
*Study eight was created to further detail the older woman's clothing and hands, showing her with a gold [[glove]].
*Study nine is a partial sketch of the younger woman who is reading, which shares the page with sketch eight, in greater detail. Until this sketch the other seated figure was a man.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hotel Lobby by Edward Hopper Detail 3.JPG| thumb| Blonde woman detail]] --&gt;
These studies show the older couple communicating, only to cease their conversation in the final painting and reading man is replaced with a blonde young woman reading in the final painting.&lt;ref name="Saetre"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fame is no cure for fear, Hopper exhibit shows |author=Julie Cope Saetre |url=http://assets3.indy.com/posts/10478 |newspaper=Indy.com |date=28 August 2008 |accessdate=14 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724055209/http://assets3.indy.com/posts/10478 |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modeling for both women in the painting was done by his wife Josephine. After their marriage in 1920 she insisted on being the model for all of his female figures.&lt;ref name="Elovich"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elovich |first1=Richard |last2= |first2= |year=1981 |title=London. Edward Hopper |journal=[[The Burlington Magazine]] |volume=123 |issue=935 |pages=111 |publisher=The Burlington Magazine Publications, Inc. |doi= |jstor=880286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coat the older woman wears is based on a [[fur coat]] owned by Hopper's wife, a coat she often wore to openings and a rare find in the Hopper's frugal household. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hotel Lobby by Edward Hopper Detail 1.JPG| thumb|left| Woman in red detail]] --&gt;
The red dress that the older woman wears (that Jo, in her journal, describes as "coral") signifies anger and extroversion, while the blue dress worn by the younger woman shows youth and distance. Throughout Hopper's sketches the clerk does not appear until the final painting. Under X-ray it can be seen that Hopper did little to change the canvas once he began work. Most alterations were made in the position of the young woman's head and in outlines of some areas in dark blue paint. A partial underdrawing was found but little detail remains.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hotel Lobby by Edward Hopper Detail 4.JPG| thumb| |Hopper detail]] --&gt;
Hopper was known to model for himself for figures, as in ''Nighthawks'', leading some to believe he may have modeled for the male figure in ''Hotel Lobby''.

One of the few paintings by Hopper to lack windows, ''Hotel Lobby'' utilizes light from the revolving door and an unseen area from between the ceiling beams.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;

==Reception==

In 1945 Hopper was awarded the [[Logan Medal of the Arts]] and a $500 [[honorarium]] for ''Hotel Lobby''.&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levin |first=Gail |coauthors= |title=Edward Hopper: An intimate biography |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=1998 |month= |isbn=0-520-21475-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtInstitute1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levin |first1=Gail |last2=Hopper |first2=Edward |year=1996 |title=Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks", Surrealism, and the War |journal=Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=195 |publisher=[[Art Institute of Chicago]] |doi= |jstor=4104321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was chosen by a jury composed of [[Juliana Force]], then director of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]], and artists [[Raphael Soyer]] and [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]].&lt;ref name="ArtInstitute1"/&gt; In regards to the painting, Chicago critic [[Clarence Joseph Bulliet|C.J. Bulliet]] stated that "Mr. Hopper is getting a little lazy about the excellent formula he has hit. ''Hotel Lobby'' is typical Hopper, but Hopper that has lost something of its kick."&lt;ref name="Levin"/&gt; The artwork has been compared to Hopper's earlier work ''Summer Interior'' (1909), a work that helped to create Hopper's signature style; an intimate setting, simple lines and geometry, flat color usage and moody light. A shadowy figure and a sensual woman each make another visit in ''Hotel Lobby'' as seen in ''Summer Interior''.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;

==Ownership and exhibition history==
The painting was in the collection of Henry Hope from [[Bloomington, Indiana]].&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt;

From June until December 2006 the Whitney Museum, which has the largest holding of Hopper's works in the world, displayed ''Hotel Lobby'' alongside their own works and key loans such as ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) and ''New York Movie'' (1939).&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Edward Hopper | work=Exhibitions | publisher=Whitney Museum of American Art | url=http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/EdwardHopper | accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hoppers Come and Go In a Whitney Show |author=Carol Vogel |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=6 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronnen"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tiroche sale opens tomorrow |author=Meir Ronnen |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=7 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hotel Lobby'' is currently on display in the Indianapolis Museum of Art's [[American scene painting|American Scene]] Gallery.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt; In 2008 the IMA exhibited the work alongside the ten studies on loan from the Whitney in ''Edward Hopper: Paper to Paint'', which ran until January 2009.&lt;ref name="IndianapolisMonth1"/&gt;

===Publications===

In 1996 ''Hotel Lobby'' was used as the paperback cover for the book ''Hotel Paradise'' by [[Martha Grimes]].&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grimes |first=Martha |coauthors= |title=Hotel Paradise |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=1996 |month= |isbn=978-0-345-39425-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting also appears in ''City Limits: Crime, consumer culture and the urban experience'' by [[Keith Hayward]].&lt;ref name="Hayward"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayward |first=Keith |coauthors= |title=City limits: Crime, consumer culture and the urban experience |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |year=2004 |month= |isbn=1-904385-03-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SekienNinmenju.jpg|thumb|right|The ''jinmenju'' as illustrated by [[Toriyama Sekien]]]]
{{nihongo|'''Jinmenju''' or '''Ninmenju'''|人面樹|''human-face tree''}} is a strange [[tree]] illustrated in [[Toriyama Sekien]]'s ''[[Konjaku Hyakki Shūi]]''.

==Description in folklore==
Legend has it that the tree grows "in remote mountain valleys in China".

The Jinmenju's [[fruit]] appear to be "human heads. The faces are always smiling or laughing, even as they fall from their branch."

==In popular culture==
* In the ''[[InuYasha]]'' anime series, episodes 57 and 58 revolve around Tokajin, a sage who feeds humans to a demonic tree with human-faced fruit in exchange for the immortality the fruit can grant.
* In the music video for [[Dir en grey]]'s song "[[Obscure (song)|Obscure]]", a woman resembling a [[geisha]] is seen taking a baby's head from a tree.
* The [[Pokémon]] Exeggutor may have been based on the Jinmenju.
* In several ''[[Castlevania]]'' games, there is a monster called "corpseweed" that appears as a tall plant with a head dangling from the end. 
* In the [[Sega Saturn]] port of ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' there is a new enemy Jinmenju which looks almost exactly like a jinmenju.
* In the game ''[[Tomba!|Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return]]'', there are fruits in Donglin Forest that either cry or laugh.
* In the film ''[[Dead and Deader]]'', there is an enemy tree-like creature, called Sun, with human faces, which may be inspired by this creature.

'''Marguerite Wyke''' '''[[OBE]]''' (May 1908 – 1995) was an [[African-American]]-born Trinidadian teacher, poet, artist and politician. After growing up in Jersey City, New Jersey, and working as a teacher, she married and moved to Canada for a decade and then relocated to Trinidad. Writing for various journals and newspapers, and cultivating the artistic community in Trinidad, she became active in local politics. Renouncing her U. S. citizenship, Wyke became a Trinidadian citizen in 1953 and became active in the island's governance. With the establishment of the [[West Indies Federation]] she was appointed as one of two Senators from [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and one of only two women Senators to serve in the federal parliament. When the Federation dissolved, Wyke returned to her artistic endeavors, publishing poetry and participating in various art media.

After her service in the Senate, Wyke returned to artistic pursuits and promoting development of the arts, as well as heritage protection programs.{{sfn|Sindoni|2016}} In 1961, she exhibited works for the opening of Nina's Art Gallery, one of the first galleries to open in Trinidad.{{sfn|Collier|2013|p=404}} She was chair of the committee organized to prepare for the celebrations of Trinidad and Tobaggo's Independence, which featured a [[Calypso music|calypso]] competition.{{sfn|Sindoni|2016}} Wyke was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1963 for her service to Trinidad as chair of the Independence Celebrations Committee.{{sfn|''The London Gazette''|1962|p=51}}{{sfn|''The Dominica Herald''|1963|p=8}} In the 1970s, Wyke served as the chair of the advisory board to the Central Library of Trinidad and Tobago.{{sfn|''The World of Learning''|1972|p=1258}}

In her lifetime, though Wyke worked in multiple artistic media, including fused glass, mosaic, painting, and pottery,{{sfn|Sindoni|2016}} she was most known for her sculpture.{{sfn|''Caliban''|1975|p=53}} She produced works which are held in private collections throughout the Caribbean, Canada, Denmark and the United States.{{sfn|''Caribbean Quarterly''|2008|p=205}}

==Death and legacy==
Wyke died around 1995.{{sfn|Sindoni|2016}} In 2002, the Cultural Center Art Gallery of the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] in Port of Spain, hosted an art exhibition for the country's 40th anniversary of independence. Wyke was one of several featured artists included in the show.{{sfn|''A Challenging Endeavor''|2002|pp=7, 36}}

'''''Memoria Urbana Berlin''''' (also known as [[Reconstruction (architecture)|Reconstruction]] Bohemian Bethlehem Church) is a [[Public art|public sculpture]] by [[Spanish art]]ist [[Juan Garaizabal]] that stands in the middle of the Bethlehemkirchplatz, [[Mitte]] district, [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It was constructed in June 2012 on the [[mosaic]] marking the exact site and size of the original Bohemian or Bethlehem Church ({{lang-de|Böhmische Kirche, Bethlehemskirche}}), which was destroyed in the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2013/06/18/actualidad/1371567587_938428.html ElPais.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sculpture]] is made up of 800 [[Metre|meters]] (2,600 [[Foot (unit)|feet]]) of square section (12x12 cm/4.7 in) [[Hollow structural section|steel tube]] and 300 meters (984 feet) of [[Light-emitting diode|LED illumination]] system. Its [[Structural art|structure]] draws in the air the lines of the [[silhouette]] of the lost construction, recreating its [[volume]] in the form of a [[sketch (drawing)|sketch.]] It measures 25 x 15 x 31 metres (82 x 49 x 101 feet) in height and weighs 44 [[short ton]]s (40 [[Ton|metric tons]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/telediario/escultor-espanol-juan-garai-zabal-presenta-proyecto-memorias-urbanas/1451945/ RTVE Garazaibal presents the ''Memorias Urbanas'' project (video)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and maintenance==
Originally planned as a [[Installation art|temporary installation]], as of December 2013 the district and [[Local government|municipal authorities]] have decreed permanent status for the work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morgenpost.de/bezirke/mitte/article122562359/Skulptur-der-Bethlehemskirche-bleibt-nach-Protesten.html Morgenpost.de]&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative proceedings for the permanent allocation on [[public land|public grounds]] are currently ongoing. The Lux-Bethlehem e.V. cultural trust, representing twenty of the public and private institutions that promoted the permanent installation, has been formally created to guarantee the [[Property maintenance|maintenance]] of the [[Monumental sculpture|sculpture]].

{{unsourced section|date=April 2018}}

It is a monument dedicated to [[Freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]] and to [[immigration]] with the spirit of [[Europeanism]].

The original Bohemian Church otherwise Bethlehem Church was built between 1733 and 1735 in the middle of the [[Friedrichstadt (Berlin)|Friedrichstadt]] (now the Mitte district) of Berlin, representing one of the most positive chapters of relations between [[Germany]] and [[Bohemia]]. Thanks to King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]], [[Czechs|Czech]] [[refugee]]s leaving their homeland for religious reasons were admitted to the Friedrichstadt district of Berlin. It was a monument to the [[Toleration|tolerance]] pervading the foundation of the [[Prussia|Prussian State]].

In 1943, it was badly damaged by bombing. Later, in 1963, the church was demolished and the site incorporated into the facilities of [[Checkpoint Charlie]].

'''Metaphoric architecture''' is an architectural movement that developed in [[Europe]] during the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="karatani" /&gt;

It is considered by some to be merely an aspect of [[postmodernism]] whilst others consider it to be a school in its own right and a later development of [[expressionist architecture]].&lt;ref name="metaphor" /&gt;

The style is characterised by the use of analogy and metaphor as the primary inspiration and directive for design.  Well known examples of this can be found in the Palm Mosque at the [[King Saud University]] in [[Riyadh]] by [[Basil Al Bayati]], based upon the form of a palm tree,&lt;ref name="revival" /&gt; the [[Lotus Temple]] in [[New Delhi]], by Fariborz Sahba, based on a lotus flower,&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; the [[TWA Flight Center]] building in [[New York City]], by [[Eero Saarinen]], inspired by the form of a bird's wing,&lt;ref name="NYT08"/&gt; or  the [[Sydney Opera House]], in [[Australia]], by [[Jørn Utzon]] that is derived from the sails of ships in the harbour.&lt;ref name="sydney" /&gt;

Certain architects have also been known to utilise metaphors as a theme throughout their work such as [[Le Corbusier]] and the open hand motif.  This to him was a sign of "peace and reconciliation.  It is open to give and open to receive."&lt;ref name="lotus" /&gt;
[[File:Onion House Hawaii 31.jpg|thumb|The Onion House, Hawaii]]
Perhaps the most prominent voice of the Metaphoric architectural school at present is Dr. [[Basil Al Bayati]] whose designs have been inspired by trees and plants, snails, whales, insects, dervishes and even myth and literature.&lt;ref name="Bingham" /&gt;  He is also the founder of the International School of Metaphoric Architecture in [[Málaga]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="centromalaga" /&gt;

'''Mierle Laderman Ukeles''' (born 1939, [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]) is a [[New York City]]-based artist known for her [[Feminist art|feminist]] and service-oriented artwork, which relates the idea of process in conceptual art to domestic and civic "maintenance".&lt;ref name=Krug /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finkelpearl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Patricia C.|last2=Finkelpearl|first2=Tom|last3=Harris|first3=Larissa|last4=Lippard|first4=Lucy|last5=Raicovich|first5=Laura|title=Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Maintenance Art|date=2016|publisher=Prestel|isbn=9783791355382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
As an undergraduate, Ukeles studied [[history]] and [[international studies]] at [[Barnard College]] and later began her artistic training at the [[Pratt Institute]] in New York.&lt;ref name=Krug&gt;{{cite web|last=Krug|first=Don|title=Ecological Restoration: Mierle Ukeles, Flow City|url=http://www.greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Issues/ukeles.php|work=Art &amp; Ecology: Perspectives and Issues|publisher=greenmuseum.org|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukeles is [[Jewish]] and the daughter of a [[Rabbi]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/138254/mierle-laderman-ukeles&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1969 she wrote a manifesto entitled ''Maintenance Art Manifesto 1969! Proposal for an exhibition "CARE"'', challenging the domestic role of women and proclaiming herself a "maintenance artist". Aside from "personal" or household maintenance, the manifesto also addressed "general" or public maintenance and earth maintenance, such as addressing polluted waters. Her exhibitions were intended to bring awareness to the low cultural status of maintenance work, generally paying either minimum wage or no payments for housewives.&lt;ref name="queensmuseum"&gt;[http://www.queensmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ukeles_MANIFESTO.pdf "Maintenance Art Manifesto 1969]." Queens Museum. Retrieved on 2017-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance, for Ukeles, includes the household activities that keep things going, such as cooking, cleaning and child-rearing -&lt;ref name="Bird"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Jon|last2=Newman|first2=Michael|title=Rewriting conceptual art|date=1999|publisher=Reaktion|location=London|isbn=1861890524|pages=114-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xoAaNAWDOfwC&amp;pg=PA114|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liss|first1=Andrea|title=Feminist art and the maternal|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0816646234|pages=43-68|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wQ_EbappjiUC&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during her exhibitions, she performed the same tasks that she would perform in her daily life, including entertaining guests.&lt;ref name="feldmangallery1969"&gt;[http://www.feldmangallery.com/media/pdfs/Ukeles_MANIFESTO.pdf  "Maintenance Art Manifesto 1969]." Feldman Gallery. Retrieved on 2014-02-02.{{better source|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of her performances in the 1970s involved the maintenance of art spaces, including the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]]. Since 1977 she has been the Artist in Residence (unsalaried) of the [[New York City Department of Sanitation]].&lt;ref name=galleristny&gt;[http://galleristny.com/2013/01/trash-talk-the-department-of-sanitations-artist-in-residence-is-a-real-survivor/ Trash Talk: The Department of Sanitation’s Artist in Residence Is a Real Survivor | Gallerist]. Galleristny.com. Retrieved on 2014-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts and methodologies==
The role of the artist for Ukeles is that of an activist: empowering people to act and change societal values and norms. This agenda stems from a feminist concern with challenging the privileged and gendered notion of the independent artist. For Ukeles, art is not fixed and complete but an ongoing process that is connected to everyday life and her ''Manifesto for Maintenance Art'' proclaims the infection of art by everyday mundane activities.&lt;ref name=Stratford&gt;{{cite book|last=Stratford|first=Helen|title=Collective Assemblages|date=2003|publisher=Intellect|location=Bristol|isbn=9781841508511|pages=107–117|author2=Hinchcliffe, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The gargantuan domestic actions that she performed primarily became inaugurated out of her role as artist and mother in the 70s. After the birth of her first child in 1968, Ukeles believes that her public identity as an artist slipped into second place, because of the public perception of the role of a mother.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Shannon|title=Social works : the infrastructural politics of performance|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415486019|pages=82–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manifesto For Maintenance Art 1969!===
Initially written as a proposal for an exhibition entitled ''Care'', the ''Manifesto For Maintenance Art'' emphasizes maintenance—keeping things clean, working and cared for—as a creative strategy. The manifesto came about after Ukeles gave birth to her first child, suddenly she had to balance her time as artist and mother, and had little time to create art, she noted that the famous male artists that she admired never had to make such sacrifices.&lt;ref name="Sample"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sample|first1=Hilary|title=Maintenance Architecture|date=2016|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0262335360|pages=65-67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohWsDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wack! Art and the Feminist Revolution|last=Butler|first=Cornelia|publisher=MIT Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described this feeling and the epiphany that lead to the manifesto in this way, "I felt like two separate people...the free artists and the mother/maintenance worker.... I was never working so hard in my whole life, trying to keep together the two people I had become. Yet people said to me, when they saw me pushing my baby carriage, "Do you do anything?"...Then I had an epiphany... I have the freedom to name maintenance as art. I can collide freedom into its supposed opposite and call that art. I name necessity art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conservation and Maintenance of Contemporary Public Art|last=Yngvason|first=Hafthor|publisher=Archetype|year=2002|isbn=|location=London|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifesto is formed into two major parts. In part I, under the rubric 'Ideas' she makes a distinction between the two basic systems of 'Development' and 'Maintenance', where the former is associated with 'pure individual creation', 'the new', 'change' and the latter is tasked with 'keep the dust off the pure individual creation, preserve the new, sustain the change'. She asks, "after the revolution, who’s going to pick up the garbage on Monday morning?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feldmangallery.com/media/pdfs/Ukeles_MANIFESTO.pdf |title= Manifesto for Maintenance Ar 1969!|last1=Laderman Ukeles|first1=Mierle|date=1969 |website= |publisher=Ronald Feldman Fine Arts |access-date=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the modernist tradition in which the originality of an artist is foregrounded and the mundane material reality of an artist's everyday life is disregarded.&lt;ref name="arnolfini.org.uk"&gt;Knight, Sarah (2013) "[http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/mierle-laderman-ukeles-maintenance-art-works-196920131980/MierleGuidefinalweb.pdf Mierle Laderman Ukeles Maintenance Art Works 1969–1980 Exhibition Guide]" Arnolfini, Bristol&lt;/ref&gt; “Avant-garde art, which claims utter development, is infected by strains of maintenance ideas, maintenance activities, and maintenance materials…”

The second part describes her proposal for the exhibition and is made up of three parts ''A) Part One: Personal'', ''B) Part Two: General'' and ''C) Part Three: Earth Maintenance''. She begins with the statement “I am an artist. I am a woman. I am a wife. I am a mother. (Random order) I do a hell of a lot of washing, cleaning, cooking, renewing, supporting, preserving, etc. Also, (up to now separately) I ‘do’ Art. Now I will simply do these everyday things, and flush them up to consciousness, exhibit them, as Art [...] MY WORKING WILL BE THE WORK”&lt;ref name=e-flux&gt;{{cite web|title=Mierle Laderman Ukeles Maintenance Art Works 1969–1980|url=http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/mierle-laderman-ukeles/|work=e-flux|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Touch Sanitation (1979-80)===
''Touch Sanitation'' is one of Ukeles’ most ambitious early projects and a milestone in the history of [[performance art]].&lt;ref name="arnolfini.org.uk"/&gt; Taking almost a year, Ukeles met over 8500 employees of the New York Sanitation Department, shaking hands with each of them and saying, “Thank you for keeping New York City alive”.&lt;ref&gt;Ukeles, Mierle Laderman. "Interview." Coordinated by Erin Salazer, Bronx Museum ''TCG'' (Spring/Summer 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; She documented her activities on a map, meticulously recording her conversations with the workers. Ukeles documented the workers' private stories in an attempt to change some of the negative words used in the public sphere of society, using her art as an agent of change to challenge conventional stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Issues/ukeles.php |title=Ecological Restoration Mierle Ukeles, Flow City |last1=Krug |first1=Dan |date=2006 |website= |publisher=Green Museum |access-date=8 March 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5735">[[Image:Spoonlogo.gif|right]]'''Nicu's Spoon''' is an [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion-oriented]] [[off-off-Broadway]] [[theater company]] in [[New York City]]. Its artistic director is Stephanie Barton-Farcas, a NYC director/actress/producer/writer who won the OOBR (Off-Off Broadway Review) award for direction of ''Suburbia'' in 2004, the NYU Thom Fluellen Award in 2006 and the 2008 NY Innovative Theater Award for Outstanding Actress in a Lead Role for ''Elizabeth Rex'' among others. Nicu's Spoon was the first ever fully inclusive company in NYC history. They are also co-founders of the Disability in Cinema Coalition [http://disabilitycinemacoalition.weebly.com/ DCC]

The company is based on [[Inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]], so it chooses to work with actors that might otherwise be considered '[[marginalization|marginalized]]', whether by age, disability, gender, or ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spoontheater|url=http://spoontheater.org/about/|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company became known from the outset for productions which challenged stereotypes and expectations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Access to theater|url=http://spoontheater.org/reviews/Kitedoodirty.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was the recipient of the 2006 [[Thom Fluellen Award]] given by the [[New York University]] Community Fund for "excellence in programming for the diverse city of New York". It has also won the 2004 OOBR award and a 2008 Snapple/Mayor of NY City Award, as well as a 2008 NY Innovative Theatre Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyitawards.com |title=New York Innovative Theatre Awards - Home |publisher=Nyitawards.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's unusual name stems from a young boy the artistic director met in [[Romania]] in the 1990s when working with abandoned children there. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;...[T]he most amazing one was Nicu, who was 5...in diapers and did not walk, talk or feed himself. They told me he was deaf and retarded. Nicu had spent 5 years on his back in a crib. I got angry and said "I'll take him." Six months later he did all those things. He and I fought some big, bad battles together to get him there&amp;nbsp;— to get him to choose life. And in the process he changed my life. Though he was mentally and physically challenged Nicu viewed the world with wonder; he spent hours bouncing sunlight off of a spoon. When he began to eat solid food ... his spoon was  everything to him. Nicu's spoon became the symbol for all the impossible things that were suddenly possible—things like walking, talking, thinking, and living. He was and we lost him 5 years later, in 1996. Nicu's life was about quality, not quantity&amp;nbsp;— about life's impossibles becoming possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Nicu|url=http://spoontheater.org/nicu/|publisher=Spoontheater|accessdate=16 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416192045/http://spoontheater.org/nicu/|archivedate=16 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nicu's Spoon productions have been the original work ''Displaced''; ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]''; Eric Overmyer's ''In Perpetuity Throughout the Universe''; ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''; Mac Wellman's ''Murder of Crows''; [[Eric Bogosian]]'s ''[[SubUrbia]]''; a play adaptation of ''Ordinary People'' by Nancy Gilsenan (from the book by Judith Guest); Elizabeth Egloff's ''The Swan''; a play adaptation of ''[[Le Petit Prince]]'' by Ric Cummins and John Scoullar; Mark Medoff's ''Stumps''; Gary Henderson's ''Skin Tight''; Ken Duncum's ''Cherish''; ''[[Buried Child]]''; Constance Congdon's ''Tales of the Lost Formicans'', ''[[Richard III (play)|Shakespeare's Richard III]]'', and most recently their highly successful run of ''[[Elizabeth Rex]]'', which after its run moved to New York's [[Center Stage (New York)|Center Stage]] in August 2008 for a one-month limited [[Off-Broadway]] engagement.  In 2013 and 2014 they have been followed for 6 months for a documentary film produced by The School of Visual Arts in NYC, called ''Two and Twenty Troubles''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4164008/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 their artistic director, Stephanie Barton-Farcas had a book published by Routledge Press, "Disability &amp; Theater: A Practical Manual for Inclusion in the Arts."

[[File:Paul Gauguin, 1894, Oviri (Sauvage), partially glazed stoneware, 75 x 19 x 27 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Paul Gauguin, ''Oviri'' (''Sauvage''), 1894, partially glazed [[stoneware]], 75 × 19 × 27 cm (29.5 × 7.5 × 10.6 in), [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris]]

'''''Oviri''''' ([[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] for '''savage''' or '''wild''')&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, 162&lt;/ref&gt; is an 1894 [[ceramic]] sculpture by the French artist [[Paul Gauguin]]. In [[Tahiti and Society Islands mythology|Tahitian mythology]], Oviri was the goddess of mourning. She is shown with long pale hair, and wild eyes, smothering a wolf with her feet, while clutching a cub in her arms. Art historians have presented multiple interpretations—usually that Gauguin intended it as an epithet to reinforce his self-image as a "civilised savage". Tahitian goddesses of her era had passed from folk memory by 1894, yet Gauguin romanticises the island's past as he reaches towards more ancient sources, including an [[Assyrian relief]] of a "[[master of animals]]" type, and [[Majapahit]] mummies. Other possible influences include preserved skulls from the [[Marquesas Islands]], figures found at [[Borobudur]], and a 9th-century [[Mahayana Buddhist]] temple in [[central Java]].

Gauguin made three casts, each in partially glazed [[stoneware]], and while several copies exist in plaster or bronze, the original cast is in the [[Musée d'Orsay]].  His sales of the casts were not successful, and at a low financial and personal ebb he asked for one to be placed on his grave. There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure: he described the figure as a strange and cruel enigma on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a [[woodcut]] of ''Oviri'' for [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]; he referred to it as ''La Tueuse'' ("The Murderess") in a 1897 letter to [[Ambroise Vollard]]; and he appended an inscription referencing [[Honoré de Balzac]]'s novel ''[[Séraphîta]]'' in a {{circa|1899}} drawing.&lt;ref name=Landy&gt;Landy, 242, 244–46&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oviri'' was exhibited at the 1906 [[Salon d'Automne]] (no.&amp;nbsp;57)&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.org/stream/cataloguedesouvr1906salo#page/192/mode/2up 1906 Salon d'automne]".

Retrieved 29 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; where it influenced [[Pablo Picasso]], who based one of the figures in ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' on it.&lt;ref&gt;Frèches-Thory, 372–73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist [[Ernest Chaplet]]. They had been introduced by [[Félix Bracquemond]]&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 224&lt;/ref&gt; who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at [[Rue de Vaugirard|Vaugirard]], where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/fapot/hd_fapot.htm French Art Pottery]". Metropolitan Museum of Art timeline. Retrieved 11 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agostini - Tahiti, plate page 0080.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Jules Agostini's 1896 photograph of Gauguin's house in [[Puna'auia]], [[French Polynesia]]]]
Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of ''faaturuma'' (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic.&lt;ref name="soth"&gt;"[http://www.sgallery.net/artnews/2008/04/29/important-and-rare-paul-gauguin-sculpture-up-for-auction-at-sotheby-s.html Important and Rare Paul Gauguin Sculpture Up for Auction at Sotheby's]". sgallery.net. April 29, 2008. Retrieved     22 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Gauguin's first [[wood carving]]s in Tahiti were with a [[guava]] wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived.

He completed ''Oviri'' in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] 1895 ''salon'' opening in April the following year.&lt;ref name= Orsay&gt;"[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/sculpture/commentaire_id/oviri-11308.html?cHash=f88883513c Oviri]". [[Musée d'Orsay]]. Retrieved 23 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; There are two versions of what ensued: {{ill|Charles Morice (writer)|lt=Charles Morice|fr|Charles Morice}} claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was "literally expelled" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest.&lt;ref name="Frèches Thory 372"&gt;Frèches-Thory, 372&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bengt Danielsson]], Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to ''[[Le Soir]]'', bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.&lt;ref name="Danielsson 170"&gt;Danielsson, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on ''Oviri'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the ''Tueuse'' ("The Murderess"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=B6JTCCBSZuoC&amp;dq=gauguin,+oviri,+bronze&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Cézanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde].

Art historian [[Christopher Gray]] mentions three plaster casts, the fissured surfaces of which suggest that they were taken from a prior undocumented wood carving no longer extant. One was given to [[George-Daniel de Monfreid|Daniel Monfreid]] and now belongs to the [[Musée départemental Maurice Denis "The Priory"]] in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. Another version in plaster, with the surface finish of wood, was kept by [[Gustave Fayet]], and subsequently formed part of the collection of his son, Léon. The third version was kept by the artist who made the casts.&lt;ref name="Christie's 2006"&gt;"[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4815166 After Paul Gauguin, ''Oviri'', bronze, lot 317, sale 1723]".

Oviri has long blonde or grey hair reaching to her knees.

[[Christie's]], Impressionist and Modern Art (Day Sale), 9 November 2000. Retrieved 21 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub,&lt;ref name= F-T371/&gt; but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the [[Medea|vengeful mother]], influenced by [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s 1838 painting, ''[[Medea#Many endings|Medea About to Kill Her Children]]''.&lt;ref name= Pollitt /&gt; A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 198–99&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.&lt;ref name= T199&gt;Taylor, 199&lt;/ref&gt;

The association between the woman and a wolf stems from a remark [[Edgar Degas]] made defending Gauguin's work at the poorly received  1893 [[Durand-Ruel]] exhibition, when Degas quoted [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine's]] fable ''[[The Dog and the Wolf]]'', which is usually taken as implying that freedom should not be exchanged for comfort or financial gain: "You see, Gauguin is the wolf."&lt;ref name =T199/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 95&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Oviri'', the mature wolf, the European Gauguin, perishes while the whelp, the  Gauguin of Tahiti, survives.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 206&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siddharta Gautama Borobudur.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|''Siddharta Gautama'', 8th century [[frieze]], [[Borobudur]]]]
The Tahitian myths had largely disappeared by Gauguin's time (he based his own accounts on other sources without acknowledgement), as had most artefacts associated with that culture. His representation of ''Oviri'' is largely a work of imagination, informed by a collection of what he described as his "little world of friends" and which he took with him to Tahiti on his first visit. These included [[Odilon Redon]]'s [[lithograph]] ''La Mort'', photographs of subjects such as [[:commons:File:Siddharta Gautama Borobudur.jpg|a temple frieze]] at [[Borobudur]], [[Java]], and an [[:commons:File:Nebamun-Bankett.JPG|Egyptian fresco]] from an 18th dynasty tomb at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 143, 145, 152&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources that have been suggested include an [[Dur-Sharrukin|Assyrian]] relief of [[Gilgamesh]] clutching a lion cub now in the [[Louvre]], and a [[Majapahit Terracotta|Majapahit terracotta]] figure from the [[Jakarta History Museum|Djakarta museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Oviri's head seems based on mummified skulls of chieftains in the [[Marquesas Islands]], whose eye sockets were traditionally encrusted with mother-of-pearl and worshiped as divine. Elements of her body may draw from  [[Borobudur]] images of [[fecundity]]. Thus life and death were evoked in the same image.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, 65&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Mallarmé trying to raise a public subscription to purchase the work, Morice titled the sculpture ''Diane Chasseresse'' ("Diana the Huntress"), an allusion to the ancient Greek goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] of the hunt, moon and childbirth. He made the same reference in his poems on ''Oviri''. Barbara Landy interprets the life and death theme as indicating Gauguin's need to abandon his civilised ego in a return to the natural state of the primitive savage.&lt;ref name="Frèches Thory 372"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landy, 245–46&lt;/ref&gt; The work is related to the 1889 ceramic ''Black Venus'', which shows a woman kneeling over a severed head resembling the artist.&lt;ref name= T199/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;"[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/gauguin/explore-exhibition/eternal-feminine The Eternal Feminine]". [[Tate]]. Retrieved 23 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Mowll Mathews]] believes the creatures in her arms and at her feet are actually foxes, animals Gauguin had used in his 1889 wood carving ''Be in Love, You Will Be Happy'' and in his 1891 Pont-Aven oil painting ''The Loss of Virginity''. In an 1889 letter to [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], he described the ''[[Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses|Soyez amoureuses]]'' fox as an "Indian symbol of perversity".&lt;ref&gt;Barkan; Bush, 258&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long tradition in Asian folklore of foxes having the power to transform into women (for example in Japanese ''[[Yōkai]]'' or ''[[Kitsune]]'' folklore).&lt;ref&gt;Casal, 1–93&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauguin depicts the ''Oviri'' figure in at least one drawing, two watercolour transfer [[monotype]]s and two woodcuts. It is possible that the woodcuts were created in Pont-Aven in the summer of 1894; before the ceramic.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, 375–76&lt;/ref&gt; The last to appear is probably the drawing in what is apparently the first issue of Gauguin's [[Papeete]] broadsheet ''[[Le Sourire]]'' "(The Smile: A Serious Newspaper)" published between August 1899 and April 1900. It was accompanied by the inscription "Et le monstre, entraînant sa créature, féconde de sa semence des flancs généreux pour engendrer Séraphitus-Séraphita" (''And the monster, embracing its creation, filled her generous womb with seed and fathered Séraphitus-Séraphita''). Séraphitus-Séraphita is an allusion to [[Honoré de Balzac|Honoré de Balzac's]] novel ''[[Séraphîta]]'' which features an [[androgynous]] hero. In this first issue of ''Le Sourire'', he reviewed a local [[Maohi]] author's play by that dealt with incest (among other themes), and invokes 'Séraphitus-Séraphita'. The review congratulated the play's "savage author" and ended with a plea for women's liberation through the abolition of marriage. The accompanying drawing is distinctly androgynous.&lt;ref name= T215-8&gt;Taylor, 215–18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Art historians have put forward various theories as to the seeming multiplicity of meanings inherent in Gauguin's representation. Most obviously the figure invokes Tahitian legend and themes of death and superstition. It reflects the artist's view of female sexuality; a common motif in 19th century art was the connection between long, wild hair and evil femininity. Related is the delight Gauguin took from its alternative title "savage" and the implications of a brutal, bloodthirsty deity, which seems to refer as much to himself as the goddess.&lt;ref name="g245"&gt;Gray, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauguin's figure invokes the Polynesian goddess [[Hina (goddess)#Tuamotu and Tahiti|Hina]], depicted by Morice as a [[Diana (mythology)|Diana-like]] deity clutching a wolf cub, "monstrous and majestic, drunk with pride, rage and sorrow".&lt;ref name= Taylor&gt;Taylor, 211, 214&lt;/ref&gt; He titled an 1894 self-portrait in plaster as ''Oviri''.&lt;ref name="C208" /&gt; The original is lost but a number of bronze casts survive. He used double mirrors to capture his familiar Inca profile, the result reprising his ''[[Jug in the Form of a Head, Self-Portrait]]''. This was one of the earliest occasions Gauguin applied the term ''Oviri'' to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Cachin, 377&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/sculptures-statues-figures/after-paul-gauguin-selfportrait-oviri-5624458-details.aspx Sale 3022 Lot 49"].

''Oviri'' was the title of a favourite Tahitian song—a melancholy tune of love and longing that mentions the subject's "savage, restless heart".&lt;ref name="Danielsson 170"/&gt; It recounts the love between two women for each other, both of whom have grown silent and cold. Gauguin translated the verse in his series of romanticised journal ''[[Noa Noa]]'' (Tahitian for "fragrance", a written project he undertook to examine his Tahitian experience, which he accompanied with a series of ten woodcuts);&lt;ref&gt;Ives, 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/gri_33125008635993 Paul Gauguin, Charles Morice, ''Noa Noa'' (full text online)]&lt;/ref&gt; the only one of his songs reprinted in the Tahitian newspaper ''La Guêpes'' when he became editor.{{efn|Gauguin copied the song into his second 1893–95 draft in collaboration with Morice. Danielsson describes the translation as very poor and provides his own.}} Danielsson believes the song echoes Gauguin's dual attachment to his Danish wife Mette and his then ''vahine'' (Tahitian for "woman") [[Merahi metua no Tehamana|Teha'amana]], his young native wife and the focal point of ''Noa Noa''.&lt;ref&gt;Danielsson, 115–17&lt;/ref&gt;

''Noa Noa'' contains an account of a journey into the mountains with a young man whom he eventually understands as sexless, leading him to meditate on the "androgynous side of the savage" in his manuscript.&lt;ref name=F-T371-2&gt;Frèches-Thory, 371–72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau, 321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, 113–19&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Pollitt notes that in Tahitian culture the craftsman/artist, neither warrior/hunter nor homemaker/carer, was conceived androgynously, an ambiguous gender position that appealed to Gauguin's subversive nature.&lt;ref name= Pollitt&gt;Pollitt, Ben. "[https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/becoming-modern/avant-garde-france/post-impressionism/a/gauguin-oviri Gauguin, Oviri]. [[Khan Academy]], 2015. Retrieved 23 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor believes Morice may have been describing Gauguin in his 1897 poem ''Shining Hina of the Woods'' as part of two long extracts from their collaboration on ''Noa Noa''. Gray views the sculpture as representing "the expression of Gauguin's profound disillusionment and discouragement".&lt;ref name= Orsay/&gt;

''Noa Noa'' is part of Gauguin's documentation of his experiences as a colonial visitor to Tahiti in 1891–1893. He first used the term "Noa Noa" to describe the scent of Tahitian women: "A mingled perfume, half animal, half vegetable emanated from them; the perfume of their blood and of the [[gardenia taitensis]], which they wore in their hair".&lt;ref&gt;Nicole, 126&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to Paris in 1893, Gauguin was apprehensive about exhibiting his Tahitian works. ''Noa Noa'' was to provide the context necessary for the public to comprehend the new motifs presented at his Durand-Ruel exhibition. It was not completed in time for the opening of the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.clevelandart.org/research/in-the-library/collection-in-focus/paul-gauguins-noa-noa Paul Gauguin's Noa Noa]".

===Self portrait===
Gauguin asked that ''Oviri'' be placed on his grave,{{efn|[https://archive.org/stream/letterspaulgaug00gauggoog#page/n145/mode/2up ''Letter XLVIII to Monfreid'']: the sculpture is not named and he says in the first place he wants it to decorate his garden: "The large ceramic figure that did not find a purchaser&amp;nbsp;... I should like to have it here for the decoration of my garden and to put on my tomb in Tahiti."}} which seems to indicate that he saw the figure as his ''alter ego''. According to Mathews, he saw the fox as changeable in its gender as he was, and thus symbolic of dangerous sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, 208&lt;/ref&gt; A number of sources indicate that Gauguin was suffering a syphilitic rash that prevented him from travelling to Tahiti for several months.{{efn|Danielsson, 182, mentions an oral source to the effect that when Gauguin returned, his ''vahine'' Teha'amana spent a week with him but was repulsed by the running sores covering his body}} She suggests the orifice is a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the woman who infected him.&lt;ref name= T204/&gt;

The anthropologist {{ill|Paul van der Grijp|nl}} believes ''Oviri'' was intended as an [[epithet]] to reinforce Gauguin's ''persona'' as a "civilised savage".&lt;ref&gt;van der Grijp, 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Psychoanalysis"&gt;Gedo, 61&lt;/ref&gt;  In his final letter to Morice, the artist wrote that "''You'' were wrong that day when you said I was wrong to say I was a savage. It's true enough: I am a savage. And civilised people sense the fact. In my work there is nothing that can surprise or disconcert, except the fact that I am a savage in spite of myself. That's also why my work is inimitable."{{efn|Letter to Charles Morice, April 1903. Malingue 1949, CLXXXI: "Tu t'es trompé un jour en disant que j'avais tort de dire que je suis un sauvage. Cela est cependant vrai: je suis un sauvage. Et les civilisés le pressentent : car dans mes œuvres il n'y a rien qui surprenne, déroute, si ce n'est ce « malgré-moi-de-sauvage ». C'est pourquoi c'est inimitable."}}&lt;ref name="C208" /&gt;&lt;ref name= F-T371&gt;Frèches-Thory, 371&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Browning Chipp, 84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==
[[File:Paul Gauguin - Oviri presentation mount for Stéphane Mallarmé - AIC 1947.686.1 &amp; 1947.686.2.jpg|thumb|''Oviri'' presentation mount for [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], 1895. [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
Whether or not the sculpture was to be exhibited at the ''[[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts|Salon de la Nationale]]'', it was scheduled for the café proprietor Lévy at 57 rue Saint-Lazare, with whom Gauguin had concluded an agreement to represent him before his last departure for Tahiti. It failed to sell, and Charles Morice was unable to raise public money to acquire it for the nation. Gauguin had thought his only likely interested patron would be [[Gustave Fayet]], who did eventually buy it for 1,500 francs, but in 1905, after Gauguin's death.&lt;ref&gt;Schackelford, 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauguin was celebrated by the Parisian [[avant-garde]] after the posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in 1903 and 1906. The power evoked by his work led directly to ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' in 1907. According to [[David Sweetman]], Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist {{ill|Paco Durrio|es|Francisco Durrio de Madrón}} in Paris. Durrio was a friend of Gauguin and held several of his works in an attempt to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris.&lt;ref name="Sweetman"&gt;Sweetman, 562–63&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of divine energy.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 461&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both Sweetman and Richardson point to the Gauguin ''Oviri'' as a major influence. First exhibited in the 1906 Salon d'Automne retrospective, it was probably a direct influence on ''Les Demoiselles''. [[David Sweetman]] writes, "Gauguin's statue ''Oviri,'' which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in printmaking, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''."&lt;ref name="Sweetman" /&gt;

In 2006, a bronze version of ''Oviri'' sold at [[Christie's]] New York for US$251,200.&lt;ref name="Christie's 2006" /&gt;

The '''Polish Academy of Literature''' ({{lang-pl|Polska Akademia Literatury, PAL}}) was one of the most important state institutions of literary life in the [[Second Polish Republic]], operating between 1933–1939 with the headquarters in [[Warsaw]]. It was founded by the decree of the Council of Ministers of the Republic ([[Rada Ministrów]] RP).&lt;ref name="Lerski-451"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=QTUTqE2difgC&amp;pg=PA451&amp;dq=%22Polish+Academy+of+Literature%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4WHdTuOqE5TSiALn7rXQAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CGIQuwUwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Polish%20Academy%20of%20Literature%22&amp;f=false | title=''Historical dictionary of Poland, 966-1945'' | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | year=1996 | accessdate=December 5, 2011 | author=[[Jerzy Jan Lerski]], Piotr Wróbel, Richard J.

The Academy was the highest opinion-forming authority in the country, in charge of all aspects of promoting and honoring the most outstanding contemporary achievements of [[Polish literature]]. According to its own statute, the main objective of the Academy was to raise the quality level of Poland's publishing, while working in conjunction with the government efforts and NGO endeavors focused on the advancement of Polish culture and art in general. The century of [[Partitions of Poland|foreign Partitions]] of Poland, ending in 1918, was marked by the forcible suppression of Polish education, language and religion under Prussian (and later German rule, see [[Kulturkampf]]),&lt;ref name="Janowski"&gt;Maciej Janowski, [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;vid=ISBN9639241180&amp;id=ieF7NYaEqQYC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=iroquois+poles+frederick&amp;prev=https://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3Diroquois%2Bpoles%2Bfrederick&amp;sig=1jAuJXSLBvbGJaA7sBxtkFP7-38 Frederick's "Iroquois of Europe"] in ''Polish liberal thought before 1918''; Central European University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|963-9241-18-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and outright Russification in the territories occupied by the Tsarist Empire,&lt;ref name="Gatagova"&gt;[[Liudmila Gatagova]], [http://archives.acls.org/programs/crn/network/ebook_gatagova_paper2.doc  "The Crystallization of Ethnic Identity in the Process of Mass Ethnophobias in the Russian Empire.

==Organization and the awards for contributions to literature==
The structure of the Academy was modeled on the corresponding French [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]]. It consisted of 15 members chosen for life, seven of whom were selected by the Minister of Religion and Public Education. The remaining eight were proposed by the members of the first group. Notably, socialist writer and [[Freemason]], [[Andrzej Strug]] declined the offer,&lt;ref name="portalwiedzy" /&gt; upset by voices of official criticism of [[Freemasonry|the movement]].&lt;ref name="wprost"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wprost.pl/ar/14211/Mason-ofiarny/| title = Mason ofiarny (Sacrificial Mason) | author=Przemysław Waingertner | publisher=Magazine ''Wprost'' 42/1038 | year=2002 | accessdate=December 12, 2011 | language=Polish}} ''See also'': [http://translate.google.ca/translate?sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wprost.pl%2Far%2F14211%2FMason-ofiarny%2F  Google translation] from Polish.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy awarded two highest national honors for contribution to the development of Polish literature: the Gold and the Silver Laurel (Złoty, and Srebrny Wawrzyn). Another prize, also widely regarded, was the Young Writer's Award, a ''door-opener'' for new and emerging talent.&lt;ref name="bookinstitute"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bookinstitute.pl/en,ik,site,40,78,1282.php | title=Wawrzyn akademicki (Academic laurel) | publisher=2011 ''Instytut Książki'' (The Book Institute), [[Kraków]] | accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The honorary members included also the Academy's main promotors: President of Poland [[Ignacy Mościcki]] and Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]].&lt;ref name="portalwiedzy" /&gt;

Among the members of the Academy were the luminaries of Poland's literary life including its own president [[Wacław Sieroszewski]], vicepresident [[Leopold Staff]],&lt;ref name="Miłosz-348"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=R-MkT9vavwIC&amp;pg=PA430&amp;dq=%22Polish+Academy+of+Literature%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=12PdTowcxNiIApOl4MYD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEkQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Polish%20Academy%20of%20Literature%22&amp;f=false | title=''The history of Polish literature'' | publisher=University of California Press | year=1983 | accessdate=December 5, 2011 | author=[[Czesław Miłosz]] | pages=348, 430, 490 | isbn=0-520-04477-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; secretary general [[Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski]],&lt;ref name="Bartelski"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biblioteka.kijowski.pl/bartelski%20leslaw.m/pisarze.pdf | title=''Polscy pisarze współcześni 1939-1991.

The composition changed after the death Choynowski (1935) and Leśmian (1937) and after the withdrawal from PAL by Rzymowski accused of plagiarism (1937),&lt;ref name="ipn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/pl/398/4916/ | title=Wincenty Rzymowski (1883–1950) | publisher=''[[Instytut Pamięci Narodowej]]'' | year=2011 | accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Rostworowski (1937) protesting against the change of government.&lt;ref name="teatry"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.teatry.art.pl/portrety/roztworowski_kh/mistrzd.htm | title=Karol Hubert Rostworowski | publisher=''Nasz Dziennik'' | date=November 2002 | accessdate=December 14, 2011 | author=Wojciech Wielądek | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415035742/http://www.teatry.art.pl/portrety/roztworowski_kh/mistrzd.htm | archivedate=April 15, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new members were soon appointed, including writers [[Ferdynand Goetel]], [[Kornel Makuszyński]], [[Jan Lorentowicz]], and [[Kazimierz Wierzyński]]. The Academy ceased to exist following the Nazi-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="portalwiedzy" /&gt;

===Epilogue===
In 1947 following World War II, in the Soviet-controlled [[People's Republic of Poland]], there was a discussion among some communist writers about whether to reinstate the Academy. The leading proponent of [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Stalinist era (1948–1956)|Polish Stalinism]] from ''Kuźnica'', [[Jan Kott]], summarized the subject in the following way: "The Academy is like the monarchy; if it has existed for some time, one can get used to it, just as one can get accustomed to [[progressive bulbar palsy]]. But to start it afresh – that leads to trouble."&lt;ref name="IPN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/download.php?s=1&amp;id=3897 | title=Co z tą Akademią?

'''''Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)''''' is a large [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]]-on-canvas [[pop art]] painting by British artist [[David Hockney]], completed in May 1972. It measures {{cvt|7|x|10|ft|m}},&lt;ref name=Christies-auction&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Paintings/david-hockney-portrait-of-an-artist-6171867-details.aspx?lid=1&amp;from=relatedlot&amp;intobjectid=6171867|title=David Hockney (b.1937), ''Portrait of an artist (Pool with Two Figures)''|publisher=Christies|accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and depicts two figures: one swimming underwater and one clothed male figure looking down at the swimmer. In November 2018, it sold for US$90.3&amp;nbsp;million, the highest price ever paid at auction for a work by a living artist.

== Background ==
Hockney visited [[California]] for the first time in January 1964 after a successful first solo exhibition at the [[John Kasmin]] gallery.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The United States fascinated him, and Los Angeles in particular, partly because of the influence of Hollywood cinema but also because of the modernist building [[Bailey House – Case Study House|Case Study House #21]]. As a gay man, he was also a fan of the [[beefcake magazine]] ''Physique Pictorial'', which was published in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Christiesbio"/&gt; "I instinctively knew I was going to like it," Hockney said, "and as I flew over San Bernardino and saw the swimming pools and the houses and everything and the sun, I was more thrilled than I have ever been in arriving in any city."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170210-the-bewitching-allure-of-hockneys-swimming-pools|publisher=BBC|title=The bewitching allure of Hockney's swimming pools|accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hockney painted the first of his pool paintings ''California Art Collector'' in 1964, and the swimming pool became a recurring theme in his paintings, such as ''[[Peter Getting Out of Nick's Pool]]'' (1966, [[Walker Art Gallery]], [[Liverpool]]) and most notably ''[[A Bigger Splash]]'' (1967, [[Tate Gallery]]).&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;  He painted a series of double portraits from 1968 to 1977, including ''[[American Collectors (Fred and Marcia Weisman)]]'' (1968, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]), and ''[[Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy]]'' (1971, Tate Gallery).

== Composition ==
This work brings together two of Hockney's themes from his paintings of the late 1960s and early 1970s: the swimming pool, and the double portrait.  It depicts a male figure in white trunks swimming [[breaststroke]] underwater, and the painter [[Peter Schlesinger]], Hockney's former lover and muse, fully clothed and standing at the edge of the pool looking down at the swimmer.&lt;ref name="Apollo"/&gt; The painting is set in southern France, near [[Saint-Tropez]].&lt;ref name="Apollo"/&gt; In characteristic Hockney style, the foreground is simplified and flattened with a view of tree-clad hills in the background.

The composition was inspired by a serendipitous combination of photographs that Hockney noticed on his studio floor: one of a man swimming underwater, taken in California in 1966, and the other of a man standing looking at the ground.  Juxtaposed, it appeared as if the standing person was looking at the swimmer.&lt;ref name="Hockney1972"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thedavidhockneyfoundation.org/chronology/1972|title=1972|publisher=David Hockney Foundation|accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hockney's relationship with Schlesinger had ended abruptly in 1971, following a fight in [[Cadaqués]].  "By showing another young man swimming towards Peter, the artist acknowledges lost love and his boyfriend’s desire for a new partner".&lt;ref&gt;M. Livingstone and K. Haymer, ''Hockney's People'', London, 2003, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting can be viewed as fitting into a European tradition since the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] of depicting the nude bathing, washing off the stain of pollution amid the peace of nature.&lt;ref name=Christies-auction/&gt;

Hockney worked on the painting for four months in late 1971, but dissatisfied with the composition, in particular with the angle of the pool, abandoned the work and started afresh.&lt;ref name="Hockney1972"/&gt; He then travelled for several months with Mark Lancaster, and returned to the work in early 1972. The year 1972 was a very productive year for Hockney, as he threw himself into his work to escape from his unhappiness, often working 14 or 15 hours a day.  Around the same time, he was working on his (unfinished) double portrait of ''George Lawson and Wayne Sleep'' (1972-5, Tate).

In April 1972, Hockney flew to the south of France to better visualise the figure swimming underwater, using the pool at film director [[Tony Richardson]]'s villa at Le Nid du Duc near Saint-Tropez to do so. Hockney's studio assistant, Mo McDermott, recreated the pose of the downcast man, while a young photographer, John St Clair, was the swimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gerryco23.wordpress.com/tag/painting/page/6/?iframe=true&amp;preview=true/feed/ |title=David Hockney: Early Reflections at the Walker |website=That's How The Light Gets In |publisher=gerryco23.wordpress.com |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hockney took hundreds of photographs based on his original composition.&lt;ref name="Christiesbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/features/David-Hockney-Portrait-of-an-Artist-Pool-with-Two-Figures-9372-3.aspx|title=Hockney's Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)|publisher=Christies|accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Back at his London studio, Hockney assembled the photos along with photographs of Peter Schlesinger taken in [[Kensington Gardens]] wearing the same pink jacket.&lt;ref name="Christiesbio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/cultural-capital/2012/01/hazan-film-hockney-splash|title=Gilbey on Film:The truth about David Hockney|work=New Statesman|accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hockney worked on the painting for two weeks, working 18-hour days, completing and varnishing it only the night before it was due to be shipped to New York for the exhibition at [[André Emmerich]] Gallery.&lt;ref name="Christiesbio"/&gt; It was first shown in the exhibition ''Paintings and Drawings'', which ran from 13 to 31 May 1972.&lt;ref name="Hockney1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-46232870|title=Hockney painting sells for record $90m|date=16 November 2018|accessdate=16 November 2018|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hockney said of the painting, "I must admit I loved working on that picture, [...] working with such intensity; it was marvellous doing it, really thrilling"&lt;ref name="Christiesbio"/&gt;

The creation of the painting and the breakdown of Hockney's relationship with Schlesinger were featured in the semi-fictional 1974 documentary ''[[A Bigger Splash (1974 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'', named after the 1967 Hockney painting.&lt;ref name=Apollo&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apollo-magazine.com/david-hockney-pool-paintings/|title=The Pull of Hockney's Pool Paintings|work=Apollo|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Printmaking''' is the process of making [[work of art|artwork]]s by [[printing]], normally on [[paper]]. Printmaking normally covers only the process of creating prints that have an element of originality, rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painting.  Except in the case of [[monotyping]], the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a '''print'''&lt;!--
-- cite need for bold-- term redirected to this article so need to
-- emphasise "Print" term, as redirected here from disambig page.
--
--&gt;. Each print produced is not considered a "copy" but rather is considered an "original". This is because typically each print varies to an extent due to variables intrinsic to the printmaking process, and also because the imagery of a print is typically not simply a reproduction of another work but rather is often a unique image designed from the start to be expressed in a particular printmaking technique. A print may be known as an '''impression'''&lt;!--
-- also a disabig/rediret target term
--
--&gt;. Printmaking (other than monotyping) is not chosen only for its ability to produce multiple impressions, but rather for the unique qualities that each of the printmaking processes lends itself to.

Prints are created by transferring ink from a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] or through a prepared screen to a sheet of paper or other material. Common types of matrices include: metal plates, usually copper or zinc, or polymer plates for [[engraving]] or [[etching]]; stone, aluminum, or polymer for [[lithography]]; blocks of wood for [[woodcut]]s and [[wood engraving]]s; and linoleum for [[linocut]]s. Screens made of silk or synthetic fabrics are used for the [[screen-printing|screenprinting]] process. Other types of matrix substrates and related processes are discussed below.

Multiple impressions printed from the same matrix form an [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]. Since the late 19th century, artists have generally signed individual impressions from an edition and often number the impressions to form a limited edition; the matrix is then destroyed so that no more prints can be produced. Prints may also be printed in book form, such as illustrated books or [[artist's book]]s.

=== Overview===
Printmaking techniques are generally divided into the following basic categories:
* [[relief print|Relief]], where ink is applied to the original surface of the matrix. Relief techniques include [[woodcut]] or [[woodblock printing|woodblock]] as the Asian forms are usually known, [[wood engraving]], [[linocut]] and [[metalcut]].
* [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]], where ink is applied beneath the original surface of the matrix. Intaglio techniques include [[engraving]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[aquatint]].
* [[Planographic]], where the matrix retains its original surface, but is specially prepared and/or inked to allow for the transfer of the image. Planographic techniques include [[lithography]], [[monotyping]], and digital techniques.
* [[Stencil]], where ink or paint is pressed through a prepared screen, including [[screen-printing|screenprinting]] and [[pochoir]].

Other types of printmaking techniques outside these groups include [[collagraph]]y and [[viscosity printing]]. Collagraphy is a printmaking technique in which textured material is adhered to the printing matrix. This texture is transferred to the paper during the printing process. [[Printing#Modern printing technology|Contemporary printmaking]] may include [[digital printing]], photographic mediums, or a combination of digital, photographic, and traditional processes.

Many of these techniques can also be combined, especially within the same family. For example, Rembrandt's prints are usually referred to as "etchings" for convenience, but very often include work in engraving and [[drypoint]] as well, and sometimes have no etching at all.

=== Woodcut ===
&lt;div style="width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;"&gt;Artists using this technique include
[[Albrecht Dürer]],
[[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]],
[[Dulah Marie Evans]],
[[Hiroshige]],
[[Hokusai]],
[[Gustave Baumann]], 
[[Hannah Tompkins (artist)|Hannah Tompkins]], 
[[Hussein El Gebaly]],
[[Carlos Alvarado Lang]]
&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|woodcut}}
[[File:Vallotton-Raison.gif|thumb|[[Félix Vallotton]], ''La raison probante (The Cogent Reason)'', [[woodcut]] from the series ''Intimités'', (1898)]]
[[File:Kirchner - Bildnis Otto Mueller.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], ''Portrait of [[Otto Mueller|Otto Müller]]'', 1915]]

Woodcut, a type of [[relief print]], is the earliest printmaking technique, and the only one traditionally used in the Far East. It was probably first developed as a means of printing patterns on cloth, and by the 5th century was used in China for printing text and images on paper. Woodcuts of images on paper developed around 1400 in Japan, and slightly later in Europe. These are the two areas where woodcut has been most extensively used purely as a process for making images without text.
[[File:Some woodcutts of Stanislaw Raczynski.jpg|thumb|''Woodcuts of Stanislaw Raczynski (1903&amp;ndash;1982)'']]
The [[artist]] draws a design on a plank of [[wood]], or on paper which is transferred to the wood. Traditionally the artist then handed the work to a specialist cutter, who then uses sharp tools to carve away the parts of the block that will not receive ink. The surface of the block is then inked with the use of a [[brayer]], and then a sheet of [[paper]], perhaps slightly damp, is placed over the block. The block is then rubbed with a [[Baren (printing tool)|baren]] or [[spoon]], or is run through a [[printing press]]. If in color, separate blocks can be used for each [[color]], or a technique called reduction printing can be used.

Reduction printing is a name used to describe the process of using one block to print several layers of color on one print. This usually involves cutting a small amount of the block away, and then printing the block many times over on different sheets before washing the block, cutting more away and printing the next color on top. This allows the previous color to show through. This process can be repeated many times over. The advantages of this process is that only one block is needed, and that different components of an intricate design will line up perfectly. The disadvantage is that once the artist moves on to the next layer, no more prints can be made.

Another variation of woodcut printmaking is the cukil technique, made famous by the [[Taring Padi]] underground community in Java, Indonesia. Taring Padi Posters usually resemble intricately printed cartoon posters embedded with political messages. Images—usually resembling a visually complex scenario—are carved unto a wooden surface called cukilan, then smothered with printer's ink before pressing it unto media such as paper or canvas.

=== Engraving ===
{{main|Engraving}}
[[File:Melencolia I (Durero).jpg|thumb|upright|left|"[[Melencolia I]]", engraving by [[Albrecht Dürer]], one of the most important printmakers.]]
The process was developed in Germany in the 1430s from the engraving used by [[goldsmith]]s to decorate metalwork.  Engravers use a hardened steel tool called a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] to cut the design into the surface of a metal plate, traditionally made of copper. Engraving using a burin is generally a difficult skill to learn.

Gravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. Other tools such as mezzotint rockers, roulettes (a tool with a fine-toothed wheel) and burnishers (a tool used for making an object smooth or shiny by rubbing) are used for texturing effects.

To make a print, the engraved plate is inked all over, then the ink is wiped off the surface, leaving only ink in the engraved lines. The plate is then put through a high-pressure printing press together with a sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it). The paper picks up the ink from the engraved lines, making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the printing plate shows much sign of wear, except when [[drypoint]], which gives much shallower lines, is used.

In the 20th century, true engraving was revived as a serious art form by artists including [[Stanley William Hayter]] whose Studio 17 in Paris and New York City became the magnet for such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Mauricio Lasansky]] and [[Joan Miró]].

[[file:The frogs who wanted a king by Wenceslaus Hollar. The Hollar Collection, Toronto.jpg|thumb|''Of the Frogs Desiring a King'' (1665), from ''The Fables of Aesop paraphras’d in verse'' of [[John Ogilby]], etching by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]].]]

=== Etching ===
&lt;div style="width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;"&gt;Artists using this technique include [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], [[Francisco Goya]], [[Wenceslaus Hollar]], [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]], [[Otto Dix]], [[James Ensor]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Käthe Kollwitz]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Lucas van Leyden]], [[Carlos Alvarado Lang]].&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Etching}}
'''Etching''' is part of the [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] family (along with [[engraving]], [[drypoint]], [[mezzotint]], and [[aquatint]].) Although the first dated etching is by [[Albrecht Dürer]] in 1515, the process is believed to have been invented by [[Daniel Hopfer]] (circa 1470-1536) of Augsburg, Germany, who decorated armor in this way, and applied the method to printmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Brian D. [http://artinprint.org/article/freedom-and-resistance-in-the-act-of-engraving-or-why-durer-gave-up-on-etching/ "Freedom and Resistance in the Act of Engraving (or, Why Dürer Gave up on Etching),"] &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt; Vol. 7 No. 3 (September-October 2017), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Etching soon came to challenge engraving as the most popular printmaking medium. Its great advantage was that, unlike engraving which requires special skill in metalworking, etching is relatively easy to learn for an artist trained in drawing.

Etching prints are generally linear and often contain fine detail and contours. [[Line art|Lines]] can vary from smooth to sketchy. An etching is opposite of a woodcut in that the raised portions of an etching remain blank while the crevices hold ink. In pure etching, a metal (usually copper, zinc or steel) plate is covered with a waxy or acrylic ground. The artist then draws through the ground with a pointed etching needle. The exposed metal lines are then etched by dipping the plate in a bath of etchant (e.g. [[nitric acid]] or [[ferric chloride]]). The etchant "bites" into the exposed metal, leaving behind lines in the plate. The remaining ground is then cleaned off the plate, and the printing process is then just the same as for engraving.

=== Mezzotint ===
{{main|Mezzotint}}
An [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] variant of engraving in which the image is formed from subtle gradations of light and shade. Mezzotint—from the Italian mezzo ("half") and tinta ("tone")—is a "dark manner" form of printmaking, which requires artists to work from dark to light. To create a mezzotint, the surface of a copper printing plate is roughened evenly all over with the aid of a tool known as a rocker; the image is then formed by smoothing the surface with a tool known as a burnisher. When inked, the roughened areas of the plate will hold more ink and print more darkly, while smoother areas of the plate hold less or no ink, and will print more lightly or not at all. It is, however, possible to create the image by only roughening the plate selectively, so working from light to dark.

Mezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colors to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the texture with burin, burnisher and scraper allows fine gradations in tone to be developed.

The mezzotint printmaking method was invented by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] (1609–1680). The process was used widely in England from the mid-eighteenth century, to reproduce oil paintings and portraits.

=== Aquatint ===
[[File:Goya-Capricho-43.jpg|thumb|upright|"The sleep of Reason creates monsters", etching and aquatint by [[Francisco Goya]]]]
{{main|Aquatint}}
A technique used in [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] etchings. Like etching, aquatint technique involves the application of acid to make marks in a metal plate. Where the etching technique uses a needle to make lines that retain ink, aquatint relies on powdered [[rosin]] which is acid resistant in the ground to create a tonal effect. The rosin is applied in a light dusting by a fan booth, the rosin is then cooked until set on the plate. At this time the rosin can be burnished or scratched out to affect its tonal qualities. The tonal variation is controlled by the level of acid exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.

Goya used aquatint for most of his prints.

=== Drypoint===
{{main|Drypoint}}
[[File:Rembrandt The Three Crosses 1653.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Three Crosses]]'', [[drypoint]] by [[Rembrandt]]]]
A variant of engraving, done with a sharp point, rather than a v-shaped [[Burin (engraving)|burin]]. While engraved lines are very smooth and hard-edged, drypoint scratching leaves a rough burr at the edges of each line. This burr gives drypoint prints a characteristically soft, and sometimes blurry, line quality. Because the pressure of printing quickly destroys the burr, drypoint is useful only for very small editions; as few as ten or twenty impressions. To counter this, and allow for longer print runs, electro-plating (here called steelfacing) has been used since the nineteenth century to harden the surface of a plate.

The technique appears to have been invented by the [[Housebook Master]], a south German fifteenth-century artist, all of whose prints are in drypoint only. Among the most famous artists of the old master print: Albrecht Dürer produced three drypoints before abandoning the technique; Rembrandt used it frequently, but usually in conjunction with etching and engraving.

{{main|Lithography}}
[[File:Toulouse-Lautrec - Moulin Rouge - La Goulue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[La Goulue]]'', Lithograph poster by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]].]]
[[Lithography]] is a technique invented in 1798 by [[Alois Senefelder]] and based on the [[Cohesion (chemistry)|chemical repulsion]] of [[oil]] and [[water]].
A porous surface, normally [[limestone]], is used; the image is drawn on the limestone with a greasy medium.
Acid is applied, transferring the grease to the limestone, leaving the image 'burned' into the surface. [[Gum arabic]], a water-soluble substance, is then applied, sealing the surface of the stone not covered with the drawing medium.
The stone is wetted, with water staying only on the surface not covered in grease-based residue of the drawing; the stone is then 'rolled up', meaning oil ink is applied with a roller covering the entire surface; since water repels the oil in the ink, the ink adheres only to the greasy parts, perfectly inking the image.
A sheet of dry paper is placed on the surface, and the image is transferred to the paper by the pressure of the printing press. Lithography is known for its ability to capture fine gradations in shading and very small detail.

A variant is [[photo-lithography]], in which the image is captured by photographic processes on metal plates; printing is carried out in the same way.

&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Screenprinting}}
[[Screen-printing|Screenprinting]] (occasionally known as "silkscreen", or "serigraphy") creates prints by using a fabric stencil technique; ink is simply pushed through the stencil against the surface of the paper, most often with the aid of a squeegee. Generally, the technique uses a natural or synthetic 'mesh' fabric stretched tightly across a rectangular 'frame,' much like a stretched canvas. The fabric can be silk, nylon monofilament, multifilament polyester, or even stainless steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://awt-gpi.com/product148.htm |title=Screen Fabric |website=A.W.T. World Trade Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While commercial screenprinting often requires high-tech, mechanical apparatuses and calibrated materials, printmakers value it for the "Do It Yourself" approach, and the low technical requirements, high quality results. The essential tools required are a squeegee, a mesh fabric, a frame, and a stencil. Unlike many other printmaking processes, a printing press is not required, as screenprinting is essentially stencil printing.

Screenprinting may be adapted to printing on a variety of materials, from paper, cloth, and canvas to rubber, glass, and metal. Artists have used the technique to print on bottles, on slabs of granite, directly onto walls, and to reproduce images on textiles which would distort under pressure from printing presses.

=== Monotype ===
[[File:Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione - The Creation of Adam - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Monotype]] by the technique's inventor, [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], ''The Creation of Adam'', c 1642]]
{{main|Monotyping}}
Monotyping is a type of printmaking made by drawing or painting on a smooth, non-absorbent surface. The surface, or matrix, was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to acrylic glass. The image is then transferred onto a sheet of paper by pressing the two together, usually using a printing-press. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using brushes or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of opaque color. The inks used may be oil based or water based. With oil based inks, the paper may be dry, in which case the image has more contrast, or the paper may be damp, in which case the image has a 10 percent greater range of tones.

Unlike [[monoprinting]], monotyping produces a unique print, or monotype, because most of the ink is removed during the initial pressing. Although subsequent reprintings are sometimes possible, they differ greatly from the first print and are generally considered inferior. A second print from the original plate is called a "ghost print" or "cognate". Stencils, watercolor, solvents, brushes, and other tools are often used to embellish a monotype print. Monotypes are often spontaneously executed and with no preliminary sketch.

Monotypes are the most painterly method among the printmaking techniques, a unique print that is essentially a printed painting. The principal characteristic of this medium is found in its spontaneity and its combination of printmaking, painting, and drawing media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonprintmakers.com/resources/techniques/monoprint Washington printmakers' gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228183408/http://washingtonprintmakers.com/resources/techniques/monoprint |date=2010-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monoprint ===
{{main|Monoprinting}}
Monoprinting is a form of printmaking that uses a matrix such as a woodblock, litho stone, or copper plate, but produces impressions that are unique. Multiple unique impressions printed from a single matrix are sometimes known as a variable edition. There are many techniques used in monoprinting, including [[collagraph]], [[collage]], hand-painted additions, and a form of tracing by which thick ink is laid down on a table, paper is placed on the ink, and the back of the paper is drawn on, transferring the ink to the paper. Monoprints can also be made by altering the type, color, and viscosity of the ink used to create different prints. Traditional printmaking techniques, such as lithography, woodcut, and intaglio, can be used to make monoprints.

=== Mixed-media prints ===
Mixed-media prints may use multiple traditional printmaking processes such as etching, woodcut, letterpress, silkscreen, or even monoprinting in the creation of the print. They may also incorporate elements of chine colle, collage, or painted areas, and may be unique, i.e. one-off, non-editioned, prints. Mixed-media prints are often experimental prints and may be printed on unusual, non-traditional surfaces.

=== Digital prints ===
&lt;div style="width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;"&gt;Artists using this technique include
[[Istvan Horkay]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Enrique Chagoya]]
&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Digital printing}}
Digital prints refers to images printed using digital printers such as [[Inkjet printing|inkjet printers]] instead of a traditional printing press. Images can be printed to a variety of substrates including paper, cloth, or plastic canvas. 

====Dye-based inks====
Dye-based inks are [[organic compound|organic]] (not [[mineral]]) dissolved and mixed into a liquid. Although most are synthetic, derived from [[petroleum]], they can be made from vegetable or animal sources. Dyes are well suited for textiles where the liquid dye penetrates and chemically bonds to the fiber. Because of the deep penetration, more layers of material must lose their color before the fading is apparent. Dyes, however, are not suitable for the relatively thin layers of ink laid out on the surface of a print.

====Pigment-based inks====
Pigment is a finely ground, particulate substance which, when mixed or ground into a liquid to make ink or paint, does not dissolve, but remains dispersed or suspended in the liquid. Pigments are categorized as either [[inorganic]] (mineral) or organic (synthetic).&lt;ref name="MagnoliaFAQ"&gt;[http://www.magnoliaeditions.com/pages/FAQs.htm Printmaking FAQ at Magnolia Editions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413021716/http://magnoliaeditions.com/pages/FAQs.htm |date=2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pigment-based inks have a much longer permanence than dye-based inks.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Carden, Digital Textile Printing, Bloomsbury Publishing - 2015, page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

====Giclée====
[[Giclée]] (pron.: /ʒiːˈkleɪ/ zhee-KLAY or /dʒiːˈkleɪ/), is a neologism coined in 1991 by printmaker Jack Duganne &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harald. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dq3Xj8zEYMIC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=giclee+prints+produced+on+epson#PPA11,M1 ''Mastering Digital Printing'', p.11] at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; for digital prints made on inkjet printers. Originally associated with early dye-based printers it is now more often refers to pigment-based prints.&lt;ref&gt;Luong, Q.-Tuan. [http://www.largeformatphotography.info/digital-printing.html An overview of large format color digital printing] at largeformatphotography.info&lt;/ref&gt; The word is based on the French word gicleur, which means "nozzle". Today fine art prints produced on large format ink-jet machines using the [[CcMmYK color model]] are generally called "Giclée".

=== Foil imaging ===
In art, '''foil imaging''' is a printmaking technique made using the Iowa Foil Printer, developed by [[Virginia A. Myers]] from the commercial [[foil stamping]] process. This uses gold leaf and acrylic [[Foil (chemistry)|foil]] in the printmaking process.

== Color ==
[[File:Mishima Asa-Giri-東海道五十三次之内 三島 朝霧-Morning Mist MET DP123235.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Morning Mist'']]
Printmakers apply color to their prints in many different ways. Some coloring techniques include positive surface roll, negative surface roll, and [[A la poupée]]. Often color in printmaking that involves etching, [[screenprinting]], woodcut, or [[linocut]] is applied by either using separate plates, blocks or screens or by using a reductionist approach. In multiple plate color techniques, a number of plates, screens or blocks are produced, each providing a different color. Each separate plate, screen, or block will be inked up in a different color and applied in a particular sequence to produce the entire picture. On average about three to four plates are produced, but there are occasions where a printmaker may use up to seven plates. Every application of another plate of color will interact with the color already applied to the paper, and this must be kept in mind when producing the separation of colors. The lightest colors are often applied first, and then darker colors successively until the darkest.

The reductionist approach to producing color is to start with a lino or wood block that is either blank or with a simple etching. Upon each printing of color the printmaker will then further cut into the lino or woodblock removing more material and then apply another color and reprint. Each successive removal of lino or wood from the block will expose the already printed color to the viewer of the print. Picasso is often cited as the inventor of reduction printmaking, although there is evidence of this method in use 25 years before Picasso's linocuts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/catalogues/bibliography/136140/bunbury-alisa-not-picassos-invention--a-foray-into.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[subtractive color]] concept is also used in [[offset printing|offset]] or [[digital print]] and is present in bitmap or vectorial software in [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] or other color spaces.

== Registration ==
In printmaking processes requiring more than one application of ink or other medium, the problem exists as to how to line up properly areas of an image to receive ink in each application. The most obvious example of this would be a multi-color image in which each color is applied in a separate step. The lining up of the results of each step in a multistep printmaking process is called "registration." Proper registration results in the various components of an image being in their proper place. But, for artistic reasons, improper registration is not necessarily the ruination of an image.

This can vary considerably from process to process. It generally involves placing the substrate, generally paper, in correct alignment with the printmaking element that will be supplying it with coloration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nontoxicprint.com/perfectregistration.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protective printmaking equipment ==
Protective clothing is very important for printmakers who engage in etching and lithography (closed toed shoes and long pants). Whereas in the past printmakers put their plates in and out of acid baths with their bare hands, today printmakers use rubber gloves.  They also wear industrial [[respirator]]s for protection from caustic vapors. Most acid baths are built with ventilation hoods above them.

Protective respirators and masks should have particle filters, particularly for aquatinting. As a part of the aquatinting process, a printmaker is often exposed to [[rosin]] powder.  Rosin is a serious health hazard, especially to printmakers who, in the past, simply used to hold their breath {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} using an aquatinting booth.

'''Radio art''', refers to the use of [[radio]] for [[art]].

The artist who works in radio art is not necessarily a trained DJ, programmer, producer, or engineer, but one who uses sound to make art. The radio [[Art medium|medium]] can be used in ways which are different from what it  was intended for.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://okno.be/?id=964 A contemporary look on radio art] by okno staff.&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, the way the message is transmitted and received by an audience is as important as the message itself. "As an aural art form it reaffirms that it's not just what we say, but the way we say it." &lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://transition.turbulence.org/somewhere/NAR/writings/apple.htm New American Radio and Radio Art]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by [[Jacki Apple]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Victoria Fenner's words, "Radio art is art which is specifically composed for the [[Art medium|medium]] of radio and is uniquely suited to be transmitted via the [[radio wave|airwaves]]." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magneticspirits.com/history.html Radio Art and its History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121221712/http://www.magneticspirits.com/history.html |date=2008-11-21 }} by Victoria Fenner, Canadian sound artist and radio producer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists use [[:Category:Radio technology|radio technology]] (i.e. radio [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]], [[radio wave|airwaves]]...) to communicate artistic compositions for interpretation – exposing their audience to alternate means to experiencing their art through [[sound]] verses visualization. Radio Art contributes to new media art - a digitally driven art movement growing in response to the informative technological revolution we live in. “From the artist's point of view radio is an environment to be entered into and acted upon, a site for various cultural voices to meet, converse, and merge in. These artists cross disciplines, raid all genres and recontextualize them into hybrids.” &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Radio art projects can be collaborative including various professional sources, unifying an [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] broadcast with science, experimentation, geography, entertainment, etc." Some have approached radio as an architectural space to be constructed sonically and linguistically; or as the site of an event, an arena, or stage. Some used it as a gathering place, or a conduit, a means to create community. Other artists have employed the [[Mass media|media]] landscape itself as the narrative, while others looked into the body as the site and the source; the voicebox, the larynx become medium and metaphor." &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Art radio and webradio ==

An art radio is a radio station that would dedicate every second of its transmission time to radio art. Although this kind of project can seem utopian in the traditional state of [[radio]], there are few lasting experiences in the underground or community side such as London's [[ResonanceFM]] which intend to make radio with art and promote the ''art of listening''.

Also, radio had renewed itself through the [[Internet]]. The audio streaming technique had replaced the analogue transmitting system and artists can experiment on radio outside the legal constraints of an FM license for example. 
Among the webradios which are dedicated to radio art, some broadcast pieces like traditional [[radios]]. Some others directly experiment with the [[Art medium|medium]] in the more concrete sense.

'''Randy Souders''' is an American [[artist]] and a [[disability rights]] advocate.

==Early life and influences==
Souders was born in [[Chickasha, Oklahoma]]. Hoping to become an illustrator he attended [[Trimble Technical High School]] in [[Fort Worth]] where he received daily instruction in [[commercial art]]. At age 14, his parents also enrolled him in a home study correspondence course offered by [[Art Instruction Schools]] which was founded in 1914 and well known for its "Draw Me" art introductory tests. He attended the [[University of Texas at Arlington]] where he received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in [[graphic design]].&lt;ref name=Enabled&gt;{{cite book|last=Landry|first=Keith|title=Enabled in Words: The Real Lives, Real Victories of People with Disabilities|year=2005|publisher=Enabled Media Group, Inc|location=U.S.A.|isbn= 0976656019|pages=211–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 1972, three months before his 18th birthday, Souders dove into a local lake and hit a submerged object. He broke his neck and sustained a paralyzing [[spinal cord injury]] resulting in incomplete [[tetraplegia]]. He adapted and gradually regained enough function to write, paint and live independently. His drawing hand is paralyzed so his artworks are created entirely with wrist and arm movement.&lt;ref name=Chronicles&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy-Smith|first=Jean|title=Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists |year=1993|publisher=Random House|location=New York, NY|isbn=0394570030|pages=147–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Beginning===

Upon graduating college in May 1978, Souders was employed for a short time at a local advertising agency. He had his first one-man show of paintings on November 8, 1978. Based on the success of this first show, he left advertising to concentrate on painting full-time.&lt;ref name=Chronicles/&gt;

Many millions of Texans had a piece of Souders art in their home and or office when Southwestern Bell selected a painting called “County Seat” for the cover of the 1984-1985 phone book in Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hancock |first1=Orville |title=Bell rings success for Tarrent artist | accessdate=September 3, 2018 | url = http://www.newpapers.com |work=Fort Worth Star-Telegram |issue=June 19, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Loydean |first1=Thomas |title=Handicap doesn't slow 'telephone book artist' | accessdate=September 3, 2018 | url = http://www.newpapers.com |work=San Antonio Express-News |date=August 2, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting featured a red stone courthouse typical of many historic Texas courthouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fredrick |first1=Linda |url=https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc983089/m1/?q=randy%20souders#track/1 |website=University of North Texas Libraries Special Collection |publisher=KXAS-TV |title=Phonebook | accessdate=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===
Since 1990 Souders has created artworks for the [[Walt Disney Company]]. Souders' involvement with Disney originally began through his exhibits at the former "Old World Antiques" shop in Liberty Square at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disabled Artist Will Pay A Visit To Disney World|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-03-15/entertainment/9203130085_1_museum-of-art-souders-world-antiques|accessdate=28 January 2012|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=15 March 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ten years he was a featured artist at Disney's "Official [[Disneyana]] Conventions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disneyana Convention 2001 -Mouseplanet.com|url=http://www.mouseplanet.com/merchandise/mer010912a.htm|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2752">'''''Reifendrehen''''' is a unique type of toy manufacture using [[wood turning]] techniques that was developed in the [[Ore Mountains]] in the vicinity of the town of [[Seiffen/Erzgeb.|Seiffen]] and continues there to the present day. The process produces small animals and other figures or even little wooden houses in outline, that are used as toys or to decorate [[Christmas pyramids]] or [[Nativity scene]]s. The animals and figures (''Reifentiere'' and ''Reifenfiguren'') so produced are an inherent part of [[Ore Mountain folk art]].

== Production ==
In the process known as ''Reifendrehen'' (literally "tyre turning") a suitable piece of wood, as far as possible free of splits, is worked on a special [[wood lathe]] to produce a wooden ring with a diameter of about 30 to 50 centimetres, the cross-section of which forms the outline of the desired figure. Small slices are then sawn off the ring. These are used as the raw material from which the finished figures are made by [[carving]] and painting.

The technique of ''Reifendrehen'', which demands great experience and skill, emerged around 1800. It enabled, during the 19th century, the efficient mass production of wooden figures, because it was faster and cheaper than pure woodcarving by hand. Today part of the exhibition at the [[Ore Mountain Toy Museum, Seiffen|Ore Mountain Toy Museum in Seiffen]] is dedicated to the craft of the turners - the ''Reifendreher'' - who make these toys. In addition, there are several visitor workshops in the region around Seiffen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17880">'''Richmond Artists Association (RAA)''' (1955-2005) was a twentieth-century incorporated organization of artists active in Virginia well into the 21st century. Organizational plans began in 1955, and RAA was founded and started building up its membership during 1955-1965, securing its first certificate of incorporation in 1956. Artist/lawyer Westwood Winfree was the first president. RAA was allied with the Richmond Federated Arts Council, Arts Council of Richmond,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts Council of Richmond|url=http://www.richmondarts.org/|website=www.richmondarts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists Equity Association, and the [[Southern Arts Federation|Southern Arts Association]]. The group brought to Richmond the show ''Three Modern Painters: Hartley, Feininger, Beckmann'', featuring the art of [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Lyonel Feininger]], and [[Max Beckmann]] in January 6–27, 1957 and ''[[Max Ernst]] Works on Paper'' in 1968. The RAA remained active until 2005 when some of the membership merged with another art organization to form the Richmond Metropolitan Artists Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Richmond Artists Association|url=http://www.metrorichmondart.com/|website=www.metrorichmondart.com|accessdate=27 May 2016|quote=Looking for ways to display their artworks and introduce Richmond to contemporary fine art, a group of full time art instructors and other professional artists from Richmond Professional Institute (now Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts) started the area's very first art organization. . . . The Richmond Artists Association has been a leader in encouraging and showcasing all types of art throughout the community. In the fall of 2005, members of the Richmond Artists Association and the Metropolitan Artists Association met and decided to join together to form the Metropolitan Richmond Artists Association.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officers and Members of RAA==
[[Theresa Pollak]], a teacher and founder of the art departments at both the [[University of Richmond]] and [[Richmond Professional Institute]] (also known as RPI, an extension of the [[College of William and Mary]] which became the [[Virginia Commonwealth University|Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts]]) was Vice President of the Richmond Artists' Association from 1958-1959. In 1978, she became a lifetime Honorary Member and frequent exhibitor in the group's juried shows.&lt;ref&gt;https://gallery.library.vcu.edu/exhibits/show/remembering-theresa-pollak/about-theresa-pollak/later-years&lt;/ref&gt; Other presidents of RAA after Westwood Winfree were Barbara Kennedy (1963-1964), Thomas Gay, Jr. (1964-1965),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas B.

==Exhibitions==

In 1963 the Petersburg Area Art League featured Richmond Artists' Association  member Helen S. Hull in one of their exhibitions, and she presented a critique session for the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Portrait Artist to Give Critique|publisher=The Progress-Index|date=September 24, 1963|location=Petersburg, Virginia|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAA members were frequent exhibitors in the juried and curated shows of  the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[Women's Caucus for Art]], and local galleries such as Schindler Gallery, Scott-McKennis Gallery, [[Artspace in Richmond, Virginia|Artspace]], 1708, Uptown, Shockoe Bottom Arts Center, and [[Art6]].

In 1992 Baylor Nichols presented a show at [[Artspace in Richmond, Virginia|Artspace Gallery]] on Broad Street in Richmond, a gallery founded in [[Shockoe Slip]] by members also affiliated with RAA. The Richmond Artists' Association was one of the sponsors of the national book art show ''Art ex Libris'' shown at [[Artspace in Richmond, Virginia|Artspace]], and several member artists contributed art to the exhibition.

A favorite public exhibition site for RAA was the Gellman Room gallery space at the [[Richmond Public Library (United States)|Richmond Public Library]], presenting juried member shows and receptions there from 1977-1983. It was usual to invite a well-known artist, often artists-in-residence or visiting artists from the [[University of Richmond]] or [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] to act as juror and to give in the library's auditorium a follow-up lecture/critique about their choices. Exhibitions by RAA members began in 2004 in a hall leading to the chambers of U.S. District [[D. Dortch Warriner|Judge D.

The '''Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments''' or '''Roerich Pact''' is an inter-American [[treaty]]. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the [[legal recognition]] that the defense of [[cultural objects]] is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military [[defense (military)|purposes]], and the protection of culture always has precedence over any [[military necessity]].

[[File:N Roerich.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Nicholas Roerich]].]]

Russian painter and philosopher [[Nicholas Roerich]] (1874–1947)&lt;ref&gt;[[Leslie Brenner]], "Nicholas Roerich. Idealist and Visionary", ''[[Foreign Affairs Journal]]'', April 1990&lt;/ref&gt; initiated the modern movement for the defense of cultural objects, for the idea of "Peace of Civilizations". Besides the recognition as one of the greatest Russian painters, Roerich's most notable achievement during his lifetime was the Roerich Pact signed on 15 April 1935 by the representatives of [[International Conference of American States|American states]] in the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]] (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Stoumatoff, ''FDR's Unfinished Portrait: A Memoir'', University of Pittsburgh Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8229-3659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas Roerich was born on 9 October 9, 1874, in [[St. Petersburg]]. His parents encouraged him to study law, but seeing their son's inclination for painting, they allowed him to study both, which he did with much success. In 1900, Roerich went to [[Paris]] to take lessons from [[Fernand Cormon]], the well known tutor of [[Van Gogh]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]]. Upon his return to St. Petersburg, he married [[Helena Roerich|Helena Shaposhnikova]], who later developed the [[Agni Yoga]] philosophy. Soon Roerich became quite a successful painter. One of his paintings was purchased by Russian [[Tsar Nicolas II]] himself. Roerich also worked as stage and costume designer for several operas and ballets by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], premiered in St. Petersburg.

In 1917 Roerich went to live near a lake in [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]], to strengthen his health. After the border between Russia and Finland was closed in 1918 in the context of the [[October Revolution]] and [[Finnish Civil War]], the family travelled across several [[Scandinavia]]n countries to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and eventually left for [[North America]] in 1920. There, Roerich founded two cultural institutions: "[[Cor Ardens]]" (Flaming Heart, a fraternity of artists from several countries) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corardens.com/|title=Scripture Speaks - Savoring the deep meaning of the Word of God which unfolds each year in the liturgy, revealing the fundamental mysteries of our faith.|website=Corardens.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Master Institute of United Arts" (an organization for education, science, and philosophy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php|title=Nicholas Roerich biographical outline|website=Roerich.org|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the [[Roerich Museum]] was founded in New York. In 1929, it moved to a new building. Presently, the Roerich Museum is located in [[Manhattan]], at the corner of 107th Street and Riverside Drive. In 1929, Roerich's work towards the pact was recognised through a nomination for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/redirector/?redir=archive/show.php&amp;id=5885 Nobel Prize Committee archives 1929]&lt;/ref&gt;.


After leaving America, the Roerichs settled at Naggar in the [[Kullu Valley]] from which their estate looked towards the [[Himalayas]]. Here they established the [[Urusvati Institute]] which remains in Naggar with an exhibition about the pact. Nicholas Roerich died of a cardiac arrest on 13 December 1947.

== Origins of the Roerich Pact ==
An idea about the protection of [[cultural monuments]] was formulated for the first time by N.K. Roerich in 1899. During his excavations at [[Saint Petersburg Governorate|Saint-Petersburg province]], Roerich began to point to the necessity of protection of cultural monuments, which reproduce a world-view of ancient people for us.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 1903, Roerich together with his wife Helena Ivanovna Roerich toured through forty ancient Russian cities, including [[Yaroslavl]], [[Kostroma]], [[Kazan]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Suzdal]], [[Yuryev-Polsky (town)|Yuriev-Polsky]], [[Smolensk]], [[Vilnius]], [[Izborsk]] and [[Pskov]]. In 1904, proceeding the expedition, N.K.Roerich has visited [[Uglich]], [[Kalyazin]], [[Kashin (town)|Kashin]] and [[Tver]]. During these travels Roerich created a large series of architectural studies, created near 90 paintings of the visited sites. Later many Russian churches were destroyed and these paintings remain the only documenting images.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Summarizing this trips, the painter admired the beauty of the ancient monuments. Roerich, expressing his feelings for the state of their protection, in his article "Along the old times" (1903): "Last summer I had an occasion to see many our true antique and little love to it".

In 1904, Roerich gave a report to the Emperor's [[Russian Archeological Society|Russian Archeologist Society]] about the sad state of historical monuments and the necessity to take prompt actions to protect them.

During the [[Russian-Japan war]] (1904–1905), Roerich expressed an idea about the necessity of a special treaty for the protection of institutions and cultural monuments.  In the course of several years after his travel in 1903-1904, Roerich repeatedly pointed out the state of antique monuments. He wrote several articles dedicated to the poor state of the churches. In the article "Silent Pogroms" (1911) Roerich wrote about the unskillful restoration of [[St. John the Forerunner Church at Yaroslavl]]: "Who would defense a beautiful antique from mad pogroms? It is grievously when the antique dies. But it is more terrible when the antique remains disfigured, false, imitation...".

In 1914, Roerich appealed to the high command of the [[Imperial Russian army]], as well as the governments of the [[United States]] and [[Third French Republic|France]] with an idea of conclusion of an international agreement aimed on the protection of cultural values during armed conflicts. He created a poster "Enemy of Mankind" denouncing the barbaric destruction of cultural monuments, and picture "Glow" expressing a protest against [[World War I]].

In 1915, Roerich wrote a report for Russian Emperor [[Nicholas II]] and Great Prince [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Nicholas Nikolayevich]] containing an appeal to make real state measures for national protection of cultural values.

In 1929, Roerich, in cooperation with [[Georgi Shklyaver|G.G. Shklyaver]] (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver), a doctor of [[international law]] and political sciences at [[Paris University]] prepared a project of the Pact for protection of cultural values. Simultaneously Roerich proposed a distinctive sign to identify the objects that are in need of protection – the [[Banner of Peace]]. It represents a white cloth with a red circle and three red circles inscribed in it.

== The Roerich Pact ==
In 1929 Roerich in collaboration with [[Paris University]] professor G.G. Shklyaver  (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver) prepared a draft of an international treaty dedicated to protection of cultural values. The scheme was to be a cultural analog to the [[Red Cross]] for medical neutrality.

In 1930, text of draft agreement with accompanying Roerich's appeal to governments and peoples of all countries was published in press and distributed in government, scientific, artistic and educational institutions of the whole world. As a result, the committees supporting the Pact were established in many countries. The draft pact was approved by Committee for Museum affairs at [[League of Nations]] and also by the Committee of the [[Pan-American Union]]. Ultimately, the Pact was signed by 21 states in the Americas and was ratified by ten of them.

In the [[aftermath of World War II]], the Roerich Pact played an important role in forming of international law standards and public activity in the field of protection of cultural heritage. In 1949, at the fourth [[UNESCO]] General Conference, a decision was accepted to begin the work for international law regulation in the field of cultural heritage protection in case of armed conflict.

Ideas of Roerich Pact still are not implemented in the [[international law]], especially its principle of the almost unlimited preference of the preservation of cultural values to the military necessity.

== The Banner of Peace ==
{{main|Banner of Peace}}
[[File:Pax cultura.svg|thumb|100px|right|The Pax Cultura emblem.]]
[[File:Pax-roerix-50.jpg|thumb|200px|right|50 years of the Roerich Pact]]

"''Pax Cultura''" ("Cultural Peace" or "Peace through Culture") is the motto of the cultural artifact protection movement founded by Nicholas Roerich, and is symbolized by a maroon on white emblem consisting of three solid circles in a surrounding circle. On April 15, 1935 the Roerich Pact was signed by the [[United States]] and [[Latin America]]n nations, agreeing that "historic monuments, museums, scientific, artistic, educational and cultural institutions" should be protected both in times of peace and war, and identified by their flying a distinctive flag, the ''Banner of Peace'', bearing the Pax Cultura emblem.

According to the Roerich Museum, "The Banner of Peace symbol has ancient origins. Perhaps its earliest known example appears on Stone Age amulets: three dots, without the enclosing circle. Roerich came across numerous later examples in various parts of the world, and knew that it represented a deep and sophisticated understanding of the triune nature of existence. But for the purposes of the Banner and the Pact, Roerich described the circle as representing the totality of culture, with the three dots being Art, Science, and Religion, three of the most embracing of human cultural activities. He also described the circle as representing the eternity of time, encompassing the past, present, and future. The sacred origins of the symbol, as an illustration of the trinities fundamental to all religions, remain central to the meaning of the Pact and the Banner today."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roerich.org/nr.html?mid=pact ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roerich Pact sign was superseded by the distinctive marking of cultural property as defined by the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention of 1954]]. However, the emblem of the Roerich Pact is still a valid protective sign in the relations between the ten states which are bound by the Pact.

== The Roerich Pact importance for the 21st century ==
The Roerich Pact is not only a relatively short multilateral treaty: it is a conglomerate of legal ideas about a new state order in which the state and the culture closely overlap. A measure of this complexity is the share of state [[budget]] annually spent on culture, art and
education, which in many countries exceeds military expenses.

Important in the framework of ideas of the Roerich Pact is the recognition that the safety of any foreign cultural object on the territory of a foreign state must be also respected and treated as a factor much higher in significance than military willingness to bomb, destroy or use it for military purposes.

Nicholas Roerich managed to continue and develop into a profound and feasible doctrine the famous maxim proclaimed by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], "Beauty will save the World!" Hence starts a very powerful Russian movement in the development of the concept of aesthetical statehood. The concept of the state as a work of art was first suggested in the 19th century by [[Jacob Burckhardt]], who was Swiss historian of art, specializing in Italian [[Renaissance]], and who gave this name to a chapter of one of his books. The concept itself had not been formulated to a completion and was expressed in a general idea that period, as well as their rulers, considered the achievements in culture and art as most important for securing the prestige both of their states and their own, which finally resulted in the unique Italian Renaissance art, literature, philosophy and science. Roerich produced ideas based on the approaches used by Burkhardt and Dostoevsky.

Roerich, considered the care for future generations to be a cornerstone of the existence of the [[rule of law]] and the constitutional state. President of the USA, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the speech upon the signature of the 'Roerich Pact' Treaty said: "In opening this Pact to the adherence of the Nations of the world, we are endeavoring to make of universal application one of the principles vital to the preservation of modern civilization. This Treaty possesses a spiritual significance far deeper than the text of the instrument itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Barenboim P., Sidiqi N. ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75th Anniversary of the Roerich Pact'']. М., Letny Sad; Grid Belgium, 2010. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to realize that the Roerich Pact was only the first step towards the future development of a new legal culture. All written laws must conform to the universal unwritten principles of morality, fairness, and justice, equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect that is known as a higher law theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rule of Law article in the West's Encyclopedia of American Law&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete conceptual provisions of Roerich's philosophical and legal concept of the state are based on the one of [[Rule According to Higher Law]] ideas that the primary duty of the state is to sustain and develop the spiritual unity of its citizens, by carefully preserving the best specimens of national cultural heritage, promoting universal culture and spiritual growth of all people, especially the young ones. At that, the major share of profits received by the state should be directed at the development of culture, which, as it was already mentioned, would lead to a further growth of economical prosperity.

According to Roerich's concept, the state, as an instrument for the preservation and development of culture, the instrument defending both domestic and foreign cultural treasures, the instrument maintaining peace and avoiding wars, the instrument building a new civilization, based on the best cultural traditions of today and, therefore, spending the utmost economically reasonable assets for these purposes — all this can be explicitly and exclusively based on constitutional foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, Op.cit. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis R. Elbinger, "The Unifying Power of Art", in Foreign Service Journal, April 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== World League of Culture and World Day of Culture ==
In the broad sense the Roerich Pact is understood as not only a legal treaty but also as a whole complex of measures for the protection of cultural values suggested by N. Roerich. Consequently, the Roerich Pact has not only legal but also philosophic, enlightening, and evolutional significance since it reflects an idea of cultural protection in its many manifestations.

Characterizing the Roerich Pact, cosmonaut [[Alexey Leonov|A.A. Leonov]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we are raising a culture and spirituality then it will help us to strengthen an economics, to make the policy moral and to stop the military conflicts. This is a significance of the Roerich Pact today. The more time is passed the more actual for the world it becomes. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Developing the Pact ideas N. Roerich has stated the thoughts about a role of community. The laws for culture protection in itself will not work if the community will not display an activity and interest to this. Later this thought was supported by academician [[Dmitry Likhachov|D.S. Likhachev]]. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;… I believe that the best and freely developing social forms of culture can unite creative constructive forces and improve a social life, thereby help the state to maintain high ideals of humanism and peacefulness in the people. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the first international conference of Roerich Pact in Bruges (September, 1931), N. Roerich proposed to create a World League of Culture. One of main aims of the League must be to train care of the nature.

In his article "Pain of the Planet" (1933) N. Roerich wrote: "The call about culture, call about the world, and call about creativity and beauty reaches the ear which is strengthen by true values only. Understanding of life as self-improving for the people's good arises where the respect of the nature is valid. Therefore, the League of Culture together with main enlightener activity must wholesale explain a wise regard for the nature as an origin of merry work, wise joy, continuous cognition and creativity".

The cultural community highly appreciates N. Roerich's thought about the implementation of [[Universal Day of Culture|World Day of Culture]]. N. Roerich wrote:
"… We shall hear about the world Day of Culture too when at all schools and enlightener societies simultaneously the day will dedicated to comprehension of the national and world cultural treasures…"

'''''Saint George and the Dragon''''' is a painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (c. 1605-07), based upon [[Saint George and the Dragon|the motif with the same name]].

It was painted in [[Genoa]] ([[Saint George]] is the patron of this city) while Rubens was in [[Italy]] to complete his artistic training on behalf of his mentor at the time, Otto van Veen. Many scholars speculate the work was originally commissioned for the Church of [[Sant’Ambrogio]], which was dedicated to Saint George. If so, the commissioner never received the masterpiece, due to the artist holding on to his work until he died in 1640, where [[Felipe IV]] procured the piece. It is currently housed in the [[Museo del Prado]] of [[Madrid]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museoprado.mcu.es/idragon.html|title=Saint George and the Dragon|author=|accessdate=2007-09-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012024703/http://museoprado.mcu.es/idragon.html|archivedate=2007-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
 
In the painting the princess represents the church as a whole, and the lamb she is grasping represents the innocence and purity of the church, and Saint George and his steed symbolize the triumph of good over evil as the Saint George stares the beast down from literally “on high”. To reiterate, Saint George’s right foot prominently highlighted above the dragon signifies that the dragon (darkness, devil, evil) is in every way beneath Saint George and the light that envelops him and the princess. In opposition, the dragon’s form, which very much resembles a serpent, rather than the typical lizard, or dinosaur-like depiction of dragons, an allegory to the classic tale of Adam and Eve, where in [[Satan]] takes the form of a serpent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3228">'''The Society for the Arts, Religion, and Contemporary Culture''', or '''ARC''', was founded in October 1961 by three people, Alfred Barr, the art critic and founder of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], and Marvin Halverson an American Protestant theologian sometime of the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] and the author of a 1951 booklet, ''Great Religious Paintings''.&lt;ref&gt;Halverson M., [http://lccn.loc.gov/54004313 ''Great Religious Paintings''], New York, H. N. Abrams, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its aims and program are based on the deep and complex relationship between religion and the arts.  Its first board of directors included these three as well as [[Unitarian Universalist]] theologian and parish minister, [[James Luther Adams]]; mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], principal developer of the merger forming the [[United Church of Christ]], [[Truman B. Douglass]]; Congregationalist parish minister and theologian [[Amos Wilder]], and [[Stanley Romaine Hopper]], theologian and co-founder of the first Theology and Literature program in the United States.

Among the more than 300 Fellows of the Society have been [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Denise Levertov]], [[Sallie McFague]], [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[Marianne Moore]], [[W. H. Auden]], and [[John Updike]].

During the late 1960s most of the individuals involved in the published discourse pertaining to the field of [[theopoetics]] were either fellows or members of SARCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keefe-Perry|first=L. B. C.|title=Christianity and Literature|journal=Christianity and Literature|year=2009|volume=58|issue=4|url=http://theopoetics.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Theopoetics-Process-and-Perspective1.pdf|accessdate=11/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another major focus of the Society has been the role of myth in culture resulting in two publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell (ed.)|first=Joseph|title=Myth, Dreams and Religion|year=1970|publisher=E. P. Dutton &amp; CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently SARCC sponsors public lectures and currently publishes a newsletter, Seedbed. Previously it has published a periodical entitled "ARC Directions."

The archives of SARCC are maintained at the [[Harvard_Divinity_School#Andover-Harvard_Theological_Library|Andover-Harvard Theological Library]]&lt;ref name="Library Holdings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Society for the Arts, Religion, and Contemporary Culture, 1961-2003|url=http://div.hds.harvard.edu/library/bms/bms00555.html|publisher=Andover-Harvard Theological Library|accessdate=26 November 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Tale of Kitty-in-Boots''''' is a British [[children's book]] written by [[Beatrix Potter]] and illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]] published in 2016. The manuscript was discovered by [[Jo Hanks]], a publisher at [[Penguin Random House Children's Books]], in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] archive in 2015.
&lt;ref name="kitty in boots"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beatrix Potter story Kitty-in-Boots discovered after 100 years|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35407846|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=26 January 2016|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter sent the manuscript to her publisher in 1914, and mentioned in letters that she intended to complete it; however, her work was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War I]] and personal events such as her marriage and illness.&lt;ref name="kitty in boots"/&gt;

The story centres around "a well-behaved prime black Kitty cat, who leads rather a double life", and includes characters from other Potter stories, including [[Peter Rabbit]], and [[Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle]].&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lost Beatrix Potter tale 'Kitty-in-Boots' rediscovered - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/26/entertainment/new-beatrix-potter-kitty-in-boots/index.html|website = CNN|access-date = 27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was published on 1 September 2016 ({{ISBN|978-0241247594}}) by [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]], the publisher of Potter's other works, which since 1983 has been an imprint of [[Penguin Group]].&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tale of Kitty-in-Boots|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Tale-Kitty-In-Boots-Beatrix-Potter/dp/0241247594|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frederick Warne|url=http://www.penguin.com/meet/publishers/frederickwarne/|publisher=Penguin Group|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication coincided with the 150th anniversary of Potter's birth.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

'''''The Temples of Paestum''''' is an 1824 painting by [[Antonie Sminck Pitloo]]. It shows two of the temples at [[Paestum]], probably during an excavation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/museo-di-capodimonte/oclc/868314174&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Il Museo di Capodimonte|last=Sapio|first=Maria|last2=|last3=|first3=|date=2012|publisher=Artem|year=|isbn=9788856903034|location=Napoli|pages=|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cir.campania.beniculturali.it/museodicapodimonte/itinerari-tematici/galleria-di-immagini/OA100002|title=Descrizione del dipinto|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was produced the same year as its artist won the landscape category in the competition organised by the Real Istituto di Belle Arti di Napoli. It was first exhibited in 1826 at the Bourbon biennial and is now in Room 58 (part of the former Royal Apartments) of the [[National Museum of Capodimonte]] in Naples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=_UxO8xDIuuwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=9788836525775&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFibC8vpjeAhXrct8KHSreDjcQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pitloo&amp;f=false|title=Museo di Capodimonte|last=Utili|first=Mariella|last2=Spinosa|first2=Nicola|date=2002|publisher=Touring Editore|year=|isbn=9788836525775|location=Milan|pages=239|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tomb effigy''', usually a '''recumbent effigy''' or in French '''''gisant''''' ([[French language|French]], “recumbent”) is a sculpted figure on a [[tomb monument]] depicting in [[effigy]] the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Lucie-Smith|Lucie-Smith, Edward]] (1984), ''The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Art Terms'', [[Thames and Hudson]], pg 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Such compositions, developed in Western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], continuing into Renaissance, and early modern times, and still sometimes used.  They typically represent the deceased in a state of "eternal repose", lying with hands folded in prayer and awaiting resurrection. A husband and wife may be depicted lying side by side. An important official or leader may be shown holding his attributes of office or dressed in the formal attire of his official status or social class.

The life-size recumbent effigy was first found in the tombs of royalty and senior clerics, and then spread to the nobility.  A particular type of late medieval effigy was the ''[[transi]]'', or cadaver tomb, in which the effigy is in the macabre form of a decomposing corpse, or such a figure lies on a lower level, beneath a more conventional effigy.  In the same period small figures of mourners called [[weepers]] or ''pleurants'' were added below the effigy to important tombs.  In the [[Early Modern period]] European effigies are often shown as alive, and either kneeling or in a more active pose, especially for military figures.  During the [[Renaissance]], other non-recumbent types of effigy became more popular. Variations showed the deceased lying on their side as if reading, kneeling in prayer and even standing. The recumbent effigy had something of a vogue during the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] period of the 19th century, especially for bishops and other clerics.  Many graves at [[Cimitero Monumentale di Milano|Monument Cemetery in Milan]] have recumbent figures.

Some of the best-known examples of the form are in [[Westminster Abbey]] in [[London]], Saint Peter's in Rome, [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]] (twenty-five [[Doge]]s), and the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]].

A celebrated poem describing and reflecting on a stone effigy is ''[[An Arundel Tomb]]'' by [[Philip Larkin]].

==History==

===Ancient precursors===
Recumbent effigies were a common tradition in [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] [[funerary art]], examples are known in both [[ceramic]] and stone. The deceased was typically depicted alive as at a feast, lying sideways, propped up on one arm and sometimes holding a cup.  Usually these were rather smaller than life-size.  The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] continued this tradition, though they also created many other types of funerary effigy. Their faces are often clearly portraits of individuals.

===Medieval===
The first medieval gisants emerged in the 12th century. They were executed in low relief, and were horizontal, but appeared as in life. The faces were generalized rather than portraits. Gradually these became full high-relief effigies, usually recumbent, as in death, and, by the 14th century, with hands together in prayer. In general, such monumental effigies were carved in stone, marble or wood, or cast in bronze or brass. Often the stone effigies were painted to simulate life, but in the majority of the medieval monuments, this has long since disappeared. The cross-legged attitude of many English armoured figures of the late 13th or early 14th centuries was long supposed to imply that the deceased had served in the [[Crusades]], had taken crusading vows, or more specifically had been a [[Knights Templar|Knight Templar]]; but these theories are now rejected by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=O. D. |last=Harris |title=Antiquarian attitudes: crossed legs, crusaders and the evolution of an idea |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7884801&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0003581510000053 |journal=Antiquaries Journal |volume=90 |year=2010 |pages=401–40 |doi=10.1017/s0003581510000053}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the early 13th century, effigies began to be raised on tomb-style chests (known as [[tomb chest]]s or [[altar tomb]]s) decorated with foliage, heraldry or architectural detailing. Soon such chests also stood alone with varying degrees of decoration. By the end of the century, these often had architectural canopies and figured "[[weepers]]" or "mourners" — representing friends or relatives and identified by their coats of arms — were popular decorative features.

In Britain the "large-scale production of military effigies" began in the middle of the 13th century, as the result of the "emergence of a new patron class" of knights, who were fewer in number but wealthier than before.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Another late medieval fashion was to show the person in an [[cadaver tomb|advanced state of decomposition]], perhaps as a secondary effigy. This type of tomb is known as a ''transi''.

===Later===
In Spain the iconography of Christ lying (Cristo yacente), as though an effigy, was very popular until the late 18th century. One of the famous sculptures famous for this iconography was [[Gregorio Fernández]], see: [[Cristo Yacente of El Pardo]].

A late example of a stone effigy is that of [[T. E. Lawrence]] ("Lawrence of Arabia") by [[Eric Kennington]], in [[St Martin's Church, Wareham]], [[Dorset]], installed in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Knowles |title=Tale of an 'Arabian knight': the T. E. Lawrence effigy |journal=Church Monuments |volume=6 |year=1991 |pages=67–76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5374">Tornabuoni Art is an [[art gallery]] specializing in [[Italian art]] from the second half of the 20th century. 

== Historic ==
Founded in 1981 in Florence by Roberto Casamonti, Tornabuoni Art is specialised in Italian art of the second half of the 20th Century. It established exhibition spaces in Crans Montana in 1993, Milan in 1995, Forte Dei Marmi in 2004, Paris in 2009 and London in 2015. The ensemble of galleries is today run by his son Michele Casamonti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Michelland|first=Antoine|title=Les Casamonti, chercheurs d’art|publisher=Point de Vue|date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Casamonti family owns the world's largest collection of works by [[Lucio Fontana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barbieri|first=Claudia|title=Postwar Italian Artists Find Their Niche|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/04/arts/04iht-rarttorna04.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tornabuoni Art Paris presents the work of artists such as Fontana, Burri, Castellani, Manzoni, Dorazio, Bonalumi, Dadamaino and Boetti, as well as those of major protagonists of the Italian Novecento, such as De Chirico, Morandi, Balla, Severeni and Sironi.

The gallery also proposes works of essential artists of the 20th Century, such as Picasso, Mirò, Kandinsky, Hartung, Poliakoff, Dubuffet, Lam, Matta, Christo, Wesselmann, Warhol and Basquiat.


'''Paris'''

Since inaugurating its Parisian space in 2009, with an exhibition dedicated to Lucio Fontana, Tornabuoni Art has organized numerous monographic exhibitions, showing the works of Alighiero Boetti (2010), Arnaldo Pomodoro (2011), Enrico Castellani (2011), Mimmo Rotella (2012), Giuseppe Capogrossi (2013), Dadamaino (2013) and in 2014 presented an exceptional exhibition "Lucio Fontana, rediscovery of a masterpiece" in parallel with the retrospective at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, the first exhibition in France of Turi Simeti and most recently retrospectives of Alberto Biasi (2015), Giuseppe Chiari (2015), Paolo Scheggi (2015) and Piero Dorazio (2016).

In February 2017, the gallery inaugurated its new space in the Marais (9, Rue Charlot), with an exhibition dedicated to Alighiero Boetti, and organised the first solo exhibitions in France of Emilio Isgrò and Francesca Pasquali. These solo-shows were followed by an exhibition on avant-garde artists in Post-War Rome "La Dolce Vita", a personal exhibition on the iconic 20th Century Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico, and those of Afro (2018) and Alberto Burri (2018). Each solo show is put together through close collaboration with the artist, or the artist's foundation, and is accompanied by an exhibition catalogue.


These solo shows are accompanied by collective exhibitions, realised in close collaboration with external curators, to whom complete freedom is given. As a result, the exhibitions "Monochrome sous tension" (2011), "Tout feu tout flamme" (2012), "Bianco Italia" (2013), "Entre signe et écriture : parcours dans l’art italien" (2014), "Ceci n'est pas une idée" (2015) and “Roma Pop” (2016) were organised. 



Tornabuoni Art participates in major international art fairs and events such as the FIAC in Paris, TEFAF in Maastricht and New York, Art Basel, Art Basel Miami Beach, Art Basel Hong Kong, Art Genève and Art Monte Carlo, Artefiera in Bologna, Frieze New York, Frieze Masters and Masterpiece in London.

The '''U.S. Commission of Fine Arts''' ('''CFA''') is an [[independent agency]] of the [[federal government of the United States]], and was established in 1910. The CFA has review (but not approval) authority over the "design and aesthetics" of all construction within [[Washington, D.C.]] In accordance with the [[Old Georgetown Act]], the CFA appoints the Old Georgetown Board. The Old Georgetown Board has design review authority over all semipublic and private structures within the boundaries the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown Historic District]]. The CFA was granted approval (not just review) authority by the [[Shipstead-Luce Act]] over the design and height of public and private buildings which front or abut the grounds of the [[United States Capitol]], the grounds of the [[White House]], [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] NW extending from the Capitol to the White House, [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]], [[Rock Creek Park]], the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoological Park]], the [[Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway]], [[West Potomac Park|Potomac Park]], and the [[National Mall]] and its constituent parks.&lt;ref&gt;Gutheim and Lee, p. 208; Kohler, ''The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910–1995'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFA mandate does not apply to the [[United States Capitol]], the [[Library of Congress]], or the other properties and locations overseen by the [[Architect of the Capitol]].

==Formation of the CFA==
President [[George Washington]] granted the government of the District of Columbia the power to regulate architectural design and urban planning. These powers were suspended by President [[James Monroe]] in 1822.&lt;ref name="GrantPlanning"&gt;Grant III, Ulysses S. "Planning the Nation's Capital." ''Records of the Columbia Historical Society.'' 1948/1950, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]] in 1893, the [[Cosmos Club]] and [[American Institute of Architects]] formed the Public Art League, a new organization whose purpose was to lobby for a new agency of the federal government to approve the design or purchase of art and architecture by the federal government. Legislation was proposed in Congress in 1897, but failed to pass because members of Congress wanted an advisory board rather than one which could deny Congress the ability to award commissions as part of the [[spoils system]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, ''The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910–1995'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, the [[United States Congress]] created the [[McMillan Plan|Senate Park Commission]] (also known as the "McMillan Commission" for its chairman, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[James McMillan (politician)|James McMillan]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Michigan|MI]])) to reconcile competing visions for the development of [[Washington, D.C.]] and especially the [[National Mall]] and nearby areas.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, p. 77-91.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission's plan for development of the city, popularly known as the [[McMillan Plan]], proposed the razing of all residences and other buildings on [[President's Park#Lafayette Park|Lafayette Square]] and building tall, [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] government office buildings with facades of white [[marble]] around the square to house executive branch offices.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; It also proposed clearing large spaces north and south of the [[National Mall]], realigning some streets, and constructing major new museums and public buildings along the Mall's length.&lt;ref&gt;Bednar, p. 49-51.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission also proposed significant expansion of the district's park system, the creation of a system of [[parkway]]s, and extensive renovation and beautification of existing parks.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 137-180.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, the President and Congress established several new agencies to supervise the approval, design, and construction of new buildings in the District of Columbia to carry out the McMillan Plan: The Commission of Fine Arts in 1910 to review and advise on the design of new structures, the Public Buildings Commission in 1916 to make recommendations regarding the construction of buildings to house federal agencies and offices, and the [[National Capital Planning Commission|National Capital Parks and Planning Commission]] in 1924 to oversee planning for the District.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine, p. 373-374.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 1909, a committee of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) asked President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to establish an independent federal agency to advise the government on architecture, bridges, painting, parks, sculpture, and other artistic works requiring design. Roosevelt wrote back the same day, agreeing to the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, ''The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910–1995'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 19, 1909, Roosevelt issued [[Executive order|Executive Order]] 1010, establishing a Council of Fine Arts. He requested that the AIA name 30 individuals to the council, and he instructed the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] to seek the council's advice in matters of architecture, building site selection, landscaping, painting, and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, ''The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910–1995'', p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council met only once, on February 9, 1909,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/ncr/designing-capital/sec6.html Kohler, Sue. "The Commission of Fine Arts: Implementing the Senate Park Commission's Vision." Commission on Fine Arts. March 20, 2009.] Accessed 2012-10-13. Charles Moore, CFA chairman from 1912 to 1915, puts the date of the meeting at February 10, 1909, but the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reported on February 10, 1909, that the council had met the previous day..

[[William Howard Taft]] was inaugurated as President in March 1909. Taft revoked Executive Order 1010 on May 21, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Executive Order 1074|"Revoking Executive Order of January 19, 1909, Which Appointed the Council of Fine Arts." Executive Order 1074.]] William Howard Taft. May 21, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Partridge311"&gt;Partridge and Helrich, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler3"&gt;Kohler, ''The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910–1995'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; There are differing explanations for Taft's actions. Historians Sue Kohler and Christopher Thomas state that Taft supported the idea of a fine arts commission, but wanted it to have a basis in legislation.&lt;ref name="Kohler3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; But a contemporary report in the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' noted that the council was highly controversial, and Congress had passed legislation prohibiting the expenditure of funds for any federal body not established by law. The newspaper said the legislation was intended to defund the Council of Fine Arts.&lt;ref&gt;"Art Council No More." ''Washington Post.'' May 27, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1909, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Elihu Root]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[New York (state)|NY]]) drafted legislation establishing an advisory commission of fine arts.&lt;ref name="Partridge311" /&gt; [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Samuel W. McCall]] (R-[[Massachusetts|MA]]) introduced the bill, H.R. 19962, into the [[United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="SerialSet"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GmE3AQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;ots=RvNAGUWWkQ&amp;dq=Samuel%20McCall%20fine%20arts%20commission%20H.R.&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q=Samuel%20McCall%20fine%20arts%20commission%20H.R.&amp;f=false "Commission of Fine Arts." p. 251-253.] Accessed 2012-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The House passed the legislation on February 9, 1910. The House bill made the members of the commission subject to approval by the Senate, gave their term of office as four years, and their qualifications as artists "of repute". In addition to having an advisory capacity on all questions of art and design, the commission was given final say on the selection of sites for monuments and statues.&lt;ref&gt;"Art Board for District." ''Washington Post.'' February 10, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; Root managed the House bill through the Senate. [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] opposed the bill, and it was bottled up the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Library|Committee on the Library]]. But in mid-March, a group of renegade [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] joined forces with [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to strip Speaker Cannon of much of his power. The fine arts commission bill quickly passed through the committee and was brought up for a vote on the Senate floor.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;

The Senate amended the bill, and passed it on May 3, 1910. One amendment, to bar statues of any person not dead 50 years, was turned down.&lt;ref&gt;"Senators As Art Critics." ''Washington Post.'' May 4, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate changed the qualifications of the commissioners to seven "well qualified judges of the fine arts". It struck the commission's authority to site monuments and statues, making the authority advisory only. It also added fountains to the type of items covered by the act.&lt;ref name="SerialSet" /&gt; In a [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]] on May 9, the House conferees agreed to the Senate amendments. They also won approval of the Senate conferees to remove the requirement that the commission members be approved by the Senate. Clarifying language was also added to the bill, permitting the commission to advise (upon request) on the U.S. Capitol and [[Library of Congress]] buildings.&lt;ref name="SerialSet" /&gt; H.R. 19962, as amended, was passed by the House on May 12, and the Senate on May 17.&lt;ref&gt;American Federation of Arts, p. 97; [https://books.google.com/books?id=W3vQmfZEUZ8C&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;ots=nySI4hhx94&amp;dq=May%2017%20commission%20on%20fine%20arts%20passed%20senate&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=May%2017%20commission%20on%20fine%20arts%20passed%20senate&amp;f=false Joint Committee on the Library, p. 56.] Accessed 2012-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Taft signed the legislation Public Law 61-181 (40 U.S.C. 104, 36 Stat. 371), shortly thereafter.

President Taft named the seven members of the commission on June 13, 1910.&lt;ref&gt;"Art Experts Chosen." ''Washington Post.'' June 14, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; Taft appointed architect [[Daniel Burnham]] to be the chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1910 legislation establishing the CFA gave the commission the power to only provide advice on the siting of monuments and memorials. In October 1910, President [[William Howard Taft]] issued [[Executive order|Executive Order]] 1259 (October 25, 1910), which required that all new public buildings erected in the District of Columbia be reviewed by the CFA as well.&lt;ref name="Resnik"&gt;Resnik and Curtis, p. 488, fn. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 28, 1913, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] issued Executive Order 1862, which expanded the CFA's advisory authority to cover any "new structures...which affect in any important way the appearance of the City, or whenever questions involving matters of art and with which the federal government is concerned..."&lt;ref name="Kohler204"&gt;Kohler, ''The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910–1995'', p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Executive Order 3524, issued by President [[Warren G. Harding]] on July 28, 1921, further expanded the CFA's review to the design of coins, fountains, insignia, medals, monuments, parks, and statues, whether constructed or issued by the federal government or the government of the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="Kohler204" /&gt;

A '''used book''' or '''secondhand book''' is a [[book]] which has been owned before by an owner other than the [[publisher]] or [[retailer]], usually by an individual or [[library]]. 

Used books typically become available on the market when they are sold or given to a [[second-hand shop]] or [[used bookstore]]; they are usually sold for about half or three-quarters the price of what they would cost new, though rare books and others still in demand or hard to obtain might sell for more than this. 

Some new [[book shop]]s also carry used books, and some used book shops also sell new books. Though the original [[author]]s or [[publisher]]s will not benefit financially from the sale of a used book, it helps to keep old books in circulation. Sometimes very old, rare, [[Edition (book)|first edition]], [[antique]], or simply [[out of print]] books can be found as used books in used book shops.

A reading copy of a book may be well-used, may include highlighting or [[marginalia]], and is suitable for reading, but is not collectible. This is a term used in the used book business, to indicate the lack of collectible value, while claiming that the book is in sufficiently good condition for a purchaser whose interest is primarily in actually reading the book. A reading copy is typically less expensive than a collectible copy.

==Booktowns==
A number of small towns have become centres for used book sellers, most notably [[Hay-on-Wye]] in [[South Wales]]. They act as a magnet for buyers, and are located in country areas of great scenic beauty.
