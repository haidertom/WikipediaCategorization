      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2367">'''A Change of Hobbit''' (1972-1991) was one of the first [[science fiction, fantasy and horror bookstores]] established, and was a significant part of [[science fiction fandom]] generally and in Southern California particularly.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;Duke Helfand, [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-10/news/we-1280_1_science-fiction "For Science Fiction Fans, Old Habit Dies Hard : Change of Hobbit Devotees Are Already Mourning Bookstore Demise"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Feb. 10, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherry Gottlieb, [http://www.wordservices.com/hobbit/ "Escape Velocity: A History of A Change of Hobbit Bookstore"] (draft memoir, last visited March 31, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name references the [[hobbit]]s from [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' series. Owner Sherry Gottlieb offered the use of her name to colleagues in Berkeley, who then established [[The Other Change of Hobbit]] bookstore in 1974; that store continues to operate in the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="bdp1008"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Bullock |work=The Berkeley Daily Planet |title=The Other Change of Hobbit is Living in South Berkeley |url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2010-08-10/article/36052?headline=The-Other-Change-of-Hobbit-Thrives-in-South-Berkeley |date=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Change of Hobbit bookstore hosted numerous events, including, famously, [[Harlan Ellison]] in its front window, writing a story in public view, over the course of a week.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harlan Ellison]], ''[[Strange Wine]].''&lt;/ref&gt; The store was also a mainstay on author tours, as [[Anne Rice]] noted: "Authors around the world have dreamed of going to the Hobbit for signings. What's a West Coast tour if you can't visit Sherry?"&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt; The store was also notable for Gottlieb's pet boa constrictor, "Wrinklesnakeskin".&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt;

Gottlieb first opened the store in Westwood, moved it to Westwood Boulevard, and then to Lincoln Boulevard in [[Santa Monica]]. In 1989, Gottlieb moved the store to its final location on 2nd Street in [[Santa Monica]].&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">[[File:Correggio_-_Allegory_of_Virtues_-_WGA05338.jpg|thumb|350px]]
The '''''Allegory of Virtue''''' is an oil on canvas painting by [[Correggio]] dating to around 1531 and measuring 149 by 88 cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Giuseppe Adani, ''Correggio pittore universale'', Silvana Editoriale, Correggio 2007. {{ISBN|9788836609772}}&lt;/ref&gt; It and ''[[Allegory of Vice (Correggio)|Allegory of Vice]]'' were painted as a pair for the [[studiolo]] of [[Isabella d'Este]], with ''Vice'' probably the second of the two to be completed. This hypothesis is since only one (possibly non-autograph) sketch survives for ''Vice'', unlike ''Virtue'', for which two preparatory studies survive (in the [[Louvre]]), along with a near-complete oil sketch (attributed to Correggio in the 1603 inventory of the [[Aldobrandini]] collection and now at the [[Galleria Doria Pamphili]]) - this suggests Correggio had become more proficient after the difficult gestation of ''Virtue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Mauro Lucco (ed), ''Mantegna a Mantova 1460-1506'', exhibition catalogue, Skira Milano, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Allegoria della virtù, disegno preparatorio 1, louvre.jpg|Sketch
File:Allegoria della virtù, disegno preparatorio 2, louvre.jpg|Sketch
&lt;/gallery&gt;

As usually interpreted, the central woman is [[Minerva]], holding a read lance and a plumed helmet - the work may even be a continuation of [[Mantegna]]'s ''[[Triumph of the Virtues (Mantegna)|Triumph of the Virtues]]'', painted for the same studiolo and also featuring a Minerva with a red lance. (Others have interpreted the figure as Isabella herself, dressed as Wisdom.) Glory hovers above her holding a crown, whilst a seated female figure to the right is surrounded by symbols of the four [[cardinal virtues]] (a snake in her hair for Prudence, a sword for Justice, reins for temperance and [[Hercules]]'s lion skin for Fortitude). Some interpret the seated black female figure on the right as Astrology, Science or Intellectual Virtue - she points outside the painting's space and thus (like the putto in ''Vice'') draws the viewer's attention from one painting to the other. 

After the studiolo's contents was dispersed, ''Virtue'' and the Mantegna were given to [[cardinal Richelieu]] around 1627 and moved to Paris. There they were acquired by [[Eberhard Jabach]] in 1671, before being sold by him to [[Louis XIV]] - ''Virtue'' still hangs in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartelfr.louvre.fr/cartelfr/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=14291&amp;langue=fr|title=Site officiel du musée du Louvre|website=Cartelfr.louvre.fr|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correggioarthome.it/Sezione.jsp?idSezione=171&amp;idSezioneRif=54|title=Giulio Sanuto, Apollo e Marsia, 1562 - Correggio ART HOME|first=Netribe|last=srl|website=Correggioarthome.it|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}

An '''Amazon Standard Identification Number''' ('''ASIN''') is a 10-character [[alphanumeric]] [[unique identifier]] assigned by [[Amazon.com]] and its partners for product identification within the Amazon organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.ca/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200576730 |title=Amazon.ca Help: Product Identifiers |website=Amazon.ca |accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and structure==
ASINs were once unique worldwide, but global marketing has changed so that ASINs are only guaranteed unique within particular marketplaces.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Accordingly, the same product may have several ASINs though, and different national sites may use a different ASIN for the same product.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} In general, ASINs are unlikely to be different between the country sites specially if they are for a class of product where the ASIN is based on an externally defined and internationally consistent identifier, such as [[ISBN]] for books.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Each product sold on Amazon.com is given a unique ASIN. For books with 10-digit [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN), the ASIN and the ISBN are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/help/t5/a16 |title=FAQ: ISBN{{not a typo|-13}} for Amazon Associates |website=Affiliate-Program.Amazon.com |accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] edition of a book will not use its ISBN as the ASIN, although the electronic version of a book may have its own ISBN. In most cases, it is possible to convert an ASIN to obtain a corresponding EAN code, also known as an [[International Article Number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://erwinmayer.com/labs/asin2ean/index.php|title=ASIN to EAN converter |publisher=erwinmayer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASINs are also used for other items available from Amazon.com (and subsidiaries), such as businesses in the yellow pages (on [[A9.com]]) and [[OpenSearch]] feeds.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

'''''Apple''''' is a 1966 conceptual artwork by the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]].

==Work==
The work consists of an [[apple]] on top of a [[plexiglass]] stand. A brass plaque bearing the word 'APPLE' is fixed to the front of the stand.&lt;ref name=VF15&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/05/yoko-ono-moma-exhibit-review|title=The Two Must-See, Must-Do, Must Step-On Works at Yoko Ono's MoMA Show|date=May 2015|author=Bruce Handy|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was subsequently covered in [[bronze]] as part of Ono's 'Bronze Age' series of artworks.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nell Beram|author2=Carolyn Boriss-Krimsky|title=Yoko Ono: Collector of Skies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pCOWKp3LZ0C|date=1 February 2012|publisher=Abrams|isbn=978-1-61312-513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The work was shown at Ono's autumn 1966 show, ''Unfinished Paintings and Objects By Yoko Ono'' at the [[Indica Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"/&gt; The preview night of Ono's Indica exhibition on 9 November 1966 was visited by the musician [[John Lennon]] who had heard that "this amazing woman was going to be putting on a show...and it was going to be a bit of a happening". Lennon described himself as "astounded" at the "apple on sale for two hundred quid; I thought it was fantastic—I got her work immediately...it was two hundred quid to watch the fresh apple decompose". The piece also appealed to Lennon as he "didn't have to have much knowledge about avant-garde or underground art... the humor got me straight away".&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"/&gt; Lennon took a bite out of the apple on display, before apologising and putting the apple back. Ono later recalled that "...he just grabbed it and bit it and looked at me like, you know, "There!" you know? I was so furious, I didn't know what to say. And it all showed in my face: How dare this person, you know, mess around with my work?".&lt;ref name='MOMA'&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple. Yoko Ono. 1966.|url=https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/15/368|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon was subsequently impressed by his interaction with Ono's piece ''[[Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting]]''.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"/&gt;

''Apple'' was recreated for the first time in four decades in 2006 at a recreation of the Indica Gallery at the art gallery [[Riflemaker]] in London's Soho district. The original Indica had closed in 1967.&lt;ref name=Ind06&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/john-and-yoko-love-at-first-bite-423973.html|title=John and Yoko: Love at first bite|date=12 November 2006|author=Anthony Barnes|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was displayed at Ono's 2015 retrospective, ''Yoko Ono: One Woman Show, 1960–1971'' at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. Critic Bruce Handy highlighted ''Apple'' as one of the "must see" pieces from the exhibition, and believed the [[apple]] itself to be of the [[Granny Smith]] [[cultivar]].&lt;ref name=VF15/&gt;

==Interpretation==
In 1966 Ono described the "...excitement of watching the apple decay, and the decision as to whether to replace it, or just thinking of the beauty of the apple after it's gone".&lt;ref name=VF15/&gt; Bruce Handy wrote that the accompanying label for ''Apple'' highlighted for the viewer the juxtaposition between the physical permanence of the pedestal's brass plaque and the "passage of time marked by the apple's decay and periodic renewal as it is replaced throughout the course of the exhibition" a relationship that begins as "the transparent base recedes into space".&lt;ref name=VF15/&gt;

'''Arab television drama''' or '''Arab soap opera''' (also known as "مسلسل", '''musalsal''', plural '''musalsalat''') is a television form of melodramatic serialized fiction.&lt;ref name=nyt-iton/&gt; The musalsalat are similar in style to Latin American [[telenovelas]].&lt;ref name=nyt-iton/&gt; They are often historical epics about Islamic figures or love stories involving class conflict and intrigue.&lt;ref name=nyt-iton&gt;{{cite web|title=Ideas &amp; Trends: Ramadan Nights; Traditions Old (Fasting) and New (Soap Operas)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/23/weekinreview/ideas-trends-ramadan-nights-traditions-old-fasting-and-new-soap-operas.html|publisher=New York Times|date=November 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''musalsal'' literally means "chained, continuous".&lt;ref name=salamandra&gt;{{cite book|last=Salamandra|first=Christa|title=A New Old Damascus: Authenticity And Distinction In Urban Syria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l6UKhO5KJO4C&amp;pg=PA169|pages=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the evenings of the month of [[Ramadan]], after the [[Iftar]] meal is eaten to break the day's fast, families across much of the [[Arab world]] watch these special dramas on television.&lt;ref name=bbc-rsoab&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramadan soap opera boom for Egypt|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19296520|publisher=BBC News|date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab satellite channels broadcast the programs each night, drawing families who have gathered to break their fast.&lt;ref name=wp-ssoc&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian Soap Opera Captivates Arab World|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/12/AR2007101200238.html|publisher=Washington Post|date=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most musalselat are bundled into about 30 episodes, or about one episode for each night of Ramadan.&lt;ref name=ta-sss&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria's Subversive Soap Operas|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/07/syrias-subversive-soap-operas/242718/|publisher=The Atlantic|date=Jul 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These television series are an integral part of the Ramadan tradition, the same way the [[hakawati]], the storyteller who recounted tales and myths, was part of Ramadan nights in the past.&lt;ref name=sol-rff/&gt;

According to the market research firm [[Ipsos]], during the first two weeks of Ramadan 2011 television figures rose across the Middle East by 30%, and as many as 100 Arab soap operas and shows broadcast on state and private channels.&lt;ref name=gn-rtv&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramadan TV: Your ultimate guide to the best of the month’s television programmes|url=http://gulfnews.com/arts-entertainment/television/ramadan-tv-your-ultimate-guide-to-the-best-of-the-month-s-television-programmes-1.1050028|publisher=Gulf News|date=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ramadan season has been compared to a month-long [[Super Bowl]] for its importance in the Arab world's television market.&lt;ref name=gn-rtv/&gt; During this period, television ratings remain high well into the night, and the cost of a 30-second advertisement during peak Ramadan viewing hours can be more than double the normal rate.&lt;ref name=gn-rtv/&gt; According to the Pan Arab Research Center, the amount spent in 2012 for Ramadan television advertising exceeded a forecast of US$420 million, out of an estimated $1.98 billion for the total Arab television advertising market for the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramadan shows give TV revenue a big boost|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/media/ramadan-shows-give-tv-revenue-a-big-boost|publisher=The National|date=Aug 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 [[Egypt]]ian television channels had more than 50 soap operas on offer, for a combined production cost estimated at a record 1.18 billion [[Egyptian pounds]].&lt;ref name=bbc-rsoab/&gt;

==Lebanon==
[[Lebanon|Lebanese]] drama series lag significantly behind the more popular Syrian or Egyptian production, a lack of popularity thought to be caused primarily by weak scripts.&lt;ref name=sol-rff&gt;{{cite web|title=Soap operas: a Ramadan family favorite|url=http://www.saidaonline.com/en/news.php?go=fullnews&amp;newsid=28099|publisher=Saida Online|date=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanese television tends to focus on reality television, shows with interviewing/talks shows, comedy, and so on rather than soap operas. Lebanese series also face challenges because of low budgets and an absence of government support.&lt;ref name=ds-rts&gt;{{cite web|title=Lebanon’s Ramadan TV series prepare to air|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Lifestyle/2012/Jul-14/180517-lebanons-ramadan-tv-series-prepare-to-air.ashx#axzz2EqRo7yCF|publisher=The Daily Star|date=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the war in Syria, some Syrian production companies have relocated their projects to Lebanon.&lt;ref name=ab-spd&gt;{{cite web|title=Made in Beirut: Syrians produce drama in Lebanon|url=http://www.albawaba.com/entertainment/syria-tv-beirut-454230|publisher=Al Bawba|date=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syria==
[[File:Unshoodat Al Matar Film Set Location 1.jpg|thumb|Film set of the series ''[[Unshoodat Al Matar]]'']]
[[Syria]]n soap operas took off in the 1990s, when satellite-television access increased across the Arab world, and were watched by tens of millions of people from Morocco to the Persian Gulf. As a consequence of the [[Syrian civil war]], Syrian production companies have shelved new shows and viewers throughout the Arab world have called for a boycott of Syrian satellite channels. A tax break issued by the government has failed to revive the industry.&lt;ref name=nyt-acow&gt;{{cite web|title=Another Casualty of War: Soap Operas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/opinion/in-syria-the-soap-opera-is-a-casualty-of-war.html|publisher=New York Times|date=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, some 30 Syrian soaps were aired during Ramadan, some only in Syria, but most on pan-Arab satellite channels.&lt;ref name=ft-ttss&gt;{{cite web|title=Tough times for Syrian soap operas|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cdb99908-ae0a-11e0-a2ab-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2EksfWYBm|publisher=Financial Times|date=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syrian musalselat have become one of the country's most prized exports, and are very popular in the Persian Gulf countries.&lt;ref name=ta-sss/&gt; Following the onset of the [[2011 Syrian uprising]], some have called for a boycott of Syrian musalselat.&lt;ref name=ta-sss/&gt;

Many Syrian actors, producers and directors left the country; many film sets have been destroyed or made inaccessible by the fighting.&lt;ref name=asdrama&gt;{{cite web|title=A Syrian drama: The end of an affair|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/pomegranate/2014/07/syrian-drama|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014 only 20 Syrian series were being made, compared to the 40 produced in 2010.&lt;ref name=asdrama/&gt;

==Jordan==
[[Jordan]] produces a number of “Bedouin Soap Operas” that are filmed outdoors with authentic props.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists concerned with decline in Jordan's Bedouin dramas|url=http://al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/meii/features/entertainment/2011/03/03/feature-03|publisher=Al-Shorfa|date=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actors use Bedouin-accented Arabic to make the story feel more authentic. These musalsalat have become popular in Saudi Arabia and Iraq.

In musalsalat that center around traditional village life during the time period just before World War II.  Oftentimes, these dramas are permeated by themes of tension between the traditional and modern ways of life with specific emphasis on the patriarchal systems and the role of women within them. Unique to this particular type of musalsal is the willingness of the shows’ creators to confront sensitive issues such as [[honor killing]]. Another musalsal genre is that of the historical drama. Topics of these shows range from pre-Islamic poets to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Many of these are joint productions by Jordanian, Syrian, and Persian Gulf region television producers. According to a survey of Jordan’s television viewers, 92.5% prefer watching Syrian dramas while 61.6% prefer Egyptian ones. This is compared to 26.6% who prefer watching Jordanian drama series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jordanian TV viewers prefer Syrian and Egyptian drama series over Jordanian ones|url=http://www.arabadvisors.com/Pressers/presser-190910.htm|publisher=Arab Advisors Group|date=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the aforementioned musalsalat target a broader, Arabic-speaking audience, certain programs target Jordanians specifically.  These shows tend to deal with social and political issues particular to present-day Amman. Acting in these programs, as well as Jordanian musalsalat in general, is often lauded as being superior to that of many Egyptian-produced soap operas.&lt;ref&gt;Shoup, John A. "Literature and Media."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12769">[[File:Asymmetrical haricut.jpg|thumb|An asymmetric haircut]]
An '''asymmetric cut''' is a [[haircut]] in which the hair is cut in such a way that the hair does not have left-right [[symmetry]] and one side is cut or appears to be longer than the other.{{r|Stacy-nd}} It is a versatile hairstyle with many subvariations.{{r|Stacy-nd}}{{r|Shellie-nd}} Usually it is a combination of two separate styles, one for each side.{{r|Stacy-nd}} An extreme variation is the "side shave", in which one side of the head is totally or partially shaved close.{{r|Cauterucci-2015-09-24}}

== Examples ==

Celebrities who have sported asymmetric hairstyles include [[Justin Bieber]],{{r|Page-Six-2015-08-31}}{{r|Romeyn-2015-08-30}} [[January Jones]],{{r|Gardner-2013-03-07}} [[Milla Jovovich]],{{r|Hairstyles-Weekly-nd}}  [[Kim Kardashian]],{{r|Panych-2016-08-02}} [[Cyndi Lauper]],{{r|Stacy-nd}} [[Rihanna]],{{r|Cauterucci-2015-09-24}} [[Roland Orzabal]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/10/how-we-made-mad-world-tears-fears&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Oakey|Phil Oakey]],{{r|Lester-2001-07-12}} and [[Davey Havok]]{{r|Raymer-2006-07-06}} of [[AFI (band)|AFI]]. Reality television star [[Kate Gosselin]] became well known for her asymmetrical cut,{{r|Romeyn-2015-08-30}}{{r|Talarico-2014-10-28}} which she has since changed.{{r|Talarico-2014-10-28}}

== Aesthetics ==

Asymmetric cuts can confer an [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] property known to professional [[Hairdresser|hairdressers]] and [[Cosmetology|cosmetologists]] as "asymmetrical balance" when they balance asymmetrical facial features.{{r|Alpert-Altenburg-Bailey-et-al-2004|p=237–238,251}}{{r|Bendell-and-Tehan-2009|p=158,160}} Hairdressers advise the use of an asymmetric cut for clients with asymmetrical features, such as a crooked nose, because symmetrical hairstyles draw attention to the facial asymmetries.{{r|Stacy-nd}}{{r|Alpert-Altenburg-Bailey-et-al-2004|p=245}} Experts on personal appearance management in business offer the same advice.{{r|Vega-2010|p=99}} The asymmetry of the hairstyle should be opposite to that of the facial feature.{{r|Roche-and-Roche-2017}} Asymmetrical styles that show the ears can make the face look slimmer, and hence are advised for clients with round faces or wide-set eyes.{{r|Alpert-Altenburg-Bailey-et-al-2004|p=427}}{{r|Bendell-and-Tehan-2009|p=156}} If the client wears eyeglasses, an asymmetric cut can distract attention from them.{{r|Bendell-and-Tehan-2009|p=156}} Asymmetric cuts are often more "trendy" than symmetrical hairstyles.{{r|Alpert-Altenburg-Bailey-et-al-2004|p=237}}

== Psychology ==

Psychological experiments have shown that hairstyle asymmetries are helpful, although not necessary, in determining whether or not an image of a familiar face has been mirror-reversed.{{r|Bredart-2003}}

'''''Baigneuses''''', also called '''''Bathers''''', is a [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] painting, now lost or missing, created circa 1908 by the French artist and theorist [[Jean Metzinger]]. Possibly exhibited during the spring of 1908 at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] (n. 4243).&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16028coll4/id/17386 Jean Metzinger, ''Baigneuse'', Société des artistes indépendants: catalogue de la 24ème exposition, 1908, p. 285]&lt;/ref&gt; This black-and-white image of Metzinger's painting, the only known photograph of the work, was reproduced in [[Gelett Burgess]], "The Wild Men of Paris", ''[[Architectural Record]]'', May 1910.&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess"&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris Gelett Burgess, "The Wild Men of Paris: Matisse, Picasso, and Les Fauves", ''Architectural Record'', May 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/ext/resources/news/2016/02-Feb/wild-men-of-paris-architectural-record-may-1910.pdf Gelett Burgess, "The Wild Men of Paris: Matisse, Picasso, and Les Fauves", ''Architectural Record'', May 1910, p. 412 (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was also reproduced in ''The New York Times'', 8 October 1911, in an article titled "The 'Cubists' Dominate Paris' Fall Salon", and subtitled, "Eccentric School of Painting Increases Its Vogue in the Current Art Exhibition - What Its Followers Attempt to Do".&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/10/08/104878571.pdf ''New York Times'', October 8, 1911]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Baigneuses'', likely an oil painting on canvas (as practically all Metzingers' works of the period), was painted in a vertical format with unknown dimensions.

The work represents at least four nude women (or bathers) relaxing in a highly [[abstract art|abstract]] landscape with vegetation and a small body of water visible through reflections and from the woman on the left whose legs are submerged from the knees down. The central figure holds the trunk of a tree with her left arm and a woman with her right, forming a tight central mass. The two nudes at the center, treated in a light color, stand-out against a darker background. They are flanked on both sides by a standing and a sitting nude.

The colors of the painting, as its dimensions and whereabouts, are unknown

==The Wild Men of Paris==
Leading up to 1910, the draftsman, illustrator and poet [[Gelett Burgess]] interviewed and wrote about artists and artworks in and around Paris. The result of Burgess' investigation was published after his visit to the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]], the massive anti-establishment art exhibition in Paris, and one year before the scandalous group exhibition that brought [[Cubism]] to the attention of the general public. At the 1910 Indépendants Jean Metzinger showed his ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' (the first Cubist portrait according to [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]); [[Albert Gleizes]] showed his ''Portrait de René Arcos'' and ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre (The Tree)]]'', paintings in which the emphasis on simplified geometric form overwhelms representational interests.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881–1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S. E. Johnson"&gt;S. E. Johnson, 1964, Metzinger, Pre-Cubist and Cubist Works, 1900–1930, International Galleries, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in his review of the 1910 Salon des Indépendants made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, [[Robert Delaunay|Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger|Léger]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier|Le Fauconnier]], as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux « Indépendants »'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910]&lt;/ref&gt; The works of Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay were exhibited together. Le Fauconnier showed the geometrically simplified ''Ploumanac'h'' landscapes: ''Le Ravin'' and ''Village dans les Montagne'', along with ''Femme à l'éventail'' and ''Portrait of Maroussia''. In the same exhibition hung the works of [[Henri Matisse]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Kees van Dongen]] and [[Henri Rousseau]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Kubisme.info, Salon des Indépendants]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelett Burgess writes in ''The Wild Men of Paris'' of the same exhibition:

&lt;Blockquote&gt;There were no limits to the audacity and the ugliness of the canvasses. Still-life sketches of round, round apples and yellow, yellow oranges, on square, square tables, seen in impossible perspective; landscapes of squirming trees, with blobs of virgin color gone wrong, fierce greens and coruscating yellows, violent purples, sickening reds and shuddering blues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But the nudes! They looked like flayed Martians, like pathological charts—hideous old women, patched with gruesome hues, lopsided, with arms like the arms of a Swastika, sprawling on vivid backgrounds, or frozen stiffly upright, glaring through misshapen eyes, with noses or fingers missing. They defied anatomy, physiology, almost geometry itself!&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the death of [[Paul Cézanne]] in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in the form of several large exhibitions and a retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1907, greatly affecting the direction taken by the avant-garde artists in Paris. Prior to the advent of [[Cubism]], Cézanne's geometric simplifications and optical phenomena inspired not just Metzinger, Matisse, Derain and [[Georges Braque|Braque]], but the other artists who earlier exhibited with the [[Fauvism|Fauves]]. Those who had not transited through a Fauve stage, such as Picasso, also experimented with the complex fracturing of form. Cézanne had thus sparked a wholesale transformation in the area of artistic investigation that would profoundly affect the development [[modern art]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;
The Fauvism of Metzinger, Matisse and [[André Derain|Derain]] was virtually over by the spring of 1907. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

[[File:Henri le Fauconnier, 1908, Ploumanac'h.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Henri le Fauconnier]], 1908, ''Ploumanac'h'', Museum Kranenburgh, Bergen, the Netherlands]]
Burgess continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though the school was new to me, it was already an old story in Paris. It had been a nine-days’ wonder. Violent discussions had raged over it; it had taken its place as a revolt and held it, despite the fulmination of critics and the contempt of academicians. The school was increasing in numbers, in importance. By many it was taken seriously. At first, the beginners had been called "The Invertebrates." In the Salon of 1905 they were named "The Incoherents." But by 1906, when they grew more perfervid, more audacious, more crazed with theories, they received their present appellation of "Les Fauves"—the Wild Beasts. And so, and so, a-hunting I would go!&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Turning his attention to Metzinger's abode, Burgess writes in The Architectural Record:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Metzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color. Surely, Metzinger should know what such things mean. Picasso never painted a pretty woman, though we have noticed that he likes to associate with them. Czobel sees them through the bars of his cage, and roars out tones of mauve and cinnabar. Derain sees them as cones and prisms, and Braque as if they had been sawn out of blocks of wood by carpenters’ apprentices. But Metzinger is more tender towards the sex. He arranges them as flowers are arranged on tapestry and wall paper; he simplifies them to mere patterns, and he carries them gently past the frontier of Poster Land to the world of the Ugly so tenderly that they are not much damaged—only more faint, more vegetable, more anaemic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

What’s Metzinger? A scrupulously polite, well-dressed gentleman as ever was, in a scrupulously neat chamber, with a scrupulously well-ordered mind. He is complete as a wax figure, with long brown eyelashes and a clean-cut face. He affects no idiosyncrasies of manners or dress. One cannot question his earnestness and seriousness or sincerity. He is, perhaps, the most articulate of them all. Let us not call him prim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Instead of copying Nature," [Metzinger] says, "we create a ''milieu'' of our own, wherein our sentiment can work itself out through a juxtaposition of colors. It is hard to explain it, but it may perhaps be illustrated by analogy with literature and music. Your own Edgar Poe (he pronounced it ‘Ed Carpoe’) did not attempt to reproduce Nature realistically. Some phase of life suggested an emotion, as that of horror in ‘The Fall of the House of Ushur.’ That subjective idea he translated into art. He made a composition of it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"So, music does not attempt to imitate Nature’s sounds, but it does interpret and embody emotions awakened by Nature through a convention of its own, in a way to be aesthetically pleasing. In some such way, we, taking out hint from Nature, construct decoratively pleasing harmonies and symphonies of color expression of our sentiment." (Jean Metzinger, circa 1909)&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Metzinger, Picasso, and Braque==
[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1908, Paysage aux deux figures (Landscape with Two Figures), oil on canvas, 60 x 73 cm, Musée Picasso, Paris.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1908, ''Paysage aux deux figures (Landscape with Two Figures)'', oil on canvas, 60 x 73 cm, Musée Picasso, Paris]]

There is a close association between Metzinger's ''Baigneuses (Bathers)'' and Picasso's 1908 ''Paysage aux deux figures (Landscape with Two Figures)''. Both stances are verbalized with the same abstract vocabulary. In both cases, the figures are camouflaged or blended with the background, their bodies forming part of the landscape. These works were completed at a time when Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir in [[Montmartre]], where he may have seen Picasso's painting. There are differences, too, worth noting between the two works (aside from the size and colors which are unknown in the Metzinger case). While the dominant feature of Picasso's painting is the landscape, Metzinger chose to highlight the figures; the landscape playing only a secondary role in the overall composition. Metzinger's figures are much larger relative to the canvas. They are prominently and symmetrically displayed, and of lighter color contrast relative to Picasso's asymmetrical juxtaposition and subdued contrasting. Two of Metzinger's nudes—to the right and left of the dominant central figures—are quite inconspicuous, as in Picasso's piece. In both paintings the nudes and landscape have become unified, not presuming a representation of reality.

They are the product of a reductive abstracting process, of an open, freewheeling process of synthesis—where a dialogue between components lead to the liberation from any particular classical foundation. They are combined harmoniously though pictographic imagery rendered in residuum abstractions of apparent mathematical codes. In the case of Metzinger, his prowess in mathematics is well documented.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; In the case of Picasso, the mathematical association with his paintings has been made through [[Maurice Princet]].

Metzinger's early interests in mathematics is well documented.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; He was familiar with the works of [[Gauss]], [[Riemann]] and [[Jules Henri Poincaré]] (and perhaps Galilean relativity) prior to the development of Cubism: something that reflects in his pre-1907 works.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://jean-metzinger.blogspot.com.es/ Alex Mittelmann, 2012, ''Jean Metzinger, Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post-Cubism'']&lt;/ref&gt; The French mathematician [[Maurice Princet]] promoted the work of Poincaré, along with the concept of the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth spatial dimension]], to artists at the [[Bateau-Lavoir]]. He was a close associate of Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, [[Max Jacob]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and Jean Metzinger. Princet is known as "le mathématicien du cubisme." He brought to the attention of these artists a book entitled ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions'' by [[Esprit Jouffret]] (1903) a popularization of Poincaré's ''Science and Hypothesis''. In this book Jouffret described [[hypercubes]] and complex [[polyhedra]] in four dimensions projected onto a two-dimensional page. Princet became estranged from the group after his wife left him for André Derain. However, Princet would remain close to Metzinger and participate in meetings of the [[Section d'Or]] in [[Puteaux]]. He gave informal lectures to the artists, many of whom were passionate about mathematical order. In 1910, Metzinger said of him, "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, October–November 1910, "Note sur la peinture" Pan: 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Picasso's ''Landscape with Two Figures'' is almost entirely Cézannian, in its color, in its reduction to simplified forms and in its loose brushwork. Picasso still shows a sense of depth perspective through shading, despite some flattening of the surface. Metzinger's painting is less influenced by Cézanne in its brushstrokes, hardly visible in this photograph. Its quasi-[[Nabis]] post-[[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] treatment can be observed, but Metzinger vacates all [[depth of field]]. The background and foreground have become one. The only devices that indicate depth are (1) elevation in the picture plane; lower is closer and further is higher, and (2) objects in front of others obscure the object in the background, such as the central nude appears in front of the nude she holds with her right hand.

In both paintings, the faces of the models have been left out, featureless, reduced to their simplest spherical form.

In light of the fact that Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir since 1908 and exhibited with Georges Braque at Berthe Weill's gallery,&lt;ref name="Joann Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909'', p.&amp;nbsp;35, 1985, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press&lt;/ref&gt; introduced to Picasso by [[Max Jacob]] and Guillaume Krotowsky (who already signed his works [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]),&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=salle+VII,+salon+d'automne+de+1905&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=alVRJahAml&amp;sig=6SkzgOftNxhpsdYdDNKbJjzqXUY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false Russell T. Clement, 1994, ''Les Fauves: A sourcebook'']&lt;/ref&gt; and in view of the similarities between the two works, it is probable that Metzinger's ''Bathers'' was painted the same year; 1908. The differences between the two paintings suggest that, while Metzinger may have been influenced by Picasso (unlike [[Albert Gleizes]]), his intention was certainly not to copy or even resemble the Spaniard, as would soon Braque (or ''visa versa''). His intention was to create his own brand of art, dependent on his own lived experience.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then the kingdom of the Fauves whose civilization had appeared so new, so powerful, so startling, took on suddenly the aspect of a deserted village.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It was then that Jean Metzinger, joining Picasso and Braque, founded the Cubist City. (Guillaume Apolllinaire, 1913)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/mjp/render.php?id=1299781650906252&amp;view=mjp_object Guillaume Apolllinaire, ''Aesthetic Meditations, On Painting, The Cubist Painters, Second Series'', The Little Review: Quarterly Journal of Art and Letters, Vol. 9, No. 1: Stella Number, Anderson, Margaret C. (editor), New York: Margaret C. Anderson, 1922–09 (Autumn 1922), Modernist Journals Project, Brown University and the University of Tulsa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whether in advanced non-objective mathematical workings or abstract geometrical form, along with his non-representative dislocated outward appearance, Metzinger creates a pure image—''"the total image"''.

By 1908–09, in such studies as ''Baigneuses (Bathers), it is apparent that Metzinger was not following the lead of Picasso or Braque in their hermetic approach to painting—he had little interest in imitating, whether it be "an orb on a vertical plane" or anything else—Metzinger was on a path leading to abstraction and to the almost total disintegration of recognizable form.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

==''New York Times'', 1911==
Metzinger's ''Baigneuses'' was reproduced in the 8 October 1911 issue of ''The New York Times''. This article was published a year after ''The Wild Men of Paris'', and two years prior to the [[Armory Show]], which introduced astonished Americans, accustomed to realistic art, to the experimental styles of the European avant garde, including Fauvism, Cubism, and Futurism. The 1911 ''New York Times'' article, a review of the 1911 [[Salon d'Automne]], portrayed works by Picasso, Matisse, Derain, Metzinger and others dated before 1909; not exhibited at the 1911 Salon. The article is titled: "The 'Cubists' Dominate Paris' Fall Salon" and subtitled, "Eccentric School of Painting Increases Its Vogue in the Current Art Exhibition - What Its Followers Attempt to Do."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

:"Among all the paintings on exhibition at the Paris Fall Salon none is attracting so much attention as the extraordinary productions of the so-called "Cubist" school. In fact, dispatches from Paris suggest that these works are easily the main feature of the exhibition. [...]

:In spite of the crazy nature of the "Cubist" theories the number of those professing them is fairly respectable. Georges Braque, André Derain, Picasso, Czobel, Othon Friesz, Herbin, Metzinger—these are a few of the names signed to canvases before which Paris has stood and now again stands in blank amazement.

:What do they mean? Have those responsible for them taken leave of their senses? Is it art or madness? Who knows?"&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

==Proto-Cubism==
{{main|Proto-Cubism}}
According to Metzinger, in his ''Cubism was Born'', published years later, Cubism had been born out of the "need not for an intellectual art but for an art that would be something other than a systematic absurdity"; the idiocies of reproducing or copying nature in [[trompe l'oeil]] on a surface that is rigorously flat. With this type of illusion other artist of his generation such as Gleizes and Picasso wanted nothing to do. "Quite clearly" Metzinger notes, "nature and the painting make up two different worlds which have nothing in common&amp;nbsp;..." Already, in 1906, "it could be said that a good portrait led one to think about the painter not the model".&lt;ref name="Metzinger"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Le Cubisme était Né: Souvenirs par Jean Metzinger'' (Cubism was Born), Présence, Chambéry, 1972. (This text written by Jean Metzinger was supplied to the publisher Henri Viaud by Metzinger's widow Suzanne Phocas). Translation Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Le Cubisme était Né: Souvernirs'', Metzinger writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As for Picasso&amp;nbsp;... the tradition he came from had prepared him better than ours for a problem to do with structure. And Berthe Weil was right when she treated those who compared him/confused him with, a Steinlen or a Lautrec as idiots. He had already rejected them in their own century, a century we had no intention of prolonging. Whether or not the Universe was endowed with another dimension, art was going to move into a different field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The illusion had been maintained up to 1906 or 1907 through the negligence of those whose job it was to clear away the rubbish, but the break was achieved in 1908. No-one would again dare to look at a Puvis de Chavannes or read Balzac. No-one, I mean, among those who walked above the Moulin Rouge, which they would never even have thought of entering.&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both Metzinger's studio on the rue Lamarck and Picasso's [[Bateau Lavoir]] studio on the rue Ravignan were above the Moulin Rouge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Metzinger continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had measured the difference that separated art prior to 1900 from the art which I felt was being born. I knew that all instruction was at an end. The age of personal expression had finally begun. The value of an artist was no longer to be judged by the finish of his execution, or by the analogies his work suggested with such-and-such an archetype. It would be judged – exclusively – by what distinguished this artist from all the others. The age of the master and pupil was finally over; I could see about me only a handful of creators and whole colonies of monkeys. (Jean Metzinger, Cubism was Born)&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From his [[Montmartre]] studio on the rue Lamarck to Picasso's Bateau Lavoir studio on the rue Ravignan, writes Metzinger, "the attempt [''prétention''] to imitate an orb on a vertical plane, or to indicate by a horizontal straight line the circular hole of a vase placed at the height of the eyes was considered as the artifice of an illusionistic trickery that belonged to another age."&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wanted an art that was faithful to itself and would have nothing to do with the business of creating illusions. I dreamed of painting glasses from which no-one would ever think of drinking, beaches that would be quite unsuitable for bathing, nudes who would be definitively chaste. I wanted an art which in the first place would appear as a representation of the impossible. (Metzinger)&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was the search for beauty that had attracted Metzinger to the abstract. Beauty depends not only on geometrical forms or simplified colors, but plainly beauty as it exists in itself. It wasn't just the simple result of a reductive approach to the elements of all the parts. It wasn't either just a dialectic view of everything that led him just as simply to treat each object as opposed to the other, and therefore thoroughly distinct. The blurring of differences was against the entire tenor of the whole.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

The narrative of Metzinger outlined by his ''Bathers'' schematic geometric arrangements was the result of an abstracting process not solely based on "axiomatics". These axiomatic abstractions, however, by themselves contain no assertions as to the reality that can be experienced, not in a logical sense deduced from experience, but free inventions of the human mind, abstractions, construed by mathematical means. With works such as ''Bathers'' had emerged a growing accent on the power of the mind to create for itself, a growing spirit of abstraction, of invention, fabrication.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

As one would expect, Metzinger’s concept of painting was both more sophisticated and perceptive than Cézanne, but fundamentally the shape of the misunderstandings that were to follow Cubism were the same as Cézanne's, and so too were the implications. Metzinger had seen painting as rooted in the experience of nature: four-dimensional and geometric. He stressed this heavily, and at the same time brought out the ''flatness'' and dislocations of Cézanne’s transformations of nature—with the conceptual aspect of multiple perspectives and non-Euclidean spacetime. The importance of Cubism, he accepted, was to emphasize the idea that everything visible (objects) and invisible (consciousness) has an ''n''-dimensional geometric basis (an idea he associated with ‘construct an infinite number of different spaces for the use of painters’).&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nearly conscious in someone like Michelangelo, or Paolo Uccello, quite intuitive in painters such as Ingres, or Corot, it works on the basis of numbers which belong to the painting itself, not to whatever it represents. (Metzinger)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Bhayānaka''' (Sanskrit: भयानक, Bhayānaka)  is one of the nine [[Indian aesthetics|rasas]], usually translated as fear. Rasa means "flavour", and the theory of rasa is the primary concept behind classical [[Indian art]]s, including [[theatre]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[poetry]], and even [[sculpture]].

'''Birmingham Conservation Trust''' is a charity which saves and restores historic buildings in the city of [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. In 2004 it completed the conservation and restoration of the last surviving court of [[Birmingham Back to Backs|Back to Back houses]] on [[Hurst Street]] in the city. These are now run by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

[[Image:Perrotts Folly Crop.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Perrott's Folly&lt;ref name="BCT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghamconservationtrust.org/bct-finished/perrotts-folly/|title=Perrott’s Folly|publisher=Birmingham Conservation Trust|accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Birmingham Conservation Trust moved on to a short term project managing the protection of [[Perrott's Folly]] &amp;mdash; a tower in the city which has close associations with [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Work has been taking place to ensure the tower does not collapse.

Another project is Newman Brothers, a family-run factory in Birmingham's unique [[Jewellery Quarter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/newman-brothers-coffin-works-jewellery-5380940|title=Newman Brothers Coffin Works in Jewellery Quarter brought back from the dead - Birmingham Mail|author=Jane Tyler|work=birminghammail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm made some of the world's finest [[coffin]] furniture, including the fittings for the funerals of [[Winston Churchill]], [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. The very last sets of cast brass gothic handles from this factory were used on the coffins of Cardinal [[Basil Hume]] and of [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]].

===[[Chinese Literature]]===

The word "[[literature]]" has two meanings. In a narrower sense it means belles-lettres, writings done with a purpose of entertainment, leisure, self-expression, and so on, like poems, novels, letters, or diaries. In a broader sense, like it is treated here, "literature" means everything that has been written, including philosophical writings, scientific treatises, political writings, geography, inscriptions on tomb stones, or documents of court politics.&lt;ref&gt;

Chinaknowledge provides four different search tools to readers:

* Literature from A to Z
* Literature by time, Literature by theme
* Literature by the four categories
* Terms in Chinese literature

===[[Chinese History]]===
This section of the Chinaknowledge Encyclopedia deals with Chinese history from the beginnings to the [[People's Republic of China]]. It is organised in the traditional, and still common, way of regarding Chinese history from the viewpoint of dynasties. Each dynasty or dynastic period is explained in terms of event history, the history of administration and government, economic history, the history of philosophy and literature during the respective periods, religion, technology and inventions, as well as the history of arts. Literature, philosophy, arts and religions in general are described in detail in the respective parts of this encyclopedia. For each historical period, detailed information is given about the rulers and the geography of their realm.&lt;ref&gt;

===[[Chinese Language]] and [[Chinese Characters]]===
With 1.5 billion speakers, the Chinese language is the most spoken language of the world. It is nevertheless one single language that is spoken in the same form in all parts of China, nor has it been unchanged over time. The script by which the Chinese language is written is an ideographic script embedded into clouds of mystery. It is an obstacle for education and literacy and has nevertheless been used for a vast treasury of literature. And it has provided an example for the scripts of neighbouring states. This part of the encyclopedia provides an introduction into important aspects of both the Chinese language and the Chinese script.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Death and Life''''' (Italian: '''''Morte e Vita''''') is an oil on canvas painting by Austrian symbolist painter, [[Gustav Klimt]] whose primary subject was the female body. His paintings, murals, and sketches are marked by a sensual eroticism, which is especially apparent in his pencil drawings. The painting was started in 1908 and completed in 1915. It is created in an Art Nouveau (Modern) style by use of allegorical painting genre during Golden phase. The painting measures 178 by 198 centimeters and is now housed at the [[Leopold Museum]] in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leopoldmuseum.org/en/leopoldcollection/masterpieces/41|title=Gustav Klimt, Death and Life|publisher=Leopold Museum|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
This is one of Klimt’s central themes, central also to his time and to his contemporaries among them Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele. Klimt makes of it a modern dance of death, but unlike Schiele, he introduces a note of hope and reconciliation, instead of feeling threatened by the figure of death, his human beings seem to disregard it. The imagination of the artist is focused no longer on physical union, but rather on the expectation that precedes it. Perhaps this new found serenity is rooted in Klimt’s own awareness of aging and closeness to death. But before the moment came when he chose to depict nothing more than moments of intense pleasure or miraculous beauty and youth.

== History ==
[[File:Design Management Europe Award Trophy.jpg|thumb|right|DME Award Trophy]]
=== ADMIRE (Award for Design Management Innovating and Reinforcing Enterprises, January 2007 – February 2009) ===
The DME Award started off as part of the ADMIRE programme in January 2007. The ADMIRE programme was a 2-year project in the European PRO – INNO programme of the [[Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry]] of the [[European Commission]]. The 6.4 million Euro programme addressed the [[Innovation management]] agenda of PRO – INNO Europe by raising the awareness of Design Management, in particular amongst European [[small and medium enterprises]], to improve their competitiveness and to boost the European economy in general. It was one of the key project objectives to establish the DME Award. 18 European organisations participated in this programme under the coordination of the City of Eindhoven until the end of the ADMIRE project in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Studies in Design Policy &amp; Programmes|url=http://www.seeproject.org/images/file/Case%20Study%20pdfs/Design%20Management%20Europe%20Award%20-%20SEE%20Case%20Study.pdf|work=SEE Project|publisher=Design Wales|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADMIRE|url=http://www.proinno-europe.eu/admire|publisher=PRO INNO Europe|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project website|url=http://www.proinno-europe.eu/admire/link-external-project-website|publisher=PRO INNO Europe|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Overview|url=http://www.proinno-europe.eu/admire/project-overview|publisher=PRO INNO Europe|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DME Organisation (February 2009 – Present)  ===

The former ADMIRE partners have been organising the DME Award since the end of the funded ADMIRE project on a voluntary basis. The role of these DME partners is to promote and organize the annual DME Award. For this purpose, a DME Award board was elected. The board consists of five representatives from the following organisations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DME Award Guidelines|url=http://www.designmanagementeurope.com/site/webfiles/DME-Award-Guidelines-2013.pdf|publisher=DME Award|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Edward II''''' is a 1991 British [[historical film|historical]] [[drama film|tragedy]] film directed by [[Derek Jarman]] and starring [[Steven Waddington]], [[Tilda Swinton]] and [[Andrew Tiernan]]. It is based on the [[Edward II (play)|play of the same name]] by [[Christopher Marlowe]]. The plot revolves around [[Edward II of England]]'s infatuation with [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]], which proves to be the downfall of both of them, thanks to the machinations of [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]].

The film is staged in a [[postmodern]] style, using a mixture of contemporary and [[medieval]] props, sets and clothing. (The date "1991" appears on a royal proclamation at one point.) The gay content of the play is also brought to the fore by Jarman, notably by adding a homosexual sex scene and by depicting Edward's army as [[gay rights]] protesters.

==Plot==
Once installed as king, Edward II summons his friend and lover, [[Piers Gaveston]], to his side and showers him with gifts, titles and abiding love. Their relationship is fiery and passionate, but it is the focus of gossip and derision throughout the kingdom. Upon his return, Gaveston takes revenge on the Bishop of Winchester, who had been responsible for his banishment from England during the previous reign, by personally [[torture|torturing]] him. Kent, Edward's brother, is the first to protest Gaveston's return. Many others feel the same way, including the Bishop of Winchester and [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Lord Mortimer]], who is in charge of the kingdom's army forces. Nevertheless, Edward defends his lover from his mounting enemies.

A pleasure-seeker, Edward is quite distracted from affairs of state, much to the distress and anger of the court (sombre men and women in business suits). [[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella]], Edward's French wife, vainly tries everything to win him back from his lover, but she is mercilessly rejected by her husband. Love-starved, Isabella turns to Gaveston, who inflames Isabella's desire by whispering obscenities in her ear, and then mocks her responsiveness.

The handsome, hedonistic and opportunistic Gaveston repels everyone except the King. His enemies join forces and threaten Edward with dethronment and exile; Edward is forced to comply with their wishes and sends Gaveston away. The lovers' separation is serenaded by [[Annie Lennox]]’s rendition of [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye]]".

The queen hopes that once Gaveston is away she could reconcile with her husband, but he rejects her once again. In a last effort to regain her husband's affection, she allows Gaveston to return. The king and his lover resume their relationship, but their enemies are ready to strike back.

Isabella and Mortimer, who has become her lover, plan to rule the realm through Edward and Isabella's young son, the future [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. When Kent tries to save his brother, he is murdered by Isabella. The nobles are soon plotting to get rid not only of Gaveston but also the king. Mortimer, their leader, is a military man and practising [[sadomasochism|sadomasochist]] who takes a grim pleasure in personally torturing Gaveston and the lovers' friend Spencer, who he addresses as "girl boy." Their torture takes place while there is a clash between the police and members of the British gay rights organisation Outrage.

After Gaveston and Spencer's assassinations, Edward, who has been thrown in a dungeon, is executed by impalement on a red-hot poker. This hideous fate is presented as a nightmare from which the imprisoned king awakens. The executioner, when he does arrive, tosses away his lethal weapon and kisses the man he was sent to kill.

Back in the castle, Mortimer and Isabella enjoy their triumph just briefly. The king's young son, Edward III, who all along has been neglected by both parents and who has witnessed their quarrels, has donned his mother's earrings and lipstick and, while listening to classical music on his [[Walkman]], walks atop a cage that imprisons his mother and Mortimer.

'''Enjoy the Arts''' is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)]] [[nonprofit organization]] located in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. Founded in 1981 by socialite Irma Lazarus and Phyllis Weston, Enjoy the Arts aimed to connect young audiences with Cincinnati's arts, culture and entertainment. In 2017, Enjoy the Arts merged with ArtsWave,&lt;ref name="Partners"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theartswave.org/impact/ripple-effect-blog/artswave-blog/2016/12/02/enjoy-the-arts-joins-artswave-to-inspire-new-generation-of-arts-enthusiasts|title=Enjoy the Arts joins ArtsWave to inspire new generation of arts enthusiasts|last=Partners|first=US DIgital|website=www.theartswave.org|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater Cincinnati's local arts agency and the nation's first and largest community campaign for the arts.

==About==
The original organization made its mark as Young Friends of the Arts in the 1960s. Inspired to introduce the University of Cincinnati’s College Conservatory of Music students to the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra with Phyllis Weston and Irma Lazarus as co-founders of the organization. The two pioneering women sought to foster the next generation of arts patrons with membership costs at just a few dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theartswave.org/impact/ripple-effect-blog|title=The Ripple Effect|last=Partners|first=US DIgital|website=www.theartswave.org|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 80s, Young Friends of the Arts became known as Enjoy the Arts (ETA), and steadily grew from offering discounted symphony tickets to University of Cincinnati college students to offering multiple discounts at more and more organizations to any student in Greater Cincinnati. By 1985, Enjoy the Arts offered $10 tickets to 30 different arts organizations to any student in the Greater Cincinnati area for a $25 membership fee. This grew Irma Lazarus' legacy of encouraging young people to appreciate and attend the arts. Irma knew that there were enough "blue hairs" (in her words) in the audiences. She wanted to see more young people attending all kinds of arts events.

In 1991, Enjoy the Arts grew to three full-time staff members and during this time, the program blossomed. Executive Director Lisa J. Mullins and Assistant Director Joelle Daniel, along with Membership Outreach Coordinator Laura Foy, worked together to take the organization from a fledgling, best-kept secret to a program that was city-wide and flourishing. During this time, Enjoy the Arts gathered young professionals to find out what they would like in a membership. ETA used their input to create the START program (Sample The ARTs). START was a companion membership program to Enjoy the Arts, cost $35 and offered half-price tickets to the same 30 arts organizations offering discounts to Enjoy the Arts' student members. Arts organizations in Greater Cincinnati were looking for ways to engage YPs in their programs and this was the perfect opportunity for Enjoy the Arts to capitalize on that need. The organization became known as Enjoy the Arts/START.

In 1992, the staff of ETA/START started creating countless social opportunities for members to get together - happy hours before performances, backstage tours, behind-the-scenes peeks at museums, and much more. Simply offering discounts to arts events was not enough to encourage young people, unfamiliar with arts in general, to attend. One program that really took off was Art for Dummies, a monthly arts education event. Each event was unique and offered ETA/START members the chance to dive deeper into the arts than they ever had before. Accountants got ballet lessons from Cincinnati Ballet, students got backstage peeks at set design from the Playhouse, and much more. 

Former members of Young Friends of the Arts wanted to reinstate their beloved organization for the modern age with Young Friends of the Arts members who had aged-out of the previous program. Enjoy the Arts was founded in 1981 to make Cincinnati's arts programs more accessible to even more audiences.&lt;ref name="soapbox"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soapboxmedia.com/features/041613enjoythearts.aspx | title=Bridging the gap: Enjoy the Arts streamlines path to arts patronage | first=Andrew | last=Welsh | publisher=Soapbox Media | date={{date|2013-04-16}} | accessdate={{date|2014-03-24}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members would receive an actual coupon book that granted VIP access and two free tickets to every participating arts event in the city, as well as exclusive invites to parties and happy hours on top of year-long ticket price reduction.&lt;ref name="soapbox" /&gt; Various price, age, and voucher structures were implemented and tested from 1981 to 2016. At one point, Enjoy the Arts offered two memberships: "Orange" for members under 35 and young professionals and "Noir" for people of all ages.&lt;ref name="cincy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cincymagazine.com/Main/Articles/Discounts_Deals_and_Parties_3499.aspx | title=Discounts, Deals and Parties: Arts Organizations Target Next-Generation of Audience &amp; Supporters | first=Julianna | last=Roche | publisher=Cincy Magazine | date={{date|2012-07}} | accessdate={{date|2014-03-25}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other structures included membership costs at $50 [[United States dollar|USD]] for a year-long membership with a discounted student rate of $35 [[United States dollar|USD]].&lt;ref name="soapbox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="howitworks"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enjoythearts.org/pages/how_it_works | title=How It Works | publisher=Enjoy the Arts | accessdate={{date|2014-03-25}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participating arts organizations included the Cincinnati Opera, Cincinnati Ballet, Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra &amp; Pops, and Playhouse in the Park among others.&lt;ref name="cincy" /&gt;

In April 2013, under manager Jennifer Foster, Enjoy the Arts partnered with Gaslight web developers, located in [[Blue Ash]], [[Ohio]], and Cincinnati branding agency We Have Become Vikings to modernize the organization even further.&lt;ref name="soapbox" /&gt; Enjoy the Arts underwent a brand repositioning and a website re-launch that features "an energetic new image that combines the nonprofit’s roots with attitude."&lt;ref name="soapbox" /&gt; For example, the organization's current brand mascot is [[William Shakespeare]] "with his face painted à la [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]."&lt;ref name="soapbox" /&gt; The mantra in the new look is that "everything needs to be fun."&lt;ref name="cincinnati"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cincinnati.com/blogs/arts/2013/04/19/enjoy-the-arts-unveils-fine-new-website-re-design/ |title=Enjoy the Arts unveil fine new website re-design |work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer|Cincinnati.com]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date={{date|2013-04-19}} |accessdate={{date|2014-03-25}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325082848/http://www2.cincinnati.com/blogs/arts/2013/04/19/enjoy-the-arts-unveils-fine-new-website-re-design/ |archivedate=2014-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the site became more in tune with [[smart phone]] technology.&lt;ref name="soapbox" /&gt; Rather than providing coupon booklets, Enjoy the Arts posted hundreds of free tickets on their website for members to claim on a first-come, first-served basis, similar to [[deal of the day]] websites like [[Groupon]] and [[Living Social]], and members can go back to organizations for half-price all year long.&lt;ref name="howitworks" /&gt; An unveiling party was held at the [[American Sign Museum]].&lt;ref name="unveiling"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Avis=AB&amp;Dato=20130419&amp;Kategori=LIFE15&amp;Lopenr=304190057&amp;Ref=PH%2FEnjoy-the-Arts-Unveiling-Party | title=Enjoy the Arts Unveiling Party | work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer|Cincinnati.com]] | publisher=[[Gannett Company]] | date={{date|2013-04-19}} | accessdate={{date|2014-03-25}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing access to Cincinnati's premier arts organizations, Enjoy the Arts also hosted its own parties and events.&lt;ref name="soapbox"/&gt;

Enjoy the Arts was previously in residence at the [[Cincinnati Museum Center]] and was a subsidiary of the museum. In addition, the non-profit was largely supported by the [https://www.tgci.com/funding-sources/funders/haile-jr-us-bank-foundation Carol Ann and Ralph V. Haile, Jr./U.S. Bank Foundation], [http://www.theartswave.org/ ArtsWave] and [[Joseph-Beth Booksellers]]. In December 2016, Enjoy the Arts, the Cincinnati Museum Center, and ArtsWave announced a merger between Enjoy the Arts and ArtsWave.&lt;ref name="Partners"/&gt; As of January 2017 the two programs were completely merged.

Foti'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/louisiana/lamdce/3:2006cv00431/33659/1/0.pdf?ts=1208834325 |title=The complaint: Entertainment Software Association vs. Foti |website=Justia.com |access-date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[lawsuit]] filed on June 16, 2006 claiming that a [[Louisiana]] law should be declared unconstitutional. The recently passed Louisiana law was a way for the state to [[Video game controversy|censor video games]] by making it illegal to supply minors with video games considered violent, similar to laws making pornographic material unavailable to minors, but using violence as the criteria instead of sexual content. The lawsuit claims that the law infringed on the video game industry's constitutional right to freedom of expression.

The suit was successful in getting the law overturned in late 2006, and the plaintiffs were awarded attorney's fees in early 2007.

==Lawsuit ==
The [[plaintiff]]s in the case, the [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA) and the [[Entertainment Merchants Association]] (EMA), claimed that Louisiana criminal law RS 14:91.14 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=78708|title=Louisiana Statute: La RS 14:91.14 Prohibited sales of video or computer games to minors}}&lt;/ref&gt; is unconstitutional on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] grounds. The defendants were [[Attorney General]] of Louisiana, [[Charles Foti|Charles C. Foti, Jr.]], and Doug Moreau, US [[District Attorney]] of the [[Parish]] of East [[Baton Rouge]]. Louisiana Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] had signed [[Louisiana House Bill 1381|HB1381]] just the day before as Act 441 of the 2006 Louisiana Regular Session. The law made it illegal for someone in Louisiana to sell, lease or rent a violent video game (as defined in the Act) to someone under 18 years of age.

The suit pointed out that in other states, similar laws had already been declared unconstitutional, and thus impossible to enforce. Furthermore, according to the suit, the law would have chilling results with video games being less likely to be accessible by adults (as well as by minors, as was the initial intent of the law).

==Aftermath==
Louisiana Middle District Judge James J. Brady issued a [[preliminary injunction]] on August 24, 2006.&lt;ref name="GP injunction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/347139.html |title=Judge Issues Preliminary Injunction Against Louisiana Law |accessdate=2007-01-20 |last=McCauley |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis McCauley |coauthors= |date=2006-08-25 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=[[GamePolitics.com]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212163016/http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/347139.html |archivedate=2007-02-12 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IXS Enterprise.jpg|thumb|The IXS ''Enterprise'' as imagined by Mark Rademaker]]

'''IXS ''Enterprise''''' is a conceptual [[Faster-than-light|interstellar superluminal]] [[spacecraft]] designed by [[NASA]] scientist Dr. [[Harold G. White]], revealed at SpaceVision 2008, designed for the goal of achieving [[Warp drive|warp travel]]. The conceptual spacecraft would make use of a modified version of the [[Alcubierre drive]]. Dr. White is currently running the [[White–Juday warp-field interferometer]] experiment in order to develop a [[proof of concept]] for Alcubierre-style warp travel, if possible. The Alcubierre drive uses [[exotic matter]] (not to be confused with [[antimatter]]) to travel faster than light.

While the concept had been out since 2008 the design of IXS ''Enterprise'' was popularized in June 2015 after a series of media outlets reported on the conceptual artwork done by Dutch artist Mark Rademaker in collaboration with NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillip|first1=Abby|title=This is the amazing design for NASA’s Star Trek-style space ship, the IXS ''Enterprise''|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/06/11/this-is-the-amazing-design-for-nasas-star-trek-style-space-ship-the-ixs-enterprise/}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mark Rademaker, over 1,600 hours have been spent on the conceptual artwork that he created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Chaka|title=Warp Speed Tests: NASA Advanced Propulsion Names Latest Model ''Enterprise'' After Star Trek|url=http://www.latinpost.com/articles/15393/20140622/warp-speed-tests-nasa-advanced-propulsion-names-latest-model-enterprise-after-star-trek.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy required to power the warp drive, according to White,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peckham|first1=Matt|title=NASA Actually Working on Faster-than-Light Warp Drive|url=http://techland.time.com/2012/09/19/nasa-actually-working-on-faster-than-light-warp-drive/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is approximately the [[negative energy|negative]] (negative energy is required for the Alcubierre drive concept to function) [[mass–energy equivalence]] of ''[[Voyager 1]]'', which has a mass of approximately 700 [[kilograms]]. Using E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, −700 kilograms of mass is equivalent to ~−63 [[exajoules]] of energy (this number is not definitive and can be further reduced). The ship has two thick outer rings (to reduce required energy) that generate the warp field—a contraction of space ahead, and expansion of space behind it. The space inside the rings is optimized to fit more space for cargo, crew and equipment.

'''''Imparja National News''''' was an Australian regional television news program broadcast on [[Imparja Television]] presented by Emma Groves.

==History==
Imparja introduced a local news service (primarily covering the Alice Springs area) into its nightly simulcast of ''National Nine News'' in 1990. Subsequently, the bulletin expanded into a full half-hour program incorporating local, national and international news. The program was directed at Indigenous and non-Indigenous viewers, but found a wide audience among all Australians interested in [[Indigenous Australian]] issues, as such topics are rarely covered in the mainstream Australia media.

In 2005, ''Imparja National News'' was axed in anticipation of the network's license area being merged with that of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. Regulations imposed by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] relating to minimum levels of local news coverage led to the bulletin's revival in February 2006 with Ryan Liddle.

Two years later, the bulletin was axed again and replaced by short one-minute updates broadcast throughout the day. A short-lived weekly current affairs program, ''Footprints'', was also introduced. As of 2009, Imparja now airs the Brisbane and Darwin editions of ''[[Nine News]]'' at 6 pm and 6:30 pm ([[Australian Eastern Standard Time|AEST]]) respectively.

'''Khmer ceramics''' refers to [[ceramic art]] and [[pottery]] designed or produced as a form of [[Khmer art]]. The tradition of Cambodian ceramics dates back to the third millennium BCE. Pottery and ceramics were an essential part of the trade between Cambodia and its neighbours.

In Europe the [[Musée Guimet]] in Paris has a number of historic Cambodian ceramic pieces. 

The [[Khmer Ceramics &amp; Fine Arts Centre]] in Siem Reap was established in 2006 to re-establish ancient pottery techniques and production. The [[National Museum of Cambodia]] houses an important collection.

{{Nihongo|'''''Kibyōshi'''''|黄表紙|}} is a genre of Japanese picture book [[kusazōshi]] (草双紙) produced during the middle of the [[Edo period]], from 1775 to the early 19th century. Physically identifiable  by their yellow-backed covers, kibyōshi were typically printed in 10 page volumes, many spanning two to three volumes in length, with the average number of total pages being 30.&lt;ref&gt;Shirane (2002: 672)&lt;/ref&gt; Considered to be the first purely adult comicbook in Japanese literature, a large picture spans each page, with descriptive prose and dialogue filling the blank spaces in the image.

Due to the numerous characters and letters in the Japanese language, moveable type took longer to catch on in Japan; it was easier to carve the text directly onto the same wood block as the illustration.&lt;ref&gt;Gravett (2004: 20)&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed for a close and harmonious interaction between image and text,&lt;ref&gt;Shirane (2002: 672)&lt;/ref&gt; with either a balance of both elements, or text dominating the image.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 185)&lt;/ref&gt; Kibyōshi used [[kana]]-based vernacular language. Known for its satirical view of and commentary on flaws in contemporary society, these books focused primarily on urban culture, with most early works writing about the [[hanamachi|pleasure quarters]]. Typically, kibyōshi were printed with 10 pages in a volume, with the average number of total pages being 30, thus spanning several volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Shirane (2002: 672)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the kibyōshi may have only been popular for a short period of time, thousands of pieces were published. At its peak in 1784, a record of 92 titles were published.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 201)&lt;/ref&gt; Only a fraction of this genre has been studied, leaving much to still be written.

==History==
Uda Toshihiko divides the history of kibyōshi into five periods: the incipient pieces (1775–1779), early works (1780–1783), gossip pieces (1784–1787), protest pieces (1788–1790), and post-Kansei Reform works.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 182)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incipient works===
The first major kibyōshi to be published was ''Kinkin sensei eiga no yume'', often translated as ''Master Flashgold's Splendiferous Dream'', by [[Koikawa Harumachi]] in 1775. It combined the wit and subject matter of fashionbooks with the graphic nature of the ''[[otogi-zōshi]]'' to retell the classic [[noh]] drama Kantan in contemporary [[Edo]]. Harumachi started with a prologue, which was common in fashionbooks but virtually nonexistent in otogizoshi. The piece featured realistic dialogue, trendy language, contemporary slang, and modern fashion trends.
Through ''Master Flashgold'', Harumachi created not only a new genre but a new market entirely; 50 to 60 kibyōshi titles are estimated to have been published in the next 2 to 3 years alone.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 195)&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, print runs were limited, but the high demands lead to the number of copies per run, as well as the number of titles per year, to increase.Another noteworthy piece released by Harumachi during this early phase of kibyōshi was ''Travelogue of Snooby Atlier'' (''Kōmansai angya nikki''), which he released the following year in 1776.

===Early works===
Continuing his success, Harumachi released many more successful kibyōshi. Other authors were keen to follow his lead, including [[Santō Kyōden]], Shiba Zenkō, [[Ōta Nanpo]], and Hōseidō Kisanji, who all got their start during this period. Kisanji's ''Dreamers the Winners'' (''Miru toku issui no yume'') threw him into the popular literature spotlight when published in 1781. Early kibyōshi targeted an educated audience, as evidenced  by allusions made to “old fashioned” theatre, such as noh and kyōgen, in ''Master Flashgold'' and ''Travelogue'' and kabuki being used as a major plot point in ''Dreamers''.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006:201)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golden age of gossip pieces===
Kibyōshi published during this time were riddled with countless references to contemporary persons, places, events, etc. The pieces from this period were composed of nine parts social [[satire]] and one part political satire. Kyōden's ''Playboy, Roasted à la Edo'' (''Edo umare uwaki no kabayaki'', 1785), for example, alludes to modern kabuki actors, authors, poets, and courtesans. It contains political overtones regarding the class system, as the protagonist Enjirō tries desperately to live the life of the [[romantic hero]]es of kabuki plays and ballads, despite being a merchant's son; he is firmly put back in his place at the end of the story.
Other popular titles of the day include:
*''Pat-a-cake! Pat-a-cake!'' (''Atama tenten ni kuchi ari'') by  Ōta Nanpo (1784)
*''Horned Words of a Dishheaded Demoness'' (''Hachikazuki hannya no tsuno moji'') by Kyōden (1785)
*''Absent White Lies'' (''Teren itsuwari nashi'') by Ōta Nanpo (1786)

===Political satire of "protest pieces"===
Piece from this era reversed the proportion of the gossip pieces to nine parts political, one part social. These kibyōshi were written during an intense period of social unrest; Japan was afflicted with natural catastrophes, such as floods, volcanoes, cold weather, earthquakes, and draught, leading to high commodity prices as famine struck the country, causing an estimated one million citizens to starve to death.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 205)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, government corruption, fiscal mismanagement, and the threat of class wars were plaguing the nation. These protest kibyōshi reflected the popular sentiments, but these messages were never outright said, in order to get past censors. Instead, the authors used a number of literary devices, such as allegory, asides, and [[reductio ad absurdum]] to code their true messages.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006:207)&lt;/ref&gt; The key to the satire of this period was overtone rather than overt statements. Popular subjects to satirize included the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa regime]], bad blood between [[Tanuma Okitsugu]] and Sono Zanzaemon Masakoto, devaluation of the silver coin, and Neo-Confucian policies advocated during the Kansei Reforms, based on a sampling of major works.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 205)&lt;/ref&gt; While never proven, it is likely that these novels contributed to public outrage and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 204)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Kansei Reforms works===
In 1791, strict censorship laws ended political satire in kibyōshi. Kibyōshi was prohibited from touching on current events and politics. All printed material had to be approved by government appointed censors; printblocks had to be submitted to a censor and had to be stamped “inspected" before the piece could go to print. Additionally, all publications had to clearly state the names of the author, artist, and publisher, to prevent unapproved material from being produced. 
The government also reprimanded authors of the protest pieces, and by 1791 virtually no one had gotten by unscathed. The first to be punished was Hōseidō Kisanji. It is said he was ordered to disappear from Edo, by means of a forced exile. Koikawa Harumachi was summoned, but he declined to appear on medical ground. He ultimately avoided having to present himself by dying abruptly; rumors of a self-imposed death spread. Ōta Nanpo unexpectedly gave up writing and disappeared under the radar. Publisher Tsutaya Jūzaburō had half of his assets confiscated; he was arguably the most influential publisher of popular literature and art of his time. 
Kyōden, undisputedly, was reprimanded most severely. He was brought before the City Magistrate and was forced to recant. He was then shackles and put under house arrest for 50 days. Despite punishment, he continued to publish kibyōshi for 15 years, minus the political overtones. He also released what is considered one of the last masterpieces of the genre, ''The Night Before Rosei's Dream'' (''Rosei ga yume sono zenjitsu''), in 1791. It was written and published after the admonishments of Kisanji, Nanpo, and Harumachi, but before he himself was preosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 235)&lt;/ref&gt;
The last major author to be punished was Shikitei Sanba. His piece ''Swaggering Headbands: A Chronicle of Urban Knight-Errantry in a Peaceful Realm'' (''Kyan taiheiki mukō hachimaki''), published in 1799, actually incited physical violence. An Edo fire brigade assailed his residence, as well as the residence of his publisher, ironically enough in protest of the negative portrayal of fire brigades in his story.
Due to censorship, works after 1791 lacked the playful spark of earlier kibyōshi.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 231)&lt;/ref&gt; Without political and social satire as fodder, authors were forced to go back to parodying earlier kibyōshi and other written formats, which grew tedious fast.

===End of kibyōshi===
Many scholars agree that the end of the genre came in 1806,&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 236)&lt;/ref&gt; though individual pieces continued to trickle out until as late as 1828. While the Kansei Reforms certainly damaged the industry, it is believed this was not solely responsible for the disappearance of the kibyōshi, but rather that it just sped up the process. What really killed the genre were the constant attempts to broaden the reader base by appealing to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 245)&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially, kibyōshi was written by educated authors for educated individuals. As authors attempted to expand the reader base across different classes and education levels, the jokes, illusions, etc. were inevitably dumbed down. As author Adam L. Kern notes, “in bending over backwards to expand its readership, the kibyōshi lost its esoteric uniqueness. In this sense, kibyōshi fell victim to its own success.” &lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 245)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translating kibyōshi==
There are several popular manners in which kibyōshi are translated. One is the method used by James T. Araki in the 1970s, described as an illustrated playscript.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2206: 255)&lt;/ref&gt; While not perfect, many translators followed his example and used this format. The main concern with this system is that all the text from the image is neatly divided up to a particular speaker, when it's difficult to pinpoint exact speakers in the original text, as the dialogue floats in the empty spaces of the page. Thus, this format gives the misconception that the reading process of kibyōshi is straight forward. It also creates a disconnect between the text and images by taking the text out of the image, making it seems as if the parts are independent of one another when they in fact are interrelated and inseparable. Another common method of translation is to replace the original, hand written text. In the 1920s, Yamaguchi Takeshi replaced the penned text with typescript, but it did not adequately convey the flowing nature of the original script. Sugiura Hinako improved upon this concept when publishing her rendition of ''Master Flashgold'' by replacing the sprawling script with her own less curvaceous, more legible handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 257)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar genres==
Kibyōshi has its roots in earlier illustrated novels, starting with the [[Otogi-zōshi|companion novels]]. These lightly illustrated novels would slowly evolve into [[akahon]], or "red books", the oldest form of woodblock printed comic books. Akahon tended to be easy-to-read adaptations of children's stories, folk legends, and fairy tales. Thus, the next type of woodblock comics, kurohon, or “black books”, feature more complicated retellings of [[kabuki]] and puppet plays, heroic legends, and military accounts while still being easy to read. This last genre is from which kibyōshi would directly descend. Early aohon ("blue books") were almost indistinguishable from kurohon, but this genre can be broken into two distinct categories: works that catered to younger, less literate readers and works that catered to cultured adults. The dyed used to color the covers the aohon faded with exposure to sunlight into various shades of yellow, which is how these sophisticated aohon became known as kibyōshi. It is believed the name change occurred after the hype of the genre, as kibyōshi were referred to as aohon as late as 1802.&lt;ref&gt;Kern (2006: 182–191)&lt;/ref&gt;

Land art includes everything from constructing a road, to taking a walk, building a monument, and leaving a mark in the sand. The program seeks to expand upon connections between typically separate fields. Each fall we spend two months camping while traveling 7,000 miles to engage sites that range from the [[CLUI]] complex at Wendover, Utah to the [[Mata Ortiz pottery|pottery culture at Mata Ortiz]], Mexico, from earth works like Robert Smithson's [[Spiral Jetty]] to archeological sites like [[Chaco Canyon]]. We learn from the fact that [[Donald Judd]] surrounded himself with both contemporary sculpture and [[Navajo people|Navajo rugs]]; that [[Chaco Canyon]] and [[Roden Crater]] function as celestial instruments; and that the [[Very Large Array]] is a scientific research center with a powerful aesthetic presence on the land. We spend the semester living and working in the landscape with guest scholars that expand the range of our definition in disciplines including archeology, art history, architecture, ceramics, criticism, writing, design, and studio art. The immersive nature of how we experience the landscape triggers an amalgamated body of inquiry where students have the opportunity of time and space to develop authority in their work through direct action and reflection. Land Arts hinges on the primacy of first person experience and the realization that human-land relationships are rarely singular.

Land Arts of the American West started at the [[University of New Mexico]] by artist [[Bill Gilbert (artist)|Bill Gilbert]] in 2000 and developed as a collaboration between Gilbert and architect [[Chris Taylor (architect/educator)|Chris Taylor]] since 2001. From 2002-2008 Land Arts was co-sponsored by the University of New Mexico and the [[University of Texas at Austin]] where Taylor taught in the interdisciplinary design program of the Department of Art and Art History. In 2007 Taylor was invited by [http://www.incubo.cl Incubo] to bring together a group of students and professionals from Chile and the United States for a [http://earthworkslab.org/atacama_lab/3_conference.html symposium] in Santiago and a Land Arts [http://earthworkslab.org/atacama_lab/4_schedule.html exploration] of the Atacama Desert. In 2008 Taylor began teaching in the College of Architecture at [[Texas Tech University]] where Land Arts continues to develop in addition to the programming at the University of New Mexico. The program now operates autonomously from both institutions. Operational funding for Land Arts of the American West is provided in part by [[Lannan Foundation]] and [[Nasher Sculpture Center|Andrea Nasher]].

The book [http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/books/taylan.html Land Arts of the American West] documents the history and development of the program was published by the [[University of Texas Press]] in April 2009.

'''''Les Trois Grâces''''' is a set of three public artworks by French-American [[sculptor]] [[Niki de Saint Phalle]]. ''The Three Graces'' are part of the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]] [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]] Sculpture Project.&lt;ref name="FactSheet"&gt;{{cite web | author=National Museum of Women in the Arts | year=2010 | title=Fact Sheet | work=New York Ave Sculpture Project at National Museum of Women in the Arts | publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts | url=http://www.nmwa.org/sculptureproject/files/Sculpture_Project_Fact_Sheet.pdf | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In the classic style of Niki de Saint Phalle's work, ''Les Trois Grâces'' are three large sculptures of [[voluptuous]] women (a creation that de Saint Phalle calls a 'Nana') who appear to be dancing. Made of [[fiberglass]], one Nana is covered in white, one yellow and the other is black [[mosaic]] tiles, ranging in heights of {{convert|12|to|15|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Trescott1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Jacqueline Trescott | title=National Museum of Women in the Arts to turn D.C. corridor into sculpture alley | work=Style | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/23/AR2010022304712.html | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011 | date=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They all wear elaborate [[bathing suits]] in designs such as hearts, fish, and instruments, in multiple color schemes. A whimsical set of sculptures, the three figures have their arms raised as if [[ballet]] dancing; each has one foot on the ground and another raised up. They are Saint Phalle's own version of [[The Three Graces (disambiguation)|The Three Graces]].&lt;ref name="Images"&gt;{{cite web | author=National Museum of Women in the Arts | year=2010 | title=Images | work=New York Ave Sculpture Project at National Museum of Women in the Arts | publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts | url=http://www.nmwa.org/sculptureproject/files/Sculpture_Project_Images.pdf | accessdate=8 Feb 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219155737/http://nmwa.org/sculptureproject/files/Sculpture_Project_Images.pdf | archivedate=2010-12-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Phalle said that the works represented unity among the races.&lt;ref name="Gopnik1"/&gt;

==New York Avenue Sculpture Project==
{{main|National_Museum_of_Women_in_the_Arts#New_York_Avenue_Sculpture_Project}}
''Les Trois Grâces'' are the first of many sculptures being installed for the Project by the National Museum of Women in the Arts. By 2015 a selection of sculptures was to be installed along New York Avenue from 13th Street to 9th Street, in the heart of [[Mount Vernon Square]]. The museum's efforts were in part to bring "character" to an area where "there is a lot of good stuff going on", due to revitalization programs in the neighborhood. Saint Phalle's works, four in total, were the first in a series of installations. The installation of de Saint Phalle's iconic pop art works was intended to contrast with the traditional sculpture that graces the streets and squares of Washington.&lt;ref name="Trescott1"/&gt;

The entire selection of de Saint Phalle's works was removed during the winter for conservation purposes, intended to reappear in the Spring.&lt;ref name="Gopnik1"/&gt; They were to remain up for one year, before being returned to the artist's foundation.&lt;ref name="Gopnik1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Blake Gopnik | title=Sculptures add color to New York Avenue, but are they art? | work=Style | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042703104.html | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011 | date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=July 2017}}

==Dedication==
The works arrived and were installed in mid-April 2010 by way of flat-bed semi-truck. The pieces were removed from their custom crates, handled and installed by hand.&lt;ref name="Strokes"&gt;{{cite web | author=Broad Strokes | year=2010 | title=The Three Graces are HERE! | work= | publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts | url=http://womeninthearts.wordpress.com/2010/04/15/the-three-graces-are-here/ | accessdate= 9 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Les Trois Grâces'', along with the other de Saint Phalle sculptures in the project, were dedicated at 1:30 pm on April 28, 2010., with an evening reception within the museum. [[Dr. Jill Biden]], [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]], [[Jack Evans (DC Council)|Jack Evans]], National Museum of Women in the Arts founder [[Wilhelmina Holladay]] and Saint Phalle's granddaughter [[Bloum Cardenas]], along with members of the DC Business Improvement District, [[District of Columbia Department of Transportation]], DC Office of the Planning, and other guests attended the ribbon cutting.&lt;ref name="FactSheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trescott1"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s [[Jacqueline Trescott]] described ''Les Trois Grâces'' as a "splash of [[pop art]], as exaggerated as Las Vegas [[showgirl]]s".&lt;ref name="Trescott1"/&gt; Fellow ''Post'' writer and [[art critic]] [[Blake Gopnik]] described the pieces as being "less weighty than what we hope to find inside our museums", characterizing them as [[plop art]].&lt;ref name="Gopnik1"/&gt;

'''Louis Paul Jonas''' (July 17, 1894 – February 16, 1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Paul Jonas|url=http://www.wildlifeart.org/collection/artists/artist-louis-paul-jonas-233/|publisher=National Museum of Wildlife Art|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American sculptor of [[wildlife]], [[taxidermist|taxidermist, and natural history exhibit designer]].

Born in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], Jonas moved to the United States at the age of 12 and went to work at his brothers' taxidermy studio, Jonas Brothers, in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver, Co]].  Later he moved to New York City, where studied under [[Carl Akeley]], a noted field naturalist, taxidermist, and animal sculptor.  There, they created the [[African elephant]] group in the center of Akeley Hall at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jonas' Wildlife Sculpture in Big Demand|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19831003&amp;id=ogshAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YXMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2739,663459|publisher=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=August 4, 2014|pages=2|date=October 3, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Madi (disambiguation)}}

'''Madí''' (or MADI; also known as Grupo Madí or Arte Madí) is an international abstract (or concrete) art movement initiated in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946 by the Hungarian-Argentinian artist and poet [[Gyula Kosice]], and the Uruguayans [[Carmelo Arden Quin]] and [[Rhod Rothfuss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Made in Madí: Nelson Di Maggio, curador de retrospectiva sobre Carmelo Arden Quin|url=http://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2010/11/made-in-madi/|publisher=La Diaria|accessdate=14 June 2012|author=Riccardo Boglione|date=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement focuses on creating [[concrete art]] (i.e., non-representational [[geometric abstraction]]) and encompasses all branches of art (the plastic and pictorial arts, music, literature, theater, architecture, dance, etc.). The artists in the Madí movement consider the concrete, physical reality of the art medium and play with the traditional conventions of [[Western art history|Western art]] (for instance, by creating works on irregularly-shaped canvases).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention "Concrete Invention."] ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010. Web. 30 Dec. 2010. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Artwork of Madí movement appeared in eight issues of its magazine, ''[[Arte Madí Universal]]'', published between 1947 and 1954.

== Historical Context ==
The Madí art movement formed as a reaction to the major concrete art movement in Argentina at the time, known as the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI), whose art was perceived by the Madí group as being too strict in their method of creating concrete art, resulting in a lack of expression in their artworks. 

Operating under the rule of Colonel [[Juan Perón|Perón]], whose time in power was characterized by a volatile political climate, the Madí artists used their art to make statements with social and political implications. One of the most overt criticisms made by the Madí movement criticized cultural authorities in the ''[[Arte Madí Universal]]'' magazine'','' commenting "[t]he last submission to the Venice Biennial has signified for Argentina a blunt negation of the new [artistic] values. We invite competent authorities to stop and compare the true current of contemporary plastic arts with the submissions that today put us [our country] half a century behind", which vaguely attack the aesthetic choices of certain cultural officers under Perón. According to [[Pérez-Barreiro]], Madí and Concrete art (referring to the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI)) are the artistic parallel(s) of the political phenomenon of [[Peronism]]. These artists were also seen as combining modern art with Communist ideology. Some scholars, including Barreiro, saw the government was an outspoken critic against concrete art as a whole, whereas others such as [[Andrea Giunta]] assert that the Madí and Concrete groups were not victimized under Perón's regime; rather, they "coexisted on its margins".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The political regime of Perón made use of both linguistic and visual images for propaganda purposes. This is seen in his use of an image, "the shirtless workers" (los descamisados), as an alternative to the concept of the working class. This image had strong connections and connotations with the male worker, shirtless and, unrealistically, without much affliction. In a speech given October 17th, 1946 at Plaza de Mayo, Perón addressed the workers in speeches as "mis queridos descamisados" (my loving shirtless workers). At this speech, he declared October 17th the "Day of the Shirtless Workers" and stated "I don’t want to govern over men but over their hearts, because mine beats in unison with the heart of each shirtless worker, which I interpret and love above all things.” The use of representations to create propaganda opened up a clear target for the Madí artists to oppose.

== Origin of the name ==
Gyula Kosice, who also operated under the pseudonym Raymundo Rasas Pèt, has explained that the name for the movement is derived from the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] motto in the [[Spanish Civil War]], "''Madrí, Madrí, no pasarán''" ("Madrid, Madrid, they will not make it in", i.e., the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist forces]] will not invade Madrid).&lt;ref&gt;[http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml "Entrevista a Gyula Kosice"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120629170755/http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml |date=29 June 2012 }}, ''Ñusleter Cultura'', 12 de agosto de 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is most typically understood as an acronym for ''Movimiento, Abstracción, Dimensión, Invención'' (Movement, Abstraction, Dimension, Invention).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Characteristics ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
A Madí work is non-figurative and non-representational; it has a cut-out or irregularly-shaped form, which takes away the viewer's perception of spatial depth that a rectangular frame provides; its colors are flat and sharply defined; it is often three-dimensional and sometimes articulated and/or mechanical; and it is playful in spirit. Madí artists were concerned with creating artworks that were autonomous with functions that naturally transcend the physical features that constitute the work. Introducing elements of transformation and ambiguity were techniques commonly employed by these artists to avoid representation as well as avoid the fixity of representations. In painted works, some artists would intentionally lower the legibility of the design.

The incorporation of unusual materials into artworks is seen throughout the art movement movement; this includes Plexiglas, fluorescent tubes, neon lights, water, metal, and other materials. An example of this is seen in [[Gyula Kosice|Kosice's]] first hydraulic piece, ''La arquitectura del agua: Hidro-escultura (The Architecture of Water: Hydro-Sculpture)'', which utilized light and water interaction.

Madí artists sought to combat representational forms because this art reflected and perpetuated class-based social organizations. They believed that representational images "forced others to relate to concepts, connotations, and feelings which were superfluous to the object itself... which enticed individuals into supporting class-based organizations". The Concrete art they produced was meant to have a reality that was self-contained. In other words, the reality of the art ended in the object. In the minds of the Madí artists, "Concrete art was worthy as a contribution to social liberation" because it helped its audience grasp true reality while standing against the concepts, connotations and feelings associated with art. To state this differently, exposing people to what is actually reality allows people to eventually confront myths perpetuated by the bourgeois that has suppressed revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Madí is perhaps the sole remaining art movement which can boast of a half-century of uninterrupted activity since its creation in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946. Today, the MADI movement has over 60 members — painters, sculptors, architects and poets — working in France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Japan, [[Argentina]] and the United States. One prominent figure behind this fifty years of artistic creation is [[Carmelo Arden Quin]].

== The Madí Manifesto ==
The Madí Manifesto was created to defend the importance of invention in the light of limitations imposed on concrete art by the excessive rationalism of European concrete art. This strictness of form in concrete art was also demonstrated by the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI). The manifesto also called for "the integration of the nonorthogonal framework into representational space".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geometric Abstraction: Latin American Art from the Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Collection|last=Bois|first=Yve-Alan|publisher=Harvard University Art Museums|year=2001|isbn=|location=Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Madí Dictionary ==
In written works, artists "disrupted the construction of semantically coherent structures" to avoid attaching meaning to the art and the possibility of representation. The Madí created a dictionary that accomplished the opposite of what a normal dictionary does in that it confused and distorted the meanings of words and made up words. The following excerpt is from the Madí dictionary, which demonstrates a correct grammatical structure that relates ideas that are impossible to interpret meaningfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is an example of this incoherent construction which prevents interpretation:&lt;blockquote&gt;M               &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Maclode: Upward hill. / Slope to insinuate land.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Meril: Kidnapping of flat centimeters. / ''Madícional'' [‘Madí-like’ or ‘of Madí origin’] opposition and resistance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Miogue: Account of events in which the authors of great answers participated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Molois: Site where the most varied adjectives are collected. / ''Fam''. Insult.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Musver: About the manner to focus in photography the liveliest glare of a childhood memory. / Fixation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Macichud: Line of shade that emits a loosening of gray beams.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;N&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nandy: Arrangement for new personal cuño.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nem-Er: Record of instances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nigs: Opening that is left so that a cluster of enchanted powder emigrates.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Novoh: Shooter that the riverside authority exercises to learn the coastal ruling&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Selected Artists and Artworks ==
Representatives of the Madí movement, in addition to Kosice, Quin and Rothfuss, include [[Martín Blaszko]], [[Waldo Longo]], [[Juan Bay]], [[Esteban Eitler]], [[Diyi Laañ]], and [[Valdo Wellington]], among others.

== Why MADI? ==
To the question, "Why MADI?" Josee Lapeyrere, who met Arden Quin in 1962 and has since participated with her poem-objects in most of the events organized by the movement, replies: "MADI's goal is to be rigorous, inventive, gay and ludic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MADI internacional 50 años después: exposición del 7 de marzo al 3 de abril de 1996, Centro de Exposiciones y Congresos, Zaragoza|last=Osornio|first=Cesar Lopez|last2=Roitman|first2=Ibercaja|publisher=Ibercaja|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the importance to which they accord spiritual and imaginative games, even the most serious MADI artists can be described as playful. Already in 1795, Schiller focused on "the inborn playful nature of man" as an explanation for his production of art forms. In his essay, "[[Homo Ludens]]" ("Ludic Man") (1938), [[Johan Huizinga]] observed that, "Play reveals an aspiration to beauty. The terms we use to designate the elements of play are, for the most part, the same as those utilized in the aesthetic realm: beauty, tension, balancing, equilibrium, gradation, contrast, etc. Like art, play engages and delivers. It absorbs. It captivates, or, in other words, it charms. It is full of those two supremely noble qualities which man expresses through rhythm and harmony." The French art critic [[Dominique Jacquemin]] also remarks that, "It is possible that Arden Quin's passion for game playing led him to create MADI, the only remaining contemporary art movement which can pride itself in possessing both coherence and a truly international outlook."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11393">'''Material selection''' is a step in the process of designing any physical object. In the context of [[product design]], the main goal of material selection is to minimize cost while meeting product performance goals.&lt;ref&gt;George E. Dieter (1997). "Overview of the Materials Selection Process", ''ASM Handbook Volume 20: Materials Selection and Design''.&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic selection of the best material for a given application begins with [[list of materials properties|properties]] and costs of candidate materials. For example, a thermal blanket must have poor [[thermal conductivity]] in order to minimize heat transfer for a given temperature difference.

Systematic selection for applications requiring multiple criteria is more complex. For example, a rod which should be stiff and light requires a material with high [[Young's modulus]] and low [[density]]. If the rod will be pulled in tension, the [[specific modulus]], or modulus divided by density &lt;math&gt;E/\rho&lt;/math&gt;, will determine the best material. But because a plate's bending stiffness scales as its thickness cubed, the best material for a stiff and light plate is determined by the ''cube root'' of stiffness divided by density &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3
]{E}/\rho&lt;/math&gt;. For a stiff beam in bending the material index is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[2
]{E}/\rho&lt;/math&gt; (please clarify cubed vs. square root difference).

An Ashby plot, named for [[M. F. Ashby|Michael Ashby]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], is a scatter plot which displays two or more properties of many materials or classes of materials.&lt;ref name="ashby"&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plots are useful to compare the ratio between different properties. For the example of the stiff/light part discussed above would have Young's modulus on one axis and density on the other axis, with one data point on the graph for each candidate material. On such a plot, it is easy to find not only the material with the highest stiffness, or that with the lowest density, but that with the best ratio &lt;math&gt;E/\rho&lt;/math&gt;. Using a log scale on both axes facilitates selection of the material with the best plate stiffness &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{E}/\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus as energy prices have increased and technology has improved, automobiles have substituted increasing amounts of lightweight [[magnesium]] and [[aluminium alloy]]s for [[steel]], aircraft are substituting [[carbon fiber reinforced plastic]] and [[titanium alloy]]s for aluminium, and [[satellite]]s have long been made out of exotic [[composite material]]s.

Of course, cost per kg is not the only important factor in material selection. An important concept is 'cost per unit of function'. For example, if the key design objective was the stiffness of a plate of the material, as described in the introductory paragraph above, then the designer would need a material with the optimal combination of density, Young's modulus, and price. Optimizing complex combinations of technical and price properties is a hard process to achieve manually, so rational material selection software is an important tool.

== General method for using an Ashby chart ==
Utilizing an "Ashby chart" is a common method for choosing the appropriate material. First, three different sets of variables are identified:
* [[List of materials properties|Material variables]] are the inherent properties of a material such as density, modulus, [[yield stress]], and many others.
* Free variables are quantities that can change during the loading cycle, for example, applied force. 
* Design variables are limits imposed on the design, such as how thick the beam can be or how much it can deflect
Next, an equation for the '''performance index''' is derived. This equation numerically quantifies how desirable the material will be for a specific situation. By convention, a higher performance index denotes a better material. Lastly, the performance index is plotted on the Ashby chart. Visual inspection reveals the most desirable material.

== Example of using an Ashby chart ==
In this example, the material will be subject to '''both tension and bending'''. Therefore, the optimal material will perform well under both circumstances.

=== Performance index during tension ===
In the first situation the beam experiences two forces: the weight of gravity &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and tension &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. The material variables are density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and [[Strength of materials|strength]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that the length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and tension &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are fixed, making them design variables. Lastly the cross sectional area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a free variable. The objective in this situation is to minimize the weight &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; by choosing a material with the best combination of material variables &lt;math&gt;\rho, \sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Figure 1 illustrates this loading.

[[File:Bar_tensile_stress.svg|thumb|400px|center|frame|'''Figure 1.''' Beam under Tensile stress loading to minimize weight.]]

The stress in the beam is measured as &lt;math&gt;P/A&lt;/math&gt; whereas weight is described by &lt;math&gt;w = \rho AL&lt;/math&gt;. Deriving a performance index requires that all free variables are removed, leaving only design variables and material variables. In this case that means that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; must be removed. The axial stress equation can be rearranged to give &lt;math&gt;A = P/\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Substituting this into the weight equation gives &lt;math&gt;w=\rho (P/\sigma) L = \rho L P/\sigma &lt;/math&gt;. Next, the material variables and design variables are grouped separately, giving &lt;math&gt;w = (\rho/\sigma)LP&lt;/math&gt;. 

Since both &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are fixed, and since the goal is to minimize &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, then the ratio &lt;math&gt;\rho/\sigma&lt;/math&gt; should be minimized. By convention, however, the performance index is always a quantity which should be maximized. Therefore, the resulting equation is &lt;math&gt;\text{Performance index} = P_{cr} = \sigma/\rho&lt;/math&gt;

=== Performance index during bending ===
Next, suppose that the material is also subjected to bending forces. The max tensile stress equation of bending is &lt;math&gt;\sigma = (-My)/I&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[bending moment]], &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the neutral axis, and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the moment of inertia. This is shown in Figure 2. Using the weight equation above and solving for the free variables, the solution arrived at is &lt;math&gt;w=\sqrt{6MbL^2}(\rho/\sqrt{\sigma})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the length and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the height of the beam. Assuming that &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; are fixed design variables, the performance index for bending becomes &lt;math&gt;P_{CR}=\sqrt{\sigma}/\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Beam_bending_stress.svg|thumb|400px|center|frame|'''Figure 2.''' Beam under bending stress. Trying to minimize weight]]

=== Selecting the best material overall ===
At this point two performance indices that have been derived: for tension &lt;math&gt;\sigma/\rho&lt;/math&gt; and for bending &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\sigma}/\rho&lt;/math&gt;. The first step is to create a [[log-log plot]] and add all known materials in the appropriate locations. However, the performance index equations must be modified before being plotted on the log-log graph.

For the tension performance equation &lt;math&gt;P_{CR}=\sigma/\rho&lt;/math&gt;, the first step is to take the [[logarithm|log]] of both sides. The resulting equation can be [[Logarithm#Product.2C_quotient.2C_power_and_root|rearranged]] to give &lt;math&gt;\log(\sigma) = \log(\rho) + \log(P_{CR})&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this follows the format of &lt;math&gt;y = x + b&lt;/math&gt;, making it linear on a log-log graph. Similarly, the y-intercept is the log of &lt;math&gt;P_{CR}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the fixed value of &lt;math&gt;P_{CR}&lt;/math&gt; for tension in Figure 3 is 0.1.

The bending performance equation &lt;math&gt;P_{CR}=\sqrt{\sigma}/\rho&lt;/math&gt; can be treated similarly. Using the [[Logarithm#Product.2C_quotient.2C_power_and_root|power property of logarithms]] it can be derived that &lt;math&gt;\log(\sigma) = 2 \times (\log(\rho) + \log(P_{CR}))&lt;/math&gt;. The value for &lt;math&gt;P_{CR}&lt;/math&gt; for bending is ≈ 0.0316 in Figure 3. Finally, both lines are plotted on the Ashby chart.

[[File:Material-comparison--strength-vs-density plain.svg|thumb|500px|center|frame|'''Figure 3.''' Ashby chart with performance indices plotted for maximum result]]

First, the best bending materials can be found by examining which regions are higher on the graph than the &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\sigma}/\rho&lt;/math&gt; bending line. In this case, some of the foams (blue) and technical ceramics (pink) are higher than the line. Therefore those would be the best bending materials. In contrast, materials which are far below the line (like metals in the bottom-right of the gray region) would be the worst materials.

Lastly, the &lt;math&gt;\sigma/\rho&lt;/math&gt; tension line can be used to "break the tie" between foams and technical ceramics. Since technical ceramics are the only material which is located higher than the tension line, then the best-performing tension materials are technical ceramics. Therefore, the overall best material is a technical ceramics in the top-left of the pink region such as [[boron carbide]].

=== Numerically understanding the chart ===
The performance index can then be plotted on the Ashby chart by converting the equation to a log scale. This is done by taking the log of both sides, and plotting it similar to a line with &lt;math&gt;P_{cr}&lt;/math&gt; being the y-axis intercept. This means that the higher the intercept, the higher the performance of the material. By moving the line up the Ashby chart, the performance index gets higher. Each materials the line passes through, has the performance index listed on the y-axis. So, moving to the top of the chart while still touching a region of material is where the highest performance will be.

As seen from figure 3 the two lines intercept near the top of the graph at Technical ceramics and Composites. This will give a performance index of 120 for tensile loading and 15 for bending. When taking into consideration the cost of the engineering ceramics, especially because the intercept is around the Boron carbide, this would not be the optimal case. A better case with lower performance index but more cost effective solutions is around the Engineering Composites near CFRP.

'''''Meditation by the Sea''''' is an American [[folk art]] [[oil painting]] by an unknown artist from the early 1860s.

The painting is derived from a wood engraving of [[Gay Head]], [[Martha's Vineyard]] by [[David H. Strother]] in the September 21, 1860 issue of ''[[Harper's|Harper's New Monthly]]''.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;

==Description==
Though the receding cliff suggests the artist's familiarity with [[one-point perspective]], the rest of the view is distorted to suggest the vastness of the scene.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;  The artist creates a surreal image by juxtaposing the lone, brooding foreground figure with tiny silhouettes in the distance.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt; Though solitary figures are common in the contemporary [[Luminism (American art style)|luminist]] paintings of the [[Hudson River school]] (to which the artist was likely exposed), the artist's approach to the subject is markedly different.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;  They create a sense of foreboding using a vast horizon and an ominous hanging branch.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;  Based on the date of the Strother engraving, this painting was probably painted near the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]; a sense of dread is visible in the figure's "confrontation with the omnipotence of nature and God".&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;

[[Image:Gay Head.jpg|thumb|left|The engraving in ''[[Harper's|Harper's New Monthly]]'' that inspired ''Meditation by the Sea'']]

==Acquisitions==
Art collector [[Maxim Karolik]] bought the painting from J.B. Neumann for $650 in 1943; it was one of the first 19th-century paintings he acquired.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;&lt;ref name=antiques/&gt;  In 1945 Karolik donated the piece to the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] to inaugurate the M. and M. Karolik Collection of American Art, 1815-1865.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;&lt;ref name=antiques&gt;Troyen, Carol. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_4_159/ai_73410728 "Maxim Karolik folk art"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2233">'''NSCAD conceptual art''' refers to a period beginning in 1969 when [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] (NSCAD), a post-secondary [[art]] school in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]] became an important art centre with an international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Barber, "Conceptual Art: The NSCAD Connection 1967-1973", ''Conceptual Art: The NSCAD Connection 1967-1973'', Halifax: Anna Leonowens Gallery, 1998, p. 11''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1967, the artist [[Garry Kennedy]] was appointed President, and he immediately moved to remake the College from a provincial art school into an international centre for artistic activity. He invited notable artists to come to NSCAD as visiting artists, particularly those involved in [[conceptual art]]. Artists who made significant contributions during this period include [[Vito Acconci]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Claes Oldenburg]].

==NSCAD University Press==
Under the direction of Kennedy, The Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design was established as a vehicle to publish books by and about leading contemporary artists. The Press was instrumental in establishing the university's international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Garry Neill Kennedy, "NSCAD and the Sixties", ''Conceptual Art: The NSCAD Connection 1967-1973'', pp. 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1972 and 1987, 26 titles by such artists as [[Michael Snow]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Gerhard Richter]] and [[Yvonne Rainer]] were published.

'''''Nine Views''''' ({{lang-hr|Devet pogleda}}) is an ambiental [[installation art|installation]] in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] which, together with the sculpture ''Prizemljeno Sunce'' (''The Grounded Sun''), makes up a consistent [[Solar System model|model of the Solar System]].

''Prizemljeno Sunce'' by [[Ivan Kožarić]] was first displayed in 1971 by the building of the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]], and since then changed location a few times.&lt;ref name="jutarnji-2006"/&gt; Since 1994 it has been situated in the Bogovićeva Street. It is simply a bronze sphere around 2 metres in diameter.

In 2004, artist Davor Preis had a two-week exhibition in the Josip Račić Exhibition Hall in Margaretska Street in Zagreb, and afterwards he placed 9 models of the [[planets]] of the [[Solar System]] around Zagreb, to complete a model of the entire solar system. The models' sizes as well as their distances from the ''Prizemljeno Sunce'' are all in the same [[Scale model|scale]] as the ''Prizemljeno Sunce'' itself.&lt;ref name="jutarnji-2006"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.jutarnji.hr/pronadeno-srce-grada/225123/ | language = Croatian | title = Pronađeno srce grada | newspaper = [[Jutarnji list]] | date = 2006-06-27 | accessdate = 2012-04-11 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111229214652/http://www.jutarnji.hr/pronadeno-srce-grada/225123/ | archivedate = 2011-12-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preis did this installation with very little or no publicity, so his installation isn't well known among citizens of Zagreb. On a few occasions individuals or small groups of people, particularly physics students, "discovered" that there was a model of  the solar system in Zagreb.&lt;ref name="jutarnji-2006"/&gt; One of the earliest efforts to find all of the planets was started in November 2004 on the [[web forum]] of the student section of [[Croatian Physics Society]].&lt;ref&gt;http://rasprave.fizika.org/viewtopic.php?t=1212&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The locations of the planets are as follows:

*Mercury - 3 Margaretska Street
*Venus - 3 [[Ban Josip Jelačić Square]]
*Earth - 9 Varšavska Street
*Mars - 21 [[Tkalčićeva Street]]
*Jupiter - 71 Voćarska Street
*Saturn - 1 Račićeva Street
*Uranus - 9 Siget (not at the residential building but at the garage across the street)
*Neptune - Kozari 17
*Pluto - Bologna Alley (underpass) - included in the installation before being demoted to [[dwarf planet]]

The system is at scale 1:680 000 000. Earth's model is about 1.9 cm in size and at 225 m distance from the sun's model, while Pluto's model is 7.7 km away from it.&lt;ref&gt;http://astrogeo.geoinfo.geof.hr/prizsunce/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12419">The '''Nunnehi''' are a race of immortal spirit people in [[Cherokee mythology]]. In the [[Cherokee language]], ''Nunnehi'' literally means "The People Who Live Anywhere", but it is often translated into English as "The People Who Live Forever", or simply "The Immortals". The Cherokee believed the Nunnehi to be a type of [[supernatural]] human being, completely distinct from [[ghosts]] and [[nature spirits]], as well as from [[gods]]. In this sense, the Nunnehi (along with the ''Yunwi Tsunsdi'', or "Little People" in the Cherokee language) are the Cherokee equivalent of [[fairies]] in traditional [[European folklore]]. The belief in fairy-like beings is universal among all ethnicities, including all [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] [[Tribe (Native American)|tribes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Cherokee [[folklore]], the Nunnehi had many underground townhouses throughout the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]], and they were particularly fond of high mountain peaks where no timber ever grew. Hunters would often hear the Nunnehi in the mountains, singing and dancing and beating drums, but when they would go toward the sound, it would shift about and suddenly seem to be coming from behind them or from some other direction, so that the person hearing the sound would never be able to find where it was coming from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judson|first=Katherine B.|title=Native American Legends of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley|year=2000|publisher=Northern Illinois University Press|location=Dekalb|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Dance at Nottely ==
The Nunnehi only appeared to humans when they allowed themselves to be seen. When they did appear, they looked and acted just like other Cherokee. The Nunnehi were very fond of music and dancing, as are the Cherokee. One of the stories about the Nunnehi tells about four Nunnehi women who came to a town called Nottely and danced with the young men there for hours. Nobody knew that they were Nunnehi women; everyone thought they were just women from another village or town. As the women were leaving the dance, a group of men standing outside the townhouse watched the women walk down an open trail to the [[Nottely River]]. When the women reached the river they suddenly disappeared, with no apparent hiding place. It was then that the men realized that the women were Nunnehi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yahula ==
The Nunnehi were very friendly to the Cherokee and often helped lost wanderers, especially during the winter. The Nunnehi would take the person into their warm townhouses until the person was rested and ready to return home,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Randy|title=Mountain Ghost Stories and Curious Tales of Western North Carolina|year=1988|publisher=John F. Blair, Publisher|location=North Carolina|pages=59|author2=Janet Barnett }}&lt;/ref&gt; if the person chose to do so. A well-known story tells about a man named Yahula, who had become separated from a hunting party. His friends searched for him for a long time but eventually gave up and returned to their village, grieving for Yahula, whom they believed was dead. The Nunnehi found Yahula and brought him back to their townhouse to live with them. Yahula became immortal and lived with the Nunnehi for a long time until he began to miss his friends and family. One night Yahula went back to his village to see his friends and family, and he told them what had happened. When they asked Yahula to eat dinner with them, he said he could not, for he had eaten the food of the Nunnehi and could never again eat human food. He told them he had only come back to visit and that he would soon be returning to the Nunnehi. His friends and family begged him to stay, but he refused, telling them he could not choose death with his own people over immortality with the Nunnehi. Yahula then returned to the Nunnehi, but he continued to visit the Cherokee often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Nunnehi Protect the Cherokee Before the Removal in 1838 ==
The Nunnehi often warned the Cherokee of impending danger and protected them in times of need. One of the most well-known stories about the Nunnehi tells how they helped the Cherokee before the [[Cherokee removal|Removal]] in 1838, when the Cherokee were forced to leave their homeland and resettle in [[Oklahoma]]. According to the story, the Nunnehi came to a Cherokee village and told the people to pack up their belongings and to be prepared to leave in seven days to come live with the Nunnehi, for a great catastrophe was about to happen, worse than anything that had ever before happened to the Cherokee. After seven days, the Nunnehi returned for the Cherokee and led them to a large stone deep into the mountains. As the Cherokee watched, the stone rolled away, revealing an entrance into the mountain. Inside the mountain was the most beautiful place the Cherokee had ever seen, and many families rushed into the mountain without ever looking back. However, some of the people refused to enter, and instead chose to stay outside and face whatever was about to happen to them. The people who remained outside were later forced to leave their homes and resettle in Oklahoma. The people who chose to live with the Nunnehi escaped the fate of their fellow Cherokee. According to the story, it is from this group of Cherokee that the small number of modern Cherokee who still live on their native land is descended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duncan|first=Barbara|title=Living Stories of the Cherokee|year=1998|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|pages=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Removed Townhouse ==
There are also other similar stories that tell about how the Nunnehi invited Cherokee people to come live with them in order to avoid war and misfortune. One well-known story tells about a time long before the time of the Removal, when the Nunnehi told a group of Cherokee that they would return in seven days to carry away the townhouse along with anyone inside it. The Nunnehi warned the people not to shout or make any sound as the townhouse was being carried away. On the seventh day there was a sound like thunder that grew louder and louder as it approached the village. Despite the Nunnehi's warning to the Cherokee to remain quiet, some of the people became frightened and screamed when the ground began to shake as the Nunnehi lifted the townhouse off the ground. Some of the Nunnehi were startled by the scream and dropped a part of the townhouse, which fell to the ground and became the [[mound]] at a village called Setsi. The Nunnehi steadied themselves and carried off the remaining part of the townhouse, with the people still in it, to a mountain called Lone Peak, where it was changed to solid rock and the people inside it became invisible and immortal like the Nunnehi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Nunnehi of Hiwassee River ==
In another story, the Nunnehi invited a group of Cherokee to come live with them, and after the seven days had passed, they returned and took the people to live with them underneath [[Hiwassee River]], near the area where Shooting Creek comes in. The Cherokee who went to live with the Nunnehi under the river would sometimes catch the fish-drags of their kinsmen because they did not want to be forgotten. On warm summer days, when the wind ripples the surface of the water, their voices could sometimes be heard by those floating by on the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Nunnehi Warriors of Nikwasi ==
The Nunnehi sometimes assisted the Cherokee in times of war. One of the most well-known stories about the Nunnehi tells about how they fought alongside the Cherokee when their land was invaded by a powerful, unknown tribe of American Indians from the southeast. [[Nikwasi]] was the most ancient settlement of the Cherokee. the invading tribe attacked Nikwasi one morning just before daybreak. The warriors of Nikwasi fought back but were eventually overpowered. A stranger then appeared and told the Nikwasi chief to retreat and that he himself would fight the enemy. The chief did as he was instructed, believing the stranger to be a chief from another village who had come with reinforcements. The mound at Nikwasi then opened up and hundreds of Nunnehi warriors poured out and began to approach the battlefield. When the Nunnehi warriors reached the invading tribe they became invisible and slaughtered all but a few who had surrendered and begged for mercy. The Nunnehi told the invading tribe that they got what they deserved for attacking a peaceful tribe, and then sent them back to where they came from so they could deliver the news to their people and warn them to never again attack Nikwasi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Nunnehi Defend Franklin, North Carolina ==
During the [[American Civil War]], by which time Nikwasi had become known as [[Franklin, North Carolina]], a group of [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers approached Franklin with the intention of burning it to the ground. A group of scouts returned to their commanding officers and warned them not to attack the town because it was heavily guarded by soldiers on every corner. However, the town was defenseless, as every able-bodied person had already left to fight in the war. Unaware of this fact, the Union soldiers then changed their course toward [[Atlanta, Georgia]], burning every town in their path. According to the Cherokee, it was the Nunnehi that had protected Franklin from the Union soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duncan|first=Barbara|title=Living Stories of the Cherokee|year=1998|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|pages=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Abandoned Nunnehi Townhouse ==
There is a story that tells about how some of the Nunnehi eventually decided to leave their home. Near the Cherokee town of [[Tugaloo]] there was a circular depression in the ground, the size of a townhouse. The inside of the depression was waist-deep and was always clean as though it had been cared for by unknown hands. Travelers passing by would often throw rocks and logs into the depression, but when they returned the logs and rocks would always be lying far from the depression. The Cherokee believed the place to be a Nunnehi townhouse, and so they always avoided the place out of respect. Eventually, some logs had been thrown into the depression and were allowed to remain there, and the Cherokee concluded that the Nunnehi had become annoyed by the presence of the white men and had abandoned their townhouse forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Nunnehi in Cherokee Folklore After The Removal in 1838 ==
After the Removal in 1838, when the Cherokee were forced to leave their homeland and resettle in Oklahoma, one of their greatest regrets was that they were forced to leave behind forever their relatives who had gone to live with the Nunnehi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Storytelling]] always has been and is still an important tradition in Cherokee [[culture]], and the Nunnehi remain a popular subject of many stories. There are even some Cherokee still living in their native land that claim to have had encounters with the Nunnehi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duncan|first=Barbara|title=Living Stories of the Cherokee|year=1998|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|pages=183–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of [[art]], '''prehistoric art''' is all art produced in preliterate, [[Prehistory|prehistorical]] cultures beginning somewhere in very late geological history, and generally continuing until that culture either develops writing or other methods of record-keeping, or makes significant contact with another culture that has, and that makes some record of major historical events. At this point [[ancient art]] begins, for the older literate cultures. The end-date for what is covered by the term thus varies greatly between different parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;"The term "prehistoric" ceases to be valid some thousands of years B.C. in the Middle East but remains a warranted description down to about 500 A.D. in Ireland", Review by "A. T. L." of ''Prehistoric Art'' by T. G. E. Powell, ''The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland'', Vol. 97, No. 1 (1967), p. 95, [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25509644 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest human artifacts showing evidence of workmanship with an artistic purpose are the subject of some debate. It is clear that such workmanship  existed by 40,000 years ago in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era, although it is quite possible that it began earlier. In September 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the earliest known drawing by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', which is estimated to be 73,000 years old, much earlier than the 43,000 years old artifacts understood to be the earliest known modern human drawings found previously.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180912" /&gt;

Engraved shells created by [[homo erectus]] dating as far back as 500,000 years ago have been found, although experts disagree on whether these engravings can be properly classified as ‘art’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429983.200-shell-art-made-300000-years-before-humans-evolved.html#.VISuEibfWnM|title=Shell 'art' made 300,000 years before humans evolved - New Scientist|work=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Upper Palaeolithic through to the [[Mesolithic]], [[cave painting]]s and portable art such as  [[figurine]]s and [[bead]]s predominated, with decorative figured workings also seen on some utilitarian objects. In the [[Neolithic]] evidence of early [[pottery]] appeared, as did [[sculpture]] and the construction of [[megalith]]s. Early [[rock art]] also first appeared during this period. The advent of [[metalworking]] in the [[Bronze Age]] brought additional media available for use in making art, an increase in stylistic diversity, and the creation of objects that did not have any obvious function other than art. It also saw the development in some areas of artisans, a class of people specializing in the production of art, as well as [[history of writing|early writing systems]]. By the [[Iron Age]], civilizations with writing had arisen from [[Ancient Egypt]] to [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]].

Many indigenous peoples from around the world continued to produce artistic works distinctive to their geographic area and culture, until exploration and commerce brought record-keeping methods to them.  Some cultures, notably the [[Maya civilization]], independently developed writing during the time they flourished, which was then later lost.  These cultures may be classified as prehistoric, especially if their writing systems have not been deciphered.

===Lower and Middle Paleolithic===
{{main|Art of the Middle Paleolithic}}

The earliest undisputed art originated with the [[Aurignacian]] [[archaeological culture]] in the Upper Paleolithic. However, there is some evidence that the preference for the [[aesthetic]] emerged in the [[Middle Paleolithic]], from 100,000 to 50,000 years ago. Some archaeologists have interpreted certain Middle Paleolithic artifacts as early examples of artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/science/14paint.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of New York City [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/preh/hd_preh.htm ''Introduction to Prehistoric Art''] Retrieved 2012-5-12&lt;/ref&gt;
The symmetry of artifacts, evidence of attention to the detail of tool shape, has led some investigators to conceive of [[Acheulean]] [[hand axe]]s and especially laurel points as having been produced with a degree of artistic expression.

Similarly, a zig-zag etching made with a shark tooth on a freshwater clam-shell around 500,000 years ago (i.e. well into the [[Lower Paleolithic]]), associated with ''[[Homo erectus]]'', was proposed as the earliest evidence of artistic activity in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joordens|first1=Josephine C. A.|last2=d’Errico|first2=Francesco|last3=Wesselingh|first3=Frank P.|last4=Munro|first4=Stephen|last5=de Vos|first5=John|last6=Wallinga|first6=Jakob|last7=Ankjærgaard|first7=Christina|last8=Reimann|first8=Tony|last9=Wijbrans|first9=Jan R.|last10=Kuiper|first10=Klaudia F.|last11=Mücher|first11=Herman J.|last12=Coqueugniot|first12=Hélène|last13=Prié|first13=Vincent|last14=Joosten|first14=Ineke|last15=van Os|first15=Bertil|last16=Schulp|first16=Anne S.|last17=Panuel|first17=Michel|last18=van der Haas|first18=Victoria|last19=Lustenhouwer|first19=Wim|last20=Reijmer|first20=John J.

There are other claims of Middle Paleolithic sculpture, dubbed the  "[[Venus of Tan-Tan]]" (before 300 kya)&lt;ref name="Chase145"&gt;[[#Chase|Chase]], pp. 145-146&lt;/ref&gt;  and the "[[Venus of Berekhat Ram]]" (250 kya). In 2002 in [[Blombos cave]], situated in [[South Africa]], stones were discovered engraved with grid or cross-hatch patterns, dated to some 70,000 years ago. This suggested to some researchers that [[Human#Paleolithic|early ''Homo sapiens'']] were capable of abstraction and production of abstract art or symbolic art. Several archaeologists including [[Richard Klein (paleoanthropologist)|Richard Klein]] are hesitant to accept the Blombos caves as the first example of actual art.

In September 2018 the discovery in South Africa of the earliest known drawing by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' was announced, which is estimated to be 73,000 years old, much earlier than the 43,000 years old artifacts understood to be the earliest known modern human drawings found previously.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180912" /&gt;

===Upper Paleolithic===
{{Main|Art of the Upper Paleolithic}}
[[File:Lascaux 04.jpg|thumb|[[Aurochs]] on a cave painting in [[Lascaux]], France]]
In November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the oldest known [[Figurative art|figurative art painting]], over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of [[Lubang Jeriji Saléh]] on the [[Indonesia|Indonesian]] island of [[Borneo]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20181107-cz"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=In Cave in Borneo Jungle, Scientists Find Oldest Figurative Painting in the World - A cave drawing in Borneo is at least 40,000 years old, raising intriguing questions about creativity in ancient societies. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/science/oldest-cave-art-borneo.html |date=7 November 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=8 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20181107"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aubert, M. et al. |title=Palaeolithic cave art in Borneo |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0679-9 |date=7 November 2018 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |accessdate=8 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the oldest undisputed works of figurative art were found in the [[Schwäbische Alb]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], Germany. The earliest of these, the [[Venus figurine]] known as the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]] and the [[Lion-man|Lion-man figurine]], date to some 40,000 years ago.
[[File:Venus of Willendorf frontview retouched 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Venus of Willendorf]]]]
Further depictional art from the Upper Palaeolithic period (broadly 40,000 to 10,000 years ago) includes [[cave painting]] (e.g., those at [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]], [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira]], [[Pech Merle]], [[Caves of Arcy-sur-Cure|Arcy-sur-Cure]] and [[Lascaux]]) and [[portable art]]: Venus figurines like the [[Venus of Willendorf]], as well as animal carvings like the [[Swimming Reindeer]], [[Wolverine pendant of Les Eyzies]], and several of the objects known as [[bâtons de commandement]].

Paintings in [[Pettakere cave]] on the Indonesian island of [[Sulawesi]] are up to 40,000 years old, a similar date to the oldest European cave art, which may suggest an older common origin for this type of art, perhaps in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/08/354166930/indonesian-cave-paintings-as-old-as-europes-ancient-art|title=Indonesian Cave Paintings As Old As Europe's Ancient Art|date=8 October 2014|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monumental open-air art in Europe from this period includes the rock-art at [[Côa Valley Paleolithic Art|Côa Valley]] and [[Mazouco]] in Portugal, [[Domingo García, Segovia|Domingo García]] and [[Siega Verde]] in Spain, and {{illm|Rocher gravé de Fornols|fr}} in France.

A cave at [[Turobong cave|Turobong]] in South Korea containing human remains has been found to contain carved deer bones and depictions of deer that may be as much as 40,000 years old.&lt;ref name="Portal25"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  Petroglyphs of deer or reindeer found at Sokchang-ri may also date to the Upper Paleolithic.  [[Sherd|Potsherds]] in a style reminiscent of early Japanese work have been found at Kosan-ri on [[Jeju island]], which, due to lower sea levels at the time, would have been accessible from Japan.&lt;ref name="Portal26"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest [[petroglyph]]s  are dated to approximately the Mesolithic and late [[Upper Paleolithic]] boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.
The earliest undisputed [[Rock art#Africa|African rock art]] dates back about 10,000 years. The first naturalistic paintings of humans found in Africa date back about 8,000 years apparently originating in the [[Nile River]] valley, spread as far west as Mali about 10,000 years ago.
Noted sites containing early art include [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] in southern Algeria, [[Tadrart Acacus]] in Libya (A Unesco World Heritage site), and the [[Tibesti Mountains]] in northern Chad.&lt;ref name="Coulson150"&gt;[[#Coulson|Coulson]], pp. 150–155&lt;/ref&gt; Rock carvings at the [[Wonderwerk Cave]] in South Africa have been dated to this age.&lt;ref name="Thackeray"&gt;[[#Thackeray|Thackeray]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Contentious dates as far back as 29,000 years have been obtained at a site in Tanzania.  A site at the [[Apollo 11 Cave]] complex in Namibia has been dated to 27,000 years.

[[Göbekli Tepe]] in Turkey has circles of massive T-shaped stone pillars dating back to the 10th–8th millennium BCE; the world's oldest known megaliths. Many of the pillars are decorated with abstract, enigmatic pictograms and carved animal reliefs.

Asia was the cradle for several significant civilizations, most notably those of China and South Asia.  The prehistory of eastern Asia is especially interesting, as the relatively early introduction of writing and historical record-keeping in China has a notable impact on the immediately surrounding cultures and geographic areas.  Little of the very rich traditions of the [[art of Mesopotamia]] counts as prehistoric, as writing was introduced so early there, but neighbouring cultures such as [[Urartu]], [[Luristan]] and [[Persia]] had significant and complex artistic traditions.

===Indian sub-continent===
The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the  [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. The [[Indus Valley civilization]] produced fine small [[cylinder seal]]s and sculptures, and may have been literate, but after its collapse there are relatively few artistic remains until the literate period, probably as perishable materials were used.

===China===
[[File:Gold Mask (黄金面罩).jpg|thumb|left|Two bronze heads from [[Sanxingdui]], covered with [[gold leaf]]s]]
Prehistoric artwork such as painted pottery in [[Neolithic]] China can be traced back to the [[Yangshao culture]] and [[Longshan culture]] of the Yellow River valley. During China's [[Bronze Age]], Chinese of the ancient [[Shang Dynasty]] and [[Zhou Dynasty]] produced multitudes of [[Chinese ritual bronzes]], which are elaborate versions of ordinary vessels and other objects used in rituals of [[ancestor veneration in China|ancestor veneration]], decorated with ''[[taotie]]'' motifs and by the late Shang [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]].  Discoveries in 1987 in [[Sanxingdui]] in central China revealed a previously unknown pre-literate Bronze Age culture whose artefacts included spectacular very large bronze figures (example left), and which appeared culturally very different from the contemporary late Shang, which has always formed part of the account of the continuous tradition of Chinese culture.

===Japan===

According to archeological evidence, the [[Jōmon]] people in ancient Japan were among the first to develop [[Jomon pottery|pottery]], dated from the [[11th millennium BCE]]. With growing sophistication, the Jōmon created patterns by impressing the wet clay with braided or unbraided cord and sticks.

[[File:Korea-Neolithic.age-Pot-01.jpg|thumb|left|A Korean Neolithic pot found in Busan, 3500 BCE]]

The earliest examples of Korean art consist of Stone Age works dating from 3000 BCE. These mainly consist of [[Votive offering|votive sculptures]], although petroglyphs have also been recently rediscovered. [[Rock art]]s, elaborate [[stone tools]], and [[pottery|potteries]] were also prevalent.

This early period was followed by the art styles of various Korean kingdoms and dynasties. In these periods, artists often adopted Chinese style in their artworks. However, Koreans not only adopted but also modified Chinese culture with a native preference for simple elegance, purity of nature and spontaneity. This filtering of Chinese styles later influenced Japanese artistic traditions, due to cultural and geographical circumstances.

The prehistory of Korean ends with the founding of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], which are documented in the [[Samguk Sagi]], a 12th-century CE text written in [[Classical Chinese]] (the written language of the literati in traditional Korea), as beginning in the 1st century BCE; some mention of earlier history is also made in Chinese texts, like the 3rd-century CE [[Sanguo Zhi]].

====Jeulmun period====
{{further|Jeulmun pottery period}}
Clearer evidence of culture emerges in the late Neolithic, known in Korea as the [[Jeulmun pottery period]], with pottery similar to that found in the adjacent regions of China, decorated with Z-shaped patterns.  The earliest Neolithic sites with pottery remains, for example [[Osan-ri]], date to 6000–4500 BCE.&lt;ref name="Portal26"/&gt;  This pottery is characterized by comb patterning, with the pot frequently having a pointed base.  Ornaments from this time include masks made of shell, with notable finds at [[Dongsam-dong Shell Midden|Tongsam-dong]], Osan-ri, and Sinam-ri.  Hand-shaped clay figurines have been found at Nongpo-dong.&lt;ref name="Portal27"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mumun period====
{{further|Mumun pottery period}}
[[File:Korea-Bronze.age-Jinju-Pot-01.jpg|thumb|right|Large Middle Mumun (c. 800 BCE) storage vessel unearthed from a pit-house in or near [[Daepyeong]]]]
During the [[Mumun pottery period]], roughly between 1500 BCE and 300 BCE, agriculture expanded, and evidence of larger-scale political structures became apparent, as villages grew and some burials became more elaborate.  Megalithic tombs and [[dolmen]]s throughout Korea date to this time.  The pottery of the time is in a distinctive undecorated style.  Many of these changes in style may have occurred due to immigration of new peoples from the north, although this is a subject of debate.&lt;ref name="Portal29"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  At a number of sites in southern Korea there are rock art panels that are thought to date from this period, mainly for stylistic reasons.&lt;ref name="Portal33"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

While the exact date of the introduction of bronzework into Korea is also a matter of debate, it is clear that bronze was being worked by about 700 BCE.  Finds include stylistically distinctive daggers, mirrors, and belt buckles, with evidence by the 1st century BCE of a widespread, locally distinctive, bronzeworking culture.&lt;ref name="Portal34_35"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protohistoric Korea====
[[File:Goguryeo tomb mural.jpg|thumb|left|[[Goguryeo tomb mural]]]]
The time between 300 BCE and the founding and stabilization of the Three Kingdoms around 300 CE is characterized artistically and archaeologically by increasing trade with China and Japan, something that Chinese histories of the time corroborate.  The expansionist Chinese invaded and established [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] in northern Korea as early as the 1st century BCE; they were driven out by the 4th century CE.&lt;ref name="Portal38"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  The remains of some of these, especially that of [[Lelang Commandery|Lelang]], near modern [[Pyongyang]], have yielded many artifacts in a typical Han style.&lt;ref name="Portal39"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese histories also record the beginnings of iron works in Korea in the 1st century BCE.  Stoneware and [[kiln]]-fired pottery also appears to date from this time, although there is controversy over the dates.&lt;ref name="Portal40"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  Pottery of distinctly Japanese origin is found in Korea, and metalwork of Korean origin is found in northeastern China.&lt;ref name="Portal41"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steppes Art===
[[File:Placca pantera, da regione di krasnodar, kurgan chertomlyk, oro a sbalzo e cesellato, fine VII sec ac..JPG|thumb|Late 7th-century [[Scythia]]n plaque of a leopard]]
{{main|Scythian art}}
Superb samples of [[Steppes art]] - mostly golden jewellery and trappings for horse - are found over a vast expanses of land stretching from [[Hungary]] to [[Mongolia]]. Dating from the period between the 7th and 3rd centuries BCE, the objects are usually diminutive, as may be expected from nomadic people always on the move. Art of the steppes is primarily an [[animal style|animal art]], i.e., combat scenes involving several animals (real or imaginary) or single animal figures (such as golden stags) predominate. The best known of the various peoples involved are the [[Scythians]], at the European end of the steppe, who were especially likely to bury gold items.

Among the most famous finds was made in 1947, when the Soviet archaeologist [[Sergei Rudenko]] discovered a royal burial at [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]], [[Altay Mountains]], which featured - among many other important objects - the most ancient extant [[pile rug]], probably made in Persia.  Unusually for prehistoric burials, those in the northern parts of the area may preserve organic materials such as wood and textiles that normally would decay.  Steppes people both gave and took influences from neighbouring cultures from Europe to China, and later Scythian pieces are heavily influenced by ancient Greek style, and probably often made by Greeks in Scythia.

==Near East==
[[File:Gobekli Tepe 2.jpg|thumb|Pillar from [[Göbekli Tepe]] with [[low relief]]s of what are believed to be a [[bull]], [[fox]], and [[Crane (bird)|crane]], 9600 to 8800 BCE.]]
The ''[[Ain Sakhri Lovers]]'' from modern [[Israel]], is a small [[Natufian]] carving in [[calcite]], from about 9,000 BCE.  Around the same time, the extraordinary site of [[Göbekli Tepe]] in eastern [[Turkey]] was begun. During the first phase, belonging to the [[pre-pottery Neolithic A|Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] (PPNA), circles of massive but neatly shaped T-shaped stone pillars were erected – the world's oldest known [[megalith]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qR5TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|title=The Archaeology of Malta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107006690|page=47|language=en|last1=Sagona|first1=Claudia|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200 pillars in about 20 circles are currently known through [[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|geophysical surveys]]. Each pillar has a height of up to {{convert|6|m|0|abbr=on}} and weighs up to 10 tons. They are fitted into sockets that were hewn out of the [[bedrock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Curry |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/gobekli-tepe.html |date=November 2008 |publisher=Smithsonian.com |title=Gobekli Tepe: The World’s First Temple? |accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second phase, belonging to the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (PPNB), the erected pillars are smaller and stood in rectangular rooms with floors of polished [[Lime (material)|lime]]. On the smoothed surfaces of the pillars there are [[relief]]s of animals, abstract patterns, and some human figures.

By convention, prehistory in the Near East is taken to continue until the rise of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 6th century BCE, although writing existed in the region from nearly 2,000 years earlier. On that basis the very rich and long tradition of the [[art of Mesopotamia]], as well as [[Assyrian sculpture]], [[Hittite art]] and many other traditions such as the [[Luristan bronzes]] all fall under prehistoric art, even if covered with texts extolling the ruler, as many Assyrian palace reliefs are.

==Europe==

===Stone Age===
[[File:Prehistoric Hand Outline Cosquer Cave.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Hand stencil]], [[Cosquer Cave]], France, c. 27,000 years old]]
The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] includes carvings on antler and bone, especially of animals, as well as the so-called [[Venus figurines]] and [[cave paintings]], discussed above.  Despite a warmer climate, the [[Mesolithic]] period undoubtedly shows a falling-off from the heights of the preceding period.  [[Rock art]] is found in Scandinavia and northern Russia, and around the Mediterranean in [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin|eastern Spain]] and the earliest of the [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica]] in northern Italy, but not in between these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 75-98&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of portable art include painted pebbles from the [[Azilian]] culture which succeeded the [[Magdalenian]], and patterns on utilitarian objects, like the paddles from [[Tybrind Vig]], [[Denmark]].  The Mesolithic statues of [[Lepenski Vir]] at the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]], [[Serbia]] date to the [[7th millennium BCE]] and represent either humans or mixtures of humans and fish.  Simple pottery began to develop in various places, even in the absence of farming.

====Mesolithic====
Compared to the preceding Upper Paleolithic and the following Neolithic, there is rather less surviving art from the Mesolithic.  The [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]], which probably spreads across from the Upper Paleolithic, is a widespread phenomenon, much less well known than the cave-paintings of the Upper Paleolithic, with which it makes an interesting contrast. The sites are now mostly cliff faces in the open air, and the subjects are now mostly human rather than animal, with large groups of small figures; there are 45 figures at [[Roca dels Moros]].  Clothing is shown, and scenes of dancing, fighting, hunting and food-gathering.  The figures are much smaller than the animals of Paleolithic art, and depicted much more schematically, though often in energetic poses.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, Nancy K., ''Prehistoric Art in Europe'', Penguin (Pelican, now Yale, History of Art), pp. 87-96, 1968 (nb 1st edn.)&lt;/ref&gt;  A few small engraved [[pendant]]s with suspension holes and simple engraved designs are known, some from northern Europe in [[amber]], and one from [[Starr Carr]] in Britain in [[shale]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2016/research/mesolithic-shale-pendant/ "11,000 year old pendant is earliest known Mesolithic art in Britain"], University of York&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock art in the [[Urals]] appears to show similar changes after the Paleolithic, and the wooden [[Shigir Idol]] is a rare survival of what may well have been a very common material for sculpture.  It is a plank of [[larch]] carved with geometric motifs, but topped with a human head. Now in fragments, it would apparently have been over 5 metres tall when made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.livescience.com/62404-shigir-idol-age-and-new-face.html |title=This Eerie, Human-Like Figure Is Twice As Old As Egypt's Pyramids |last=Geggel |first=Laura |work=[[Live Science]] |date=April 25, 2018 |access-date=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neolithic====

In [[Central Europe]], many [[Neolithic]] cultures, like [[Linearbandkeramic]], [[Lengyel]] and [[Vinča culture|Vinča]], produced female (rarely male) and animal statues that can be called art, and elaborate pottery decoration in, for example, the [[Želiesovce]] and painted [[Lengyel]] style.

[[Megalithic]] (i.e., large stone) monuments are found in the Neolithic Era from [[Malta]] to Portugal, through France, and across southern England to most of Wales and Ireland. They are also found in northern Germany and Poland, as well as in Egypt in the [[Sahara desert]] (at [[Nabta Playa]] and other sites). The best preserved of all temples and the oldest free standing structures are the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta]]. They start in the 5th millennium BC, though some authors speculate on Mesolithic roots. One of the best-known prehistoric sites is [[Stonehenge]], part of the [[Stonehenge World Heritage Site]] which contains hundreds of monuments and archaeological sites.  Monuments have been found throughout most of Western and Northern Europe, notably at [[Carnac]], France.
[[File:Newgrange Entrance Stone.jpg|thumb|Entrance stone with megalithic art at Newgrange]]
The large mound tomb at [[Newgrange]], Ireland, dating to around 3200 BC, has its entrance marked with a massive stone carved with a complex [[Triple spiral|design of spirals]]. The mound at nearby [[Knowth]] has large flat rocks with rock engravings on their vertical faces all around its circumference, for which various meanings have been suggested, including depictions of the local valley, and the oldest known image of the Moon. Many of these monuments were megalithic tombs, and archaeologists speculate that most have religious significance. Knowth is reputed to have approximately one third of all megalithic art in Western Europe.

In the central Alps, the [[Camunni]] made some 350,000 petroglyphs: see [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica]].

===Bronze Age===
[[File:Tanumshede 2005 rock carvings 5.jpg|left|thumb|Three men performing a ritual, [[Bohuslän]], [[Sweden]]]]
During the 3rd millennium BCE, the [[Bronze Age]] began in Europe, bringing with it a new medium for art. The increased efficiency of bronze tools also meant an increase in productivity, which led to a surplus — the first step in the creation of a class of artisans. Because of the increased wealth of society, luxury goods began to be created, especially decorated weapons.

Examples include ceremonial bronze helmets, ornamental ax-heads and swords, elaborate instruments such as [[lur]]er, and other ceremonial objects without a practical purpose, such as the oversize [[Oxborough Dirk]].  Special objects were made in gold; many more gold objects have survived from Western and Central Europe than from the Iron Age, many mysterious and strange objects ranging from [[Gold lunula|lunula]]s, apparently an Irish speciality, the [[Mold Cape]] and [[Golden hat]]s. Pottery from Central Europe can be elaborately shaped and decorated. [[Rock art]], showing scenes from the religious rituals have been found in many areas, for example in [[Bohuslän]], [[Sweden]] and the [[Val Camonica]] in northern [[Italy]].

In the Mediterranean, the [[Minoan civilization]] was highly developed, with palace complexes from which sections of [[fresco]]s have been excavated.  Contemporary [[Ancient Egyptian art]] and that of other advanced Near Eastern cultures can no longer be treated as "prehistoric".

===Iron Age===
[[File:Hochdorf golden shoes ornaments.jpg|thumb|left|Gold shoe plaques from the [[Iron Age]] [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave]], Germany, {{circa|lk=no|530}}&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
{{Main|Celtic art}}

The [[Iron Age]] saw the development of anthropomorphic sculptures, such as the [[warrior of Hirschlanden]], and the statue from the [[Glauberg]], Germany. [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] artists in the early Iron Age favored geometric, abstract designs perhaps influenced by trade links with the Classical world.

The more elaborate and curvilinear [[La Tène style]] developed in Europe in the later Iron Age from a centre in the [[Rhine]] valley but it soon spread across the continent. The rich chieftain classes appear to have encouraged ostentation and Classical influences such as bronze drinking vessels attest to a new fashion for wine drinking. Communal eating and drinking were an important part of [[Celt]]ic society and culture and much of their art was often expressed through plates, knives, [[cauldron]]s and cups. [[Horse tack]] and weaponry were also decorated. Mythical animals were a common motif along with religious and natural subjects and their depiction is a mix between the naturalistic and the stylized. [[Megalithic art]] was still sometimes practiced, examples include the carved limestone pillars of the sanctuary at Entremont in modern-day France. Personal adornment included [[torc]] necklaces whilst the introduction of [[coin]]age provided a further opportunity for artistic expression.  The coins of this period are derivatives of Greek and Roman types, but showing the more exuberant Celtic artistic style.
[[File:Romano-Celtic mirror (Desborough).jpg|thumb|A 1st century BCE mirror found in [[Desborough]], England, showing the spiral and trumpet motif]]

The famous late 4th century BCE [[Waldalgesheim chariot burial]] in the [[Rhineland]] produced many fine examples of La Tène art including a bronze flagon and bronze plaques with [[repoussé]] human figures. Many pieces had curvy, organic styles though to be derived from Classical tendril patterns.

In much of western Europe elements of this artistic style can be discerned surviving in the art and architecture of the Roman colonies. In particular in Britain and Ireland there is a tenuous continuity through the Roman period, enabling Celtic motifs to resurface with new vigour in the Christian [[Insular art]] from the 6th century onwards.

The sophisticated [[Etruscan culture]] developed from the 9th to 2nd centuries, with considerable influence from the Greeks, before finally being absorbed by the Romans.  By the end of the period they had developed writing, but early [[Etruscan art]] can be called prehistoric.

==Africa==
[[Ancient Egypt]] falls outside the scope of this article; it had a close relationship with the [[Sudan]] in particular, known in this period as [[Nubia]], where there were advanced cultures from the 4th millennium BCE, such as the "[[A-Group]]", "[[C-Group]]", and the [[Kingdom of Kush]].

===Southern Africa===

[[File:San Painting, Ukalamba Drakensberge 1.JPG|left|thumb|[[San rock art|San rock painting]] of an [[Taurotragus|eland]] at [[Drakensberg]]]]
In September 2018, scientists{{who?|date=October 2018}} reported the discovery of the earliest known drawing by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'',{{where?|date=October 2018}} which is estimated to be 73,000 years old, much earlier than the 43,000 years old artifacts understood to be the earliest known modern human drawings found previously.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180912"&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas|title=Oldest Known Drawing by Human Hands Discovered in South African Cave |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/science/oldest-drawing-ever-found.html |date=12 September 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=15 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


There is a significant body of rock painting in the region around [[Matobo National Park]] of Zimbabwe dating from as early as 6000 BCE to 500 CE.&lt;ref name="Coulson86"&gt;[[#Coulson|Coulson]], p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant [[San rock art|San rock painting]]s exist in the [[Waterberg National Park|Waterberg]] area above the [[Palala River]] and around [[Drakensberg]] in South Africa, some of which are considered to derive from the period 8000 BCE.  These images are very clear and depict a variety of human and [[wildlife]] motifs, especially [[antelope]].  There appears to be a fairly continuous history of rock painting in this area; some of the art clearly dates into the 19th century.  They include depictions of horses with riders, which were not introduced to the area until the 1820s.&lt;ref name="Coulson80"&gt;[[#Coulson|Coulson]], pp. 80–82&lt;/ref&gt;

Namibia, in addition to the [[Apollo 11 Cave]] complex, has a significant array of San rock art near [[Twyfelfontein]].  This work is several thousand years old, and appears to end with the arrival of pastoral tribes in the area.&lt;ref name="UnescoTwyfel"&gt;[[#UnescoTwyfel|Unesco World Heritage designation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horn of Africa===
[[File:Laas Geel.jpg|thumb|Long-horned [[cattle]] and other [[rock art]] in the [[Laas Geel]] complex.]]
[[Laas Geel]] is a complex of [[cave]]s and [[rock shelter]]s in northwestern [[Somalia]]. Famous for their rock art, the caves are located in a rural area on the outskirts of [[Hargeisa]]. They contain some of the earliest known cave paintings in the [[Horn of Africa]], many of which depict pastoral scenes. Laas Geel's rock art is estimated to date back to somewhere between [[9th millennium BCE|9,000]]–[[8th millennium BCE|8,000]] and [[3rd millennium BCE|3,000]] [[BCE]].

In 2008, archaeologists also announced the discovery of cave paintings in Somalia's northern [[Dhambalin]] region, which the researchers suggest includes one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is in the Ethiopian-Arabian style, dated to 1000 to 3000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Tdodras"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mire|first=Sada|title=The Discovery of Dhambalin Rock Art Site, Somaliland|journal=African Archaeological Review|year=2008|volume=25|pages=153–168|url=http://www.mbali.info/doc494.htm|accessdate=22 June 2013|doi=10.1007/s10437-008-9032-2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627100400/http://www.mbali.info/doc494.htm|archivedate=27 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guafcpaonas"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alberge|first=Dalya|title=UK archaeologist finds cave paintings at 100 new African sites|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/17/cave-paintings-found-in-somaliland|accessdate=25 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prehistoric art in the Horn region include stone [[megalith]]s and engravings, some of which are 3,500 years old. The town of Dillo in [[Ethiopia]] has a hilltop covered with stone [[stele|stelae]]. It is one of several such sites in southern Ethiopia dating from historic period{{Clarification needed|date=October 2018}} (10th-14th centuries).&lt;ref name="Coulson147"&gt;[[#Coulson|Coulson]], p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saharan Africa===
{{See also|Saharan rock art}}
[[File:Sleeping Antelope Tin Taghirt.jpg|thumb|A [[petroglyph]]ic [[Saharan rock art|Saharan rock carving]] from southern [[Algeria]] depicting an [[antelope]] or [[gazelle]].]]
The early art of this region has been divided into five periods:

* Bubalus Period, roughly 12-8 kya
* Round Head Period, roughly 10-8 kya
* Pastoral Period, roughly 7.5-4 kya
* Horse Period, roughly 3-2 kya
* Camel Period, 2,000 years ago to the present
[[File:Libya 5041 Petroglyphs Tadrart Acacus Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rock carving of an elephant at [[Tadrart Acacus]]]]
Works of the Bubalus period span the Sahara, with the finest work, carvings of naturalistically depicted megafauna, concentrated in the central highlands.  The Round Head Period is dominated by paintings of strangely shaped human forms, and few animals, suggesting the artists were foragers.  These works are largely limited to [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] and the [[Tadrart Acacus]].  Toward the end of the period, images of domesticated animals, as well as decorative clothing and headdresses appear.  Pastoral Period art was more focused on domestic scenes, including herding and dancing.  The quality of artwork declined, as figures became more simplified.&lt;ref name="Coulson156"&gt;[[#Coulson|Coulson]], pp. 156–160&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horse Period began in the eastern Sahara and spread west.  Depictions from this period include carvings and paintings of horses, chariots, and warriors with metal weapons, although there are also frequent depictions of wildlife such as giraffes.  Humans are generally depicted in a stylized way.  Some of the chariot art bears resemblance to temple carvings from ancient [[Egypt]].  Occasionally, art panels are accompanied by [[Tifinagh]] script, still in use by the [[Berber people]] and the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] today; however, modern Tuareg are generally unable to read these inscriptions.  The final Camel period features carvings and paintings in which camels predominate, but also include humans with swords, and later, guns; the art of this time is relatively crude.&lt;ref name="Coulson160_205"&gt;[[#Coulson|Coulson]], pp. 160–162,205&lt;/ref&gt;

Much Olmec art is highly stylized and uses an iconography reflective of the religious meaning of the artworks. Some Olmec art, however, is surprisingly naturalistic, displaying an accuracy of depiction of human anatomy perhaps equaled in the pre-Columbian New World only by the best Maya Classic-era art. Olmec art-forms emphasize monumental statuary and small [[jade]] carvings. A common theme is to be found in representations of a divine [[jaguar]]. [[Olmec figurine]]s were also found abundantly through their period.

[[Peru]], including an area of the central [[Andes]] stretching from [[Ecuador]] to northern [[Chile]], has a rich cultural history, with evidence of human habitation dating to roughly 10,000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Lavalle88"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the emergence of ceramics in this region around 1850 BCE, cave paintings and beads have been found.  These finds include rock paintings that controversially date as far back as 9500 BCE in the [[Toquepala Caves]].&lt;ref name="Lavallee94"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  Burial sites in Peru like one at Telarmachay as old as 8600-7200 BCE contained evidence of ritual burial, with red ocher and bead necklaces.&lt;ref name="Lavallee115"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest ceramics that appear in Peru may have been imported from the Validivia region; indigenous pottery production almost certainly arrived in the highlands around 1800 BCE at [[Kotosh]], and on the coast at La Florida c. 1700 BCE.  Older calabash gourd vessels with human faces burned into them were found at [[Huaca Prieta]], a site dating to 2500-2000 BCE&lt;ref name="Lavallee186"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Huaca Prieta also contained some early patterned and dyed textiles made from twisted plant fibers.&lt;ref name="Bruhns80"&gt;[[#Bruhns|Bruhns]], p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Initial Period and First Horizon=====
{{Further|Chavín culture}}
[[File:Estela.jpg|thumb|right|An image of the [[Lanzón]] deity on the great wall at [[Chavín de Huantar]], a First Horizon site]]
The Initial Period in Central Andean cultures lasted roughly from 1800 BCE to 900 BCE.  Textiles from this time found at Huaca Prieta are of astonishing complexity, including images such as crabs whose claws transform into snakes, and double-headed birds.  Many of these images are similar to [[optical illusion]]s, where which image dominates depends in part on which the viewer chooses to see.  Other portable artwork from this time includes decorated mirrors, bone and shell jewelry, and unfired clay female effigies.&lt;ref name="Stone19_20"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Public architecture, including works estimated to require the movement of more than 100,000 tons of stone, are to be found at sites like Kotosh, [[El Paraíso, Peru]], and [[La Galgada (archaeological site)]].  Kotosh, a site in the Andean highlands, is especially noted as the site of the Temple of the Crossed Hands, in which there are two reliefs of crossed forearms, one pair male, one pair female.&lt;ref name="Stone21"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Also of note is one of South America's largest ceremonial sites, [[Sechín Alto]].  This site's crowning work is a twelve-story platform, with stones incised with military themes.&lt;ref name="Stone27"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  The architecture and art of the highlands, in particular, laid down the groundwork for the rise of the [[Chavín culture]].&lt;ref name="Stone22"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chavín culture dominated the central Andes during the First Horizon, beginning around 900 BCE, and is generally divided into two stages.  The first, running until about 500 BCE, represented a significant cultural unification of the highland and coastal cultures of the time.  Imagery in all manner of art (textiles, ceramics, jewelry, and architectural) included sometimes fantastic imagery such as jaguars, snakes, and human–animal composites, much of it seemingly inspired by the jungles to the east.&lt;ref name="Stone28_29"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

The later stage of the Chavín culture is primarily represented by a significant architectural expansion of the [[Chavín de Huantar]] site around 500 BCE, accompanied by a set of stylistic changes.  This expansion included, among other changes, over forty large stone heads, whose reconstructed positions represent a transformation from human to supernatural animal visages.  Much of the other art at the complex from this time contains such supernatural imagery.&lt;ref name="Stone40"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  The portable art associated with this time included sophisticated metalworking, including alloying of metals and soldering.&lt;ref name="Stone44"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Textiles found at sites like [[Karwa]] clearly depict Chavín cultural influences,&lt;ref name="Stone46"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cupisnique]] style of pottery disseminated by the Chavín would set standards all across the region for later cultures.&lt;ref name="Stone49"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  (The vessel pictured at the top of this article, while from the later [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture, is representative of the stirrup-spouted vessels of the Chavín.)

=====Early Intermediate Period=====
{{Further|Paracas culture|Nazca culture|Moche (culture)}}
[[File:Paracas Mantle.jpg|thumb|left|A Paracas Mantle dating from 200 CE]]
The Early Intermediate Period lasted from about 200 BCE to 600 CE.  Late in the First Horizon, the Chavín culture began to decline, and other cultures, predominantly in the coastal areas, began to develop.  The earliest of these was the [[Paracas culture]], centered on the [[Paracas Peninsula]] of central Peru.  Active from 600 BCE to 175 BCE, their early work clearly shows Chavín influence, but a locally distinctive style and technique developed.  It was characterized by technical and time-consuming detail work, visually colorful, and a profusion visual elements.  Distinctive technical differences include painting on clay after firing, and embroidery on textiles.&lt;ref name="Stone50"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;  One notable find is a mantle that was clearly used for training purposes; it shows obvious indications of experts doing some of the weaving, interspersed with less technically proficient trainee work.&lt;ref name="Stone58"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nazca-lineas-perro-c01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Nazca lines|Nazca line]] figure known as The Dog]]
The [[Nazca culture]] of southern Peru, which is widely known for the enormous figures traced on the ground by the [[Nazca lines]] in southern Peru, shared some similarities with the Paracas culture, but techniques (and scale) differed.  The Nazca painted their ceramics with [[slip (ceramics)|slip]], and also painted their textiles.&lt;ref name="Stone67"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Nazca ceramics featured a wide variety of subjects, from the mundane to the fantastic, including utilitarian vessels and effigy figures.  The Nazca also excelled at goldsmithing, and made [[pan pipes]] from clay in a style not unlike the pipes heard in music of the Andes today.&lt;ref name="Stone74_75"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous Nazca lines are accompanied by temple-like constructions (showing no sign of permanent habitation) and open plazas that presumably had ritual purposes related to the lines.  The lines themselves are laid out on a sort of natural blackboard, where a thin layer of dark stone covers lighter stone; the lines were thus created by simply removing the top layer where desired, after using surveying techniques to lay out the design.&lt;ref name="Stone78_82"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 78–82&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mochica Headress Condor.jpg|thumb|left|Gold [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] headdress representing a [[Andean condor|condor]]]]
In the north of Peru, the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture dominated during this time.  Also known as ''Mochica'' or ''Early Chimú'', this warlike culture dominated the area until about 500 CE, apparently using conquest to gain access to critical resources along the desert coast: arable land and water.  Moche art is again notably distinctive, expressive and dynamic in a way that many other Andean cultures were not.  Knowledge of the period has been notably expanded by finds like the pristine royal tombs at [[Sipán]].&lt;ref name="Stone83"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moche very obviously absorbed some elements of the Chavín culture, but also absorbed ideas from smaller nearby cultures that they assimilated, such as the [[Recuay culture]] and the Vicús.&lt;ref name="Stone88"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  They made fully sculpted ceramic animal figures, worked gold, and wove textiles.  The art often featured everyday images, but seemingly always with a ritual intent.&lt;ref name="Stone86"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

In its later years, the Moche came under the influence of the expanding [[Huari culture|Huari]] empire.  The Cerro Blanco site of [[Huaca del Sol]] appears to have been the Moche capital.  Largely destroyed by natural events around 600 CE, it was further damaged by Spanish conquistadors searching for gold, and continues with modern looters.&lt;ref name="Stone92"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Middle Horizon=====
[[File:Tiwanaku1.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Ponce monolith in the sunken courtyard of the Tiwanaku's Kalasasaya temple]]
The Middle Horizon lasted from 600 CE to 1000 CE, and was dominated by two cultures: the [[Huari culture|Huari]] and the [[Tiwanaku]].  The Tiwanaku (also spelled ''Tiahuanaco'') culture arose near [[Lake Titicaca]] (on the modern border between Peru and [[Bolivia]]), while the Wari culture arose in the southern highlands of Peru.  Both cultures appear to have been influenced by the [[Pukara culture]], which was active during the Early Intermediate in between the primary centers of the Wari and Tiwanaku.&lt;ref name="Stone121_123"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 121–123&lt;/ref&gt;  These cultures both had wide-ranging influence, and shared some common features in their portable art, but their monumental arts were somewhat distinctive.&lt;ref name="Stone119"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

The monumental art of the Tiwanaku demonstrated technical prowess in stonework, including fine detailed reliefs, and monoliths such as the Ponce monolith (photo to the left), and the Sun Gate, both in the main Tiwanaku site.  The portable art featured "portrait vessels", with figured heads on ceramic vessels, as well as natural imagery like jaguars and raptors.&lt;ref name="Stone131_134"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 131–134&lt;/ref&gt;  A full range of materials, from ceramics to textiles to wood, bone, and shell, were used in creative endeavours.  Textiles with a weave of 300 [[thread count|threads per inch]] (80 threads per cm) have been found at Tiwanaku sites.&lt;ref name="Stone136"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piquillacta view4.jpg|left|200px|thumb|The ruins of [[Pikillacta]], a [[Huari culture|Wari]] site]]
The Wari dominated an area from central Peru to Ecuador, with their main center near [[Ayacucho, Peru]].  Their art is distinguished from the Tiwanaku style by the use of bolder colors and patterns.&lt;ref name="Stone138_139"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable among Wari finds are tapestry garments, presumed to be made for priests or rulers to wear, often bearing abstract geometric designs of significant complexity, but also bearing images of animals and figures.&lt;ref name="Stone146_148"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 146–148&lt;/ref&gt;  Wari ceramics, also of high technical quality, are similar in many ways to those of the preceding cultures, where local influences from fallen cultures, like the Moche, are still somewhat evident.  Metalwork, while rarely found due to its desirability by looters, shows elegant simplicity and, once more, a high level of workmanship.&lt;ref name="Stone149_150"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Late Intermediate Period=====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Vasoslambayeque.jpg|right|thumb|Lambayeque (Sicán) metalworks from the [[Larco Museum]] in Lima, Peru.]] --&gt;
Following the decline of the Wari and Tiwanaku, the northern and central coastal areas were somewhat dominated by the [[Chimú culture]], which included notable subcultures like the [[Sican Culture|Lambayeque (or Sicán)]] and [[Chancay culture|Chancay]] cultures.  To the south, coastal cultures dominated in the [[Ica region]], and there was a significant cultural crossroads at [[Pachacamac]], near Lima.&lt;ref name="Stone151"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  These cultures would dominate from about 1000 CE until the 1460s and 1470s, as the [[Inca Empire]] began to take shape and eventually absorbed the geographically smaller nearby cultures.

'''Chimú and Sicán Cultures'''
[[File:Sican funerary mask in the Metropolitan Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Sicán]] funerary mask, [[Metropolitan Museum]]]]
{{Further|Chimú culture|Sican Culture}}

The [[Chimú culture]] in particular was responsible for an extremely large number of artworks.  Its capital city, [[Chan Chan]], appears to have contained building that appeared to function as museums—they seem to have been used for displaying and preserving artwork.  Much of the artwork from Chan Chan in particular has been looted, some by the Spanish after the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]].&lt;ref name="Stone151"/&gt;  The art from this time at times displays amazing complexity, with "multimedia" works that require artists working together in a diversity of media, including materials believed to have come from as far away as Central America.  Items of increasing splendor or value were produced, apparently as the society became increasing stratified.&lt;ref name="Stone153"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same, the quality of some of the work declined, as demand for pieces pushed production rates up and values down.&lt;ref name="Stone154"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicán culture flourished from 700 CE to about 1400 CE, although it came under political domination of the Chimú around 1100 CE, at which time many of its artists may have moved to Chan Chan.  There was significant copperworking by the Sicán, including what seems to be a sort of currency based on copper objects that look like axes.&lt;ref name="Stone156"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;
Artwork includes burial masks, beakers and metal vessels that previous cultures traditionally made of clay.  The metalwork of the Sicán was particularly sophisticated, with innovations including [[repoussé]] and shell inlay.  Sheet metal was also often used to cover other works.&lt;ref name="Stone156_158"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 156–158&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent in Sicán iconography is the Sicán deity, which appears on all manner of work, from the portable to the monumental.  Other imagery includes geometric and wave patterns, as well as scenes of fishing and shell diving.&lt;ref name="Stone160"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chancay culture'''
[[Chancay culture]], before it was subsumed by the Chimú, did not feature notable monumental art.  Ceramics and textiles were made, but the quality and skill level was uneven.  Ceramics are generally black on white, and often suffer from flaws like poor firing, and drips of the slip used for color; however, fine examples exist.  Textiles are overall of a higher quality, including the use of painted weaves and tapestry techniques, and were produced in large quantities.&lt;ref name="Stone175_177"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 175–177&lt;/ref&gt;  The color palette of the Chancay was not overly bold: golds, browns, white, and scarlet predominate.&lt;ref name="Stone179"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pachacamac'''
[[Pachacamac]] is a temple site south of [[Lima, Peru]] that was an important pilgrimage center into Spanish colonial times.  The site boasts temple constructions from several periods, culminating in Inca constructions that are still in relatively good condition.  The temples were painted with murals depicting plants and animals.  The main temple contained a carved wooden sculpture akin to a [[totem pole]].&lt;ref name="Stone179"/&gt;

'''Ica culture'''
The [[Ica region]], which had been dominated by the Nazca, was fragmented into several smaller political and culture groups.  The pottery produced in this region was of the highest quality at the time, and its aesthetics would be adopted by the Inca when they conquered the area.&lt;ref name="Stone180"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Late Horizon and Inca culture=====
{{Further|Inca architecture}}
[[File:Cuzco1860.jpg|thumb|An 1860 map of [[Cusco]].  The [[Cougar|puma]] shape is discernible, with the head at the upper left and the tail at the lower right.]]
[[File:CuscoPiedra12angulo.jpg|thumb|The ''twelve angle stone'', in the Hatum Rumiyoc street of [[Cusco]], is an example of Inca masonry.]]
This time period represents the era in which the culture of the central Andes is almost completely dominated by the [[Inca Empire]], which began its expansion in 1438.  It lasted until the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]] in 1533.  The Inca absorbed much technical skill from the cultures they conquered, and disseminated it, along with standard shapes and patterns, throughout their area of influence, which extended from [[Quito, Ecuador]] to [[Santiago, Chile]].  Inca stonework is notably proficient; giant stones are set so tightly without mortar that a knife blade will not fit in the gap.&lt;ref name="Stone181"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the Inca's monumental structures deliberately echoed the natural environment around them; this is particularly evident in some of the structures at [[Machu Picchu]].&lt;ref name="Stone190"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;  The Inca laid the city of [[Cusco]] in the shape of a [[puma (animal)|puma]], with the head of the puma at [[Sacsayhuaman]],&lt;ref name="Stone194"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; a shape that is still discernible in aerial photographs of the city today.

The iconography of Inca art, while clearly drawing from its many predecessors, is still recognizably Inca.  Bronzework owes a clear debt to the Chimú, as do a number of cultural traditions: the finest goods were reserved to the rulers, who wore the finest textiles, and ate and drank from gold and silver vessels.&lt;ref name="Stone186"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, Inca metalwork was relatively rare, and an obvious source of plunder for the conquering Spanish.

[[File:Tupa-inca-tunic.png|160px|thumb|right|An Inca period tunic]]
Textiles were widely prized within the empire, in part as they were somewhat more portable in the far-flung empire.&lt;ref name="Stone209"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramics were made in large quantities, and, as with other media, in standardized shapes and patterns.  One common shape is the ''urpu'', a distinctive urn shape that came in a wide variety of standard capacities, much as modern storage containers do.&lt;ref name="Stone215"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of this standardization, many local areas retained some distinctive aspects of their culture in the works they produced; ceramics produced in areas under significant Chimú control prior to the Inca rule still retain characteristics indicative of that style.&lt;ref name="Stone216"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Spanish conquest, the art of the central Andes was significantly affected by the conflict and diseases brought by the Spanish.  Early colonial period art, began to show influences of both Christianity and Inca religious and artistic ideas, and eventually also began to encompass new techniques brought by the conquerors, including oil painting on canvas.&lt;ref name="Stone217"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early ceramics in northern South America====
{{See also|Indigenous peoples in Colombia|Indigenous ceramics of the Americas}}
The earliest evidence of decorated pottery in South America is to be found in two places.  A variety of sites in the Santarém region of [[Brazil]] contain ceramic sherds dating to a period between 5000 and 3000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Lavallee182"/&gt;  Sites in [[Colombia]], at [[Monsú, Colombia|Monsú]] and [[San Jacinto, Colombia|San Jacinto]] contained pottery finds in different styles, and date as far back as 3500 BCE.&lt;ref name="Bruhns116"/&gt;  This is an area of active research and subject to change.&lt;ref name="Lavallee176"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], pp. 176–182&lt;/ref&gt;   The ceramics were decorated with curvilinear incisions.  Another ancient [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|site at Puerto Hormiga]] in the [[Bolívar Department]] of [[Colombia]] dating to 3100 BCE contained pottery fragments that included figured animals in a style related to later Barrancoid cultural finds in Colombia and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name="Bruhns116"&gt;[[#Bruhns|Bruhns]], pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Valdivia, Ecuador]] also has a site dated to roughly 3100 BCE containing decorated fragments, as well as figurines, many represent nude females.  The Valdivian style stretched as far south as northern Peru,&lt;ref name="Bruhns117"&gt;[[#Bruhns|Bruhns]], pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt; and may, according to Lavallée, yet yield older artifacts.&lt;ref name="Lavallee182"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- to be continued: traditions from 1800 BCE to Spanish/Portuguese arrival:
 succeeding Puerto Hormiga: Canapote and Barlovento (to 1000 BCE), Malambo (to 0 CE)
 succeeding Valdivia: Machalilla (to 1100 BCE)
--&gt;

By 2000 BCE, pottery was evident in eastern Venezuela.  The La Gruta style, often painted in red or white, included incised animal figures in the ceramic, as well as ceramic vessels shaped as animal effigies.  The Rancho Peludo style of western Venezuela featured relatively simple textile-type decorations and incisions.&lt;ref name="Bruhns117"/&gt;  Finds in the central Andes dating to 1800 BCE and later appear to be derived from the Valdivian tradition of Ecuador.&lt;ref name="Bruhns119"&gt;[[#Bruhns|Bruhns]], p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- to be continued: traditions in this geography from 1800 BCE to Spanish/Portuguese arrival --&gt;

====Early art in eastern South America====
{{See also|Indigenous peoples in Brazil}}
Relatively little is known about the early settlement of much of South America east of the Andes.  This is due to the lack of stone (generally required for leaving durable artifacts), and a [[jungle]] environment that rapidly recycles organic materials.  Beyond the Andean regions, where the inhabitants were more clearly related to the early cultures of Peru, early finds are generally limited to coastal areas and those areas where there are stone outcrops.  While there is evidence of human habitation in northern Brazil as early as 8000 BCE,&lt;ref name="Lavallee113"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; and rock art of unknown (or at best uncertain) age,  ceramics appear to be the earliest artistic artifacts. The Mina civilization of Brazil (3000–1600 BCE) had simple round vessels with a red wash, that were stylistic predecessors to later Bahia and Guyanan cultures.&lt;ref name="Bruhns117"/&gt;
&lt;!-- to be continued: Periperi (Bahia) and Alaka (Guyana) --&gt;

====Southern South America====
The southern reaches of South America show evidence of human habitation as far back as 10,000 BCE.  A site at [[Arroio do Fosseis]] on the pampa in southern Brazil has shown reliable evidence to that time,&lt;ref name="Lavallee108"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tierra del Fuego]] at the southern tip of the continent has been occupied since 7000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Lavallee112"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;  Artistic finds are scarce; in some parts of Patagonia ceramics were never made, only being introduced by contact with Europeans.&lt;ref name="Lavallee187"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- to be continued: earliest finds are not nonexistent --&gt;

==Native arts of Oceania==

===Australia===
{{see also|Indigenous Australian art}}
[[File:Yankee Hat art-MJC.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Australian Aboriginals|Aboriginal]] rock painting at [[Namadgi National Park]]]]
From earliest times, the natives of Australia, often known as [[Australian Aborigine|Aborigines]], have been creating distinctive patterns of art. Much of Aboriginal art is transitory, drawn in sand or on the human body to illustrate a place, an animal totem, or a tribal story. Early surviving artworks of the Aborigines are mostly rock paintings. Many are called [[X-ray]] paintings because they show the bones and organs of the animals they depict. Some Aboriginal art seems [[abstract art|abstract]] to modern viewers; Aboriginal art often employs geometrical figures and lines to represent landscape, which is often shown from a birds-eye view. For instance, in Aboriginal [[symbol]]ism, a swirl stands for a watering hole.

[[File:Bradshaw rock paintings.jpg|thumb|240px|left|[[Bradshaw rock paintings]] found in the north-west [[Kimberley region of Western Australia]]]]
The [[Bradshaw rock paintings]] are a style of rock art found in Western Australia.  They are predominantly human figures drawn in fine detail with accurate anatomical proportioning.  They are usually dated to be around 17,000 years old, and there have been suggestions they are as much as 70,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/bradshaws|title=The Bradshaw Paintings - Australian Rock Art Archive|author=Bradshaw Foundation|work=Bradshaw Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sydney rock engravings]] are also prominent rock art sites in the country.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowdler|first=Sandra|title=Balls Head: the excavation of a Port Jackson rock shelter.

===Polynesia===
The natives of [[Polynesia]] have a distinct artistic heritage. While many of their artifacts were made with organic materials and thus lost to history, some of their most striking achievements survive in clay and stone. Among these are numerous pottery fragments from western [[Oceania]], from the late 2nd millennium BCE. Also, the natives of Polynesia left scattered around their islands [[Petroglyph]]s, stone platforms or [[Marae]], and sculptures of [[ancestor figure]]s, the most famous of which are the [[Moai]] of [[Easter Island]].

''''''Rejects Revenge'''''' was one of the longest running and popular professional touring theatre companies in the [[United Kingdom]].

==History==

Rejects Revenge was founded in Liverpool in 1990 by Ann Farrar, Tim Hibberd and David White. Ann studied English at Liverpool University; David was primarily a musician from Redditch who had come to Liverpool to seek fame and fortune in the home of the Beatles (they had unfortunately left by the time he arrived), and Tim moved from the Isle of Wight to study Medieval and Modern History. Ann and David met on a community theatre course at [[Hope Street, Liverpool|Hope Street]]; Tim met Ann when she joined The Network, an [[agit prop]] socialist theatre company based at the Trade Union Centre on Hardman Street. 
Their training consisted mainly of partaking in the numerous free workshops given by theatre practitioners at [[Hope Street, Liverpool|Hope Street]] in the late 80's/ early 90's, organised by Peter Ward. These companies and individuals, including [[Trestle]], the right size, [[Theatre de Complicite]], Peta Lilly, Mime Theatre Project, would usually then perform at Liverpool's [[Unity Theatre, Liverpool|Unity Theatre]] under the directorship, then as now, of Graeme Phillips.
In 1990 [[Everyman Theatre, Liverpool|The Everyman Theatre]] donated its space free for three nights for anyone on the Hope Street course who wished to perform. Ann asked Tim if he wished to create a piece based on the revolutions taking place in Eastern Europe at the time, and 'Staging The Revolution' became the first work they created together. David was introduced into the company later that year.
Much of their work began as [[devised theatre|devised]] pieces, but unlike many devising companies of the time, they were keen to turn this into a strict performance script, normally written by Tim. Their work was often very [[physical theatre|physical]], but the physicality of the words was always given equal weight.
After 15 years of national and international touring the company fell foul of the 2005 Arts Council cuts, and created its final production in that year. The company's archive now resides at the [[Museum of Liverpool Life]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2963">The '''Remix Dance Project''' (also known as '''Remix Dance Company''') is a [[South Africa]]n [[contemporary dance]] company that "brings together performers with physical disabilities and performers without".&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

The company is South Africa’s first [[physically integrated dance]] company and grew out of the British Council’s ''Tshwaragano in Touch Integrated Dance Project'' in Johannesburg in 2000. This was led by choreographer and teacher Adam Benjamin who has subsequently worked with Remix on several productions.&lt;ref name="leaders"/&gt;

Remix was founded and directed in 2000 by Nicola Visser and was formalised as a Trust and Non-Profit Organisation in 2001 with Malcolm Black.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="any-body"/&gt; In 2005 it became a full-time professional company&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; and is a resident company at the [[Baxter Theatre Centre]] in [[Cape Town]] since 2010.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="leaders"/&gt;

Remix concentrates on the contemporary dance genre drawing on [[release technique]] and [[contact improvisation]] as its primary discipline in training,&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; with its activities focused on education for children, adults and teachers of integrated dance and the creation of "performances that are intriguing and intelligent".&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

The company won the Arts and Culture Trust Award for the Cultural Development Project of the Year in 2002 for its work in education and performance and the Western Cape Cultural Commission Award for Outstanding Contribution to Disability and the Arts in 2006.&lt;ref name="any-body"/&gt;

[[File:Cueva arana.svg|thumb|Man gathering honey, from the [[Cuevas de la Araña]], Bicorp]]
The group of over 700 sites of prehistoric '''Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin''', also known as '''Levantine art''', were collectively declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1998. The sites are in the eastern part of Spain and contain [[rock art]]  dating to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] or (more likely) [[Mesolithic]] periods of the [[Stone Age]]. The art consists of small painted figures of humans and animals, which are the most advanced and widespread surviving from this period, certainly in Europe, and arguably in the world, at least in the earlier works. It is notable for the number of places included, the largest concentration of such art in [[Europe]]. Its name refers to the [[Mediterranean Basin]]; however, while some sites are located near the sea, many of them are inland in [[Aragon]] and [[Castile-La Mancha]]; it is also often referred to as Levantine Art (meaning "from Eastern Spain", not the [[Levant]] region).

==Historical period==
There has been much debate over the dating of Levantine paintings, and whether they belong to the Mesolithic, the end of the Paleolithic, or the [[Neolithic]]; they clearly represent a very different style from the much more famous [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in caves on either side of the [[Pyrenees]], but yet may well show continuity with it.&lt;ref&gt;Washburn, 211; Sandars, 86-93&lt;/ref&gt;  According to UNESCO, the oldest art in the World Heritage Site is from 8,000 [[Before Christ|BC]], and the most recent examples from around 3500 BC. The art therefore spans a period of cultural change. It reflects the life of people using primarily hunter-gatherer economic systems, "who gradually incorporated [[Neolithic]] elements into their cultural baggage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/874 Rock Art of the Mediterranean Basin on the Iberian Peninsula], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; Later scenes show men leading horses, and some cattle shown may be domesticated.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 87&lt;/ref&gt; 
The chronology of Levantine Art overlaps with that of [[Iberian schematic art]], and examples of both types of art can be found at some sites. Equally some sites continued to attract visitors in later periods, as shown by inscriptions in the [[Iberian language]] and Latin, for example at the [[Roca dels Moros|Caves of El Cogul]]; these may have been associated with repainting of figures.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 87; Beltrán Martínez, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings seem to have been produced after an influx of population from North Africa had mixed with the populations remaining from earlier periods in Iberia.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 87, but see Washburn, 211 who disputes this.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==

Levantine Art was first discovered in [[Province of Teruel|Teruel]] in 1903. The Spanish prehistorian Juan Cabre was the first to study this art, defining it as a regional [[Palaeolithic]] art.&lt;ref&gt;'El arte rupestre en España''&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment as Palaeolithic was challenged for various reasons including the fact that no glacial fauna was depicted. Antonio Beltrán Martínez and others place the beginning of this art in the [[Epipaleolithic]] or Mesolithic, placing its heyday in the Neolithic period.&lt;ref&gt;Beltrán Martínez, Chapter 7; Washburn, 199-203&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting a post-Paleolithic age for the art, Ripio{{who|date=February 2017}} devised a new chronological scheme in the 1960s, dividing the art into four stages:naturalistic, stylized static, stylized dynamic, and final phase of transition to the schematic.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Characteristics==
[[File:Valltorta Albocàsser.jpg|thumb|Figure from Valltorta]]
The art appears over a wide area, and was created over a period of several thousand years; it is widely accepted that it shows stylistic and thematic development that reflects a long evolution, at least some local variety, and changes in way of life, though agreement on the details of this development is a continuing process. 
     
The artists appear to have used feathers, in a relatively complex painting technique, compared to the [[art of the Upper Paleolithic]], that produced relatively simple figures. Figures are often outlined, apparently after the main body was painted. Some figures are shallowly engraved rather than painted. The figures are relatively small, between about {{convert|8|and|1|in|cm|abbr=off}} high, and in one or two colours. The paint was generally very thin, using mineral earths (often reddish) or [[charcoal]], and the paintings are preserved by a very thin transparent layer of limescale forming over them from water dripping down the wall.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 87-89&lt;/ref&gt;
Some figures have more than one coat of paint, which has led to claims that they were repainted after long periods, though this seems not universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Beltrán Martínez, 56-57; Sandars, 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;

The human figure, which is rare in [[Paleolithic art]], acquires great importance in Levantine Art. The human figure is frequently the main theme, and when it appears in the same scene as animals, the human figure runs towards them. The painting known as [[Roca dels Moros|The Dancers of Cogul]] is a good example of movement being depicted. The most common scenes by far are of hunting, and there are scenes of battle and dancing, and possibly agricultural tasks and managing domesticated animals. In some scenes gathering honey is shown, most famously at [[Cuevas de la Araña en Bicorp]] (illustrated below). Humans are naked from the waist up, but women have skirts and men sometimes skirts or [[gaiters]] or trousers of some sort, and headdresses and masks are sometimes seen, which may indicate rank or status in a way compared by one researcher to North American [[Plains Indians]]; figures sometimes seem to have a deliberate element of [[caricature]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 89-96; Nash, 82, 84 on headdresses&lt;/ref&gt;  Some war scenes distinguish between the sides in terms of physical appearance, or dress and weapons, though the interpretation of this is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, 82; Washburn, 207-208&lt;/ref&gt;  Within one side, figures of greater importance may be indicated by more carefully painted figures with "exaggerated calf muscles and elongated thighs", or by [[trousers|pantaloon]]s that are "tufted" at the ankle; the ordinary "infantry" are shown as mere "stick figures".&lt;ref&gt;Nash, 83-84; 84 quoted; see also Washburn, 203&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:064 Pintures de la cova dels Moros, exposició al Museu de Gavà.JPG|thumb|left|[[Roca dels Moros|The Dance of Cogul]], tracing by [[Henri Breuil]]]]

There is a much better developed sense of composition in group subjects than in Paleolithic art, and animals running are shown in the "flying gallop" convention that would last in art until after the invention of photography. Human figures are also shown with very wide strides, or in a "flying running" posture with legs up to 180 degrees apart. The scenes depicted are often moments of drama; dead and dying men and animals are often shown, and sometimes battles between humans, which can include up to 44 figures.&lt;ref&gt;Beltrán Martínez, 48-50, says up to 35; Nash, 74 (Table 2) has higher figures; see also Washburn, 206-210&lt;/ref&gt;  Scenes of human execution by archers and in one case by hanging also seen; these scenes of conflict seem to come from the later periods of painting, and from a more limited area "around the Gasulla and Valltota gorges" in the [[province of Castellón]].&lt;ref&gt;Nash, 75, including Table 1, 79-80, 79 quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;

The archer's bow is given great prominence, as the top weapon of the period; some bows are very large.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 89-96; Beltrán Martínez, 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;  To solve the problem of how to convey the distance between an archer and his distant prey, some sites use a convention of showing the trail of the hunted animal, a sophisticated and effective solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;   Some scenes with numbers of armed men appear to represent dances, and women are also shown dancing in other scenes, which they seem to have done with their feet still and using only arm and upper-body movements. A famous dance scene at the [[Roca dels Moros|Caves of El Cogul]] shows eleven women in skirts circling a naked man shown with an erect phallus.&lt;ref&gt;Washburn, 209; Beltrán Martínez, 50-52&lt;/ref&gt;

In the representation of the human body there are drawings of heads with certain characteristics: the [[pear]]-shaped, hemispherical and [[Cone (geometry)|conical]].
The top half of the human body is shown naked. Sometimes a kind of trousers are worn; sometimes the genitals are seen and there are [[phallic]] representations.
The tools represented in Levantine Art are usually [[arrow]]s, sticks, [[quiver]]s and bags, and ropes, perhaps used as [[lasso]]s or trip-ropes. These objects are always associated with the human figure, except for arrows, which may appear lying around as though shots that missed.&lt;ref&gt;Beltrán Martínez, 55&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:El pla de Petracos des de l'interior de la cova.JPG|thumb|View from inside a cave, showing a typical setting in a narrow valley]]

There is no depiction of landscape, and very little treatment of vegetation. An interesting exception is a depiction of mushrooms (possibly ''[[Psilocybe hispanica]]'') at Selva Pascuala.&lt;ref name=Akers2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akers BP, Ruiz JF, Piper A, Ruck CA |title=A prehistoric mural in Spain depicting neurotropic ''Psilocybe'' mushrooms? |journal=Economic Botany |year=2011 |pages= |doi=10.1007/s12231-011-9152-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Animals, however, are very often represented, especially large mammals that are suitable prey for hunting, or that became domesticated (though they may not have been so yet); birds, fish (even near the coast) and insects are rarely shown, apart from the occasional spider and bees in honey-gathering. Some of the animals depicted are identifiable as belonging to species we can see in the present day, and the relative frequency of animal species shown has been used as evidence for dating. Some animals have been interpreted as exotic Ice Age species now extinct in Europe, but this is controversial. Some animals appear to have been overpainted to change their species, perhaps reflecting changes in fauna. The main species shown include:

*[[deer]],
*[[goats]], the animal most frequently depicted in the illustrations.
*[[boar]]
*[[cattle]], often difficult to interpret; bulls are often hunted, but others may be domesticated. There is a bull that is possibly an [[aurochs]] at Selva Pascuala.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1364259/Selva-Pascuala-cave-murals-man-used-magic-mushrooms-6-000-years-ago.html Selva Pascuala cave murals], ''Daily Mail''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[dog]]s, rarely depicted, but they appear to help in a hunting scene at Barranc de la Palla.

Animals appear singly or in groups. A curious feature of the representation of animals is that they are generally drawn in profile but with [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] and [[hooves]] at the front.

The paintings may have meanings related to religion or at least "hunting magic", though it is also possible to see them as purely celebrations of a way of life, though including depictions of ceremonies that are religious.&lt;ref&gt;Beltrán Martínez, 56-58 and Washburn, 202-203, support a religious interpretation; Sandars, 95-96 is more non-commital.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Abric on es troben les pintures d'art llevantí al pla de Petracos.JPG|thumb|left|A typical site]] 
The World Heritage Site includes rock art across an area which stretches from the [[Pyrenees]] to the [[province of Granada]], falling within the territory of the autonomous communities of [[Catalonia]], [[Aragon]], [[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Murcia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and [[Andalusia]]. It was declared a ''[[Bien de Interés Cultural]]'' in 1985.

The art is commonly found in [[rock shelter]]s (protected by a natural [[Ridge|ledge]]) and shallow caves in which sunlight can penetrate easily. There is no clear preference as to what part of the rock shelter is used for art, it can be placed high or half-way up the walls. The sites were not used for habitation, and lack the organic remains of hearths and rubbish deposits which would help dating. Many sites are heavily decorated with figures superimposed, while other apparently suitable locations nearby have no images at all. The sites are often in ravines in steep valleys that would be relatively little use to farmers, but perhaps ideal for hunting by ambush and stampeding animals into a dead end.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 87; Beltrán Martínez, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

In general the state of conservation is poor. However, various inititiatives have been undertaken to protect the sites at a local level. For example, the municipality of [[Villar del Humo]] has designated a cultural park.

The '''Songshan Cultural and Creative Park''' ('''SSCC'''; {{zh|c=松山文創園區|p=Sōngshān Wénchuàng Yuánqū}}) is a multifunctional [[park]] in [[Xinyi District]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].

==History==
The park was initially constructed in 1937 as a [[tobacco]] factory under the name {{nihongo|'''Matsuyama Tobacco Plant of the Monopoly Bureau of the Taiwan Governor's Office'''|臺灣總督府專賣局松山菸草工場}} under the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese government]]. After [[Retrocession Day|Japan ceded Taiwan]] in 1945, the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau took over the factory and renamed it as the '''Songshan Tobacco Plant of the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau'''. In 1947, the plant was renamed again as '''Songshan Tobacco Plant of the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Bureau'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeiartplus.org/08.html |title=Taipei Art |publisher=Taipeiartplus.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The factory ceased to produce cigarettes in 1998 for concern over urban planning, tobacco and liquor marketing regulatory changes and the decline in tobacco demand.

In 2001, the [[Taipei City Government]] designed the defunct tobacco factory as Taipei's 99th historic site and converted it into a park comprising city-designated historic sites, historical structures and architectural highlights. Together with [[Taipei Dome]], the site is known as '''Taipei Cultural and Sporting Complex'''.

For more efficient reuse of space, in 2011 the former factory was turned into a creative park by its current name to provide venues for diverse cultural and creative exhibitions and performances.

==Purposes==
The park has the following aims:{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

* Establish public platform and develop the cultural and creative industry;
* Cultivate culture and creativity and cross industry exchanges;
* Develop innovative experiments and set trends;
* Provide cultural and arts education and encourage public involvement;
* Spotlight the cultural and creative industry and put Taiwan on the map.

The park consists of:{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Warehouses===
There are five warehouses, from number 1 until 5. The workers manufactured cigarettes on the second floor of the plant. After packaging the rolled cigarettes, the boxes were sent directly to warehouse no. 2 using conveyor channel, through the turntable, directed to the platforms for delivery, hence reducing manual labor.

===Inspection Room===
The inspection room served as the place for employees and officers had to pass through when reporting for or getting off work. It had stationed guards on duty.

===Office Building===
{{empty section|date=February 2014}}

===Taiwan Design===
{{empty section|date=February 2014}}

===Taiwan Design Museum===
The [[Taiwan Design Museum]] building used to house the office for supervisors and officers of the tobacco plant. The office had also conference rooms and rest areas for guests. Ordinary plant employees were not allowed to access the building.

===Innovative Design Lab===
{{empty section|date=February 2014}}

===Tobacco Factory===
The tobacco factory consists of three segments, which are North, South and East. The building has characteristics of long open hallways with no dividing walls. The first floor mainly comprises columns to support the weight of the machines on the second floor.

===Baroque Garden===
Enclosed by the tobacco factory three sections, the garden has a fountain that is surrounded by sculptures of naked women emerging from their baths.

===TMSK Restaurant===
The building which now houses the TMSK restaurant used to be the machine repair plant building. The machine repair plant was exclusively responsible for the reparation and maintenance of the tobacco producing machines.

===Boiler Room===
The boiler room acted as the power source for the tobacco plant. [[Coal]] was burnt here to provide power for the plant. The chimneys were used to expel the smoke generated.

===Nursery Room===
There used to be 1,200 employees working at the plant at the same time. The tobacco plant had an industrial village concept, in which it included facilities such as cafeterias, shower facilities, dormitories, hospital, food mall, dining rooms, entertainment rooms and nursery. The nursery room served as a place for the infants of the employees to rest and play.

===Ecology Pond===
For fire extinguishing, ventilation and hydrosphere purposes, a large lotus pond was installed. It is now revamped as an ecology pond where children can enjoy the sounds of frogs and insects and experience the beauty of ecology.

===West 201 Conference Room===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3815">The '''Symphony No. 2''' by [[England|English]] [[composer]] [[William Walton]] was commissioned by the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society]] to celebrate the city's 750th anniversary in 1957. The [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]] conducted by [[John Pritchard (conductor)|John Pritchard]] gave the first performance on 2 September 1960 at the [[Edinburgh International Festival|Edinburgh Festival]]. [[George Szell]] gave the Continental Premiere with the [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in Amsterdam on 19 November 1960. Szell also conducted the US Premiere of the work on 29 December 1960 with the Cleveland Orchestra in that city and a few months later they made its first recording. [[Leopold Stokowski]] gave the work another early Continental performance in Vienna in May 1961 while on tour with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].

The work is in three movements.

# [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Allegro]] molto
# [[Tempo|Lento]] assai
# [[Passacaglia]]: Theme, Variations, Fugato, and Coda-Scherzando

It is scored for a large symphony orchestra comprising 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling [[piccolo]]), 3 [[oboe]]s (3rd doubling [[cor anglais]]), 3 [[clarinet]]s (2nd doubling [[clarinet in E-flat]], 3rd doubling [[bass clarinet]]), 3 [[bassoon]]s (3rd doubling [[contrabassoon]]), 4 [[French horn|horns]], 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], military drum, snare drum, crash cymbals, suspended cymbal, bass drum, glockenspiel, vibraphone, xylophone, tambourine, bell, [[piano]], [[celesta]], 2 [[harp]]s and [[String instrument|strings]].

The symphony was the subject of harsh press criticism on account of its seemingly conservative style at a time when the European avant-garde style was in its ascendance. With time, however, it has been recognised&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/william-walton-the-enfant-terrible-of-oldham-655757.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--As of 15 Sept. 2017, 17:05 BST, this links to a story headlined “Police admit they have no suspects after ‘home-made time bomb’ explodes inside London Tube train”. If this is really a review of Walton's Second Symphony, it is a harsh account, indeed.--&gt; as a mature, subtle and superbly crafted work with many refinements of [[orchestration]], a characteristic of this composer.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Michael (1989). ''Portrait of Walton''. Oxford University Press. pp 211–214&lt;/ref&gt; The finale is notable for its use of a [[twelve-tone]] note-row,{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} a device used in [[twelve-tone technique]].

== History ==
On May 24, 1983, ten women formed an [[affinity group]]  to prepare for the mass arrests planned for the International Day of Nuclear Disarmament protest of June 20, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1,400 Anti-Nuclear Protesters Arrested|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB35CC6CE191FBE&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|publisher=Miami Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Direct Action Web Feature International Day 1983|url=http://www.reclaimingquarterly.org/web/handbook/DA-Handbk-IntlDay83-lo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were trained in [[civil disobedience]] by Livermore Action Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klehr|first=Harvey|title=Far Left of Center|date=January 1, 1988|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=0-88738-217-7|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YSmiFins9sC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=%22june+20,+1983%22+protest+anti-nuclear#v=onepage&amp;q=%22june%2020%2C%201983%22%20protest%20anti-nuclear&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The female membership grew over the next 3 years, as they evolved into a [[performance art]] and activist art group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boredom|first=Terminal|title=Field Guide to SF Art-Punk 1977-82ish|url=http://www.terminal-boredom.com/sfartguide.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founding member Vicki Krohn Amorose &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krohn Amorose|first=Vicki|title=Author PagesBiography|url=https://www.amazon.com/author/vickikrohnamorose|work=Art-Write: The Writing Guide for Visual Artists|publisher=Luminare Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  originally coined the name ''Nuclear Beauty Parlor'' and she, along with founding member Denise Slattery, wrote the lyrics to the ''Nuclear Beauty Parlor'' song.

== Activities ==
On June 20, 1983, the group participated in the blockade of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. More than 1000 demonstrators were arrested, including three members of the Nuclear Beauty Parlor, and jailed for 11 days in tents on the grounds of the Alameda County Jail. The group gained their first media attention with a [[The San Francisco Examiner|San Francisco Examiner]] headline: ''Nuclear Beauty Parlor a Hit in Jail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hernandez|first=Peggy|title=Nuclear Beauty Parlor a Hit in Jail|newspaper=San Francisco Examiner|date=June 23, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cover art for side 1 Nuclear Beauty Parlor record.jpg|thumb|American activist group Nuclear Beauty Parlor's record cover]]
During November and December,1983, the Nuclear Beauty Parlor acquired non-profit status, under the title Bay Area Energy Action. [[Bill Graham (promoter)]], San Francisco music impresario, funded production of the ''Nuclear Beauty Parlor'' 45-RPM 7" single. The lyrics were set to music and the record was produced by the group's friend and ally, Stacy Baird. Side A, ''The Nuclear Beauty Parlor'', was performed by Re Styles and other members of [[The Tubes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meltdown|first=Digital|title=The Nuclear Beauty Parlor/Awake split 7" (1983-320Kpbs)|url=http://digitalmeltd0wn.blogspot.com/2011/06/nuclear-beauty-parlorawake-split-7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Side B, ''Awake'', was recorded at OTR Studios under the direction of [[Cookie Marenco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marenco|first=Cookie|title=Discography|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/590314-Cookie-Marenco|work=Awake}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Nuclear Beauty Parlor'' 45-RPM single was released and a press conference held on Dec 15,1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Derek|title=Microgrooves|newspaper=San Francisco Bay Guardian|date=March 21, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between January and April, 1984, the group solidified its identity as a performance art group with the goal of gaining media attention for the nuclear freeze movement. The record gained airplay and press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stefanac|first=Suzanne|title=Sing along with the Nuclear Beauty Parlor|newspaper=BAM Magazine|date=April 6, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, 1984, the group performs the first in a series of "Tax Day actions" at Rincon Annex Post Office in [[Rincon Center]]. Playing to the audience of taxpayers lined up in cars to meet the midnight tax-filing deadline, the Nuclear Beauty Parlor interacted as costumed waitresses, served weapon-themed food, and encourage people to: "Have one, you paid for it!" They attracted attention from TV and newspaper reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Many Ask for More Time on Taxes|newspaper=[[San Francisco Examiner]]|date=April 17, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic National Convention]] was held in San Francisco on July 14 and 15, 1984. In conjunction with "A Vision of America at Peace", the Nuclear Beauty Parlor performed an original play with songs, titled "The First Lady Debate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoelterhoff|first=Manuela|title=Of Parades and Pinheads|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=July 18, 1984|quote=I bump into a group of young women wearing pink smocks that read "Nuclear Beauty Parlor."

On the eve of the Nov 6, 1984, presidential election, the group pasted thousands of anti-[[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] posters in downtown San Francisco, designed by artist [[Paul Mavrides]], who also designed the record jacket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mavrides|first=Paul|title=Published Work|url=http://artie.com/cm/art/artists/paulmavrides/resume.htm|work=The Nuclear Beauty Parlor, record jacket design and illustration}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the posters were quickly removed after Ronald Reagan’s victory, photographer C. Baldwin captured the morning-after image and created a postcard.

A December 1984 ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' [[Ms. (magazine)|Magazine]] article on the group helped to boost record sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=T|title=The Ms.Gazette News From All Over|journal=[[Ms. Magazine]]|date=December 1984|volume=XIII|issue=6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their second Tax Day performance at Rincon Annex Post Office on April 15, 1985, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor dressed as couture nuclear weapons with price tags, and interacted with last-minute taxpayers, resulting in local TV and press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Huges|first=Beth|title=Party Time for Tax Protesters on Final Day|newspaper=San Francisco Examiner|date=April 16, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July and September, 1985, the group adapted their nuclear weapon costumes for The Fashion Show presented by [[New Langton Arts]]. An original script read by the MC accompanied the runway show, titled "The Nuclear Fashion Arsenal", which was also performed a second time at Fort Mason for the [[International Day of Peace]].

In the group's third Tax Day performance, April 15, 1986, at Rincon Annex Post Office, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor enacted taxpayer robberies with pink machine guns.

In the 1990s, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor record was housed in the Audio Visual Collection of the Swarthmore College Peace Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''The Romantic Anonymous Fellowship''' was founded by the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] painter [[Odysseus Yakoumakis]] on September 2004, as the first, and currently the only, Greek group of [[Stuckism|Stuckism International]]. It has an international membership.

==History==
[[Odysseus Yakoumakis]] discovered Stuckism in July, 2004, while surfing the net, and saw in it an antidote to what he deems "the ailments of the contemporary Greek 'artscape'".&lt;ref&gt;This issue is taken up in Yakoumis' article, "The Academic Provincialism of contemporary Greek Art and its proposed Stuckist remedy", to be presented by him at the first Stuckist international symposium [http://www.student.livjm.ac.uk/lsaiwyli/TheTriumphOfStuckism/index.html ''The Triumph of Stuckism''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414172054/http://www.student.livjm.ac.uk/lsaiwyli/TheTriumphOfStuckism/index.html |date=2006-04-14 }} in Liverpool, England&lt;/ref&gt; He contacted [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], the London founder of Stuckism, and a few days later founded The Romantic Anonymous Fellowship. He conceived this as a "Greek version of Stuckism, an antidote to contemporary Greek art's [[Parochialism|provincialism]], [[sectarianism]] and servile importation of [[post-modernism]]". He developed the concept of "Romantic Stuckism", that is of "Stuckism with a good injection of [[Eleatic]] and [[Platonic philosophy]], oriented rather towards encouraging each artist to pursue his/her genuinely personal artistic vision rather, than towards pointless polemics against the reactionary official art-establishment". He published the first two Romantic Stuckist theoretical texts on the Fellowship's website.

At that stage he was the Fellowship's only fellow and, as far as he knew, the only artist in Greece aware of the Stuckist movement. He contacted other fine artists in Athens, but described the reactions he got as "ranging from a tepid 'academic curiosity' to a sheer lack of interest or even, occasionally, to a politely concealed hostility."  He was however contacted by artists from overseas and accepted them into the Fellowship. The first to apply was [http://www.ianjburkett.co.uk/ Ian J. Burkett], a painter living in London and founder of the Ealing Stuckists group. Shortly after, followed the painter and etcher [http://www.ilaniaabileah.com/ Ilania Abileah] from Canada, and the painter and etcher [http://www.artworksbyanthe.com/ Anthe] (who is of Greek descent) from the US.

==Under the Cover of Romantic Anonymity==
Yakoumakis determined that Stuckism should, nevertheless, be brought "in the flesh" before the eyes of the Greek fine arts community, and organised the first Stuckist event in Greece, titled ''Under the Cover of Romantic Anonymity'', announced for May 14 of 2010 at the Ash-In-Art Gallery, Athens, Greece.

In parallel with the show, the new book by Odysseus Yakoumakis will be featured, titled "Leaflets from the Wilderness (a case study about the artscape in nouveau-Greece and many other lands)" (Ash-In-Art Publications).

Stuckist artists taking part include:

 [[File:Thomas-german-reed.jpg|thumb|right|German Reed]]'''Thomas German Reed''' (27 June 1817 &amp;ndash; 21 March 1888) was an English composer, musical director, actor, singer and theatrical manager of the [[Victorian era]].  He was best known for creating the [[German Reed Entertainment]]s, together with his actress wife, a genre of musical plays that made theatre-going respectable at a time when the stage was considered disreputable.

While acting as organist and chapel-master at chapels in London, and also as musical director and performer at [[West End theatre]]s in the 1830s and 1840s, Reed tried his hand at producing opera.  He married [[Priscilla Horton]], a noted singer, actress and dancer, in 1844.  By 1851, he was managing opera productions at various theatres in London and on tour.   In 1855, Reed and his wife began to present and perform in "Mr. and Mrs. German Reed's Entertainments", consisting of brief, small-scale, family-friendly [[comic opera]]s. In the early and mid-Victorian era, the respectable middle classes regarded the theatre in general as sinful.  Therefore, the Reeds shrewdly called their establishment the "Gallery of Illustration" and their productions "entertainments" to emphasize their refined propriety.

In addition to comic classics like ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', the Reeds usually presented new works by English writers such as [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[William Brough (writer)|William Brough]] and [[Gilbert Arthur à Beckett|Gilbert à Beckett]].  His composers included [[Frederic Clay]], [[Arthur Sullivan]], [[George Macfarren]] and [[Alfred Cellier]], as well as himself. Reed retired in 1871 after an injury, and his son Alfred took over the entertainments with his mother.

==Life and career==
Reed was born in [[Bristol]], the son of Thomas Reed (1795–1871), a musician, and his wife, Frances, ''née'' German (1796–1839). He studied music with his father and made his debut at the age of ten as a pianist and singer at the [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] Theatre.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23278 "Reed, (Thomas) German (1817–1888)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, Jan 2008, accessed 1 February 2013 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to London where Thomas Reed was appointed conductor at the [[Haymarket Theatre]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Woodbridge Wilson, Frederic. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/10942 "Reed, Thomas German"],  Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 31 January 2013 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young Reed played, sang and acted at the theatre.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In 1832, German Reed became an organist at the Roman Catholic Chapel in [[Sloane Street]] and assistant to his father, who moved to be conductor at the [[Garrick Theatre (Leman St)|Garrick Theatre]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Reed, Thomas German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His work at the theatre included scoring and adapting new operas, including ''[[Fra Diavolo]]'' in 1837.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  He also gave private music lessons.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

[[File:A Sensation Novel.jpg|left|thumb|German Reed and [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[A Sensation Novel]]'', 1871]]
In 1838, German Reed was appointed chapel-master at the Royal Bavarian Chapel and also became musical director at his father's former employer, the Haymarket Theatre, where he continued to work until 1851 with the exception of a temporary closure in 1843, during which he produced [[Giovanni Pacini|Pacini]]'s opera ''[[Saffo (opera)|Sappho]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  During these years, he met  Priscilla Horton, a successful and popular [[contralto]] and actress who had been performing on the stage in London since the age of ten.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  They married in 1844.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  In 1851, Reed was engaged to assist in the production of opera at the [[Surrey Theatre]] and later managed Sadler's Wells Opera for a season and also conducted the music at the [[Olympic Theatre]], as well as touring extensively in the British provinces.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In the spring of 1855, at [[Queen's Theatre, Long Acre|St. Martin's Hall]], German Reed and his wife presented the first performance of "Miss P. Horton's Illustrative Gatherings," musical theatre.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; These performances usually consisted of one or two brief [[comic opera]]s designed for a minimal number of characters and performed with either the piano and [[Pump organ|harmonium]] or a small ensemble of musicians.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  They eventually became "Mr. and Mrs. German Reed's Entertainments", presented at the [[Royal Gallery of Illustration]] in [[Regent Street]], beginning in 1856, and later at [[St. George's Hall (London)|St. George's Hall]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;  At a time when the respectable middle classes regarded the theatre in general as sinful and even dangerous places of naughty humour, alcohol and prostitution, the Reeds called their establishment the "Gallery" of Illustration, rather than a "theatre", and their productions "entertainments" or "illustrative gatherings", rather than plays, [[extravaganza]]s, or [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]].  ''[[The Times]]'' characterised the works as "extravaganza of the more refined order."&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary: Thomas German Reed", ''The Times'', 26 March 1888, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Reed  and his wife almost always appeared in these pieces, and on the few occasions when they did not, the box-office receipts suffered.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

[[File:A-dream-of-venice.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Reed (in top hat) with his wife and [[John Orlando Parry|John Parry]] and Susan Galton in ''A Dream in Venice'' at the Royal Gallery of Illustration, April 1867.]]
Reed became the lessee of St. George's Hall in 1867, and there he initially produced and conducted ''[[The Contrabandista]]'' by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and [[F. C. Burnand]], ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' and other English operas in small-scale productions, as well as non-musical plays.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Around the same time, at the Gallery of Illustration, he presented works with libretti by, among others, [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[William Brough (writer)|William Brough]], [[Gilbert Arthur à Beckett|Gilbert à Beckett]], [[Robert Reece]] and [[Arthur Law (playwright)|Arthur Law]]. His composers included [[Frederic Clay]], [[George Macfarren]], [[Alfred Cellier]] and [[Hamilton Clarke]] as well as Sullivan and Reed himself.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He wrote the scores for more than a dozen of the entertainments, and is described by the museum curator Fredric Woodbridge Wilson as "an imaginative and effective writer of music for the stage".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Little of Reed's music survives. A few individual songs were published, but the scores of the entertainments were not. The autograph of the music for ''Our Island Home'' is preserved in [[The Morgan Library &amp; Museum]], New York, but no other scores are known to be extant.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

When the lease on the Gallery of Illustration ended in 1873, the German Reed entertainments moved to St. George's Hall.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; After falling from his horse when hunting, Reed had retired in 1871; his son Alfred (1847–1895) took over the entertainments with his mother, continuing with the entertainments after her retirement in 1879, until 1895.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

German Reed died at St. Croix, Upper [[East Sheen]], [[Surrey]] at the age of 70.  He was buried in [[Old Mortlake Burial Ground]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

[[File:'The Three Vinegar Tasters' by Kano Isen'in, c. 1802-1816, Honolulu Museum of Art, 6156.1.JPG|thumb|right|Another representation of the theme.]]
'''''The Vinegar Tasters''''' (三酸圖, three sours; 嘗醋翁, vinegar tasting old-men; 嘗醋圖, 尝醋图), is a traditional subject in Chinese religious painting. The [[allegory|allegorical]] composition depicts the three founders of China's major religious and philosophical traditions: [[Confucianism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Taoism]]. The theme in the painting has been interpreted as favoring Taoism and critical of the others.

The three men are dipping their fingers in a vat of [[vinegar]] and tasting it; one man reacts with a sour expression, one reacts with a bitter expression, and one reacts with a sweet expression. The three men are [[Confucius]], [[Buddha]], and [[Laozi]], respectively. Each man's expression represents the predominant attitude of his philosophy: Confucianism saw life as sour, in need of [[Norm (philosophy)|rules]] to correct the degeneration of people; Buddhism saw life as bitter, dominated by pain and suffering; and Taoism saw life as fundamentally good in its natural state. Another interpretation of the [[painting]] is that, since the three men are gathered around one vat of vinegar, the "[[three teachings]]" are one.

The painting and its theme was featured in the book ''[[The Tao of Pooh]]'' by American Taoist writer [[Benjamin Hoff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taoism.net/sanctuary/books/vintaste.htm An excerpt from ''The Tao of Pooh'' by Benjamin Hoff]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==

===Confucianism===
Confucianism saw life as sour, in need of rules to correct the degeneration of people, and the present was out of step of the past and that the government had no understanding of the way of the universe—the right response was to worship the ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;8)&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism, being concerned with the outside world, viewed the vinegar as "polluted wine".

===Buddhism===
Buddhism, as it is practiced today, was heavily influenced and shaped by [[Siddhartha Gautama]], who claimed to be [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]] when he was thirty-five years old. Siddhartha lived a very sheltered and extravagant life growing up. As he neared his thirties it is said that he became aware of all the ugliness in the world, this prompted him to leave his home in search of enlightenment. At the start of his travels Siddhartha became a beggar and studied [[philosophy]]; however, his studies did not lead him to the answers that he sought. He then tried [[asceticism]] alongside five [[monk]]s for six years; this practice also failed to bring him enlightenment. After giving up asceticism, Siddhartha decided to [[meditate]] until he found the enlightenment that he was searching for. After much meditation, he became enlightened and was henceforth known as Buddha, which means 'awakened one'. During his meditation he had a vision of humankind and the cycle that we are bound to. He concluded that we are bound to the cycles of life and death because of [[tanha]] ([[desire (emotion)|desire]], thirst, craving). During Buddha's first sermon he preached, "neither the extreme of indulgence nor the extremes of asceticism was acceptable as a way of life and that one should avoid extremes and seek to live in the middle way". "Thus the goal of basic Buddhist practice is not the achievement of a state of bliss in some [[heaven]] but the extinguishing of tanha. When tanha is extinguished, one is released from the cycle of life (birth, suffering, death, and rebirth)",&lt;ref&gt;(Hopfe/Woodward 2007, p. 176)&lt;/ref&gt; only then will they achieve [[Nirvana]].

One interpretation is that Buddhism, being concerned with the self, viewed the vinegar as a polluter of the taster's body due to its extreme flavor. Another interpretation for the image is that Buddhism reports the facts as they are, that vinegar is vinegar and isn't naturally sweet on the tongue. Trying to make it sweet is ignoring what it is, pretending it is sweet is denying what it is, while the equally harmful opposite is being disturbed by the sourness.

===Taoism (Daoism)===
Taoism sees life as fundamentally good in its natural state.

{{Quote|From the Taoist point of view, sourness and bitterness come from the interfering and unappreciative mind. Life itself, when understood and utilized for what it is, is sweet. That is the message of "The Vinegar Tasters".|Benjamin Hoff|''The Tao of Pooh''}}

In the vinegar tasters picture, Laozi's (Lao Tzu) expression is sweet because of how the teachings of Taoism view the world. Every natural thing is intrinsically good as long as it remains true to its nature.  This perspective allows Laozi to experience the taste of vinegar without judging it.  "Ah this," he might be thinking, "this is vinegar!"  From such a perspective, the taste doesn't need to be sweet, sour, bitter or bland.  It is simply the taste of vinegar.  By openly experiencing vinegar as vinegar, Laozi acknowledges and participates in the harmony of nature.  As this is the very goal of Taoism, whatever the taste of vinegar, the experience is good.

At the core of Taoist doctrine is the concept of the Dao or "the way".  According to Taoist philosophy, the universe originates from Tao, and Tao dominates the universe.  "Tao is all embracing, existing anywhere and everywhere though it is invisible.  It gives birth to the universe, which then gives birth to everything in it" (Sang, 87).  The Tao in this sense is the way of the universe, the driving power behind all in nature (Smith, 198).

A '''volvelle''' or '''wheel chart''' is a type of [[slide chart]], a [[paper]] construction with rotating parts. It is considered an early example of a paper [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nick Kanas|title=VOLVELLES!

Early examples of volvelles are found in the pages of [[astronomy]] books. They can be traced back to "certain [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabic treatises on humoral medicine]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Origin of Polyalphabetic Substitution|author=David Kahn|author-link=David Kahn (writer)|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume=71|issue=1|date=March 1980|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|pages=122–127 [126]|jstor=230316|doi=10.1086/352410 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Persian astronomer]], [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] (c. 1000), who made important contributions to the development of the volvelle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=State, Science and Economy in Traditional Societies: Some Problems in Weberian Sociology of Science|author=Bryan S.

In the twentieth century, the volvelle had many diverse uses. In ''Reinventing the Wheel'', author [[Jessica Helfand]] introduces twentieth-century volvelles with this:

{{quote|The twentieth century saw a robust growth in the design, manufacture, and production of a new generation of independent, free-standing volvelles. Categorically, they not only represent an unusually eclectic set of uses, but demonstrate, too, a remarkable range of stylistic, compositional, mechanical, informational, and kinetic conceits. There are volvelles that arrange their data peripherally, centrifugally, and radially; volvelles that use multiple concentric circles with pointers; and volvelles that benefit from the generous use of the die-cut, a particular technological hallmark of modern printing manufacture. Twentieth-century volvelles—often referred to as ''wheel charts''—offer everything from inventory control to color calibration, mileage metering to verb conjugation. They anticipate animal breeding cycles and calculate radiation exposure, measure chocolate consumption and quantify bridge tips, chart bird calls, convert metrics, and calculate taxes. There are fortune-telling wheels and semaphore-charting wheels; emergency first-aid wheels and electronic fix-it wheels; playful wheels that test phonetics and prophylactic wheels that prevent pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reinventing the Wheel|author=[[Jessica Helfand]]|publisher=[[Princeton Architectural Press]]|date=2002|isbn=978-1-56898-596-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lA26DBJI2YkC&amp;dq=helfand+%22reinventing+the+wheel%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] employed a volvelle in the sleeve design for the album ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' (1970).

Two games from the game company [[Infocom]] included volvelles inside their package as "[[feelie]]s": ''[[Sorcerer (video game)|Sorcerer]]'' (1983) and ''[[A Mind Forever Voyaging]]'' (1985). Both volvelles served to impede copying of the games, because they contained information needed to play the game.
