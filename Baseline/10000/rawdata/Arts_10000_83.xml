The '''AHRC/ESRC Religion and Society Programme''' is a five-year strategic research initiative funded by two UK research councils: the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and the [[Economic and Social Research Council]]. running 2007-2012. It has funded 75 projects across UK universities investigating various aspects of the complex relationships between religion and society, both historical and contemporary.

Research supported includes the website "British Religion in Numbers",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brin.ac.uk/ British Religion in Numbers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029143012/http://www.brin.ac.uk/ |date=October 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing a one-stop shop for statistics on religion in Britain led by Professor [[David Voas]] at [[Manchester University]], Professor Kim Knott at [[Leeds University]]'s restudy of British media coverage of religion and spirituality, and an investigation of Hindu, Muslim and Sikh shrine practices across the Punjab led by Dr Tej Purewal, also at Manchester. Phase 2 of the Programme has focused on Youth and Religion specifically, supporting projects like Dr Basia Spalek at [[Birmingham University]]'s research into police partnerships with young Muslims.

The Religion and Society Programme is hosted at [[Lancaster University]], and directed by Professor [[Linda Woodhead]] helped by Dr Rebecca Catto (Research Associate) and Peta Ainsworth (Administrator). The Programme also helps to organize various relevant and topical events such as a day at the British Library asking ‘where next for religion in the public sphere’ in July 2010 and a closed seminar asking ‘Child abuse in the Catholic Church – what can be learned?’ at [[Heythrop College]] London in November 2010.

== Sociology of Religion ==
Sociologist have studied religion right from the beginning of the discipline, in the 19th century. It was a central concern of the first generation of sociological thinkers and those who influence them. Major influences in the history of the disciplines, such as [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Durkheim]], [[Max Weber|Weber]], and Simmel all contributed in various ways to the sociology of religion. The French philosopher August Comte, coined the term sociology. Even so, religion as a replacement for existing religions as a new religion of positivism. Positivism was the view that only the methods of the natural sciences could provide knowledge of human nature and society (Kaelber, 2004). He thought positivism was valuable for its potential to solve social problems and to reorganize society. He developed a blueprint for a new social order which had a religion of humanity at its ethical basis. He did so to recognize the importance of religion in creating social bonds between people. However, his work has been largely overshadowed by the work of other scholars in sociology of religion, such as Max Weber and Durkheim's. Later work in the sociology of religion has often been developed with the work of these early scholars. Just to pick one example, one of the most famous works in the sociology of religion; Max Weber's ''[[the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. This was concerned with the question of the role played by religion. It's all to understand why a system of rational capitalism developing the west from about the 17th century onwards (Kaelber, 2004). Sociologist are interested in studying religion for three main reason. The first, is that religion is simply very important in the lives of many people around the world. Eighty five percent of the world's population affirmed some kind of religious belief with Christians, Muslims, and Hindus making up the three largest religious groups. Religious ideas help people to interpret their experiences. Religious values influence many people's actions and the organizations provide many people with fellowship, aid, and support. Sociologists just seeking to understand people's culture, can’t avoid than to understand the role that religion plays in their lives. Also, they must understand the consequences of religious beliefs and practices for the wider society, which might contain non-religious elements or a diversity. Second, revolves around the idea of how religion takes different forms. The difference in religious beliefs and practices between societies is something that is noticeable and needs explanation. Finally, the third reason for religious study in sociology is the fact that religion changes over time in response to different social conditions. The prime objective for this effect, is to understand why (Kaelber, 2002).

== Religion in America ==
Religion in America has had a relationship since the very beginning of the nation. This relationship has changed over time and has shaped the culture. It started with the Native Americans and their worship of the Great Spirits. They believed that their ancestors watched over them and that the spirits in nature blessed them. When colonist came to America, they brought Christianity along with them. They tried to integrate the religion into the lives of the Native people. Christianity branched out and separated into Protestant and Catholic (Trundle, 2012). There were many forms of Protestant like [[Methodist]], Lutheran, and Quakers. There are other forms of Catholic as well, including the [[Roman Catholic]] and eastern Orthodox. Later other religions were introduced to America through immigration. Religions like [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]], and many others. These began to influence the culture. America was known as the melting pot of different cultures and religions. It was seen as a safe haven for those seeking religious freedom. Religion has effected America in many ways over the years. It was the reason the colonist came to America, and was used as an excuse for dominating over the Native Americans (Trundle, 2012). It was also used as a foundation for the civil rights movement as Martin Luther King Jr. presented his speech through his own personal belief system. More recent was September 11 when the twin towers were destroyed through religious beliefs. The bombers claimed that it was for religious purposes on why they did what they did. In effect, all religions joined together in America to rebuild and grow stronger. Religion has brought people together in times of need, throughout history.

== What happens after Religion ==
Fewer and fewer people believe nowadays. It's possible that in a generation, there simply won’t be religion across [[Europe]] and large sections of [[North America]], [[Australia]], and [[Asia]]. That's not necessarily a problem. However, it is worth thinking about why people made up religion in the first place, and what we’re doing with the needs and longings that led them to do so. At one level, religions are about asking us to believe in something. When people say, they can’t believe, they tend to stop right there with the whole religion business. They often then point out all the horrid things that religions have undoubtly done and continue to do. In this sense, belief is almost the least important and defiantly the least interesting side of religion. What's fascinating is all the other stuff religions get up to. For example, the way they regularly gather people around, and tell them to be nice to one another. Also, the way they create a sense of community, teaching others to see everyone else as human beings (Gruber, 2008). Religions use rituals to point stuff out to us and lodge it in our fickle minds. For example, that the seasons are changing or that it's the time to remember our ancestors. Religions know were not just intellectual creatures, so they carefully appeal to us via art and beauty. We think of beauty in one category, a frivolous and superficial thing, and truth and depth in another. Religions join them together. They build temples, cathedrals, and mosques that use beauty to lend depth to important ideas. They use the resources of art to remind us of what matters. Its directed at making us feel things, calm, pity, awe.

We may no longer believe, but the needs and longings that make up these stories go on. We long for beauty, wisdom, and purpose. We want to live for something more than just ourselves. Society tells us to direct our hopes in two areas. These are romantic love, and professional success, and it distracts us with news, movies, and consumption. It's not enough, as we know. We need reminders to be good, places to reawaken awe, and something to awaken our kinder, less selfish impulses. Universal things which need tending like delicate flowers and rituals that bring us together. The choice isn’t between religion and a secular world as it is now. The challenge is to learn from religions, so we can fill the secular world with replacements for the things we long ago made up religion to provide (Giovanni, 2003).

The movement has an intense [[chromaticism]] with a great representation of [[ayahuasca]] experience psychedelic —a delirious artistic style that is seen strongly in the non-Amazonian pop art works of [[Pablo Amaringo]]. Originally, it is an [[mural]] art that blends prominently the colorful amazonian culture, European motifs and commercial characters, which could be influenced by American [[pop art]] when the era of [[cable television]] came to the city, like [[MTV]].&lt;ref name="El país" /&gt;

Amazonian pop art grew [[self-taught]]. Mainly started in the suburbs of Iquitos, where there was no [[art market]], or some kind of [[art school]], because that too is considered a [[naive art|naive]] style.&lt;ref name=SobrePeru /&gt;

Essentially, the Amazonian pop art originated from various mixes of popular culture Iquitos received through the media, including [[movie poster]]s, typography of [[Cinema of Mexico|film in Mexico]] and [[Bollywood|India]]. Another important feature is the visual style that originated from [[music video]]s.&lt;ref name="El país" /&gt; Typically, in most of the Amazonian pop art works is denoted [[nightclub]]s, [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s and pubs video scene. In several other compositions, it also becomes large presence of the feminine and the [[erotic]].&lt;ref name=SobrePeru /&gt;

In the visual, Amazonian pop art is divided into two categories: the ''diurnal'' works have consistent and complete colors, and the ''nocturn'' works, the most attractive, are painted with [[phosphorescent]] material —often taking infinite forms as a collection of [[neon light]]s—, that glow under [[black light]] or simple night.&lt;ref name="El país" /&gt;

Currently, several artists engaged in decorating the rustic architecture of the city —such as [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s and [[stilt house|palafittes]]— in areas such as the [[Belén District, Maynas|Belen District]] as a method of [[artistic expression]] and cultural influence. The cultural impact of art was so attractive that comes up in cemeteries.&lt;ref name="El país" /&gt;

Mario Raimondo, known as '''Barbadirame''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] artist.

==Life==
Barbadirame was a close associate of [[Pablo Picasso]] from when the pair first met in the 1950s until Picasso’s death in 1973. Speaking about Barbadirame in 1963 Pablo Picasso said: “To speak about young painters it is not my habit. The Italian painter ‘Raimondo' known as ‘Barbadirame', is a true painter, serious, like the workers of his earth. He implements his works decisively and with simplicity. The stone walls, the mediterranean olive trees, all have the same humanity of their agriculturists, the eternity. He is an artist that counts”.

Mario Raimondo was born in [[Dolceacqua]], Italy, in 1923. He began his professional life as a decorator, painting numerous frescoes in private residences and castles while wandering the [[Riviera dei Fiori]] and the [[Costa Azzurra]]. Barbadirame was a complete artist, equally at home in different mediums. A painter and a sculptor, one of his most famed sculptures is the huge statue he created, in collaboration with Mario Agrifoglio, in honor of  the astronomer [[Gian Domenico Cassini]] (1625–1712).

During his life Barbadirame’s exhibitions were attended by celebrities  including [[Jean Cocteau]], Picasso, [[Grace Kelly]] and her husband, the prince of Monaco. Towards the end of his career, Barbardirame received  the Biamonti Prize, a prize for art and literature portraying the true essence of Italy’s Liguria region. The prize was named after [[Francesco Biamonti]] (1933–2001), a celebrated Italian novelist from Liguria.  Biamonti himself wrote of Barbardirame’s work: “His peasants, his women, his Christs have lost every crudeness, without losing the truth of their solidity…” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanremobuonenotizie.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1256:dolceacqua-in-lutto-per-la-scomparsa-del-maestro-barbadirame&amp;catid=96:imperiese&amp;Itemid=320&amp;lang=it |title=All'artista Barbadirame la gratitudine di Dolceacqua|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbadirame died in [[Bordighera]], Italy, on 15 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumpagniadiventemigliusi.it/Galeria_feg%C3%BCrativa/Barbadirame.htm |title=cumpagniadiventemigliusi.it |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425051303/http://www.cumpagniadiventemigliusi.it/Galeria_feg%C3%BCrativa/Barbadirame.htm |archivedate=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
LaBruce was born in [[Tiverton, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gayle MacDonald |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/australians-wont-see-zombies-having-sex/article1647616/ |title=Australians won't see zombies having sex |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2010-07-22 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has claimed both '''Justin Stewart''' and '''Bryan Bruce''' as his birth name in different sources.&lt;ref&gt;"Filmmaker's series critiques gay sensibilities". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied film at [[York University]] in Toronto and wrote for ''[[Cineaction]]'' magazine, curated by [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]], his teacher.

He first gained public attention with the publication of the [[Queercore|queer punk]] [[zine]] ''[[J.D.s]]'', which he co-edited with [[G.B. Jones]].&lt;ref name=glbtq /&gt; He has written and photographed for a variety of publications including ''Vice'', the former [[Nerve.com]] and ''[[BlackBook Magazine]]'', and has been a columnist for the Canadian music magazine ''[[Exclaim!]]'' and Toronto's ''[[Eye Weekly]]'', as well as a contributing editor and photographer for New York's ''[[Index Magazine]]''. He has also been published in ''[[Toronto Life]]'', the ''[[National Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.

LaBruce's filmmaking style is marked by a blend of explicitly [[pornography|pornographic]] depictions of sex with more conventional [[narrative]] and filmmaking techniques, as well as an interest in extreme topics which mainstream audiences might dismiss as shocking or disturbing [[taboo]]s.&lt;ref name=romance&gt;"Bruce LaBruce: There Is a Certain Romance to It". ''L.A. Record'', June 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, his films have depicted scenes of sexual [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] and [[paraphilia]], [[BDSM]], [[gang rape]], [[racism|racially]]-motivated violence, [[acrotomophilia|amputee fetishism]], [[gerontophilia]], male and female [[prostitution]], and [[zombie]] and [[vampire]] sexuality.&lt;ref name=romance /&gt;

He has frequently been identified with the [[New Queer Cinema]] movement that emerged in the 1990s,&lt;ref name=romance /&gt; although at the height of that movement's prominence, he rejected the association on the grounds that he felt more personally aligned with the [[queercore]] movement.&lt;ref name=romance /&gt; The queercore movement was born in the 1980s and LaBruce was one of the fathers. Noted as the avant-garde and unapologetic gay answer to the punk movement, queercore expressed the very same discontent with society as the punks were stating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dave Croyle |year=2014|title=Sexual Revolution, Bruce LaBruce |publisher=Gay Essential |accessdate=10 December 2014 |url=http://gay-themed-films.com/sexual-revolution-bruce-labruce/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His movie, ''[[Otto; or Up with Dead People]]'' debuted at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]]. ''[[L.A. Zombie]]'' was banned from the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] in 2010 because, in the opinion of Australian censors, it would have been refused classification. However, the film was subsequently able to screen at OutTakes, a [[New Zealand]] lesbian and gay international film festival, in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/21/2959594.htm Festival zombie porn flick banned]. [[ABC (Australia)|ABC News]], July 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2010/07/21/zombie-film-bruce-labruce.html |title=Bruce LaBruce zombie film banned in Australia|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, LaBruce directed a performance of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s opera ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' at the [[Hebbel am Ufer]] Theatre in [[Berlin]]. This iteration of the opera included gender diversity, [[castration]] scenes and [[dildo]]s, as well as portraying Pierrot as a [[transgender]] [[trans man|man]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ladner. [http://www.buttmagazine.com/magazine/interviews/pierrot-lunaire "Bruce LaBruce and Item Idem at the Opera"]. ''[[Butt (magazine)|Butt]]'', March 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently also filmed this adaptation as the 2014 theatrical film ''[[Pierrot Lunaire (film)|Pierrot Lunaire]]''.

Beginning with ''[[Gerontophilia (film)|Gerontophilia]]'' in 2013, LaBruce dropped some of the more sexually explicit aspects of his filmmaking style. He retained his traditional interest in exploring sexual taboos, dramatizing an intergenerational relationship between a young man and a senior citizen, but opted to do so within a film that would be more palatable to a mainstream audience.&lt;ref name=huffington&gt;[http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/19/bruce-labruce-gerontophilia_n_2332835.html "Marie-Hélène Thibault et Pier-Gabriel Lajoie dans «Gerontophilia», un film de Bruce LaBruce tourné à Montréal"]. ''[[Huffington Post]]'', December 19, 2012. {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and style==
According to Courtney Fathom Sell of ''South Coast Today'', some of his films explore themes of sexual and interpersonal [[relational transgression|transgression]] against cultural norms, frequently blending the artistic and production techniques of [[independent film]] with [[gay pornography]].&lt;ref name=southcoasttoday&gt;[http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080227/SC2470202/80226025 Punched in the Nose: An Interview with Filmmaker Bruce LaBruce].

The '''Carthage Treasure''' is a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] silver hoard, which was found in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]], at the site of the ancient city of [[Carthage]]. The treasure principally consists of silver tableware and jewellery, most of which is now held at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=31013&amp;plaA=31013-3-2 British Museum Collection], British Museum, retrieved April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The hoard was unearthed in the nineteenth century at the Hill of St Louis in Carthage, which at the time of its deposition was the largest city of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsulare]].&lt;ref name=bowl/&gt;  Most of the treasure was purchased by Sir [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]], a senior curator at the British Museum, who bequeathed it to the museum upon his death in 1897. However, a small part of the treasure can be found in the [[Louvre]], including one of the silver covered bowls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=9434 Louvre Collection], Louvre Collection, retrieved April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and attribution==
[[Image:Carthage (2).JPG|thumb|A bowl with low relief scenes of shepherds]]
Dating to the second half of the fourth century AD, the Carthage Treasure comprises 31 different objects, primarily luxury silver tableware and jewellery that must have belonged to a wealthy Roman family who for some reason decided to [[hoard|bury it for safe-keeping]]. This may have been because of the religious feud around the year 400 but it is more likely that the treasure was hidden from the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals, led by [[Gaiseric]], invaded Africa Proconsulare from Spain in 429 and in 439 the city [[Battle of Carthage (439)|became]] capital of the [[Vandal Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=caygill&gt;{{cite book|last=Caygill|first=Marjorie|title=The British Museum A&amp;ndash;Z Companion|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135968942|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1135968942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscribed in the centre of one of the dishes around the [[tondo (art)|tondo]] is D D ICRESCONI CLARENT, which is associated with the Cresconii, a powerful Roman North African family in Carthage&lt;ref name=bowl&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/b/bowl_from_the_carthage_treasur.aspx Bowl from the Carthage Treasure], Highlights, British Museum, retrieved 3 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; who are well known from deeds and records of office-holders at this time.

==Description of the treasure==

The treasure includes a pair of flat dishes (one of which identifies the family), two bowls with chased and hammered pastoral scenes in relief around the edge,&lt;ref name=bowl /&gt; four hemispherical [[bowl]]s with high tapering feet (two of which still have their covers), a shallow bowl with handle and [[frog]] engraved in the centre, twelve silver spoons, and a mixed collection of [[jewellery]]: a finger ring, a cameo, a pair of ear rings, several [[Engraved gem|intaglios]] and two necklaces, one made of gold, the other with precious stones.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; The jewelled necklace consists of twelve polygonal emeralds, thirteen sapphires, matched by twenty five pearls all joined by gold links.&lt;ref name=arc&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofearly00britiala/catalogueofearly00britiala_djvu.txt ''Catalogue of early Christian antiquities and objects from the Christian East in the Department of British and mediaeval antiquities and ethnography of the British museum''], [[Ormonde Maddock Dalton|O. M. Dalton]], 1901&lt;/ref&gt;

The family would have owned two collections of silver: One known as ''argentum potorium'' that was the drinking set and another for eating called the ''argentum escarium''. Amongst this find were several silver hemispherical lidded bowls that measure 12&amp;nbsp;cm high and 12&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. The vessels' elegant design includes a tall base that complements the knop of the bowl's lid. The bowls also incorporate subtle [[facet]]s on the lids' curved surfaces.&lt;ref name=coveredbowl /&gt; Similar bowls have been found at the Roman site of [[Viminacium]] near the modern town of [[Kostolac]] in Serbia.&lt;ref name=coveredbowl&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/silver-bowl-from-the-carthage-treasure/dwGIZejwDjWdNQ Silver bowl from the Carthage Treasure], British Museum, retrieved 10 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cast Paper''' is a [[Paper craft|paper crafting technique]] in which paper fiber or pulp, such as [[Cotton paper|cotton fiber paper]], is formed using a mold. The pulp may consist of pure fiber, or be an amalgam of fiber, binder, and filler, such as [[Papier-mâché]].   The technique is employed for in-the-round sculpture as well as [[bas-relief]].

There have been a variety of '''Christian views on poverty and wealth'''. At one end of the spectrum is a view which casts wealth and materialism as an evil to be avoided and even combatted.  At the other end is a view which casts prosperity and well-being as a blessing from God. 

Many taking the former position address the topic in relation to the modern [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal capitalism]] that shapes the Western world. [[Americans|American]] [[theologian]] [[John B. Cobb]] has argued that the "economism that rules the West and through it much of the East" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that "man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)". He asserts that it is obvious that "Western society is organized in the service of wealth" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West.&lt;ref name="Cobb, Jr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern View of Economics |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3607 |first=John B. |last=Cobb, Jr. |accessdate=2011-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906075839/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3607 |archivedate=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scottish people|Scottish]] theologian Jack Mahoney has characterized the saying of Jesus in {{bibleref|Mark|10:23–27}} as having "imprinted themselves so deeply on the Christian community through the centuries that those who are well off, or even comfortably off, often feel uneasy and troubled in conscience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Companion encyclopedia of theology |first=Jack |last=Mahoney |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1995 |page=759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians argue that a proper understanding of Christian teachings on wealth and poverty needs to take a larger view where the accumulation of wealth is not the central focus of one's life but rather a resource to foster the "good life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Church and Society: Orthodox Christian Perspectives, Past Experiences, and Modern Challenges |first=George P. |last=Liacopulos |publisher=Somerset Hall Press |year=2007 |page=88 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xxY3gfmzdwwC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Christianity+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780977461059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[David W. Miller]] has constructed a three-part rubric which presents three prevalent attitudes among Protestants towards wealth.  According to this rubric, Protestants have variously viewed wealth as: (1) an offense to the Christian faith (2) an obstacle to faith and (3) the outcome of faith.&lt;ref name="Miller2007"&gt;Miller, David W. "Wealth Creation as Integrated with Faith: A Protestant Reflection" Muslim, Christian, and Jewish Views on the Creation of Wealth April 23–24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth and faith==

===Wealth as an offense to faith===

According to historian Alan S. Kahan, there is a strand of Christianity that views the wealthy man as "especially sinful". In this strand of Christianity, Kahan asserts, the day of judgment is viewed as a time when "the social order will be turned upside down and ... the poor will turn out to be the ones truly blessed."&lt;ref name=Kahan43&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S. |last=Kahan |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote "Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things."

David Miller suggests that this view is similar to that of the third century [[Manichaeanism|Manicheans]] who saw the spiritual world as being good and the material world as evil with the two being in irreconcilable conflict with each other.&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt;  Thus, this strand of Christianity exhorts Christians to renounce material and worldly pleasures in order to follow Jesus.  As an example, Miller cites Jesus' injunction to his disciples to "take nothing for the journey."{{bibleref2|Mark|6:8–9}}

The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] advocate [[voluntary poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/daytext.cfm?TextID=150 |title=More About Holy Poverty. Which Is Voluntary Poverty. |author=[[Dorothy Day]] |date=February 1945 |work= |publisher=[[The Catholic Worker]] |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=A Penny a Copy: Readings from the Catholic Worker |first=Tom | last=Cornell |authorlink=Tom Cornell |first2=Robert | last2=Ellsberg|authorlink2=Robert Ellsberg |year=1995 |page=198 |publisher=Orbis Books |quote=At its deepest level voluntary poverty is a way of seeing the world and the things of the world.… The Gospels are quite clear: the rich man is told to sell all he has and give to the poor, for it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven. And we are clearly instructed that 'you can not serve God and Mammon'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians, such as [[New Monasticism|New Monastics]], may choose to reject personal wealth and follow an [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle, in part as a protest against "a church and public that embraces wealth, luxury and ostentatious power."&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahlbusch|first=Erwin|title=The Encyclopedia Of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5V7oyy69zgC&amp;pg=PA307|accessdate=18 June 2012|year=2005|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2416-5|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth as an obstacle to faith===
According to David Miller, [[Martin Luther]] viewed Mammon (or the desire for wealth) as "the most common idol on earth".  Miller cites Jesus' encounter with the rich ruler {{bibleverse|Mark|10:17–31}} as an example of wealth being an obstacle to faith.  According to Miller, it is not the rich man's wealth per se that is the obstacle but rather the man's reluctance to give up that wealth in order to follow Jesus.  Miller cites [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s observation in [[First Epistle to Timothy|1st Timothy]] that, “people who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction." {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|6:9}}.  Paul continues on with the observation that "the love of money is the root of all evil."
{{bibleverse|1|Timothy|6:10}}  Miller emphasizes that "it is the love of money that is the obstacle to faith, not the money itself."&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!" The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is[a] to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the [[Eye of a needle#Christianity|eye of a needle]] than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?" Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kahan cites Jesus' injunction against amassing material wealth as an example that the "good [Christian] life was one of poverty and charity, storing up treasures in heaven instead of earth.&lt;ref name=Kahan43 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. {{bibleverse|Matthew|6|19:21}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jesus counsels his followers to remove from their lives those things which cause them to sin, saying "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to go with two hands into hell, where the fire never goes out." {{bibleref2|Mark|9:42–49}}.  In order to remove the desire for wealth and material possessions as an obstacle to faith, some Christians have taken vows of poverty.  Christianity has a long tradition of voluntary poverty which is manifested in the form of asceticism, charity and almsgiving.&lt;ref name=WellsQuash&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Christian Ethics |first1=Samuel |last1=Wells |first2=Ben |last2=Quash|publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |page=244 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ezy6wZJHFCoC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=Christian+land+wealth+usury#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20land%20wealth%20usury&amp;f=false|isbn=9781405152778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kahan argues that Christianity is unique because it sparked the beginning of a phenomenon which he calls the "Great Renunciation" in which "millions of people would renounce sex and money in God's name."&lt;ref name=Kahan43/&gt;

In [[Roman Catholicism]], poverty is one of the [[evangelical counsels]].  Pope [[Benedict XVI]] distinguishes "poverty ''chosen''" (the poverty of spirit proposed by Jesus), and "poverty ''to be fought''" (unjust and imposed poverty). He considers that the moderation implied in the former favors solidarity, and is a necessary condition so as to fight effectively to eradicate the abuse of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20090101_world-day-peace_en.htmlWorldPeaceDayAddress2009 Homily of His Holiness Benedict XVI]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[religious institute]]s also take a [[vow]] of extreme poverty. For example, the [[Franciscan]] orders have traditionally foregone all individual and corporate forms of ownership.

===Wealth as an outcome of faith===
One line of Protestant thinking views the pursuit of wealth as not only acceptable but as a religious calling or duty.  This perspective is generally ascribed to [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[Puritan]] theologies, which view hard work and frugal lifestyles as spiritual acts in themselves.  [[John Wesley]] was a strong proponent of gaining wealth, according to his famous "Sermon 50," in which he said, "gain all you can, save all you can and give all you can."&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt; It is impossible to give to charity if one is poor; John Wesley and his Methodists were noted for their consistently large contributions to charity in the form of churches, hospitals and schools.  

Included among those who view wealth as an outcome of faith are modern-day preachers and authors who propound [[prosperity theology]], teaching that God promises wealth and abundance to those who will believe in him and follow his laws. Prosperity theology (also known as the "health and wealth gospel") is a [[Christianity|Christian]] religious belief whose proponents claim the [[Bible]] teaches that financial blessing is the will of [[God in Christianity|God]] for Christians. Most teachers of prosperity theology maintain that a combination of [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], positive speech, and donations to specific Christian ministries will always cause an increase in material wealth for those who practice these actions. Prosperity theology is almost always taught in conjunction with [[continuationism]].

Prosperity theology first came to prominence in the [[United States]] during the [[Healing Revival]]s in the 1950s. Some commentators have linked the genesis of prosperity theology with the influence of the [[New Thought]] movement. It later figured prominently in the [[Word of Faith]] movement and 1980s [[televangelism]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, it became accepted by many influential leaders in the [[charismatic movement]] and has been promoted by Christian [[missionaries]] throughout the world. It has been harshly criticized by leaders of mainstream [[evangelicalism]] as a non-scriptural doctrine or as an outright [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]].

==Precursors to Christianity==

Professor [[Cosimo Perrotta]] describes the early Christian period as one which saw "the meeting and clash of three great cultures: the Classical, the Hebrew (of the Old Testament) and the Christian." Perrotta describes the cultures as having radically different views of money and wealth.  Whereas the Hebrew culture prized material wealth, the Classical and [[Christian culture]]s either held them in contempt or preached indifference to them.  However, Perrotta points out that the motivation of the Classical and Christian cultures for their attitudes were very different and thus the logical implications of the attitudes resulted in different outcomes.&lt;ref name=Perrotta43&gt;{{cite book |title=Consumption as an Investment: The fear of goods from Hesiod to Adam Smith|first=Cosimo |last=Perrotta |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004  |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2ogMXO-ZxbEC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20wealth%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780203694572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish attitudes in the Old Testament===
{{further|Jewish views of poverty, wealth and charity}}

Perrotta characterizes the attitude of the Jews as expressed in the Old Testament scriptures as being "completely different from the classical view."  He points out that servile and hired work was not scorned by the Jews of the Old Testament as it was by Greco-Roman thinkers.  Instead, such work was protected by biblical commandments to pay workers on time and not to cheat them.  The poor were protected from being exploited when in debt.  Perrotta asserts that the goal of these commandments was "not only to protect the poor but also to prevent the excessive accumulation of wealth in a few hands."  In essence, the poor man is "protected by God".  However, Perrotta points out that poverty is not admired nor is it considered a positive value by the writers of the Old Testament.  The poor are protected because the weak should be protected from exploitation.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44&gt;{{cite book |title=Consumption as an Investment: The fear of goods from Hesiod to Adam Smith|first=Cosimo |last=Perrotta |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004  |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2ogMXO-ZxbEC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20wealth%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780203694572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perrotta points out that material wealth is highly valued in the Old Testament; the Hebrews seek it and God promises to bless them with it if they will follow his commandments.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44 /&gt;  Joseph Francis Kelly writes that biblical writers leave no doubt that God enabled men such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Solomon to achieve wealth and that this wealth was a sign of divine favor.  However, Kelly also points out that the Old Testament insisted that the rich aid the poor.  Prophets such as Amos castigated the rich for oppressing the poor and crushing the needy.  In summary, Kelly writes that, "the Old Testament saw wealth as something good but warned the wealthy not to use their position to harm those with less.  The rich had an obligation to alleviate the sufferings of the poor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World of the early Christians |first=Joseph Francis |last=Kelly |publisher=Liturgical Press |year=1997 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3Pw-n3puQwsC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22Old+Testament%22+attitudes+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Old%20Testament%22%20attitudes%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9780814653135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
{{quote|''Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.''|[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#6:20|Luke 6:20]]}}

===The Gospels===
Jesus explicitly condemns excessive love of wealth as an intrinsic evil in various passages in the Gospels, especially in Luke (Luke 16:14–15 being an especially clear example).  He also consistently warns of the danger of riches as a hindrance to favor with God; as in the [[Parable of the Sower]], where it is said:

:"And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in; it chokes the Word, which becomes unfruitful"  – Mark 4:19.

Jesus makes [[Mammon]] a personification of riches, one in opposition to God, and which claims a person's service and loyalty as God does. But Jesus rejects the possibility of dual service on our part: for, he says, no one can serve both God and Mammon.

In the story of [[Jesus and the rich young man]] the young ruler's wealth inhibits him from following Jesus and thereby attaining the Kingdom. Jesus comments on the young man's discouragement thus:

:"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the [[eye of a needle]] than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."  Those who heard this were astonished, "Who then can be saved?", they asked.  Jesus replied, "What is impossible with man is possible with God."   – Luke 19:23–27

In the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]], Jesus exhorts his hearers to sell their earthly goods and give to the poor, and so provide themselves with "a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys" (Lk 12.33); and he adds "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Lk 12.34).

In [[The Parable of the Rich Fool]] Jesus tells the story of a rich man who decides to rest from all his labors, saying to himself:

:"And I will say to myself 'You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.' But God spoke to him, saying 'You fool! This very night your life will be required of you. Then who will get all that you have prepared for yourself?'" – Luke 12:16–20.

And Jesus adds, "This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God" (Lk 12.21).

[[Jesus and Zacchaeus]] (Lk 19.1–10) is an example of storing up heavenly treasure, and being rich toward God. The repentant tax collector Zacchaeus not only welcomes Jesus into his house but joyfully promises to give half of his possessions to the poor, and to rebate overpayments four times over if he defrauded anyone (Lk 19.8).

Luke strongly ties the right use of riches to discipleship; and securing heavenly treasure is linked with caring for the poor, the naked and the hungry, for God is supposed to have a special interest in the poor. This theme is consistent with God's protection and care of the poor in the Old Testament.

Thus, Jesus cites the words of the prophet Isaiah (Is:61.1–2) in proclaiming his mission:

:"The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."  – Luke 4:18–19

Luke, as is well known, had a particular concern for the poor as the subjects of Jesus' compassion and ministry. In his version of the [[Beatitudes]], the poor are blessed as the inheritors of God's kingdom (Lk 6.20–23), even as the corresponding curses are pronounced to the rich (Lk 6.24–26).

God's special interest in the poor is also expressed in the theme of the eschatological "great reversal" of fortunes between the rich and the poor in [[The Magnificat]] (Lk 1.46–55):

:He has shown the might of his arm:
:and has scattered the proud, in the conceit of their hearts.
:He has pulled down the mighty from their thrones,
:and exalted the lowly.
:He has filled the hungry with good things;
:and the rich has sent empty away.
:—Luke 1:51–53

and in Jesus repeated use of the tag "many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first" (Mt 19.30, Mt 20.16, Mk 10.31 &amp; Lk 13.30) and similar figures (Mt 23.12, Lk 14.11 &amp; Lk 18.14).

In the [[Parable of the Wedding Feast]], it is "the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame" who become God’s honored guests, while others reject the invitation because of their earthly cares and possessions (Lk 14.7–14).

===Acts of the Apostles===

Luke’s concern for the rich and the poor continues in the Acts with a greater focus on the unity of the nascent Christian communities. The two famous passages (2.43–45; 4.32–37), which have been appealed to throughout history as the “normative ideal” of the [[common ownership|community of goods]] for Christians, rather describe the extent of fellowship (koinōnia) in Jerusalem community as a part of distinctive Christian identity. Acts also portrays both positive and negative uses of wealth: those who practiced almsgiving and generosity to the poor (9.36; 10.2, 4) and those who gave priority to money over the needs of others (5.1–11; 8.14–24).

===Epistles===
For Paul, riches mainly denotes the character and activity of God and Christ – spiritual blessings and/of salvation – (e.g., Rom. 2.4; 9.23; 2 Cor. 8.9; Eph. 1.7, 18; 2.4, 7) although he occasionally refers to typical Jewish piety and Greco-Roman moral teachings of the time, such as generosity (Rom. 12.8, 13; 2 Cor. 8.2; Eph. 4.28; 1 Tim. 6.17 ) and hospitality (1 Tim. 5.10) with warnings against pride (1 Tim. 6.17) and greed (1 Cor. 5.11; 1 Tim. 3.8). 1 Tim. 6.10 seems to reflect a popular Cynic-Stoic moral teaching of
the period: “the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.” Paul’s focus of generosity is devoted to the collection for the church in Jerusalem (Gal. 2.10; 1 Cor. 16.1–4; 2 Cor 8.1 – 9.15; Rom. 15.25–31) as an important symbol of unity between Jewish and gentile believers with an appeal to material and spiritual reciprocity. It is also noteworthy that Paul's teaching in 1 Tim 6:17 implies there were rich believers in the Early Church.

A concept related to the accumlation of wealth is [[World (theology)#Christianity|Worldliness]], which is denounced by the Epistles of James and John:  "Don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God" (Ja 4.4). The first letter of John says, in a similar vein: "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him” (1 Jn 2:15).

The Epistle of James also stands out for its vehement condemnation of the oppressive rich, who were presumably outsiders to the Christian community, which mainly consisted of the poor. Adopting the [[Psalter]]'s convention of the “wicked rich” and the “pious poor” and adopting its voice, James indicts the rich with the sins of hoarding wealth, fraudulently withholding wages, corruption,  pride, luxury, covetousness and murder; and denounces the folly of their actions in the face of the imminent [[Day of Judgement]].

===Revelation===
Finally, the Revelation treats earthly riches and commercial activities with great ambivalence. While Jesus exposes the true poverty of the Laodicean church’s boast of wealth (3.17–18), he presents himself as the true source and dispenser of wealth (cf. 2 Cor. 8.13–15). Later, earthly riches and businesses activities are associated with the sins of Babylon, the earthly power of evil with self-accorded glory and luxury, whose fall is imminent (18.1–24). However, the Revelations also portrays the New Jerusalem with a lavish materialistic description, made of pure gold decorated with “every kind of precious stone” (21.18–19).

==Early Christianity==
[[File:Vespiolla Apostoli 3.jpg|thumb|240px|15th-century fresco of the Apostles, [[Turin]], Italy]]
Early Christianity appears to have adopted many of the ethical themes found in the Hebrew Bible.  However, the teachings of Jesus and his apostles as presented in the New Testament exhibit an "acute sensitivity to the needs of the disadvantaged" that Frederick sees as "adding a critical edge to Christian teaching where wealth and the pursuit of economic gain are concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A companion to business ethics |first=Robert |last=Frederick |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2002 |pages=292–93 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PDXVnfyKHBIC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+business#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20business&amp;f=false|isbn=9781405101028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Kahan points to the fact that Jesus was a poor man as emblematic of "a revolution in the way poverty and wealth were viewed."&lt;ref name=Kahan44&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S. |last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=44|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not to say that Christian attitudes borrowed nothing from its Greco-Roman and Jewish precursors.  Kahan acknowledges that, "Christian theology absorbed those Greco-Roman attitudes towards money that complemented its own."  However, as Kahan puts it, "Never before had any god been conceived of as poor."&lt;ref name=Kahan44 /&gt;  He characterizes Christian charity as being "different in kind from the generosity praised in the classical tradition."&lt;ref name=Kahan42&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S.|last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahan contrasts the attitudes of early Christians with those of classical thinkers such as Seneca.  The New Testament urges Christians to sell material possessions and give the money to the poor.  According to Kahan, the goal of Christian charity is equality, a notion which is absent in the Greco-Roman attitudes toward the poor.&lt;ref name=Kahan42/&gt;

Cosimo Perrotta characterizes the Christian attitude vis-a-vis poverty and work as being "much closer to the tradition of the Old Testament than to classical culture."&lt;ref name=Perrotta43 /&gt;  However, [[Irving Kristol]] suggests that Christianity's attitude towards wealth is markedly different from that of the Hebrews in the Old Testament.  Kristol asserts that traditional Judaism has no precepts that parallel the Christian assertion that it is difficult for a rich man to get into heaven.&lt;ref name=Kristol437&gt;{{cite book |title=Neoconservatism: the autobiography of an idea |first=Irving |last=Kristol |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1995 |page=437 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=S2nUuTagIw8C&amp;pg=PA437&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780028740218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perrotta characterizes Christianity as not disdaining material wealth as did classical thinkers such as [[Socrates]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|the Cynics]] and Seneca and yet not desiring it as the Old Testament writers did.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44 /&gt;

==Patristic era==

Many of the [[Church Fathers]] condemned private property and advocated the communal ownership of property as an ideal for Christians to follow.  However, they recognized early on that this was an ideal which was not practical in everyday life and viewed private property as a "necessary evil resulting from the fall of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Outlines of economics |first1=Richard Theodore |last1=Ely |first2=Thomas Sewall |last2=Adams |first3=Max Otto |last3=Lorenz |first4=Allyn Abbott |last4=Young |publisher=Macmillan |year=1920 |page=743 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TiYuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA743&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
American theologian [[Robert M. Grant (theologian)|Robert Grant]] noted that, while almost all of the Church Fathers condemn the "love of money for its own sake and insist upon the positive duty of almsgiving", none of them seems to have advocated the general application of Jesus' counsel to the rich young man viz. to give away all of his worldly possessions in order to follow him.&lt;ref name=Grant49&gt;{{cite book |title=Augustus to Constantine: the rise and triumph of Christianity in the Roman world |first=Robert McQueen |last=Grant |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2004 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=d_vxEB7nT_QC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20fathers%20attitudes%20money%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9780664227722 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] urged Christians to turn away from the desire for material wealth and success.  He argued that the accumulation of wealth was not a worthy goal for Christians.

[[Clement of Alexandria]] counselled that property be used for the good of the community, he sanctioned private ownership of property and the accumulation of wealth.&lt;ref name=Rothbard&gt;{{cite book |title=An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |year=2006 |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MCcWhLmRo-cC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781610164771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lactantius]] wrote that "the ownership of property contains the material of both vices and virtues but communism [communitas] contains nothing but license for vice."&lt;ref name=Grant49 /&gt;

==Medieval Europe==
{{further|Apostolic poverty}}
By the beginning of the medieval era, the Christian paternalist ethic was "thoroughly entrenched in the culture of Western Europe."  Individualist and materialist pursuits such as greed, avarice, and the accumulation of wealth were condemned as un-Christian.&lt;ref name=Hunt10&gt;{{cite book |title=Property and Prophets: The Evolution of Economic Institutions and Ideologies  |first=E.

Madeleine Gray describes the medieval system of social welfare as one that was "organized through the church and underpinned by ideas on the spiritual value of poverty.&lt;ref name=Gray119&gt;{{cite book |title=The Protestant Reformation: belief, practice, and tradition |first=Madeleine |last=Gray |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |year=2003 |page=119 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z1qRnlLwWsgC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Protestant+Reformation+money+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781903900116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kahan, Christian theologians regularly condemned merchants.  For example, he cites [[Honorius of Autun]] who wrote that merchants had little chance of going to heaven whereas farmers were likely to be saved.  He further cites [[Gratian]] who wrote that "the man who buys something in order that he may gain by selling it again unchanged and as he bought it, that man is of the buyers and sellers who are cast forth from God's temple."&lt;ref name=Kahan46&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S.|last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the medieval era saw a change in the attitudes of Christians towards the accumulation of wealth.  [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined avarice not simply as a desire for wealth but as an ''immoderate'' desire for wealth.  Aquinas wrote that it was acceptable to have "external riches" to the extent that they were necessary for him to maintain his "condition of life".  This argued that the nobility had a right to more wealth than the peasantry.  What was unacceptable was for a person to seek to more wealth than was appropriate to one's station or aspire to a higher station in life.&lt;ref name=Kahan44 /&gt; The period saw fierce debates on [[Absolute Poverty of Christ|whether Christ owned property]].

The church evolved into the single most powerful institution in medieval Europe, more powerful than any single potentate.  The Church was so wealthy that, at one time, it owned as much as 20–30% of the land in Western Europe in an era when land was the primary form of wealth.  Over time, this wealth and power led to abuses and corruption.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Monasticism===
As early as the 6th and 7th centuries, the issue of property and move of wealth in the event of outside aggression had been addressed in monastic communities via agreements such as the [[Consensoria Monachorum]].&lt;ref name=Bishko &gt;Charles J. Bishko, "The Date and Nature of the Spanish Consensoria Monachorum", ''The American Journal of Philology'' Vol. 69, No. 4, 1948 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/290910] also at [http://libro.uca.edu/monastic/monastic2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= power &gt;''Topographies of power in the early Middle Ages'' by Frans Theuws, Mayke De Jong, Carine van Rhijn 2001 {{ISBN|90-04-11734-2}} p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; By the eleventh century, [[Benedictine]] monasteries had become wealthy, owing to the generous donations of monarchs and nobility.  Abbots of the larger monasteries achieved international prominence.  In reaction to this wealth and power, a reform movement arose which sought a simpler, more austere monastic life in which monks worked with their hands rather than acting as landlords over serfs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval panorama |first=Robert |last=Bartlett |publisher=Getty Publications |year=2001 |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DjI5t3DE00wC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=monastic+communities+Christian+medieval#v=onepage&amp;q=monastic%20communities%20Christian%20medieval&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 13th century, [[mendicant orders]] such as the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscans]] departed from the practice of existing religious orders by taking vows of extreme poverty and maintaining an active presence preaching and serving the community rather than withdrawing into monasteries. [[Francis of Assisi]] viewed poverty as a key element of the [[imitation of Christ]] who was "poor at birth in the manger, poor as he lived in the world, and naked as he died on the cross".&lt;ref name= Miles160 &gt;''The Word made flesh: a history of Christian thought'' by Margaret Ruth Miles 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0846-1}} pp. 160–61&lt;/ref&gt;

The visible public commitment of the Franciscans to poverty provided to the laity a sharp contrast to the wealth and power of the Church, provoking "awkward questions".&lt;ref name="Placher1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Carl Placher|author-link=William Placher |title=Readings in the History of Christian Theology: From its beginnings to the eve of the Reformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rya0v9bgwT8C&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=11 October 2011|date=15 April 1988|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-24057-8|pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usury===
{{main|Usury}}

[[File:UsuryDurer.jpg|right |thumb |Of Usury, from [[Sebastian Brant|Brant's]] ''Stultifera Navis'' ([[Narrenschiff|the Ship of Fools]]); [[woodcut]] attributed to [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]

[[Usury]] originally was the charging of [[interest]] on [[loan]]s; this included charging a fee for the use of money, such as at a [[bureau de change]]. In places where interest became acceptable, usury was interest above the rate allowed by law.  Today, usury commonly is the charging of unreasonable or relatively high rates of interest.

The first of the scholastics, [[Saint Anselm of Canterbury]], led the shift in thought that labeled charging interest the same as theft. Previously usury had been seen as a lack of charity.

St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], the leading theologian of the Catholic Church, argued charging of interest is wrong because it amounts to "double charging", charging for both the thing and the use of the thing.

This did not, as some think, prevent investment. What it stipulated was that in order for the investor to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short he must be a joint-venturer. Simply to invest the money and expect it to be returned regardless of the success of the venture was to make money simply by having money and not by taking any risk or by doing any work or by any effort or sacrifice at all. This is usury. St Thomas quotes Aristotle as saying that "to live by usury is exceedingly unnatural". St Thomas allows, however, charges for actual services provided. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out e.g. any fair administrative charges.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Reformation==

The rising capitalistic middle class resented the drain of their wealth to the church; in northern Europe, they supported local reformers against the corruption, rapacity and venality which they viewed as originating in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of commerce and industry |first=Cheesman Abiah|last=Herrick |publisher=Macmillan Co. |year=1917 |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BHVMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=medieval+Europe+Christian+church+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=medieval%20Europe%20Christian%20church%20wealth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calvinism===

One school of thought attributes [[Calvinism]] with setting the stage for the later development of [[capitalism]] in northern Europe. In this view, elements of Calvinism represented a revolt against the medieval condemnation of [[usury]] and, implicitly, of profit in general.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Such a connection was advanced in influential works by [[R. H. Tawney]](1880–1962) and by [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920).

Calvin criticized the use of certain passages of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others of them had been rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of [[Aristotle]]) that it is wrong to charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin's position is expressed in a letter to a friend quoted in {{cite book |last = Le Van Baumer | first = Franklin, editor | title = Main Currents of Western Thought: Readings in Western Europe Intellectual History from the Middle Ages to the Present | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven |year = 1978 | isbn = 0-300-02233-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puritanism==

For [[Puritan]]s, work was not simply arduous drudgery required to sustain life.  Joseph Conforti describes the Puritan attitude toward work as taking on "the character of a vocation — a calling through which one improved the world, redeemed time, glorified God, and followed life's pilgrimage toward salvation."&lt;ref name=Conforti42&gt;{{cite book |title=Saints and strangers: New England in British North America |first=Joseph A. |last=Conforti |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zsO6_qJ0s9UC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Puritan+%22Stewardship+of+wealth%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Puritan%20%22Stewardship%20of%20wealth%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780801882531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gayraud Wilmore characterizes the Puritan social ethic as focused on the "acquisition and proper stewardship of wealth as outward symbols of God's favor and the consequent salvation of the individual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=African American religious studies: an interdisciplinary anthology |first=Gayraud S. |last=Wilmore |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1989  |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-9vTPu5Z6QC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Puritan+%22Stewardship+of+wealth%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Puritan%20%22Stewardship%20of%20wealth%22&amp;f=false|isbn=0822309262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Puritans were urged to be producers rather than consumers and to invest their profits to create more jobs for industrious workers who would thus be enabled to "contribute to a productive society and a vital, expansive church."  Puritans were counseled to seek sufficient comfort and economic self-sufficiency but to avoid the pursuit of luxuries or the accumulation of material wealth for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Conforti42 /&gt;

==The rise of capitalism==

In two journal articles published in 1904–05, German sociologist [[Max Weber]] propounded a thesis that Reformed (i.e., Calvinist) Protestantism had engendered the character traits and values that under-girded modern capitalism. The English translation of these articles were published in book form in 1930 as ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. Weber argued that [[capitalism]] in northern Europe evolved because the [[Protestant]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) [[Protestant work ethic|ethic]] influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own [[Organization|enterprises]] and engaging in [[trade]] and the accumulation of [[wealth]] for investment. In other words, the [[Protestant work ethic]] was a force behind an unplanned and uncoordinated [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]] that influenced the development of [[capitalism]].

Weber's work focused scholars on the question of the uniqueness of Western civilization and the nature of its economic and social development.  Scholars have sought to explain the fact that economic growth has been much more rapid in Northern and Western Europe and its overseas offshoots than in other parts of the world including those that where the Catholic and Orthodox churches have been dominant over Protestantism.  Some have observed that explosive economic growth occurred at roughly the same time, or soon after, these areas experienced the rise of Protestant religions.  Stanley Engerman asserts that, although some scholars may argue that the two phenomena are unrelated, many would find it difficult to accept such a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism |url=http://eh.net/node/2724 |first=Stanley L. |last=Engerman |date=2000-02-29 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Chamberlain wrote that "Christianity tends to lead to a capitalistic mode of life whenever siege conditions do not prevail... [capitalism] is not Christian in and by itself; it is merely to say that capitalism is a material by-product of the Mosaic Law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Roots of Capitalism |first=John |last=Chamberlain |year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rodney Stark]] propounds the theory that Christian rationality is the primary driver behind the success of capitalism and the Rise of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success|first=Rodney|last=Stark|location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=2005 |isbn=1-4000-6228-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q9j6OoeWqK4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Christianity+capitalism#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John B. Cobb]] argues that the "economism that rules the West and through it much of the East" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that "man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)". He asserts that it is obvious that "Western society is organized in the service of wealth" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West.&lt;ref name="Cobb, Jr"/&gt;

[[Social justice]] generally refers to the idea of creating a society or institution that is based on the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and solidarity, that understands and values [[human rights]], and that recognizes the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name="EducationSocialJustice"&gt;{{cite book |title=Education and Social Justice |first1=Joseph I. |last1=Zajda |first2=S. |last2=Majhanovich |first3=V. |last3=Rust |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |isbn=1-4020-4721-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iCZH-x9FTWoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=education+and+social+justice+zajda#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NursingEthics"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nursing ethics: across the curriculum and into practice |first1=Janie B. |last1=Butts |first2=Karen |last2=Rich |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7637-4735-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DmUBBCVjW_gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Nursing+ethics%22+Butts+Rich+Jones#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nursing%20ethics%22%20Butts%20Rich%20Jones&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term and modern concept of "social justice" was coined by the [[Jesuit]] [[Luigi Taparelli]] in 1840 based on the teachings of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] and given further exposure in 1848 by [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati]].&lt;ref name="EducationSocialJustice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NursingEthics"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Battleground criminal justice by Gregg Barak, Greenwood publishing group 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-313-34040-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engineering and Social Justice By Donna Riley, Morgan and Claypool Publishers 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-59829-626-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spirituality, social justice, and language learning By David I.

Ryan]], who initiated the concept of a [[living wage]]. [[Father Coughlin]] also used the term in his publications in the 1930s and the 1940s. It is a part of [[Catholic social teaching]], [[Social Gospel]] from Episcopalians and is one of the [[Four Pillars of the Green Party]] upheld by [[Global Greens|green parties worldwide]]. Social justice as a secular concept, distinct from religious teachings, emerged mainly in the late twentieth century, influenced primarily by philosopher [[John Rawls]]. Some tenets of social justice have been adopted by those on the [[leftist|left]] of the [[political spectrum]].

According to Kent Van Til, the view that wealth has been taken from the poor by the rich implies that the redistribution of that wealth is more a matter of restitution than of theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Poverty and Morality: Religious and Secular Perspectives |first1=William A. |last1=Galston |first2=Peter H. |last2=Hoffenberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010  |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VyzuGet8080C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Christianity+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9781139491068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic social teaching===
{{main|Catholic social teaching}}

[[Catholic social teaching]] is a body of doctrine developed by the [[Catholic Church]] on matters of [[poverty]] and [[wealth]], [[economics]], [[social organization]] and the role of the [[state (polity)|state]].  Its foundations are widely considered to have been laid by Pope Leo XIII's 1891 [[encyclical|encyclical letter]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', which advocated economic [[distributism]] and condemned [[socialism]].

According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]], its purpose "is simply to help purify reason and to contribute, here and now, to the acknowledgment and attainment of what is just…. [The Church] has to play her part through rational argument and she has to reawaken the spiritual energy without which justice…cannot prevail and prosper",&lt;ref&gt;(Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas Est, 28).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pope John Paul II]], its foundation "rests on the threefold cornerstones of human dignity, solidarity and subsidiarity".&lt;ref&gt;(John Paul II, 1999 Apostolic Exhortation, Ecclesia in America, 55).&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns echo elements of [[Jewish law]] and the prophetic books of the [[Old Testament]], and recall the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] recorded in the [[New Testament]], such as his declaration that "whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of Mine, you have done for Me."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25:40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic social teaching is distinctive in its consistent critiques of [[modernity|modern]] social and political ideologies both of the left and of the right: [[liberalism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', § 99 ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fascism]], and [[Nazism]] have all been condemned, at least in their pure forms, by several popes since the late nineteenth century.

===Marxism===

Irving Kristol posits that one reason that those who are "experiencing a Christian impulse, an impulse toward the ''imitatio Christi'', would lean toward socialism ... is the attitude of Christianity toward the poor. "&lt;ref name=Kristol437 /&gt;

[[Arnold Toynbee]] characterized Communist ideology as a "Christian heresy" in the sense that it focused on a few elements of the faith to the exclusion of the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Study of History|first=Arnold |last=Toynbee |year=1961 |page=545 |quote=The Communist ideology was a Christian heresy in the sense that it had singled out several elements in Christianity and had concentrated on these to the exclusion of the rest.  It had taken from Christianity its social ideals, its intolerance and its fervour.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Donald Treadgold interprets Toynbee's characterization as applying to Christian attitudes as opposed to Christian doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The West in Russia and China: Russia, 1472–1917 |first=Donald W. |last=Treadgold |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1973 |page=256|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fg04AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA256&amp;lpg=PA256&amp;dq=%22Arnold+Toynbee%22+Communism+Christian+heresy#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Arnold%20Toynbee%22%20Communism%20Christian%20heresy&amp;f=false|isbn=9780521097253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, "Moral Philosophy", [[Jacques Maritain]] echoed Toynbee's perspective, characterizing the teachings of [[Karl Marx]] as a "Christian heresy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Moral Philosophy |first=Jacques |last=Maritain |quote=This is to say that Marx is a heretic of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and that Marxism is a 'Christian heresy', the latest Christian heresy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After reading Maritain, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] commented that Marxism had arisen in response to "a Christian world unfaithful to its own principles."  Although King criticized the Soviet Marxist–Leninist Communist regime sharply, he nonetheless commented that Marx's devotion to a classless society made him almost Christian. Tragically, said King, Communist regimes created "new classes and a new lexicon of injustice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=From civil rights to human rights: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the struggle for economic justice |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2007 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8k6btUYR68C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Martin+Luther+King+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Martin%20Luther%20King%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian socialism===
{{main|Christian socialism}}

[[Christian socialism]] generally refers to those on the [[Christian left]] whose politics are both [[Christian]] and [[socialist]] and who see these two philosophies as being interrelated. This category can include [[Liberation theology]] and the doctrine of the [[social gospel]].

The ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' [[encyclical]] of [[Leo XIII]] (1891) was the starting point of a [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic doctrine]] on social questions that has been expanded and updated over the course of the 20th century. Despite the introduction of social thought as an object of religious thought, ''Rerum novarum'' explicitly rejects what it calls "the main tenet of socialism":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Hence, it is clear that the main tenet of socialism, community of goods, must be utterly rejected, since it only injures those whom it would seem meant to benefit, is directly contrary to the natural rights of mankind, and would introduce confusion and disorder into the commonwealth. The first and most fundamental principle, therefore, if one would undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses, must be the inviolability of private property." ''Rerum novarum'', paragraph 16.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The encyclical promotes a kind of [[corporatism]] based on [[social solidarity]] among the classes with respects for the needs and rights of all.

In the November 1914 issue of ''The Christian Socialist'', Episcopal bishop [[Franklin Spencer Spalding]] of Utah, U.S.A. stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Christian Church exists for the sole purpose of saving the human race. So far she has failed, but I think that Socialism shows her how she may succeed. It insists that men cannot be made right until the material conditions be made right. Although man cannot live by bread alone, he must have bread. Therefore the Church must destroy a system of society which inevitably creates and perpetuates unequal and unfair conditions of life. These unequal and unfair conditions have been created by competition. Therefore competition must cease and cooperation take its place."&lt;ref name="D.Berman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=David|title=Radicalism in the Mountain West 1890–1920|year=2007|publisher=University Press of Colorado|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the explicit rejection of Socialism, in the more Catholic countries of [[Europe]] the encyclical's teaching was the inspiration that led to the formation of new [[Christian democracy|Christian-inspired Socialist parties]].  A number of Christian socialist movements and political parties throughout the world group themselves into the [[International League of Religious Socialists]]. It has member organizations in 21 countries representing 200,000 members.

Christian socialists draw parallels between what some have characterized as the [[egalitarian]] and anti-establishment message of [[Jesus]], who–according to the [[Gospel]]–spoke against the religious authorities of his time, and the egalitarian, anti-establishment, and sometimes [[anti-clerical]] message of most contemporary socialisms. Some Christian Socialists have become active [[Communism|Communists]]. This phenomenon was most common among [[missionary|missionaries]] in [[China]], the most notable being [[James Gareth Endicott]], who became supportive of the struggle of the [[Communist Party of China]] in the 1930s and 1940s.

[[Michael Moore]]'s film [[Capitalism: A Love Story]] also features a religious component where Moore examines whether or not capitalism is a [[sin]] and whether [[Jesus]] would be a capitalist,&lt;ref name="ChurchMoore"&gt;{{cite news| last=Moore|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Moore|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-moore/for-those-of-you-on-your_b_308948.html|title=For Those of You on Your Way to Church This Morning ...|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=October 4, 2009| accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to shine light on the ideological contradictions among [[Christian right#History|evangelical conservatives]] who support free market ideals.

===Liberation theology===
{{main|Liberation theology}}

[[Liberation theology]]&lt;ref&gt;In the mass media, 'Liberation Theology' can sometimes be used loosely, to refer to a wide variety of activist Christian thought. In this article the term will be used in the narrow sense outlined here.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Christian movement]] in [[political theology]] which interprets the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] in terms of a liberation from unjust economic, political, or social conditions. It has been described by proponents as "an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor's suffering, their struggle and hope, and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor",&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Berryman|Berryman, Phillip]], ''Liberation Theology: essential facts about the revolutionary movement in Latin America and beyond''(1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and by detractors as Christianized [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;"[David] Horowitz first describes liberation theology as 'a form of Marxised Christianity,' which has validity despite the awkward phrasing, but then he calls it a form of 'Marxist–Leninist ideology,' which is simply not true for most liberation theology..." Robert Shaffer, "[http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html Acceptable Bounds of Academic Discourse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904165644/http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html |date=2013-09-04 }}," Organization of American Historians Newsletter 35, November, 2007. URL retrieved 12 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement, it began as a movement within the [[Roman Catholic]] church in Latin America in the 1950s–1960s. Liberation theology arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by [[social injustice]] in that region. The term was coined in 1971 by the [[Peruvian]] priest [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], who wrote one of the movement's most famous books, ''A Theology of Liberation''. Other noted exponents are [[Leonardo Boff]] of Brazil, [[Jon Sobrino]] of El Salvador, and [[Juan Luis Segundo]] of Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McBrien,''Catholicism''(Harper Collins, 1994), chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Gutierrez,''A Theology of Liberation'', First (Spanish) edition published in Lima, Peru, 1971; first English edition published by Orbis Books (Maryknoll, New York), 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of liberation theology within the Catholic Church diminished after proponents using Marxist concepts were admonished by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] (CDF) in 1984 and 1986. The Vatican criticized certain strains of liberation theology – without actually identifying any particular strain – for focusing on institutional dimensions of sin to the exclusion of the individual; and for allegedly misidentifying the church hierarchy as members of the privileged class.&lt;ref name="Wojda, Paul J. 1995"&gt;Wojda, Paul J., "Liberation theology", in R.P. McBrien, ed., ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (Harper Collins, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cigar Factory Artist Studios''' is an emerging artist community in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]’s art district. The site formerly belonged to the Bondy and Lederer Cigar Company, and consists of a 101,239 square-foot repurposed cigar factory on North 4th and Green Street.  Today the building houses galleries, shops, and 45 artist studios.&lt;ref name=Whelan&gt;Whelan, Frank (February 18, 2014).  "History’s Headlines: From ‘Seegars’ to Artists’ Mecca.” ''WFMZ-TV History’s Headlines'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical overview of Allentown's industries==
Throughout history, Allentown has been a major contender in the manufacturing arena.  In the early nineteenth century, the area’s grain production was among the highest in the country, and by the middle of the century, the Industrial Revolution was well underway.  The [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] exported load after load of Allentown’s iron and steel.  By the turn of the twentieth century, the city had greatly diversified their economy and was now producing silk, beer, and cigars.&lt;ref name=Whelan /&gt;

==The cigar factory==
The factory building located at 707 North 4th Street was built between 1898 and 1900, for the purpose of [[cigar]] production.  The New York-based Bondy and Lederer Cigar Company were notable [[tobacco]] merchants and cigar manufacturers that employed 600 cigar rollers at their New York City headquarters in the late 19th century.  They chose Allentown for their business expansion because of the area’s reputation for its high-quality tobacco production and cigar manufacturing.   In 1913-1914, there were nearly 60 cigar manufacturing companies operating and contributing toward federal revenue of $482,505 made as a result of Allentown’s cigar production.&lt;ref name=Whelan /&gt;

The growing popularity of the cigarette was a large cause of the eventual decline of many cigar companies’ success in Allentown.  Cigarette manufacturers were enjoying better success by the 1920s, and their ability to mass-produce the more economical cigarette proved to be too much of a competition for the cigar manufacturers.  Against all odds, Bondy and Lederer continued to maintain their presence as a major Allentown cigar manufacturer until the 1960s.  After the cigar factory closure, the site was used briefly as a knitting mill.  After the knitting mill closed, 707 North 4th Street, along with many of its neighboring factory buildings, stood vacant.&lt;ref name=Whelan /&gt;

Today, the city attracts a wide variety of creative manufacturing, art producers, and light industrial companies wanting to lease space in the area.  There is a lack of available land for new construction, and the demand for affordable, structurally-sound space in general is high.  There is an attraction to refinished older buildings that have been refinished to meet modern needs.&lt;ref name=Martinez&gt;Martinez, Arlene (August 24, 2008). “Could it be another SOHO?” ''The Morning Call'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to Lehigh Valley’s largest arts building==
The former Bondy and Lederer factory building currently houses commercial space utilized by apparel manufacturers, and in 2012 the owner and developer secured a contractor that would redevelop remaining space into retail and office space, 45 artist studios, and a community art gallery.  Evidence of the building's original purpose remains present, such as the first floor's tobacco blowing tubes, where tobacco leaves were transported through the factory.&lt;ref name=Pedersen&gt;Pedersen, Brian (August 10, 2012). “Firm Transforms Old Factory into New Artist Building.” ''Lehigh Valley Business''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The North of Tilghman neighborhood, or No-Tie district, is a concentrated area of working artists and other creative minds that are enthusiastic and advocating for redevelopment projects.  This site in particular is unique in that the building and its revitalized surrounding area caters to artists and others producing within the creative arena.&lt;ref name=Martinez /&gt;

Because of this trend, the Cigar Factory Artist Studios has been well received by the community.  Monthly open house events and art installations are hosted by FUSE Art Infrastructure, and feature original works by occupants of the Cigar Factory, as well as other notable area artists.  Private studio spaces are often open to the public during these events. 
Since the ribbon cutting ceremony held on November 19, 2013, the Cigar Factory Artist Studios has grown to become Lehigh Valleys largest arts building.&lt;ref name=McEvoy&gt;McEvoy, Colin (November 19, 2013).

The '''creative class''' is a posited [[social class|socioeconomic class]] identified by American economist and social scientist [[Richard Florida]], a professor and head of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the [[Rotman School of Management]] at the [[University of Toronto]]. According to Florida, the creative class are a key driving force for economic development of [[post-industrial]] [[cities]] in the [[United States]].

==Overview==
Florida describes the creative class as comprising 40 million workers (about 30 percent of the U.S. workforce). He breaks the class into two broad sections, derived from [[Standard Occupational Classification System]] codes:
* Super-creative core: This group comprises about 12 percent of all U.S. jobs. It includes a wide range of occupations (e.g. science, engineering, education, [[computer programming]], research), with arts, design, and media workers forming a small subset. Florida considers those belonging to this group to "fully engage in the creative process" (2002, p.&amp;nbsp;69). The Super-Creative Core is considered innovative, creating commercial products and consumer goods. The primary job function of its members is to be creative and innovative. "Along with problem solving, their work may entail problem finding" (Florida, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;69).
* Creative [[professional]]s: These professionals are the classic [[Knowledge workers|knowledge-based workers]] and include those working in healthcare, business and finance, the legal sector, and education. They "draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems" using higher degrees of education to do so (Florida, 2002).

In addition to these two main groups of creative people, the usually much smaller group of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]s is also included in the creative class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Florida|first1=Richard|title=Bohemia and Economic Geography|journal=Journal of Economic Geography|date=2002|volume=2|pages=55–71|doi=10.1093/jeg/2.1.55|url=http://creativeclass.com/rfcgdb/articles/6%20Bohemia_and_Economic_Geography.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2002 study, Florida concluded that the creative class would be the leading force of growth in the economy expected to grow by over 10 million jobs in the next decade, which would in 2012 equal almost 40% of the population.

== Background ==
The social theories advanced by Florida have sparked much debate and discussion. Florida's work proposes that a new or emergent class—or demographic segment made up of knowledge workers, intellectuals and various types of artists—is an ascendant economic force, representing either a major shift away from traditional agriculture- or industry-based economies or a general restructuring into more complex economic hierarchies.

The theses developed by Florida in various publications were drawn from, among other sources, U.S. Census Bureau demographic data, focusing first on economic trends and shifts apparent in major U.S. cities, with later work expanding the focus internationally.

A number of specific cities and regions (including [[California]]'s [[Silicon Valley]], [[Boston]]'s [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]], [[Research Triangle|The Triangle]] in North Carolina, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Seattle]], [[Bangalore]], [[Dublin]] and [[Sweden]]) have come to be identified with these economic trends. In Florida's publications, the same places are also associated with large Creative Class populations.

Florida argues that the creative class is socially relevant because of its members' ability to spur regional economic growth through innovation (2002).

Walter Grünzweig, professor for American Studies at [[Technical University of Dortmund]], has shown that the origin of the term “creative class” does not lie with Florida, but instead goes back to a passage in [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay "Power" in his collection ''[[The Conduct of Life]]'' (1860).&lt;ref&gt;Grünzweig, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupations ==
Florida says that the creative class is a class of workers whose job is to create meaningful new forms (2002). It is composed of scientists and engineers, university professors, poets and architects, and also includes "people in design, education, arts, music and entertainment, whose economic function is to create new ideas, new technology and/or creative content" (Florida, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;8). The designs of this group are seen as broadly transferable and useful. Another sector of the Creative Class includes positions that are [[Knowledge economy|knowledge intensive]]; these usually require a high degree of formal education (Florida, 2002). Examples of workers in this sector are health professionals and business managers, who are considered part of the sub-group called Creative Professionals. Their primary job is to think and create new approaches to problems. [[Creativity]] is becoming more valued in today's global society. Employers see creativity as a channel for self-expression and job satisfaction in their employees. About 38.3 million Americans and 30 percent of the American workforce identify themselves with the creative class. This number has increased by more than 10 percent in the past 20 years.

The creative class is also known for its departure from traditional workplace attire and behavior. Members of the creative class may set their own hours and dress codes in the workplace, often reverting to more relaxed, casual attire instead of business suits and ties. Creative class members may work for themselves and set their own hours, no longer sticking to the 9–5 standard. Independence is also highly regarded among the creative class and expected in the workplace (Florida, 2002).

== The global economy ==
The Creative Class is not a class of workers among many, but a group believed to bring economic growth to countries that can attract its members. The economic benefits conferred by the Creative Class include outcomes in new ideas, high-tech industry and regional growth. Even though the Creative Class has been around for centuries, the U.S. was the first large country to have a Creative Class dealing with information technology, in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1960s less than five percent of the U.S. population was part of the Creative Class, a number that has risen to 26 percent. Seeing that having a strong Creative Class is vital in today's global economy, Europe is now almost equal with America's numbers for this group. Inter-city competition to attract members of the Creative Class has developed.

Following an empirical study across 90 nations, Rindermann et al. (2009)&lt;ref name="Talent Development &amp; Excellence Vol. 1, No. 1, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The impact of smart fractions, cognitive ability of politicians and average competence of peoples on social development |journal=International Research Association for Talent Development and Excellence |year=2009 |last=Rindermann |first=Heiner |authorlink=Heiner_Rindermann |last2=Sailer |first2=Michael |last3=Thompson |first3=James |authorlink3=|issn=1869-2885 |format=PDF }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-06-15 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; argued that high-ability classes (or smart classes) are responsible for economic growth, stable democratic development, and positively valued political aspects (government effectiveness, rule of law, and liberty).

== Places of high creative class populations ==
Florida's use of census and economic data, presented in works such as ''The Rise of the Creative Class'' (2002), ''Cities and the Creative Class'' (2004), and ''The Flight of the Creative Class'' (2007), as well as ''[[Bobos in Paradise]]'' by David Brooks (whose "bobos" roughly correspond to Florida's creative class), and [https://www.amazon.com/dp/192121502X NEO Power] by [[Ross Honeywill]] (whose NEOs deliver a more sophisticated level of evidence), has shown that cities which attract and retain creative residents prosper, while those that do not stagnate. This research has gained traction in the business community, as well as among politicians and urban planners. Florida and other Creative Class theorists have been invited to meetings of the National Conference of Mayors and numerous economic development committees, such the [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] mayor's [http://www.denvergov.org/economicdevelopment/template328864.asp Task Force on Creative Spaces]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [[Michigan]] governor [[Jennifer Granholm]]'s [[Cool Cities Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michigan.gov/gov/0,1607,7-168--75516--,00.html|title=Governor Partners with Local Communities to Develop "Cool Cities," Spur Economic Growth|accessdate=2003-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cities and the Creative Class'', Florida devotes several chapters to discussion of the three main prerequisites of creative cities (though there are many additional qualities which distinguish creative magnets). For a city to attract the Creative Class, he argues, it must possess "the three 'T's": Talent (a highly talented/educated/skilled population), Tolerance (a diverse community, which has a 'live and let live' ethos), and Technology (the technological infrastructure necessary to fuel an entrepreneurial culture). In ''Rise of the Creative Class'', Florida argues that members of the Creative Class value meritocracy, diversity and individuality, and look for these characteristics when they relocate (2002).

As Florida demonstrates in his books, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New Orleans]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] are examples of cities which have tried to attract the Creative Class but, in comparison to cities which better exemplify the "three 'T's", have failed. Creative Class workers have sought out cities that better accommodate their cultural, creative, and technological needs, such as  [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[San Francisco]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Seattle]], [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] and [[Portland, Oregon]]. Florida also notes that [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] have the ingredients to be a "leading city in a new economy".

The "Creativity Index" is another tool that Florida uses to describe how members of the Creative Class are attracted to a city. The Creativity Index includes four elements: "the Creative Class share of the workforce; innovation, measured as patents per capita; high tech industry, using the Milken Institute's widely accepted Tech Pole Index…; and diversity, measured by the Gay Index, a reasonable proxy for an area's openness" (2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;244–5). Using this index, Florida rates and ranks cities in terms of innovative high-tech centers, with San Francisco being the highest ranked (2002).

Florida and others have found a strong correlation between those cities and states that provide a more tolerant atmosphere toward culturally unconventional people, such as gays, artists, and musicians (exemplified by Florida's "Gay Index" and "Bohemian Index" developed in ''The Rise of the Creative Class''), and the numbers of Creative Class workers that live and move there (2002).

Research involving the preferences and values of this new socioeconomic class has shown that where people choose to live can no longer be predicted according to conventional industrial theories (such as "people will go to where the jobs/factories are"). Creative workers are no longer bound by physical products, rather working with intellectual products. Their migration to metropolitan urban areas where creative work is available is more due to the attraction of leisure life and community rather than actual work. Although the Creative Class works towards the globalization of progressive and innovative ideas and products, they can also be considered to value local community and local autonomy. Sociologists and urban theorists have noted a gradual and broad shift of values over the past decade. Creative workers are looking for cultural, social, and technological climates in which they feel they can best "be themselves".

"The main assumption underlying this approach is that creative workers seek creative outlets in all aspects of their lives and therefore migrate to cities that actively support their preferred lifestyles" (Donegan et al., 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;181).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Which Indicators Explain Metropolitan Economic Performance Best?

Each year Florida and the Martin Prosperity Institute release the [[Global Creativity Index]], an international study of nations, ranking countries on the 3Ts of economic development - talent, technology, and tolerance. "The GCI is a broad-based measure for advanced economic growth and sustainable prosperity based on the 3Ts of economic development - talent, technology, and tolerance. It rates and ranks 139 nations worldwide on each of these dimensions and on our overall measure of creativity and prosperity" (Florida et al., 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://martinprosperity.org/content/the-global-creativity-index-2015/|title = The Global Creativity Index 2015|date = July 8, 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCI takes into account the diversity of geographical locations noting their openness as the means for progressive ideas to prosper. "Tolerance and openness to diversity is part and parcel of the broad cultural shift toward post-materialist values... Tolerance—or, broadly speaking openness to diversity—provides an additional source of economic advantage that works alongside technology and talent" (Florida, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;233).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Rise of the Creative Class|last = Florida|first = Richard|publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity allows these locations to attract creative individuals and therefore stimulate economic growth. The findings from the 2015 GCI measured 139 countries on their creativity and prosperity. Ranked number one on the 2015 GCI is Australia.

Share of Gross National Product spent on Research and Development is constantly raising at world level. Creative activities are growing at a fast pace in most advanced countries.  60% of the products that will be sold in 2030 do not yet exist. Repetitive works are being robotized. The whole world is becoming a "[[Creational Society]]".

==Lifestyle==
The diverse and individualistic lifestyles enjoyed by the Creative Class involve active participation in a variety of experiential activities. Florida (2002) uses the term "Street Level Culture" to define this kind of stimulation. Street Level Culture may include a "teeming blend of cafes, sidewalk musicians, and small galleries and bistros, where it is hard to draw the line between participant and observer, or between creativity and its creators" (p.&amp;nbsp;166). Members of the Creative Class enjoy a wide variety of activities (e.g., traveling, antique shopping, bike riding, and running) that highlight the collective interest in being participants and not spectators (Florida, 2002).

==Criticisms==
Numerous studies have found fault with the logic or empirical claims of Florida's Creative Class theory. This body of critical empirical research demonstrates how the Creative Class thesis, and the associated [[creative city]] policy prescriptions, in fact exacerbate social and economic inequalities in cities in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eugene|first=McCann|title=Inequality and Politics in the Creative-City Region: Questions of Livability and State Strategy|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2007|volume=31|issue=1|pages=188–196|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2007.00713.x|url=http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524162004/http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Jeffrey|title=From brew town to cool town: neoliberalism and the creative city development strategy in Milwaukee|journal=Cities|year=2008|volume=25|issue=4|pages=230–242|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2008.04.006|url=http://www.thecyberhood.net/documents/papers/zimmerman08.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Catungal|first=J.

=== Statistical indices and composition ===
Scholars in the disciplines of economics, geography, sociology, and related social sciences have challenged Florida's conception of the "creative class", particularly for the perceived fuzziness of the concept and the lack of analytical precision.{{sfn|Markusen|2006|pp=1921–1940}}&lt;ref name="Evans, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=G.|title=Creative cities, creative spaces, and urban policy|journal=Urban Studies|year=2009|volume=45|issue=5/6|pages=1003–1040|doi=10.1177/0042098009103853|url=http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/m43287_3.pdf|access-date=2013-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319103434/http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/m43287_3.pdf|archive-date=2013-03-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boren and Young, 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boren|first=T.|author2=C.

Social scientists have also identified problems with the occupational composition of the creative class. Economic geographer Stefan Kratke challenges the inclusion of financial and real estate professionals within the creative class on two accounts: 1) these individuals played a decisive role as the "dealer class" in the [[Financial crisis (2007–present)|ongoing financial crises]], and therefore cannot be considered a basis for sustainable urban and regional economic growth;{{sfn|Kratke|2011|pp=43–46}} and 2) the financial and real estate industries (especially in headquarter cities) are economically significant regional/urban players only because they are largely "reliant on inflows of wealth created by productive activities in other regions."{{sfn|Kratke|2011|p=50}} Moreover, Kratke argues that the "political class" is also ill-suited to be included within creative class, as they are, in many cases, implicated in neoliberal financial deregulation and the rise in highly unstable urban and regional growth regimes{{sfn|Kratke|2011|p=45}} evident through [[real estate bubble]]s across the United States and in other countries. In "Urban Development and the Politics of the Creative Class", Ann Markusen argues that workers qualified as being in the Creative Class have no concept of group identity, nor are they in occupations that are inherently creative.{{sfn|Markusen|2006}} Markusen also notes that the definition of the Creative Class is based largely on educational attainment, suggesting that Florida's indices become insignificant after controlling for [[education]]. Markusen argues that Florida "does not seem to understand the nature of the occupational statistics he uses" and calls for the major occupational groups to be disaggregated.{{sfn|Markusen|2006|pp=1922—1923}} She questions the inclusion of particular occupations within these broad categories such as claim adjusters, funeral directors, tax collectors, yet argues that "[t]hese occupations may indeed be creative, but so too are airplane pilots, ship engineers, millwrights, and tailors – all of whom are uncreative in Florida's tally."{{sfn|Markusen|2006|p=1923}} Moreover, it is questioned whether human creativity can be conflated with education since "[p]eople at all levels of education exercise considerable inventiveness."{{sfn|Markusen|2006|p=1924}}

===Economic growth===

Research shows that economic growth is experienced when the significance of scientifically/technologically and artistically creative workers is taken into account, but this macro-level conclusion can be drawn without Florida's creative class theory, which provides more of an "affirmation of contemporary class relations."{{sfn|Kratke|2011|p=89}} Other scholars have criticized the very basis for Florida's definition of "[[creativity]]" which many argue is conceived of narrowly and is only valued for the potential for financial and [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=C.|author2=N.

The creative class thesis—and [[Richard Florida]] himself—have been criticized for what appears to be a change in Florida's prognosis for America's ailing [[Rust Belt]] cities. Florida's message was so quickly and enthusiastically adopted by cities because he argued that any city had the potential to become a vibrant, creative city with the right infrastructure investments, policies, and consulting advice.{{sfn|Peck|2005}} A 2009 article, "The Ruse of the Creative Class", questions Florida's costly speaking engagements in struggling industrial cities in which he offered optimistic prognoses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacGillis|first=Alec|title=The Ruse of the Creative Class|url=http://prospect.org/article/ruse-creative-class-0|work=The American Prospect|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and his more recent pronouncements that many American cities may never be saved in the wake of the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Florida|first=Richard|title=How the Crash Will Reshape America|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/03/how-the-crash-will-reshape-america/307293/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creative class thesis has also drawn criticisms for relying on [[inner city]] [[property development]], [[gentrification]], and urban [[labor markets]] reliant on low-wage [[Service sector|service workers]], particularly in the [[hospitality industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCann|first=E.|title=Inequality and Politics in the Creative City-Region: Questions of Livability and State Strategy|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2007|volume=31|issue=1|pages=188–196|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2007.00713.x|url=http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|access-date=2013-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524162004/http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Peck|2005}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peck|first=J.|title=Recreative City: Amsterdam, Vehicular Ideas and the Adaptive Spaces of Creativity Policy|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2012|volume=36|issue=3|pages=462–485|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01071.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=210–219}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jakob|first=D.|title=Constructing the creative neighborhood: hopes and limitations of creative city policies in Berlin|journal=City, Culture and Society|year=2010|volume=1|issue=4|pages=193–198|doi=10.1016/j.ccs.2011.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zavos|first=Alison|title=A Portrait of East Austin and the Universal Story of Gentrification|url=http://www.featureshoot.com/2012/08/a-portrait-of-east-austin-and-the-universal-story-of-gentrification/|work=Feature Shoot|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emery|first=Michael|title=East Austin Gentrification|url=http://www.klru.org/austinnow/archives/gentrification/index.php|work=Austin Now|publisher=KLRU|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Chloe|title=Hipster culture comes at a price in East Austin neighborhood|url=http://www.hilltopviewsonline.com/viewpoints/article_8ef931d8-1713-11e2-a081-001a4bcf6878.html|work=Hilltop Views|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smithson|first=Kate|title=Extreme makeover: gentrification transforms East Austin|url=http://abcnews.go.com/OnCampus/story?id=7399717&amp;page=1|work=ABC News|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Talbot|first=David|title=How Much Tech Can One City Take?|url=http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/how-much-tech-can-one-city-take|work=San Francisco Magazine|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida has called for service workers' wages to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cities must strategize to boost service workers' pay|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/06/171257463/cities-must-strategize-to-boost-service-workers-pay|work=NPR|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grassroots resistance===

Creative Class Struggle, a Toronto-based collective, has brought these criticisms outside academic circles, challenging Florida's Creative Class theories as well as their widespread adoption into urban policy. The group manages an online clearinghouse for information about creative city strategies and policies, publishes a newsletter and other materials, and works to engage the media and public in critical discussion.&lt;ref name="Creative Class Struggle."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativeclassstruggle.wordpress.com|title=Creative Class Struggle.|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Creative Class Struggle and art magazine ''Fuse'' organized a public forum in Toronto to debate these issues.&lt;ref name="Whyte, Murray.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3675">The '''Euston Road School''' is a term applied to a group of English painters, active either as staff or students at the School of Drawing and Painting in London between 1937 and 1939.&lt;ref name=crOxf&gt;{{cite web |author=Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095801579 |title=Euston Road School |year=|accessdate=4 November 2013|work=Oxford Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The School opened in October 1937 at premises in [[Fitzroy Street]] before moving to 314/316 [[Euston Road]] in February 1938. The School was founded by [[William Coldstream]], [[Victor Pasmore]] and [[Claude Rogers (artist)|Claude Rogers]]. [[Graham Bell (artist)|Graham Bell]] was a substantial theoretical influence on these teachers and [[Rodrigo Moynihan]] was also closely associated with the School.&lt;ref name=RMtate&gt;{{cite web |author=Tate|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=1674&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio |title=Artist biography, Rodrigo Moynihan |year=|accessdate=8 December 2013|work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students at the school included [[Lawrence Gowing]], Tom Carr, [[Peter Lanyon]], and [[Thelma Hulbert]]. The writer [[Adrian Stokes (critic)|Adrian Stokes]] and the poet [[Stephen Spender]] attended drawing classes. [[Vanessa Bell]] and [[Duncan Grant]] were among visiting teachers to the School.&lt;ref name=ersODNB/&gt; The emphasis was on acute representational painting based on observation. The School emphasised [[naturalism (art)|naturalism]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]], in contrast to the various schools of ''[[avant-garde]]'' art then prevalent.  Many of the members were on the political left, and naturalism was seen as an attempt to make art more relevant and understandable to non-specialists and members of the public. To this end, Bell and Coldstream spent three weeks in working-class lodgings in [[Bolton]], Lancashire in April 1938 painting cityscapes showing local factories. The resulting paintings were not highly regarded locally in Bolton. Later in 1938, the Euston Road artists contributed to the ''Fifteen paintings of London'' exhibition held at the [[Storran Gallery]]. In an attempt to engage the wider public, private invitations were sent to everyone named Brown, in the Post Office telephone directory.&lt;ref name=ersODNB/&gt;

The School closed at the start of the Second World War, as its members joined the Armed Forces, worked as war artists or, in the case of Pasmore, were imprisoned for being a conscientious objector. A small exhibition, ''Members of the Euston Road group'' was held at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in 1942. In 1945 Pasmore, Coldstream, Rogers and Gowing were all teaching at the [[Camberwell School of Art]] and two further exhibitions followed, ''The Euston Road School and others'' at the Wakefield Art Gallery in 1948 and a group retrospective organised by the [[Arts Council]] which toured Britain throughout 1948 and 1949. By the end of 1949 the artists had embarked on separate projects, with Coldstream leaving Camberwell for the [[Slade School of Art]].&lt;ref name=ersODNB&gt;{{cite web |author=Bruce Laughton|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=64717&amp;back= |title=Euston Road School (act.1937-1939) |year=2004|accessdate=4 November 2013|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (OUP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Evangelical Press Association''' is a professional association serving the [[Christian]] periodical publishing industry, including magazines, newspapers, newsletters, and content-rich websites. Its members produce some 200 periodical titles with a combined circulation of over 15 million.&lt;ref&gt;lkeener 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; EPA is a religious and educational [[non-profit corporation]] under the laws of the state of [[California]]. It is managed by an executive director, who is responsible to a board of six directors. &lt;ref&gt;lkeener 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The EPA seeks to promote the cause of [[evangelical Christianity]] and to enhance the influence of Christian journalism by: &lt;ref&gt;lkeener 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* providing resources and training to enhance competency and effectiveness;
:* promoting the highest standards of professionalism, accountability, and authenticity of viewpoint;
:* fostering Christian fellowship among members of the Association;
:* rendering practical assistance;
:* stimulating mutual helpfulness among members;
:* and encouraging high ethical and technical standards in the field of Christian journalism.

==Beginnings &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evangelicalpress.com/about-epa/history-of-epa/ History of EPA].&lt;/ref&gt;==
In the fall of 1947, a handful of editors met at the convention of the National Sunday School Association and began to talk about an association of evangelical editors. Dr. James DeForest Murch, editor of United Evangelical Action, took the lead and called together a [[pro tem]] committee in [[Chicago]] on May 6, 1948. Thirty-five editors met at the Congress Hotel in Chicago. They officially organized the Evangelical Press Association, adopted the doctrinal statement of the National Association of Evangelicals and wrote the statement of purpose printed above. On April 4–6, 1949, the first annual convention of the EPA met in Chicago with 103 publications represented.

In September, 1951, the association mailed the first copies of a news service to its members. It was produced by volunteers who sent out ten releases in the first five months. In 1952 it became a weekly service with a subscription rate of $10 a year. That year also the association began its newsletter, Liaison. In 1954 the association adopted a code of ethics and began an awards program.

EPA has held an annual convention each year since 1949. The conventions were held in Chicago until 1957, then moved to a different city each year after that. The conventions were held in January until 1963 when the date was changed to April or May.

As the association grew, it demanded an executive secretary to carry on the administrative work and edit the news service. This became a half-time paid position. In 1978, the job of executive secretary was changed to executive director, and the director was charged with giving vision and leadership to the organization. The news service was licensed to an independent news organization, and in 1994 the news service was sold.

==Programs and services &lt;ref&gt;lkeener 2016&lt;/ref&gt;==
Held each Spring, the annual convention is the focal point of the EPA year. The 3-day convention rotates among major cities throughout the U.S. The goal is to provide three days of learning, sharing, networking, and fellowship, as well as to conduct official association business.

EPA conventions offer speakers of national stature, the annual awards contest, the annual membership meeting and election, occasional tours, and a wide variety of workshops designed for editors, writers, graphic designers, photographers, social media managers, web content managers, and business personnel—from  beginners to veterans, and for both print and digital application.

EPA hosts two annual contests: the Awards of Excellence contest (for a publication as a whole) and the Higher Goals contest (for the individual pieces produced—writing, photography, design, etc.). 

Other programs and services include press credentials, one-on-one publication critique, scholarships for undergraduate journalism students, an ethics committee to hear complaints, webinars, a legal hotline and various member benefits and discounts from selected suppliers.

'''''Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth''''' (1890) is an [[oil on canvas]] [[still life]] by [[Martin Johnson Heade]] acquired by the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 1982. Heade made significant contributions to floral still-life painting during the course of his career, the NGA points out, with ''Giant Magnolias'' being one of the finest. Heade married in 1883 and settled in [[St. Augustine, Florida]] after a lackluster career as an itinerant artist. He was patronized by Floridian [[Henry Morrison Flagler]], an oil and railroad magnate, who regularly purchased his works. The NGA believes this personal and professional stability stimulated the production of the still-life paintings of Heade's last years.

The NGA writes, "Certainly works such as ''Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth'', with their striking contrasts of brilliantly lit flowers and leaves set against a dark background, are among the most original still lifes of the nineteenth century. They are also for many observers strongly sensual, their lush colors, full, curving contours, overall sense of opulence, and implied perfumed scent of the flowers suggestive, perhaps, of female nudes languidly reclining on luxurious couches."

The '''hippocampus''' or '''hippocamp,''' also ''hippokampoi'' (plural: hippocampi or hippocamps; {{lang-el|ἱππόκαμπος}}, from {{lang|el|ἵππος}}, "horse" and {{lang|el|κάμπος}}, "sea monster"&lt;ref name="dictionary.com"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hippocampus Word origin of ''Hippocampus''] at [[reference.com]]; compare the nameless monster [[Campe]].&lt;/ref&gt;), often called a '''sea-horse'''&lt;ref&gt;The hyphen  distinguishes from the [[seahorse]], a real [[fish]].&lt;/ref&gt; in English, is a mythological creature shared by [[Phoenicia]]n&lt;ref name= "IAA"&gt;Israel Antiquities Authority, [http://www.antiquities.org.il/hoards_eng.asp Yizre'el Valley silver hoard] (retrieved Jan 10 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]], and [[Greek mythology]], though its name has a Greek origin. The hippocampus has typically been depicted as having the upper body of a [[horse]] with the lower body of a [[fish]].

==Mythology==


Coins minted at [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] around the 4th century BC show the patron god [[Melqart]] riding on a winged hippocampus and accompanied by dolphins.&lt;ref name= "IAA" /&gt; Coins of the same period from [[Byblos]] show a hippocampus diving under a galley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/stater-of-byblos-with-galley-3024 Stater of Byblos with galley | Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coinarchives.com/a/results.php?results=100&amp;search=Byblos Byblos at NumisBids]&lt;/ref&gt;

A gold sea-horse was discovered in a hoard from the kingdom  of [[Lydia]] in [[Asia minor]], dating to the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Waxman, ''Loot: The Battle over the Stolen Treasures of the Ancient World,'' Chapter 6; [https://web.archive.org/web/20081210070246/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Loot-Chasing-the-Lydian-Hoard.html excerpt in ''Smithsonian''], Nov. 14, 2008 (retrieved Jan 10 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek and Roman===
[[File:Roman Baths, Bath - Sea Horse Mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|237px|Hippocampus in Roman mosaic in the [[thermae]] at [[Aquae Sulis]] ([[Bath, Somerset|Bath]])]]

In the ''[[Iliad]]'', [[Homer]] describes [[Poseidon]], god of horses, earthquakes, and the sea, drawn by [[brass|brazen]]-hoofed horses over the sea's surface,&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''[[Iliad]]'' xlii. 24, 29;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], describes the horse of Poseidon emerging from the sea and galloping across the [[Libya]]n sands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' (iv.1353ff)&lt;/ref&gt; This compares to the specifically "two-hoofed" hippocampi of [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]] in his ''Argonautica'': "[[Orion (mythology)|Orion]] when grasping his father’s reins heaves the sea with the snorting of his two-hooved horses."&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Flaccus, ''Argonautica'' 2.507.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] imagery, however, Poseidon (or Roman [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]) often drives a sea-[[chariot]] drawn by hippocampi. Thus hippocampi sport with this god in both ancient depictions and much more modern ones, such as in the waters of the 18th-century [[Trevi Fountain]] in Rome surveyed by Neptune from his [[niche (architecture)|niche]] above.

The appearance of hippocampi in both [[freshwater]] and [[seawater|saltwater]] is counter-intuitive to a modern audience, though not to an ancient one. The Greek picture of the natural [[hydrological cycle]] did not take into account the condensation of atmospheric water as rain to replenish the [[water table]], but imagined the waters of the sea oozing back landwards through vast underground [[cavern]]s and [[aquifer]]s, rising replenished and freshened in springs.&lt;ref&gt;This made credible the mythic undersea passage of the fountain nymph [[Arethusa (mythology)|Arethusa]] from Greece to [[Sicily]]. The summary given of the ancients' view of the hydrological cycle is outlined by the Roman Epicurean [[Lucretius]]'  ''[[On the Nature of Things|De rerum natura]]'' (vi.631-38).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piazza di trevi - fontana di trevi hippocampus crop.jpg|thumb|right|267px|[[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]s and ''winged'' hippocampi in the [[Trevi Fountain]], Rome]]

Thus it was natural for a temple at [[Helike]] in the coastal plain of [[Achaea]] to be dedicated to ''Poseidon Helikonios'', (the Poseidon of Helicon), the sacred spring of [[Mount Helicon|Boeotian Helikon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]]: "The sea was raised by an earthquake and it submerged [[Helike]] and also the temple of Poseidon Helikonios..." (''Geography'' 8.7.2).&lt;/ref&gt; When an earthquake suddenly submerged the city, the temple's bronze Poseidon accompanied by hippocampi continued to snag fishermens' nets.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Eratosthenes]], noted by Strabo (''loc. cit.'').&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, the hippocampus was considered an appropriate decoration for [[mosaics]] in Roman [[thermae]] or public baths, as at [[Aquae Sulis]] modern day [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in Britannia (''illustration, below'').

Poseidon's horses, which were included in the elaborate sculptural program of gilt-bronze and [[ivory]], added by a Roman client to the temple of Poseidon at [[Corinth]], are likely to have been hippocampi; the Romanised Greek [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] described the rich ensemble in the later 2nd century AD (''Geography of Greece'' ii.1.7-.8):

{{bq|text=On the temple, which is not very large, stand bronze [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]s. In the fore-temple are images, two of Poseidon, a third of [[Amphitrite]], and a Sea, which also is of bronze. The offerings inside were dedicated in our time by [[Herodes Atticus]], four horses, gilded except for the hoofs, which are of ivory, and two gold [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]s beside the horses, with the parts below the waist of ivory. On the car stand Amphitrite and Poseidon, and there is the boy Palaemon upright upon a [[dolphin]]. These too are made of ivory and gold. On the middle of the base on which the car has been wrought a Sea holding up the young [[Aphrodite]], and on either side are the nymphs called [[Nereids]].}}

===Etruscan===
Hippocampi appear with the first Oriental-phase of [[Etruscan civilization]]: they remain a theme in Etruscan tomb wall-paintings and reliefs,&lt;ref&gt;Etruscan sea creatures, including a range of hippocampi, are set in cultural context and ordered by typology in Monika Boosen, ''Etruskische Meeresmischwesen: Untersuchungen zur Typologie u. Bedeutung'' (''Archaeologica'' 59) (Rome:Bretschneider) 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  where they are sometimes provided with wings, as they are in the Trevi fountain. Katharine Shepard found in the theme an Etruscan belief in a sea-voyage to the other world.&lt;ref&gt;Katharine Shepard, ''The Fish-Tailed Monster in Greek and Etruscan Art'', 1940, pp 25ff; the thesis was, exceptionally, reviewed (by G.W. Elderkin) in ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''45'''.2  (April 1941), pp. 307-308: available on-line through JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pictish===
The sea-horse also appears in [[Pictish Stones|Pictish stone carvings]] in Scotland.  The symbolism of the carving (also known as "[[Pictish Beast]]") is unknown. Although similar  but not identical to Roman sea-horse images, it is unclear whether this depiction originates from images brought over by the Romans, or had a place in earlier [[Pict]]ish mythology.&lt;ref name="Hilgarth"&gt;Nigella Hillgarth, Birch Aquarium at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, [http://scrippsblogs.ucsd.edu/onboard/2010/01/08/seahorses-in-myth-legend-art/Seahorses in Myth, Legend &amp; Art]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, January 8, 2010 (retrieved January 10, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval and Renaissance, and Modern===
[[File:Complete Guide to Heraldry Fig364.png|thumb|200px|The "sea-horse" in medieval heraldry was a legendary creature that was part horse and part fish, not to be confused with the later heraldic ''hippocampus'', which was a natural [[seahorse]].]]
[[File:Hippocampus, Dublin.jpg|thumb|Hippocampuses in [[Dublin]], Ireland.]]
The mythic hippocampus has been used as a [[Charge (heraldry)|heraldic charge]], particularly since the Renaissance, most often in the [[armorial bearings]] of people and places with maritime associations.  However, in a [[blazon]], the terms ''hippocamp'' and ''hippocampus'' now refer to the real animal called a ''seahorse'', and the terms ''seahorse'' and ''sea-horse'' refer to the mythological creature.  The above-mentioned fish hybrids are seen less frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, Arthur Charles. ''Complete Guide to Heraldry'', 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sea-horse is also a common image in Renaissance and post-renaissance art, for example, in the [[Trevi fountain]], dating to 1732.

A winged hippocampus has been used as a symbol for [[Air France]] since its establishment in 1933 (inherited from its predecessor [[Air Orient]]); it appears today on the engine [[nacelle]]s of Air France aircraft.

Bronze hippocampoi appear in [[Dublin]], [[Leinster]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on lampposts next to a statue of [[Henry Grattan]] and on [[Grattan Bridge]].

==Capricornus and related mythical animals==
Closely related to the hippocampus is the "sea goat", represented by [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], a mythical creature with the front half of a [[goat]] and the rear half of a fish. Canonical figures, most of which were not themselves [[cult image]]s, and coins of the [[Caria]]n goddess associated with [[Aphrodite]] as the ''[[Aphrodisias|Aphrodite of Aphrodisias]]'' through ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'', show the goddess riding on a sea-goat.&lt;ref name ="Imhoof-Blümer"&gt;Imhoof-Blümer, ''Kleinasiatische Müntzen'' plate IV, no 14, noted in Elderkin 1941:307&lt;/ref&gt;  Brody describes her thus:&lt;ref name="brody"&gt;Lisa R. Brody, under the direction of Christopher Ratté, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030923074738/http://www.geocities.com/lisa_brody/diss.htm "The Iconography and Cult of the Aphrodite of Aphrodisias"] (dead link- archive version [https://web.archive.org/web/20030923074738/http://www.geocities.com/lisa_brody/diss.htm here]), New York University, Institute of Fine Arts, 1999. ([https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Iconography_and_Cult_of_the_Aphrodit.html?id=FIyNHAAACAAJ google books link])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|text=... a semi-nude female figure appears riding on a sea-goat, accompanied by a dolphin and a Triton. This is the goddess Aphrodite herself, shown here not in her distinctive local guise but in a more traditionally Hellenistic style. She is the marine aspect of Aphrodite, known to the Greeks as ''Aphrodite Pelagia''&amp;nbsp;.... She rides on a fantastic marine creature with the body and tail of a fish and the forepart of a goat. This sea-goat moves to the right and turns his head back to look at the goddess. This group also appears on Aphrodisian coins from the 3rd century A.D.}}

Aside from ''aigikampoi'', the fish-tailed goats representing Capricorn,&lt;ref name ="Imhoof-Blümer" /&gt; other fish-tailed animals rarely appeared in Greek art, but are more characteristic of the Etruscans. These include ''leokampoi'' (fish-tailed [[lion]]s), ''taurokampoi'' (fish-tailed [[bull]]s) or ''pardalokampoi'' (fish-tailed [[leopard]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Ther/Hippokampoi.html ''Ippokampoi''] at Theoi Project (retrieved Jan. 11, 2013); see also Booson 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bing Crosby 1942.jpg|thumb|210px|Bing Crosby in 1942]]

'''Hipster''' or '''hepcat''', as used in the 1940s, referred to [[Fan (person)|aficionados]] of [[jazz]], in particular [[bebop]], which became popular in the early 1940s. The hipster adopted the lifestyle of the jazz musician, including some or all of the following: dress, slang, use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and other drugs, relaxed attitude, sarcastic humor, self-imposed poverty, and relaxed sexual codes.

==History==
[[image:Charlie Parker, Tommy Potter, Miles Davis, Max Roach (Gottlieb 06941).jpg|thumb|240px|Charlie Parker (known as Bird) at Three Deuces in New York]]
The words ''hep'' and ''hip'' are of uncertain origin, with numerous competing theories being proposed. In the early days of jazz, musicians were using the ''hep'' variant to describe anybody who was "in the know" about an emerging culture, mostly black, which revolved around jazz. They and their fans were known as ''hepcats''. By the late 1930s, with the rise of [[swing music|swing]], ''[[hip (slang)|hip]]'' rose in popularity among jazz musicians, to replace ''hep''. Clarinetist [[Artie Shaw]] described singer [[Bing Crosby]] as "the first hip white person born in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, James, "[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200102/marcus The First Hip White Person]." 2001. ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. Retrieved 2008-03-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the word ''hepster'' was used by [[Cab Calloway]] in the title of his ''Hepster's Dictionary'', which defines ''hep cat'' as "a guy who knows all the answers, understands jive". In 1944, pianist [[Harry Gibson]] modified this to ''hipster''&lt;ref&gt;"At that time musicians used jive talk among themselves and many customers were picking up on it. One of these words was hep which described someone in the know. When lots of people started using hep, musicians changed to hip. I started calling people hipsters and greeted customers who dug the kind of jazz we were playing as 'all you hipsters.' Musicians at the club began calling me Harry the Hipster; so I wrote a new tune called 'Handsome Harry the Hipster.'" -- Harry Gibson, "Everybody's Crazy But Me" (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; in his short glossary "For Characters Who Don't Dig Jive Talk", published in 1944 with the album ''Boogie Woogie In Blue'', featuring the self-titled hit "Handsome Harry the Hipster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyzercreek.com/hipsterglossary.jpg|title=Hipster Glossary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry for ''hipsters'' defined them as "characters who like hot jazz."

Hipsters were more interested in [[bebop]] and "hot" jazz than they were in swing, which by the late 1940s was becoming old-fashioned and watered down by "[[square (slang)|squares]]" like [[Lawrence Welk]], [[Guy Lombardo]] and Robert Coates. In the 1940s, white youth began to frequent African-American communities for their [[music]] and [[dance]]. These first youths diverged from the mainstream due to their new [[philosophies]] of racial diversity and their exploratory sexual nature and drug habits. The drug of choice was marijuana, many hipster [[Glossary of jive talk|slang terms]] were dedicated to the substance.

In his book ''Jazz: A History'' (1977), Frank Tirro defines the 1940s hipster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To the hipster, [[Charlie Parker|Bird]] was a living justification of their philosophy. The hipster is an underground man. He is to the [[Second World War]] what the [[dada]]ist was to the [[World War I|first]]. He is amoral, anarchistic, gentle, and overcivilized to the point of decadence. He is always ten steps ahead of the game because of his awareness, an example of which might be meeting a girl and rejecting her, because he knows they will date, hold hands, kiss, neck, pet, fornicate, perhaps marry, divorce—so why start the whole thing? He knows the hypocrisy of bureaucracy, the hatred implicit in religions—so what values are left for him?—except to go through life avoiding pain, keep his emotions in check, and after that, "be cool," and look for kicks. He is looking for something that transcends all this bullshit and finds it in jazz.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Marty Jezer]], in ''The Dark Ages: Life in the United States 1945–1960'' (1999), provides another definition:

{{quote|The hipster world that Kerouac and Ginsberg drifted in and out of from the mid-1940s to the early-1950s was an amorphous movement without ideology, more a pose than an attitude; a way of "being" without attempting to explain why. Hipsters themselves were not about to supply explanations. Their language, limited as it was, was sufficiently obscure to defy translation into everyday speech. Their rejection of the commonplace was so complete that they could barely acknowledge reality. The measure of their withdrawal was their distrust of language. A word like ''cool'' could mean any of a number of contradictory things—its definition came not from the meaning of the word but from the emotion behind it and the accompanying non-verbal facial or body expressions. When hipsters did put together a coherent sentence, it was always prefaced with the word ''like'' as if to state at the onset that what would follow was probably an illusion. There was neither a future nor a past, only a present that existed on the existential wings of sound. A Charlie Parker bebop solo—that was the truth.

The hipster's world view was not divided between "free world" and "Communist bloc", and this too set it apart from the then-current orthodoxy. Hipster dualism, instead, transcended geopolitical lines in favor of levels of consciousness. The division was ''hip'' and ''square''. Squares sought security and conned themselves into political acquiescence. Hipsters, hip to the bomb, sought the meaning of life and, expecting death, demanded it now. In the wigged-out, flipped-out, zonked-out hipster world, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Truman, McCarthy and Eisenhower shared one thing in common: they were squares ... [T]he hipster signified the coming together of the bohemian, the juvenile delinquent, and the negro.}}

==Role reversal==

===Racial roles===
The new philosophy of racial role reversal was transcribed by many popular hipster authors of the time. [[Norman Mailer]]'s 1957 pamphlet, entitled "[[The White Negro]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norman Mailer, "The White Negro," Fall 1957, reprinted in Dissent, Winter 2008|url=http://www.learntoquestion.com/resources/database/archives/003327.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become the paradigmatic example of hipster ideology. Mailer describes hipsters as individuals "with a middle-class background (who) attempt to put down their whiteness and adopt what they believe is the carefree, spontaneous, cool lifestyle of Negro hipsters: their manner of speaking and language, their use of milder narcotics, their appreciation of jazz and the blues, and their supposed concern with the good orgasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/gtmarx/www/whitenegro.html|title=The White Negro|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a nod to Mailer's discussion of hipsterism, the United States' [[Cold War]] deployments of [[African American]] culture and personalities for the purposes of [[public diplomacy]] has been discussed as "hipster diplomacy".&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, B. R., ''Artistic Ambassadors: Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era'' ([[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]: [[University of Virginia Press]], 2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pZET9DY05LUC&amp;pg=PT145#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 145–148].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Thespian Society''' (ITS) is an honor society for [[high school]] and [[middle school]] theatre students. It is a division of the [[Educational Theatre Association]]. Thespian troupes serve students in grades 9-12; Junior Thespian troupes serve students in grades 6 through 8. A few famous ITS alumni include [[Tom Hanks]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[James Marsters]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schooltheatre.org/membership/distinguishedthespians|title=Distinguished Thespians - EdTA - Educational Theatre Association|website=www.schooltheatre.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festivals are held annually at the district, state and national levels. Each June the [[International Thespian Festival]] is held at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|University of Nebraska-Lincoln]]. Membership currently stands at approximately 100,000 student members across 4,700 schools. The one millionth Thespian was inducted in 1976 and the two millionth Thespian was inducted in 2009. As of 2017, there have been over 2.3 million Thespians inducted.

== History ==
The International Thespian Society was founded in 1929 in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]]. Originally named National Thespians, the society was founded by Dr. Paul Opp, Earnest Bavely and Harry Leaper. National Thespians was an honorary organization for high school theater students who earned membership through participation in their schools' theatre programs. The organization consisted of troupes, each linked to a school. The first troupe was formed by Dr. Earl Blank at Natrona County High School in Casper, Wyoming.

At the end of the 1928-1929 school year there were 71 troupes across 26 states. In October, 1929, the first issue of The High School Thespian, "official organ of National Thespians" was published. The National Thespian headquarters was moved to Cincinnati during the year 1935. That same year, the society was renamed The National Thespian Dramatic Honor Society. The society held its first National High School Drama Conference and Play Production Festival in 1941 at Indiana University, which later became a bi-annual event. The ''High School Thespian'' became ''Dramatics'' in 1944.

In October 1945, The National Thespian Dramatic Honor Society was again renamed the National Thespian Society. As the Thespian Society reached its 25th anniversary in 1954, 1,432 Thespian troupes existed across forty-eight states and the then-territories of Alaska, Hawaii, and the Canal Zone, as well as Canada and Japan. In 1969 the organization's name was changed to the title it still holds today: The International Thespian Society. June 1982 marked a name change for the National High School Drama Conference and Play Production Festival, turning it into the Thespian Festival, as it is still called today. The Thespian Festival also began an annual schedule for the first time.

The Society offered its first set of summertime retreats for high school theatre directors in 1986, an activity that would eventually grow into a professional association called the Theatre Education Association. In 1989 the ITS board established the Educational Theatre Association (EdTA), meant to oversee both the Thespian Society and the Theatre Education Association, and launched ''Teaching Theatre,'' a quarterly journal for theatre educators. The Theatre Education Association was eventually absorbed completely into the EdTA and thus its title is no longer used.

1990 marks the birth of the Junior Thespians branch of ITS, extending the reach of the society to middle school theatre students. The EdTA helped to write the theatre section of the National Standards for Arts Education, the first set of guidelines for the arts education field, in 1994. By 2012, International Thespian Society had formed a strong bond with the charity organization [[Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS]] and raised more than $1 million for their benefit. 2015 marked the EdTA's launch of [https://www.schooltheatre.org/programs/jumpstarttheatre JumpStart Theatre], which brings sustainable musical theatre programs to underserved middle schools where there currently are none, and the creation of an ITS branch in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schooltheatre.org/about/history|title=History - EdTA - Educational Theatre Association|website=www.schooltheatre.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thespian Chapters ==
Chapters are created in order to support the mission of the International Thespian Society. They are led by a chapter director who is supported and assisted by a chapter board. As of 2017, there are active chapters in the following states, regions, and countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schooltheatre.org/membership/chapters|title=Chapters - EdTA - Educational Theatre Association|website=www.schooltheatre.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, California, Hawaii, the Western Pacific Islands, and China.

== Thespian Induction and Promotion ==
The International Thespian Society allows for the induction of high school and middle school students attending ITS affiliated schools, based on the quality and quantity of work in all realms of theatre. Points can be earned from participation in productions (either on stage or backstage), Thespian Festivals, seeing other theatre's productions, and holding an officer position in a Thespian troupe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schooltheatre.org/internationalthespiansociety/troupedirectors/thespianpointsystem|title=Official Thespian point system - International Thespian Society|website=www.schooltheatre.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Induction ceremonies vary from troupe to troupe, but most are run by the troupe's officers and director. They include, at the very least, a brief summation of the Society's history, followed by a listing of the names and achievements of each new inductee, and then a reciting of the Society's pledge by all new and existing members. The pledge is as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;"''I promise to uphold the aims and ideals of the International Thespian Society. I am a student of theatre and excellence is my ideal. I promise to perform my part as well as I can; to accept praise and criticism with grace; to cooperate with my fellow thespians and work for the good of the troupe; and to share my love of theatre."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schooltheatre.org/internationalthespiansociety/troupedirectors/troupehandbook#5c|title=Thespian troupe handbook - International Thespian Society|website=www.schooltheatre.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After induction, members can continue to earn points in order to move up through the International Thespian Society ranking system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Student Leadership==
At the high school level there are various offices possible, including, but not limited to, President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, and Historian. There are also state and international student leaders elected annually by their respective student bodies. The International Thespian Officers are student members elected to represent the student membership. They suggest policy and service changes to the Educational Theatre Association Board, and take an active role in training, chapter conferences, and the annual International Thespian Festival. There are also State Thespian Officers, elected to manage such events as State Thespian Festivals and local Junior Thespian Festivals.

After several unsuccessful attempts by other studios and producers to adapt the musical to film, Disney announced in 2012 that it was producing an adaptation, with Marshall directing and John DeLuca serving as producer.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- NOTE: The plot summary does NOT intend to reproduce the experience of watching, nor is it meant to cover EVERY detail. It should serve as an overview of the major plot elements and events. PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS AND TELEVISION SERIES SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. See "Wikipedia:How to write a plot summary" (WP:PLOTSUM) for general guidelines. --&gt;

A baker ([[James Corden]]) and his wife ([[Emily Blunt]]) wish for a child but suffer under a curse laid upon the baker's family by a [[Witchcraft|Witch]] ([[Meryl Streep]]) who found the baker's father robbing her garden when his mother was pregnant. Because the baker's father also stole some magic beans, the witch's own mother cursed her to be ugly. The witch is able to lift the curse and allow them to have a child, but only if the baker and his wife obtain four critical items for her to make a potion: a white cow, a red cape, a yellow strand of hair, and a golden slipper, none of which she is allowed to touch.

The witch's demands eventually bring the baker and his wife into contact with Jack ([[Daniel Huttlestone]]), who is selling his beloved cow, Milky-White, and to whom the baker offers magic beans left him by his father (which were stolen from the witch) which grow into a large beanstalk; with Red Riding Hood ([[Lilla Crawford]]), whose red cape the couple noticed when she stopped by the bakery earlier to buy bread and sweets on her way to grandmother's house; with blonde-haired Rapunzel ([[MacKenzie Mauzy]]), whose tower the baker's wife passes in the woods; and with Cinderella ([[Anna Kendrick]]), who also runs into the baker's wife while fleeing from the pursuing prince ([[Chris Pine]]) and whose ball outfit includes gold slippers.

After a series of failed attempts and misadventures, the baker and his wife are finally able to gather the items necessary to break the spell. Meanwhile, each of the other characters receives a "[[happy ending]]": Cinderella marries the prince; Rapunzel is freed from her guardian, the witch, by Cinderella's prince's brother and marries him; Jack provides for his mother by stealing riches from the [[Giant]] in the sky, and kills the pursuing giant by cutting down the beanstalk; Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother are saved from the [[Big Bad Wolf]] ([[Johnny Depp]]); and the witch regains her youth and beauty after drinking the potion.

However, each of the characters learns that their endings don't remain happy: the baker is worried that he is a poor father to his newborn baby; the baker's wife is temporarily seduced by the prince; Cinderella is disenchanted by her cheating prince; and the witch learns that she has lost her magic powers. The growth of a second beanstalk from the last remaining magic bean allows the giant's wife to climb down and threaten the kingdom and its inhabitants if they do not deliver Jack in retribution for killing her husband. The characters attempt to find Jack, but debate the morality of handing Jack over. In the process, Red Riding Hood's mother and grandmother, Jack's mother, and the baker's wife are killed. The characters blame each other for their individual actions that led to the tragedy, ultimately blaming the witch for growing the beans in the first place. She curses them for their inability to accept responsibility for their individual actions. Casting all the remaining beans away, the witch begs her mother to punish her again, hoping to regain her powers, but instead she disappears into a large pit of boiling tar.

The remaining characters resolve to kill the threatening giant's wife though Cinderella and the baker try to explain to the distraught Red Riding Hood and Jack the complicated morality of retribution and revenge. The characters lure the giant's wife into stepping in the tar pit where she ultimately trips and falls to her death. With the giant's wife dead, the characters move forward with their ruined lives. The baker, thinking of his wife, is determined to be a good father. Cinderella decides to leave the prince and help the baker, and Jack and Red Riding Hood, now orphans, are living with the baker and Cinderella. The baker comforts his son after he begins to cry by telling the story of the film as the movie ends with the witch's moral, meaning that children can change due to the parent's actions and behaviors.

==Stage-to-screen changes==

Meanwhile, many of the songs in the film have slightly different lyrics than their stage counterparts due to the slight tweaking of story lines.

Other changes include a major reduction of the significant role of the "mysterious man", who manipulates much of the action in the first act and is eventually revealed to be the baker's father. Also, the character of the narrator is deleted, and the film is instead narrated by the baker.&lt;ref name="Whyte"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whyte|first1=Marama|title=Five 'Into the Woods' stage-to-screen changes|url=http://www.hypable.com/2014/12/24/into-the-woods-stage-to-screen-changes/|accessdate=January 2, 2015|work=Hypable.com|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minor role of Cinderella's father was cut, and he is instead mentioned as deceased.  Due to the film's compressed story line, Rapunzel's pregnancy is eliminated, as is the subplot where the two princes have affairs with [[Snow White]] and [[Sleeping Beauty]].&lt;ref name="Whyte" /&gt; In the film, the giant's wife attacks during the marriages of Cinderella and Rapunzel to their respective princes, no more than a few weeks after the events of act one; in the stage show, nearly a year passes between the first and second acts. Rapunzel's ultimate fate is also changed: rather than being killed by the giant, she refuses to cooperate with the witch and flees with her prince.&lt;ref name="Whyte" /&gt;

Similarly, much of the violence and sexual content is slightly toned down from the original musical. For instance, the death of Jack's mother is less violent in the film. On stage, the steward clubs her to death with his staff; in the film, he simply shoves her to the ground and she hits her head on a log. The death of the baker's wife is not explicitly shown in the film, and the cause of her death is changed from being crushed by a tree in the giant's wife's wake to accidentally backing off the edge of a cliff while fleeing from the wife of the giant.

==Production==

===Early development===
Early attempts of adapting ''Into the Woods'' to film occurred in the early 1990s, with a script written by [[Lowell Ganz]] and [[Babaloo Mandel]]. A reading was held with a cast that included [[Robin Williams]] as the Baker, [[Goldie Hawn]] as the Baker's Wife, [[Cher]] as the Witch, [[Danny DeVito]] as the Giant, [[Steve Martin]] as the Wolf, and [[Roseanne Barr]] as Jack's Mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cerasaro|first=Pat|title=BWW EXCLUSIVE: Stephen Sondheim Talks Past, Present &amp; Future|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/BWW-EXCLUSIVE-Stephen-Sondheim-Talks-Past-Present-Future-20101103-page2|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|accessdate=September 5, 2013|date=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1991, [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Jim Henson Productions]] were also developing a film adaptation with [[Craig Zadan]] as producer and [[Rob Minkoff]] as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Willman|first=David|title=Jim Henson's Children Put Together a String of Big Deals to Keep Alive : The Muppet Legacy|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-26/business/fi-5359_1_jim-henson/3|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=July 26, 1992|pages=3 of 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Movie To Mix Live Actors, Jim Henson Characters|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-09-30/features/9102080788_1_brian-henson-film-project-jim-henson-productions|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 30, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Columbia put the film into [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], with Minkoff still attached as director, and [[Billy Crystal]], [[Meg Ryan]], and [[Susan Sarandon]] reportedly in talks to star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title='Bliss' sticks in ratings mire; Col chops 'Woods'|url=https://variety.com/1997/voices/columns/bliss-sticks-in-ratings-mire-col-chops-woods-1117433140/|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=January 22, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the report by [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']], a film adaptation of ''Into the Woods'' remained inactive for 15 years.

===Development at Disney===
After the critical and commercial success of ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' in 2002, director [[Rob Marshall]] approached [[Stephen Sondheim]] as he was interested in adapting one of his musicals such as ''[[Follies]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'', although Sondheim suggested ''Into the Woods'' instead.&lt;ref name="THRProd"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abramovitch|first1=Seth|title=Perverted Wolves, Cheating Wives and a Fired 10-Year-Old: The Dark Path to Disney's 'Into the Woods'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/perverted-wolves-cheating-wives-a-755359|accessdate=December 13, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall concurred, but development of the project was then postponed while he focused on directing ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' and ''[[Nine (2009 live-action film)|Nine]]''. In 2011, Marshall's interest in the project was rekindled when he heard a speech by President [[Barack Obama]] on the tenth anniversary of the [[September 11th attacks]] to the families of the 9/11 victims, which seemed to evoke the same message as the musical's most important song, "No One Is Alone".&lt;ref name="Feinberg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feinberg|first1=Scott|title=Rob Marshall on Movie Musicals and His Journey 'Into the Woods' (Q&amp;A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/rob-marshall-movie-musicals-his-760996|accessdate=January 7, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall firmly believed that ''Into the Woods'' was “a fairy tale for the post-9/11 generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gray|first1=Tim|title=Disney's 'Into the Woods' Enters Awards Season on High Note|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/disney-enters-awards-race-with-into-the-woods-1201362874/|accessdate=December 13, 2014|work=Variety|date=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, Marshall approached [[Walt Disney Pictures]]—for whom he had just directed ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''—and pitched the idea to the studio,&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt; with Lapine writing the script and Sondheim "expected" to write new songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney Sets Rob Marshall To Direct Adaptation Of 'Into The Woods'|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/01/disney-sets-rob-marshall-to-direct-adapation-of-into-the-woods/|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Deadline Hollywood|date=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Academy Award]]-winner [[Dion Beebe]], who previously collaborated with Marshall on ''Chicago'', ''Memoirs of a Geisha'', and ''Nine'', served as cinematographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Giardina|first=Carolyn|title=Honors and Hires: Oscar Winning DP Dion Beebe Goes 'Into the Woods'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/honors-hires-oscar-winning-dp-564344|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sondheim confirmed that a new song had been written for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Matt|title=Stephen Sondheim: An audience with a theatre legend|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/stephen-sondheim-an-audience-with-a-theatre-legend-8559902.html|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Disney's backing, a three-day reading of the entire updated screenplay took place in New York in October 2012 under Marshall's direction, with [[Nina Arianda]] as the Baker's Wife, [[Victoria Clark]] as Cinderella's Mother/Granny/Giant, [[James Corden]] as the Baker, [[Donna Murphy]] as the Witch, [[Christine Baranski]] as Cinderella's Stepmother, [[Tammy Blanchard]] as Florinda, Ivan Hernandez as the Wolf, [[Megan Hilty]] as Lucinda, [[Cheyenne Jackson]] as Rapunzel's Prince, [[Allison Janney]] as Jack's Mother, [[Anna Kendrick]] as Cinderella, [[Michael McGrath (actor)|Michael McGrath]] as Steward/Mysterious Man, [[Laura Osnes]] as Rapunzel, [[Taylor Trensch]] as Jack, Casey Whyland as Little Red Riding Hood, and [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Cinderella's Prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hetrick|first=Adam|title=Nina Arianda, Victoria Clark, Patrick Wilson, Cheyenne Jackson, James Corden Part of Into the Woods Film Reading|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/170672-Nina-Arianda-Victoria-Clark-Patrick-Wilson-Cheyenne-Jackson-James-Corden-Part-of-Into-the-Woods-Film-Reading|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Playbill|date=October 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103054115/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/170672-Nina-Arianda-Victoria-Clark-Patrick-Wilson-Cheyenne-Jackson-James-Corden-Part-of-Into-the-Woods-Film-Reading|archive-date=November 3, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this reading which ultimately convinced [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] president [[Sean Bailey]] to [[green-light]] the film despite ongoing concerns about the dark nature of the original musical (which Disney executives had begun to understand since Marshall's original pitch).&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt;  However, Disney (which self-finances all its films)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Block|first1=Alex Ben|title=Disney CFO Outlines Strategy, Explains Forgoing Third Party Financing|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-cfo-outlines-strategy-explains-761468|accessdate=January 9, 2015|issue=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided only a relatively small production budget of $50 million (relative to other feature-length fantasy films on its development slate), in turn forcing both cast and crew to accept pay cuts to work on the film.&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt;

In April 2013, [[Johnny Depp]] was in final negotiations, along with Streep, to join the film.&lt;ref name="StreepCast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeppCast" /&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that to help make the film on such a tight budget, Depp agreed as a favor to Disney and to Marshall (whom he had just worked with in ''On Stranger Tides'') to a "boarding" arrangement, in which he would appear in a minor role for a fee of $1 million, instead of his typical fee of $20 million for a starring role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Tatiana|title=How Johnny Depp Made $1 Million in a Week|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-johnny-depp-made-1-676799|accessdate=January 11, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May, James Corden, who took part in the reading of the screenplay, was in talks to play the role of the Baker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hetrick|first=Adam|title=One Man, Two Guvnors Star James Corden in Talks for Into the Woods Film Adaptation|url=http://playbill.com/news/article/177569-One-Man-Two-Guvnors-Star-James-Corden-in-Talks-for-Into-the-Woods-Film-Adaptation|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Playbill|date=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, 2013, Disney confirmed the casting of Streep, Depp, and Corden as the Witch, the Big Bad Wolf, and the Baker, respectively.&lt;ref name="CordenCast" /&gt; That same month, [[Emily Blunt]] and [[Christine Baranski]] were cast, respectively, as the Baker's Wife and Cinderella's Stepmother.&lt;ref name="BaranskiCast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BluntCast"&gt;{{cite news|last=Abramovitch|first=Seth|title=Emily Blunt Circling Disney's 'Into the Woods'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emily-blunt-circling-disneys-woods-524132|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|title=Emily Blunt to Sing Better in Into the Woods Than She Did in That Karaoke Video|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/06/emily-blunt-cant-live-down-that-karaoke-video.html|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Vulture|date=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall later confirmed that Blunt was selected for her "warm[th]" and likeability to ensure the emotional impact of the sudden death of the Baker's Wife: "[T]hat's very important for that character because it's the heart of the piece and you really have to love her so when she's gone it should feel like a kick in the gut."&lt;ref name="Feinberg" /&gt; After she was cast, Blunt discovered she was pregnant and her costume and choreography had to be adjusted accordingly.&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gioia"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gioia|first1=Michael|title=Emily Blunt On Hiding Her Real-Life Baby Bump, Vocal Nerves and the Much-Talked-About "Moment" in the "Woods"|url=http://playbill.com/news/article/emily-blunt-on-hiding-her-real-life-baby-bump-vocal-nerves-and-the-much-talked-about-moment-in-the-woods-336500|accessdate=January 11, 2015|work=Playbill.com|publisher=Playbill, Inc.|date=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her "overweight" appearance during production actually fit in with the role of the Baker's Wife;&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt; as she explained, "I feel like she would have eaten a lot of carbs working in the bakery."&lt;ref name="Gioia" /&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Keep and entrance of Dover Castle, 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Dover Castle]] in [[Kent]] was used as the exterior for the Prince's castle.]]
In July 2013, before filming began, Marshall put the cast through six weeks&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt; of rehearsals on a soundstage and [[Blocking (stage)|blocked]] their scenes.&lt;ref name="Twisted"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burlingame|first1=Jon|title=Rob Marshall Boldly Explores Disney's Take on Twisted Tale 'Into the Woods'|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/features/into-the-woods-rob-marshall-disney-1201346785/|accessdate=January 7, 2015|work=Variety|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the cast members visited [[Angel Recording Studios]] to separately record their respective parts in the presence of Sondheim himself.&lt;ref name="Twisted" /&gt; Over 90% of the vocal tracks in the final version of the film are from the recording studio sessions, while the rest were recorded on location or on the set.&lt;ref name="Twisted" /&gt;  The advantage of blocking and rehearsing all scenes first was that the cast members could then precisely calibrate their voices in the recording studio to the planned appearance of each scene when later filmed, thereby minimizing the slightly disconcerting disconnection between vocals and choreography typical of [[music video]]s.&lt;ref name="Marchant"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marchant|first1=Beth|title=Editor Wyatt Smith Goes Into the Woods to Cut Sound, Picture and Song|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2015/01/editor-wyatt-smith-goes-woods-cutting-sound-picture-song/|accessdate=January 9, 2015|work=StudioDaily|publisher=Access Intelligence|date=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmakers spent a whole day shooting scenes which involved Rapunzel's hair being climbed upon.&lt;ref name="mauzycast" /&gt; Mauzy claimed that the filmmakers wanted to take advantage of her blonde hair, and that the top of Rapunzel's hair appeared in the film was her own real hair; make-up artists only braided it into the extension.&lt;ref name="mauzycast" /&gt; This hair extension was engineered by hair designer Peter King.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Novak|first1=Lexi|title=The Story of Rapunzel's Hair From Into the Woods|url=http://www.allure.com/beauty-trends/blogs/daily-beauty-reporter/2014/12/into-the-woods-rapunzel-hair.html|accessdate=January 22, 2015|work=[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]|publisher=Condé Nast|date=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After testing loose, flowing hair which King found "uncontrollable", he decided to have twenty-seven wefts of real hair woven together into a 30-foot braid, a design which took inspiration from an Arthur Rackham illustration of Rapunzel.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt; In order to bring in enough real Russian hair strands needed for the extension, King and his team had to work with several distributors from Germany and England.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt; The hair-braiding process required three people, each holding a separate strand and weaving in and out.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt; King also dyed the wefts for them to match Mauzy's champagne blonde hair color, and blended together six different shades from ash and strawberry
to create realistic gradations and highlights.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt; Between scenes, Mauzy had to "wrap [the hair] around her arm like huge rolls of wool", as recalled by King.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt; A stuntman was employed to shoot hair-climbing scenes.&lt;ref name="mauzycast" /&gt; Thin rope and metal rings were the only additional tools concealed within the braid to hold the weight of a person climbing up.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt;

The film's final shot, which essentially merges into and links back to its first shot, actually transitions digitally between three shots: a [[Technocrane]] on location lifting as high as possible into the sky, an [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|aerial drone]] flying down a valley in [[Wales]], and a shot of an overcast sky in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Failes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Failes|first1=Ian|title=Into the Woods: full of effects surprises|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/into-the-woods-full-of-effects-surprises/|accessdate=January 3, 2015|work=FXGuide|publisher=FXGuide.com, LLC|date=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming concluded on November 27, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cerasaro|first=Pat|title=Filming Wraps On INTO THE WOODS Movie!

===Music===
{{main|Into the Woods (soundtrack)}}
As noted above, the majority of the songs were pre-recorded by the cast.&lt;ref name="Twisted" /&gt; Music producer Mike Higham, who had previously worked with Sondheim on ''Sweeney Todd'': ''The Demon Barber of Fleet Street'', recorded the film's score with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]].&lt;ref name="officialpr" /&gt; Music supervisor and conductor [[Paul Gemignani]] instructed the actors on how to sing, including singing live to a camera on set, to prerecorded music in studio, and with a live studio orchestra. [[Jonathan Tunick]] orchestrated Sondheim's original music.&lt;ref name="officialpr" /&gt; The [[Key (music)|key]] to the song, "Hello, Little Girl," was altered to better suit [[Johnny Depp]]'s lower vocal range. In regards to the song's musical arrangement, Higham explained, "we emphasized the woodwinds to make it feel a little lighter, especially the flutes. And we just made it a little jazzier —&lt;!--mdash with spaces is as quoted--&gt; played more on the walking bass line. Inherently, when it has a jazz feel, it just feels lighter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Ashley|title='Into the Woods': How Disney Tiptoed Around Johnny Depp's Creepy, Sexualized Song|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woods-johnny-depp-sings-hello-760348|accessdate=December 27, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's soundtrack was released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on December 15, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walt Disney Records Set To Release Into The Woods Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Into The Woods Deluxe Edition On December 16th|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/walt-disney-records-set-to-release-into-the-woods-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-and-into-the-woods-deluxe-edition-on-december-16th-282182481.html|publisher=PRNewswire|accessdate=December 13, 2014|location=Burbank, California|format=Press release|date=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it was initially reported that the film version would feature two new songs: a duet for the Baker and his Wife, titled "Rainbows"—originally written for a 1992 film adaptation that was never made—and a new song for the Witch, eventually titled "She'll Be Back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Zack|title=Disney's Into the Woods Features Major Plot Changes, Stephen Sondheim Reveals—Spoilers Ahead!|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/552578/disney-s-into-the-woods-features-major-plot-changes-stephen-sondheim-reveals-spoilers-ahead|accessdate=June 19, 2014|newspaper=E!

"She'll Be Back" was included as a bonus feature on the film's home media release.&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, Michael.

===Critical response===
The review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an approval rating of 71% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's consensus reads: "On the whole, this Disney adaptation of the Sondheim classic sits comfortably at the corner of [[Hollywood]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]—even if it darkens to its detriment in the final act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/into_the_woods_2014/|title=Into the Woods|date=December 25, 2014|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], calculate a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/into-the-woods | title=Into the Woods Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[CinemaScore]] polls conducted during the opening weekend, audiences gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="OP"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3987&amp;p=.htm | title = Weekend Report (cont.): Huge Limited Debuts for 'American Sniper,' 'Selma' | author = Ray Subers | publisher = Box Office Mojo | date = December 28, 2014 | accessdate = December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Streep was immensely applauded for her performance as the Witch, with many critics and audiences believing she was the film's heart. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post called her and Blunt's portrayals as "two of the greatest female performances of the year".  For her performance, Streep received [[Academy Award]], [[Golden Globe Award]], [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award]] nominations for Best Supporting Actress.

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that the film "benefits from respect for the source material, enticing production values and a populous gallery of sharp character portraits from a delightful cast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rooney|first1=David|title='Into the Woods': Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/woods/review/758611|accessdate=December 17, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' lauded the film, writing; "''Into the Woods'', the splendid Disney screen adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical, infuses new vitality into the tired marketing concept of entertainment for 'children of all ages'".&lt;ref name=NYTReview&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holden|first1=Stephen|title=The Quest for Storybook Endings in a Scary but Magical World|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/movies/into-the-woods-disneys-take-on-the-sondheim-lapine-classic.html|accessdate=December 25, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] called the movie as "one of the year's best films". Similarly, Pete Hammond of Deadline praised the film as "the most dazzling movie musical since Marshall's own Chicago." and praised the performance of the cast, particularly Streep. Lou Lumerick of the New York Post called the film "this century's best musical" and lauded the performances of Streep and Blunt as the best female performances of the year. Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'' gave a positive review declaring the film "Rob Marshall's best movie ever" and praised it for its genuine entertainment and strong cast performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2014/12/19/review-disneys-into-the-woods-hits-a-sour-note/ | title = Review: Disney's 'Into The Woods' Hits A Sour Note | author = Scott Mendelson | publisher = ''Forbes'' | date = December 19, 2014 | accessdate = December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] gave a positive review, stating that the film was a "smart, appealing, upside-down children's story for adults of all ages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corliss|first1=Richard|title=REVIEW: Into the Woods: A Disney Musical for Adults of All Ages|url=http://time.com/3647510/review-into-the-woods-a-disney-musical-for-adults-of-all-ages/|accessdate=December 27, 2014|work=Time|date=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Ellwood of [[HitFix]] tipped Streep as an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] contender in the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] category, and also praised the performance of Chris Pine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/can-meryl-streep-actually-win-a-fourth-oscar-for-into-the-woods| title = Can Meryl Streep Actually Win A Fourth Oscar For Into The Woods?| author = Gregory Ellwood| date = November 23, 2014| accessdate = December 16, 2014| publisher = Hitfix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Lawson of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'',&lt;ref name="Lawson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawson|first1=Richard|title=Into the Woods Is a Fairy-Tale Musical Without Much Magic|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/12/into-the-woods-review|accessdate=January 3, 2015|work=Vanity Fair|publisher=Conde Nast|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen D'Souza of the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'',&lt;ref name="D'Souza"&gt;{{cite news|last1=D'Souza|first1=Karen|title=Review: 'Into the Woods' impressive, but a bit too tame|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainment/ci_27165386/review-into-woods-impressive-but-bit-too-tame?source=rss|accessdate=January 3, 2015|work=San Jose Mercury News|publisher=Bay Area News Group|date=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dana Stevens (critic)|Dana Stevens]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stevens|first1=Dana|title=Into the Woods|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2014/12/into_the_woods_starring_meryl_streep_and_emily_blunt_reviewed.html|accessdate=January 3, 2015|work=Slate|publisher=The Slate Group|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; all published critical reviews of the film.  All three found much to like in the acting (especially Blunt and Pine's performances), but all three also concluded that after the various cuts and changes, the final version of the film had failed to adequately preserve the power of the dark [[Existentialism|existentialist]] message at the heart of the original musical's second act.&lt;ref name="Lawson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Souza" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevens" /&gt; Stevens characterized the result as a "generic [[dystopia]]n bummer,"&lt;ref name="Stevens" /&gt; while Lawson criticized the film as a "dutiful but perfunctory adaptation" which lacked "genuine heart".&lt;ref name="Lawson" /&gt; Paul Katz of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' felt the change in tone between the last two acts was too abrupt, and also criticized the film's faithfulness to the stage musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=Paul|title=Into the Woods (Review)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-katz/into-the-woods-review_1_b_6381348.html|accessdate=March 19, 2015|work=The Huffington Post|date=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Alyssa Rosenberg of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' disliked the performances by Streep and Depp, while simultaneously calling the film's first two acts a "surprising delight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Alyssa|title=How Disney wrecked "Into The Woods"|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/12/26/how-disney-wrecked-into-the-woods/|accessdate=March 19, 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kupferstich-Kabinett''' (English: '''Collection of Prints, Drawings and Photographs''') is part of the [[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden|Staatliche Kunstsammlungen]] (State Art Collections) of [[Dresden]], [[Germany]].  Since 2004 it has been located in [[Dresden Castle]].&lt;ref name=dus&gt;[http://www.dresden-und-sachsen.de/dresden/ks_kupferstichkabinett.htm Kupferstich-Kabinett] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720084737/http://www.dresden-und-sachsen.de/dresden/ks_kupferstichkabinett.htm |date=2011-07-20 }} Information and history from the Dresden and Saxony tourist website. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Like many of Dresden's notable collections, this [[print room]] traces its origins to the [[Electorate of Saxony|Prince-electors of Saxony]]. The art chamber of the [[House of Wettin]], established around 1560, became an independent museum of prints and drawings in 1720.&lt;ref name=dus /&gt;&lt;ref name=melzer&gt;[http://www.riha-journal.org/articles/2010/melzer-vorgeschichte-dresdner-kupferstich-kabinett Zur Vorgeschichte des Dresdner Kupferstich-Kabinetts zwischen 1560 und 1738] Christian Melzer, ''Journal of the International Association of Research Institutes in the History of Art'', '''0004'''. 21 June 2010. Retrieved 8 September 2010. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection was expanded in the following centuries.  It now describes itself as the oldest museum of graphic arts in the German-speaking world.  

Because most items had been evacuated to [[Schloss Weesenstein]] in the early stages of [[World War II]], the collection was saved from the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945.&lt;ref name=skd&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.skd.museum/en/museums-institutions/residenzschloss/kupferstich-kabinett/history-of-the-collection/|title= History of the Collection|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= Staatliche Kunstsammlung Dresden|access-date= 6 September 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; War-time losses were still high; around 50,000 items are still missing.&lt;ref name=skd/&gt; Most of the exhibits were [[Looted_art#Looting_by_the_Soviet_Union|looted]] by the [[Soviet Union]] after the war and did not return to Dresden until the late 1950s,&lt;ref name=dus /&gt; and some  when they were put back on display in the [[Albertinum]].

==Collection==
[[File:Jan van Eyck - Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Study for Cardinal Niccolò Albergati]]'', attributed to [[Jan van Eyck]], c. 1431]]
The collection includes over 500,000 items, only a fraction of which can be exhibited.  The most renowned artists in the collection include [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Francisco de Goya]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Rubens]].  There is also a large number of works by artists with strong connections to Dresden, such as [[Caspar David Friedrich]], [[Ludwig Richter]], [[Georg Baselitz]] and [[Johannes Heisig]].  The collection of [[Käthe Kollwitz]] was started in 1898 and now numbers over 200 works from her oeuvre of drawings and graphics.&lt;ref name=dus /&gt;

Besides the permanent exhibition, the Kupferstichkabinett also hosts regular special exhibitions featuring both its own works and those on loan from other notable museums.

The '''Lewis chessmen''' ({{lang-no|Lewisbrikkene}}; {{lang-gd|Fir-Tàilisg}}; {{lang-sco|Lewis chesmen}}) or '''Uig chessmen''', named after the [[Uig, Lewis|bay]] where they were found,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceuig.co.uk/uig-chessmen/ |title=Uig Chessmen &amp;#124; Comann Eachdraidh Uig |publisher=Ceuig.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a group of distinctive [[12th-century]] [[chess]] pieces, along with other game pieces, most of which are carved from [[walrus ivory]]. Discovered in 1831 on [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]], Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=6665 |title=The enigma of the Lewis chessmen |publisher=Chessbase |date=9 November 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; they may constitute some of the few complete, surviving [[medieval]] [[chess set]]s, although it is not clear if a set as originally made can be assembled from the pieces. When found, the hoard contained 93 artifacts: 78 chess pieces, 14 [[Tables (board game)|tablemen]] and one belt buckle. Today, 82 pieces are owned and usually exhibited by the [[British Museum]] in [[London]], and the remaining 11 are at the [[National Museum of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]].

== Origin ==
[[File:Beserker, Lewis Chessmen, British Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|"[[Berserker]]" warder (rook), in the British Museum]]
The British Museum claims the chessmen were probably made in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]], in the 12th century,&lt;ref name="British Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/the_lewis_chessmen.aspx |title=The Lewis Chessmen |publisher=British Museum |date= |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some scholars have suggested other Nordic countries.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
During that period, the [[Outer Hebrides]], along with other major groups of [[Scottish islands]], were ruled by Norway.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

According to Dr. Alex Woolf, director of the [[University of St Andrews]] Institute for Medieval Studies, there are reasons for believing the pieces came from Trondheim:
*A broken queen piece in a similar style was found in an excavation of the archbishop's palace &amp;ndash; it appeared the piece was broken as it was being made.
*The presence of wealthy people in Trondheim able to pay craftsmen for high-quality chess pieces.
*Similar carving in [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in Trondheim.
*The excavation in Trondheim of a kite-shaped shield similar to shields on some of the pieces and a king piece of similar design found on [[Hitra (island)|Hitra]] Island, near the mouth of [[Trondheim Fjord]]. Woolf has said that the armour worn by the chess figures includes "perfect" reproductions of armour worn at the time in Norway.&lt;ref name=dlmnyt&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/arts/09lewis.html |title=Reopening History of Storied Norse Chessmen |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=14 September 2010 |date=8 September 2010 |last=McClain, Dylan Loeb}} (appeared 9 September 2010 in the newspaper, page C2, ''New York Times'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Icelanders Gudmundur Thorarinsson and Einar Einarsson have proposed that the chessmen originated in Iceland, since only in Iceland were the [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]]s called that at that time, while in other countries they used a name unassociated with the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.leit.is/lewis/ |title=Are the Isle of Lewis chessmen Icelandic? |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further claim that the pieces were carved by an artist known as [[Margret the Adroit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Nancy Marie |title=Ivory Vikings: the Mystery of the most Famous Chessmen in the World and the Woman who Made Them |date=2015 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=9781137279378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McClain |first1=Dylan Loeb |title=Reopening History of Storied Ivory Chessmen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/arts/09lewis.html?_r=0 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21662487-bones-contention |title=Bones of Contention |date=29 August 2015 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is disputed by Woolf, who stated that the use of bishops originated in England,&lt;ref name=dlmnyt/&gt; and by Norwegian chess historian and member of the Ken Whyld Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Membership and Members |url=http://www.kwabc.org/index.php/membership-members |accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morten Lilleøren.&lt;ref name="The Lewis Chessmen on a Fantasy Iceland"&gt;Lilleøren, Morten, [http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=7695 The Lewis Chessmen on a Fantasy Iceland] (ChessBase News, 2 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians believe that the Lewis chessmen were hidden (or lost) after some mishap occurred during their carriage from Norway to wealthy Norse towns on the east coast of Ireland, such as [[Dublin]]. The large number of pieces and their lack of wear may suggest that they were the stock of a trader or dealer.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; Along with the chess pieces, there were 14 plain round tablemen for the game of [[Tables (board game)|tables]] and one belt buckle, all made of ivory, making a total of 93 artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Robinson|2004|pp=5, 36, 54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Almost all of the pieces in the collection are carved from walrus ivory, with a few made instead from [[Toothed whales|whale teeth]]. The 78&lt;ref&gt;93 per BM now&lt;/ref&gt; pieces consist of eight [[king (chess)|king]]s, eight [[queen (chess)|queen]]s, 16 [[bishop (chess)|bishop]]s, 15 [[knight (chess)|knight]]s, 12 [[rook (chess)|rook]]s and 19 [[pawn (chess)|pawn]]s.  The heights of the pawns range from 3.5 to 5.8&amp;nbsp;cm, while the other pieces are between 7 and 10.2&amp;nbsp;cm. Although there are 19 pawns (a complete set requires 16), they have the greatest range of sizes of all the pieces, which has suggested that the 78 pieces might belong to at least five sets.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; All the pieces are sculptures of human figures, with the exception of the pawns, which are smaller, geometric shapes.  The knights are mounted on rather diminutive horses and are shown holding spears and shields.  The rooks are standing soldiers or warders holding shields and swords; four of the rooks are shown as wild-eyed [[berserker]]s biting their shields with battle fury.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Some pieces bore traces of red stain when found, indicating that red and white were used to distinguish the two sides, rather than the black and white used in modern chess.&lt;ref name=dlmnyt/&gt;
[[Image:lewis-chessmen08.jpg|thumb|left|The Lewis chessmen in the British Museum]]

Scholars have observed that, to the modern eye, the figural pieces, with their bulging eyes and glum expressions, have a distinct comical character.&lt;ref name="Robinson, pp. 37-41"&gt;Robinson, pp. 37–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Stratford, ''The Lewis chessmen and the enigma of the hoard'' (The British Museum Press, 1997), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true of the single rook with a worried, sideways glance (front right of first image below, next to queen) and the berserkers biting their shields, which have been called "irresistibly comic to a modern audience".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed, however, that the comic or sad expressions were not intended or perceived as such by the makers, to whom these images instead displayed strength, ferocity or, in the case of the queens who hold their heads with a hand and seemingly pensive expression, "contemplation, repose and possibly wisdom".&lt;ref name="Robinson, pp. 37-41"/&gt;

== Modern discovery ==
The chessmen were discovered in early 1831 in a sand bank at the head of [[Camas Uig]] on the west coast of the Isle of Lewis, in the [[Outer Hebrides]] of Scotland.  There are various local stories concerning their arrival and modern discovery on Lewis.

Malcolm "Sprot" MacLeod ({{lang-gd|Calum an Sprot}}) from the nearby [[Ardroil|township of Pennydonald]] discovered the trove in a small stone [[cist|kist]] in a dune, exhibited them briefly in his [[barn|byre]] and sold them on to Captain Roderick Ryrie.&lt;ref name=burn/&gt;  One reported detail, that it was a cow that actually unearthed the stash, is generally discounted in [[Uig, Lewis|Uig]] as fabrication.  After the Isle of Lewis was purchased by Sir [[James Matheson]] in 1844, Malcolm Macleod and his family [[Highland Clearances|were evicted]] and the district was transformed into sheep farms.

== Exhibition and ownership ==
[[File:Lewis chessmen 23.JPG|thumb|A queen and a warder (rook) in the joint exhibition in [[Edinburgh]], 2010]]
They were exhibited by Ryrie at a meeting of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]], on 11 April 1831. The chessmen were soon after split up, with 10 being purchased by [[Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe]] and the others (67 chessmen and 14 [[tables (board game)|tablemen]]) purchased on behalf of the [[British Museum]] in [[London]].

Kirkpatrick Sharpe later found another bishop to take his collection up to eleven, all of which were later sold to [[Albert Denison, 1st Baron Londesborough|Lord Londesborough]]. In 1888, they were again sold, but this time the purchaser was the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]], who donated the pieces to the Royal Scottish Museum in [[Edinburgh]].  The eleven are now on display in the [[National Museum of Scotland]].

Of the pieces given to the British Museum, most can be found in Room 40, with the registration numbers M&amp;ME 1831, 11–1.78–159.  Others have been lent to Scottish museums and temporary exhibitions.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; A range of wooden or plastic replicas are popular items in the Museum shops.

The chessmen were number 5 in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the [[British Museum]] for the 2003 BBC Television documentary ''[[Our Top Ten Treasures]]'', presented by [[Adam Hart-Davis]].  They feature in the 2010 BBC Radio 4 series ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]'' as number 61, in the "Status Symbols" section.

An exhibition entitled "The Lewis Chessmen: Unmasked", which includes chesspieces from both the National Museum of Scotland and British Museum collections, along with other relevant objects, toured Scotland in 2010–2011. The exhibition opened in Edinburgh on 21 May 2010 and proceeded to Aberdeen, [[Shetland]], and the Museum nan Eilean in [[Stornoway]], opening there on 15 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-13085170 "Lewis Chessman exhibition opens in Stornoway museum"]. BBC. Retrieved 15 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition entitled "The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen from the Isle of Lewis" at [[The Cloisters]] in New York City included 34 of the chess pieces, all on loan from the British Museum. The exhibit ended on 22 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/arts/design/the-game-of-kings-medieval-ivory-chessmen-from-the-isle-of-lewis-at-the-cloisters.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=cloisters&amp;st=cse |title=Ken Johnson, "Medieval Foes With Whimsey," New York Times, Nov. 18, 2011 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=18 November 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April 2013, £1.8 million from the European Regional Development Fund was granted to transform [[Lews Castle]], on the Isle of Lewis, into a Museum for the Western Isles. Around £14 million in total is to be spent on restoring and converting the property, which has been shut for almost twenty-five years.  When completed the permanent displays will include six of the Lewis Chessmen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2013/04/investment-in-museum-03042013 "New funding announced for Lews Castle Museum"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispute over location ==
[[Image:Chess01.jpg|thumb|Lewis chessmen in the [[National Museum of Scotland]]]]
In 2007–2008 a dispute arose regarding the most appropriate place to display the pieces. The issue first arose&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/7159656.stm|title=Moves to unite historic chessmen|date=2007-12-24|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; late in 2007 with calls from [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) politicians in the Western Isles (notably Councillor Annie Macdonald, MSP [[Alasdair Allan]] and MP [[Angus MacNeil]]) for the return of the pieces to the place they were found. [[Linda Fabiani]], the Scottish [[Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture]], stated that "it is unacceptable that only 11 Lewis Chessmen rest at the [[National Museum of Scotland]] while the other 67 (as well as the 14 tablemen) remain in the British Museum in London."

[[Richard Oram]], Professor of Medieval and Environmental History at the [[University of Stirling]], agreed, arguing that there was no reason for there to be more than "a sample" of the collection in London.  Both points of view have been dismissed by [[Margaret Hodge]], the UK [[Minister of State]] in the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], writing "It's a lot of nonsense, isn't it?"&lt;ref name=burn&gt;Burnett, Allan (3 February 2008) "Stalemate". Glasgow. ''The Sunday Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The local historical society in Uig, ''Comann Eachdraidh Uig'', which operates a registered museum near the find site featuring detailed information about the chessmen and Norse occupation in Lewis, has indicated publicly that it has no intention of pursuing any claim to the ownership of the pieces and does not support demands for them to be sent to Edinburgh, but would welcome short-term loans.&lt;ref&gt;Uig News, February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, twenty-four of the pieces from London and six from Edinburgh began a 16-month tour of various locations in Scotland. The tour was partly funded by the [[Scottish Government]], and [[Michael Russell (politician)|Mike Russell]], the [[Minister for Culture and External Affairs]], stated that the Government and the British Museum had "agreed to disagree" on their eventual fate. [[Bonnie Greer]], the museum's deputy chairman, said that she "absolutely" believed the main collection should remain in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cornwell |first=Tim |date=2 October 2009 |title=Chessmen 'will never come home' |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/chessmen-will-never-come-home-1-778018 |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film has been the most influential medium in the presentation of the [[history of slavery]] to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. Martin and David C. Wall, "The Politics of Cine-Memory: Signifying Slavery in the History Film,"  in Robert A. Rosenstone and Constantin Parvulesu, eds. ''A Companion to the Historical Film'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2013), p67.&lt;/ref&gt;  The American film industry has had a complex relationship with [[slavery]], and until recent decades often avoided the topic. Films such as ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915)&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Stokes, ''D.W. Griffith's the Birth of a Nation: A History of the Most Controversial Motion Picture of All Time'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939) became controversial because they gave a favorable depiction. In 1940, ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|The Santa Fe Trail]]'' gave a strong condemnation of [[abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s attacks on slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Morsberger, "Slavery and 'The Santa Fe Trail,' or, John Brown on Hollywood's Sour Apple Tree," ''American Studies'' (1977) 18#2 pp. 87–98. [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/view/2290/2249 online]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States|American]] [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s made defiant slaves into heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hernán Vera|author2=Andrew M. Gordon|title=Screen saviors: Hollywood fictions of whiteness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZAPD2YdBXYC&amp;pg=PA54|year=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=54–56|isbn=9780847699476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Hollywood films used American settings, although  [[Spartacus (film)|''Spartacus'' (1960)]] dealt with an actual [[slave revolt]] in the Roman Empire known as the [[Third Servile War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.livescience.com/39730-spartacus.html |title=Spartacus: History of Gladiator Revolt Leader |last=Jarus |first=Owen |date=17 September 2013 |access-date=8 August 2018 |work=[[LiveScience]] |publisher=[[Purch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It failed, and all the rebels were executed, but their spirit lived on according to the film.&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Zemon Davis, ''Slaves on Screen: Film and Historical Vision'' (2002) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Last Supper (1976 film)|The Last Supper]]'' (''La última cena'' in Spanish) was a 1976 film directed by Cuban [[Tomás Gutiérrez Alea]] about the teaching of Christianity to slaves in Cuba and emphasizes the role of ritual and revolt.  ''[[Burn!]]'' takes place on the imaginary Portuguese island of Queimada (where the locals speak Spanish) and merges historical events that took place in Brazil, Cuba, Santo Domingo, Jamaica, and elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

&lt;note name = "while ... black"&gt;  OK, i am  disqualifyying myself from doing more about this than drawing attn to it and offering a possible draft for the change. I won't complain if someone thinks i'm a "white phony liberal", but i note my objection to the language i found in one of the entries, along the lines of " marrying a white woman while possibly black". IMO, the phrase "driving [or whatever] while black" is a well established term regarding oppression, and adapting it in the context of describing the film in question is too ambiguous between mockery of the rerm, and an unfamiliar extension of its use in labelling oppression, to be acceptable in an article. Discuss, please, and reword unless i'm mistaken.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, an author will write a story that is consciously based on an older story (typically in the [[public domain]]) but with a modernized [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] and [[fictional character|characters]]. Sometimes the original work is still [[copyrighted]], but the writer includes the minimum quota of differences to avoid being a direct [[plagiarism]] while using [[Copyright Law of the United States#Parodies|an immediately recognizable story template]].

==Film==
&lt;!--
This list only includes films that are an adaptation of an OLDER work (typically public domain, pre-1923) with a significant change in time period. Only films that are (1) credited on-screen or (2) reliable sources state the film is an adaptation of (NOT just bearing a passing resemblance) an older work.

Listing format:
Name of film - (Name of author)'s (type of work) (year) (name of work) set in (brief description of location and time period)

Example: Apocalypse Now - Joseph Conrad's 1899 novella Heart of Darkness set in 1969 during the Vietnam War

Entries may be deleted if:
(1) Work is not modernized, i.e. set roughly around the same time period as the source material (2) Work is not cited by reliable sources as a direct adaptation, but more vaguely as "inspired by", "bears some resemblance to" (3) The source material is post-copyright era

A total of 29 sculptures&lt;ref group=note&gt;With the monuments erected against the park's outer walls, the total of sculptures in the care of the [[Central Park Conservancy]] is described as "over fifty".&lt;/ref&gt; have appeared since 1863 in [[New York City]]'s {{convert|843|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Central Park]]. Most have been donated by individuals or organizations, few by the city itself. While many early statues are of authors and poets along "Literary Walk" and American figures like [[Daniel Webster]] and "the Pilgrim", other early works were simply picturesque, like ''The Hunter'' and ''The Falconer''; other notable statues include sled dog [[Balto]], the so-called "[[Cleopatra's Needle (New York)|Cleopatra's Needle]]"—an Egyptian [[obelisk]]—[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice]] of Wonderland, and most recently [[Duke Ellington]].

==Selected sculptures==

===Animals===
[[File:Balto.jpg|thumb|upright|''Balto'']]
* '''''[[Balto]]''''' was dedicated to the sled dogs that led several dogsled teams through a snow-storm in the winter of 1925 in order to deliver [[medicine]] that would stop a [[diphtheria]] epidemic in [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Alaska]]. The sculpture is slightly larger than the real-life dog, and is placed on a rock outcropping on the main path leading north from the Tisch Children's Zoo. The sculpture was created by [[Frederick George Richard Roth]], and placed in the park in 1925. Like so many other [[monument]]s in the park, it's made of [[bronze]], and it was donated to the park by the Balto Monument Committee to the City of [[New York City|New York]].  Under the [[sculpture]], a small plaque can be found, containing the following inscription:
:&lt;center&gt;''Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxins six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the Winter of 1925.  ENDURANCE • FIDELITY • INTELLIGENCE''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1328P5B46174F.49234&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!302803~!7&amp;ri=3&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=balto+new+york&amp;index=.GW&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=3|title=Balto, (sculpture)|last=|first=|date=|year=1993|website=|publisher=Save Outdoor Sculpture, New York, New York survey|others=Shahbaz Akhtar|accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

* '''''[[Eagles and Prey]]''''', designed and created by [[Christophe Fratin]], is the oldest known sculpture in any New York City park. It is made of bronze, and was cast in Paris, France in 1850 and was placed in the park in 1863. The sculpture was donated by [[Gordon Webster Burnham]], who also donated the statue of [[Daniel Webster]], as well as statues in other cities.  The monument depicts a goat, wedged accidentally between two rocks, which is about to be devoured by two [[eagle]]s. Their talons are sunk into the back of the goat as they flap their wings in victory.
* '''''Still Hunt''''' by sculptor [[Edward Kemeys]] (1843–1907) was placed in the park in 1883.  This bronze sculpture of a crouching [[cougar]] waiting to pounce, was created by Edward Kemeys, the famous American sculptor who also created the famous Hudson Bay wolves at the [[Philadelphia Zoo]], and lions at the entrance to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].  Situated on a rock outcrop on the west side of the East Drive at the edge of the Ramble, the crouching animal has scared many joggers as they climb "Cat Hill" (formally Cedar Hill) and approach this life-size and realistic representation. Unlike the traditional sculptures of other animals in the park that sit on a base or pedestal, Kemeys situated his animal directly on the rock ledge. Kemeys was so interested in depicting his animals in a realistic mode that he traveled to the western states to see them in their native habitat.

===Artists===

* Bust of the architect '''''[[Richard Morris Hunt]]''''' at the Hunt Memorial, along with two other figures sculpted by [[Daniel Chester French]]. Flanking the Hunt bust are statuettes, one holding a sculptor's mallet and a palette, representing the allied arts, while the other holds a model for the Administration Building at the [[Chicago]] [[World's Columbian Exposition]], designed by Hunt. On the perimeter wall of Central Park, Fifth Avenue and 70th Street, opposite the [[Frick Collection]], which was built on the site of the [[New York Public Library|Lenox Library]], also designed by architect Hunt. The granite and marble Hunt memorial was designed by American architect [[Bruce Price]].

• Tucked into a dead end triangle of Central Park at east 96/97th, the statue of [http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/albert-bertel-thorvaldsen.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/ Albert Bertel Thorvaldsen]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/albert-bertel-thorvaldsen.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/&lt;/ref&gt; was first dedicated in 1894 and is the only statue of an artist displayed in any New York City park.

===Fictional characters===

* One large sculpture depicts '''''[[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]''''', from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1865 classic ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. The statue is located on [[East 74th Street]] on the north side of Central Park's Conservatory Water. Alice is pictured sitting on a giant mushroom reaching toward a pocket watch held by the White Rabbit. Peering over her shoulder is the Cheshire cat, flanked on one side by the dormouse, and on the other by [[Mad Hatter]], who in contrast to the calm Alice looks ready to laugh out loud at any moment.  Publisher and philanthropist [[George T. Delacorte Jr.]] ordered the sculpture from [[José de Creeft]], in honor of Delacorte's late wife, Margarita, and to the enjoyment of the children of [[New York City|New York]]. Unveiled in 1959, de Creeft's sculpture tries to follow [[John Tenniel]]'s whimsical [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] illustrations from the first edition of the book. According to various sources, Alice is said to look like de Creeft's daughter Donna. The Alice in Wonderland project's architects and designers were Hideo Sasaki and Fernando Texidor, who inserted some plaques with inscriptions from the book in the terrace around the sculpture. Margarita's favorite poem, "The Jabberwocky" is also included; chiseled in a granite circle surrounding the sculpture:
''&lt;center&gt;'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe&lt;/center&gt;''
:The design of the sculpture attracts many children who want to climb its many levels, resulting in the bronze's glowing patina, polished by thousands of tiny hands over the years since the sculpture was unveiled.  It was cast at Modern Art Foundry Astoria Queens NY. The sculpture was in the music video of Slick Ricks Children's Story.

* The '''[[Burnett Memorial Fountain]]''', dedicated to the author [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]], was placed in the [[Conservatory Garden]] when it reopened in 1936, a donation by the ad hoc Children's Garden Building Committee. It was designed and created by [[Bessie Potter Vonnoh]] between 1926 and 1936. When Frances Hodgson Burnett died in 1924, some of her friends wanted to honor her memory by creating a storytelling area in Central Park. They chose the Conservatory Garden's south garden, at 104th Street and Fifth Avenue, as the site for the memorial. It is believed that the two figures, a reclining boy playing the flute and the young girl holding the bowl, represent Mary and Dickon, the main characters from ''[[The Secret Garden]]''.

===Historical figures===
[[File:SimonBolivarCentralParkNYC.JPG|thumb|right|upright|''Simón Bolívar'']]
[[File:christopher columbus321.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Christopher Columbus (Sunol)|Christopher Columbus]]'']]
* The [[equestrian sculpture]] of '''''[[Simón Bolívar]]''''' was originally sited on the rock outcropping between 82nd and 83rd Streets overlooking [[Central Park West]], where the [[Bolívar Hotel]], once facing it, commemorates its location. After Sixth Avenue was renamed [[Avenue of the Americas]] in 1945, the sculpture was relocated in the 1950s to be adjacent to those of fellow Latin American revolutionary leaders [[José de San Martín]] and [[José Martí]] at the head of the Avenue of the Americas.
* In 1892, '''''[[Christopher Columbus (Sunol)|Christopher Columbus]]''''' was donated to Central Park by the [[New York Genealogical and Biographical Society]] in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of his arrival in the Americas. The statue replicates one made by [[Jeronimo Suñol]] in 1892,&lt;ref&gt;The park's sculpture is signed in the bronze "J. SUÑOL"; it bears the foundry mark of Federico Masriera Barcelona 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; located at the Plaza de Colon, in [[Madrid]]. The New York version was placed in the park in 1894 at the foot of the Mall, and is today one of two monuments of Columbus found in the park's environs, the other being the statue surmounting the column at [[Columbus Circle]].  The sculpture depicts the explorer standing with outstretched arms, looking towards the heavens in gratitude for his successful voyage.
* The standing sculpture of [[Alexander Hamilton]] standing in a grove of apple trees and crabapples west of the East Drive behind the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] was "presented by [[John Church Hamilton|John C. Hamilton]] 1880", according to the inscription on its granite base. The donor was the son of Hamilton. It was sculpted by [[Carl Conrads]].
* The '''''[[King Jagiello Monument]]''''' is an equestrian statue of King '''[[Władysław II Jagiełło]]''' of [[History of Poland (1385&amp;ndash;1569)|Poland]], holding over his head two crossed swords, is the largest sculpture in Central Park.  As a result of the outbreak of the World War II, the monument stayed in New York; in July 1945 it was presented to the City of New York by the King Jagiello Monument Committee and permanently placed in Central Park with the cooperation of the last pre-Communist consul of Poland in New York, Kazimierz Krasicki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25777864?uid=3739704&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104328417543 |title=In the Footsteps of Stanislaw K.

* The bronze standing figure of '''''[[Daniel Webster (Ball)|Daniel Webster]]''''' by [[Thomas Ball (artist)|Thomas Ball]] stands on a high granite plinth at the confluence of two carriage drives near the foot of [[Strawberry Fields Memorial]], at approximately 72nd Street. Ball had circulated many examples of statuettes of this model. The over-lifesize bronze, cast in [[Munich]], was presented by Gordon W. Burnham in 1876. The plinth bears as a bronze legend Webster's famous phrases &lt;small&gt;LIBERTY AND UNION, NOW AND FOREVER, ONE AND INSEPARABLE. &lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/daniel-webster.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310224247/http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/daniel-webster.html |dead-url=no |archive-date=March 10, 2014 |publisher=Central Park Conservancy |title=Daniel Webster |accessdate=June 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientists===
* The bronze bust of naturalist '''[[Alexander von Humboldt]]''' by [[Gustav Blaeser]] (1813–1874) has stood since 1981 on a granite pedestal at Naturalists' Gate, 77th Street and [[Central Park West]], opposite the corner of the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. The monument, donated by an ad hoc association of German-Americans, the Humboldt Memorial Association, was dedicated at its original location at 59th Street and [[Fifth Avenue]] on September 14, 1869.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120207161415/http://www.centralpark2000.com/database/humbolt.html Central Park 2000: Alexander von Humboldt]; [http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=11943 NYC Dept of Parks &amp; Recreation: Alexander von Humboldt Monument]&lt;/ref&gt; Blaeser, who knew Humboldt, was said to have worked in part from Humboldt's death mask. The bronze was cast by [[Georg Ferdinand Howaldt]], Braunschweig.
* The '''[[J. Marion Sims (von Miller)|statue]]''' of [[Dr James Marion Sims]]

===War Memorials===
[[File:107th Rgt Memorial 5th Av cloudy jeh.jpg|right|thumb|''[[107th Infantry Memorial]]'']]
* The '''[[107th Infantry Memorial]]''' is dedicated to the men who served in the 107th New York Infantry Regiment, originally [[Seventh Regiment of New York]], during World War I. The regiment was, as its name implies, stationed in New York, and consisted of males mainly from this region. In 1917, the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]'s 7th New York Infantry Registry Division. While in France, they saw heavy action, and at the end of the war in November 1918, of the 3,700 men originally in the regiment, 580 men were killed and 1,487 wounded, with four of the regiment's soldiers being awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].  The memorial depicts seven men; the one to the far right carrying two [[Mills bomb]]s, while supporting the wounded soldier next to him. To his right another infantryman (depicting Robert Russell Bennett, a 107 combat veteran who was asked by the artist to model for the statue along with 6 other actual 107 veterans of the Somme) rushes towards the enemy positions, while the helmet less squad leader and another soldier are approaching the enemy with bayonets fixed. To the far left, one soldier is holding a mortally wounded soldier, keeping him on his feet. The [[bronze]] memorial was donated by 7th-107th Memorial Committee, and was designed and sculpted by [[Karl Illava]], who served in the 107th IR as a sergeant in World War I. The monument was first conceived about 1920, was made in 1926&amp;ndash;1927 and was placed in the park and unveiled in 1927, near the perimeter wall at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 67th Street.

===Writers and poets===
[[File:NYC Hans C Andersen.jpg|thumb|right|''Hans Christian Andersen'']]
* '''''[[Hans Christian Andersen]]''''', the famous Danish fairy-tale writer, his most notable work being "[[The Ugly Duckling]]". His statue features him sitting and reading to a stray duck. The 1956 work by sculptor [[Georg J. Lober]] was constructed with contributions from Danish and American schoolchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/hans-christian-andersen.html |title=Hans Christian Andersen |publisher=Central Park Conservancy |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was cast at [[Modern Art Foundry]], Astoria, Queens, NY.
* Poet '''''[[Robert Burns (Steell)|Robert Burns]]''''' is sculpted in bronze by Sir [[John Steell]], the eminent Victorian sculptor.  It was unveiled in Central Park, New York in 1880. It was intended as a companion statue to '''''[[Sir Walter Scott (sculpture)|Sir Walter Scott]]''''' by the same sculptor, erected some eight years previously.
* '''''[[Fitz-Greene Halleck (sculpture)|Fitz-Greene Halleck]]''''' has been described as the ''least known literary figure today on Literary Walk'', despite being the only person to have a memorial unveiled by the then-[[president of the United States]], [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in 1877, ten years after his death in November 1867. The monument was funded by the use of public subscription, and had a long list of prominent guests and speakers at the dedication and unveiling of the monument, among them the president's cabinet, [[General of the Army]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T.Sherman]], the poets [[Bayard Taylor]], [[George Henry Boker]] and [[William Cullen Bryant]], as well as other notable citizens.  The monument is made in bronze by [[James Wilson Alexander MacDonald]], and is placed near the Literary Walk and The Mall. The monument has been thoroughly refurbished by The Central Park Conservancy, first by hot waxing it in 1983, and then again in 1992, as well as in 1999, when it was dewaxed, pressure-washed and repatinated, and then protected by a coating of a corrosion-inhibiting lacquer.
* '''''[[William Shakespeare (Ward)|William Shakespeare]]''''', a bronze statue on a stone pedestal, located to the south of the mall, southeast of Sheep's Meadow; this sculpture was erected with funds raised from a benefit performance of Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' on November 25, 1864, at [[The Winter Garden Theatre (1850)|The Winter Garden Theatre]], in a performance by [[Edwin Booth]], [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.]] and their younger brother, [[John Wilkes Booth]]. [[John Quincy Adams Ward]] sculpted the work. Ward was arguably the dean of American sculpture at the time, and he is the source of more public sculpture in NYC than any other artist. This is the artist's second of four works in Central Park.

===Other sculptures===
* ''The Angel of the Waters'' / '''[[Bethesda Fountain]]''' (unveiled in 1873) was not in the original "Greensward Plan", developed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]]; the architectural middle of the park was called "The Water Terrace", for its placement beside The Lake, but the area became known as Bethesda Terrace after the fountain was unveiled in 1873. At the unveiling ceremony, the artist's brochure quoted a Biblical verse from the Gospel of St. John: ''Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called… Bethesda…whoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.''  The fountain was designed and created by [[Emma Stebbins]], who became the first woman to receive a sculptural commission in New York City when she was commissioned to create this fountain. &lt;!-- CHECK It is one of the few monuments donated by NYC itself--&gt; It was designed and created in 1868, but wasn't unveiled until 1873, when the park was officially completed. In 1988. the [[Central Park Conservancy]] cleaned, repatinated, and sealed the fountain with a protective coating, and it is washed and waxed annually in order to preserve it. The fountain can be found in the middle of the park, on the north side of 72nd Street.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
* '''''[[Indian Hunter (sculpture)|Indian Hunter]]''''' (1866) by [[John Quincy Adams Ward]]&lt;ref&gt;Signed in the bronze "J.Q.A. WARD Sculptor N.Y. 1866"; it was also inscribed by the bronze-founder, L.A. Amouroux, New York&lt;/ref&gt; was shown at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1867]] and made the sculptor's reputation. It was the first sculpture by an American sculptor to be sited in Central Park, in 1869; it stands on the pathway west of The Mall, between the Mall and Sheep Meadow, at approximately 66th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/indian-hunter.html |publisher=Central Park Conservancy |title=Indian Hunter |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''''[[Untermyer Fountain]]''''' in [[Conservatory Garden]] was donated by the family of Samuel Untermyer in 1947. The bronze figures, ''Three Dancing Maidens'' by [[Walter Schott]] (1861–1938), were executed in Germany about 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/untermyer-fountain.html |title=The Untermyer Fountain |publisher=Central Park Conservancy |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, temporary exhibitions of sculpture are mounted in the Doris Freedman Plaza, a concrete and cobblestone area located just outside the southeast entrance walkway to the park, behind the Sherman Monument.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In [[Japanese art]], ''mitate-e'' ({{lang|ja|見立絵}}) is a subgenre of [[ukiyo-e]] that employs allusions, puns, and incongruities, often to parody classical art or events.

The term derives from two roots: ''mitateru'' ({{lang|ja|見立る}}, "to liken one thing to another"){{efn|''Mitateru'' has a number of other meanings not relevant to ''mitate-e''.{{sfn|Clark|1997|p=7}} }} and ''e'' ({{lang|ja|絵}}, "picture").  The ''mitate'' technique arose first in poetry and became prominent during the [[Heian period]] (794–1185).  [[Haiku]] poets revived the technique during the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868), from which it spread to the other arts of the era.{{sfn|Clark|1997|p=7}}  Such works typically employ allusions, puns, and incongruities, and frequently recall classical artworks.{{sfn|Clark|1997|pp=9–10}}

In the context of ukiyo-e, ''mitate-e'' is often translated into English as "parody picture".{{sfn|Clark|1997|p=7}}  This usage of the term arose much later; the term itself was used in different ways during the Edo period.  Those works today called ''mitate-e'' used different labels at the time, such as ''fūryū'' ({{lang|ja|風流}}, "elegant" or "fashionable"){{sfn|Clark|1997|p=11}} which appeared frequently in the 18th century on works by [[Okumura Masanobu]] (1686–1764) and [[Suzuki Harunobu]] (1725–1770).{{sfn|Clark|1997|p=12}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8792">The '''American Negro Academy''' (ANA) was the first organization in the United States to support African-American academic scholarship. It operated from 1897 to 1928,&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraged classical academic studies and [[liberal arts]]. 

It was formed to provide support to classic scholarship, in contrast to [[Booker T. Washington]]'s approach to education. Washington's [[Tuskegee University]] emphasized  vocational and industrial training for southern blacks, as he thought this was more practical for the lives most would live in the segregated South, where most blacks lived in rural areas. 

==Founder members==
The founders of the ANA were primarily authors, scholars, and artists. They included [[Alexander Crummell]], an Episcopal priest and Republican from New York City;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Alexander Crummell : A Study of Civilization and Discontent: A Study of Civilization and Discontent|author=University, W.J.M.P.A.C.B.|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195364088|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZOFnrBAzmYC|page=339|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wesley Cromwell]] of Washington, DC;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gunter|first1=Donald W.|title=John Wesley Cromwell (1846–1927)|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Cromwell_John_Wesley_1846-1927|publisher=Encyclopedia Virginia|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], poet and writer in Washington; [[Walter B.

==Early meetings==

The Academy was organized in 1897 in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;''Publications of the Southern History Association:'' Volume 9 - Page 49&lt;/ref&gt; Black newspapers expressed excitement that the Academy would have wide possibilities to serve a large audience, seeking to elevate the race through educational enlightenment. Through an assessment of statistical tends, mainly concerning black illiteracy, the Academy-based its work that was to then be published in its Occasional Papers. The scholarly contributions aided the spirit of blacks who were being forced into legal segregation in southern states.&lt;ref&gt;"An American Negro Academy." ''The Freeman,'' February 5, 1898, News sec.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy generally held an annual meeting of one-two days at the Lincoln Memorial Church in Washington, D.C. A public audience was invited to attend all but the Academy's business meetings, reserved solely for members. The schedule would occupy the entire day. Reports were presented by the Academy's secretary and treasurer. During this time, new membership applications to the Academy were considered, as well as discussions on current business. In the evening, an annual address was delivered. For example, W.E.B. Du Bois presented the Academy's second annual address. A presentation of a paper would follow. The following day, after several paper presentations, discussions took place. Discussions centered around the efficacy of a scholar's musings. In order to distribute the works of various Academy members, copies were available upon requests made directly to the Academy's secretary, or through newspaper requests.

==Legacy and efficacy==
The ANA took its turn in the struggle for [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|equal rights for blacks]]. It was organized shortly after the United States Supreme Court had upheld the principle of "separate but equal" in the 1896 case, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]].'' 

Du Bois suggested that a [[Talented Tenth]] of African Americans, primarily composed of blacks trained in classical [[higher education]], could lead in educating masses of black citizens. Most of the latter would work in rural or unskilled jobs; in the South they suffered second-class status. Through a publication of works among the Academy's Occasional Papers, the group wanted to expand the reach of its scholarship, and to aid black intellectuals' efforts having influence on “his schools, academies and colleges; and then enters his pulpits; and so filters down into his families and his homes…to be a laborer with intelligence, enlightenment and manly ambitions”.&lt;ref&gt;Crummel, Alexander. "Papers of the American Negro Academy." Project Gutenberg. December 28, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have disputed the influence of the Academy. Dr. Alfred A. Moss Jr. argued for its efficacy in ''The American Negro Academy: Voice of the Talented Tenth''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Negro Academy: Voice of the Talented Tenth|last=Moss|first=Alfred A, Jr.|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=1981|isbn=0807106992|location=Baton Rouge|pages=180-181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his analysis of a collection of private letters written by Crummell, Moss explains that nearly from the beginning, the Academy was bound to become fully defunct. The organization was unable to consistently organize; it struggled to recruit new members, and to raise scholarship funds for educational uplift of more students. Moss claims that founding member [[Archibald Henry Grimké]] expressed in his writings an understanding of the difficulties and socio-economic hardships among African Americans, but that due to efforts to unseat [[Archibald Henry Grimké|Grimké]] as ANA president, he was more concerned with self-serving interests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For much of its history '''Norwegian art''' is usually considered as part of the wider [[Nordic art]] of [[Scandinavia]].  It has, especially since about 1100, been strongly influenced by wider trends in European art.  After World War II, the influence of the United States strengthened substantially. Due to generous art subsidies, contemporary Norwegian art has a high production per capita.

Though usually not especially a major centre for art production or exporter of art, Norway has been relatively successful in keeping its art; in particular, the relatively mild nature of the [[Norwegian Reformation]], and the lack of subsequent extensive rebuilding and redecoration of churches, has meant that with other Scandinavian countries, Norway has unusually rich survivals of medieval church paintings and fittings.  One period when Nordic art exerted a strong influence over the rest of northern Europe was in [[Viking art]], and there are many survivals, both in stone monuments left untouched around the countryside, and objects excavated in modern times.

The Reformation and the loss of a permanent royal court after the [[Kalmar Union]] of 1397 greatly disrupted Norwegian artistic traditions, and left the existing body of painters and sculptors without large markets. The requirements of the small aristocratic class were mainly for portraits, usually by imported artists, and it was not until the 19th century that significant numbers of Norwegians were trained in contemporary styles.  

Norwegian art came into its own in the 19th century, especially with the early landscape painters. Until that time, the art scene in Norway had been dominated by imports from Germany and Holland and by the influence of Danish rule. Initially with [[landscape painting]], later with [[Impressionism]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalprofiles.org.uk/norway/Directories/Norway_Cultural_Profile/-2885.html Painting from Norway Cultural Profile.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304022949/http://www.culturalprofiles.org.uk/norway/Directories/Norway_Cultural_Profile/-2885.html |date=2009-03-04 }} Retrieved 28 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though for the rest of the world [[Edvard Munch]] (1863–1944) is certainly Norway's great artistic figure, there have been many other significant figures.

==The beginnings==
[[File:A Tidemand-Haugianerne.jpg|thumb| [[Adolph Tidemand]]'s ''Haugianerne'' ([[Haugean]]s). 1852]]

[[Johan Christian Dahl]] (1788–1857) is often said to be the "father of Norwegian landscape painting". After a period in [[Copenhagen]], he joined the [[Dresden]] school to which he made an important contribution. He eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time.&lt;ref name="HFG"&gt;{{cite book | last = Haverkamp | first = Frode | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | others = trans. Joan Fuglesang | title = Hans Fredrik Gude: From National Romanticism to Realism in Landscape | accessdate = 2008-01-07 | language = Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important early contributor was [[Johannes Flintoe]] (1787–1870), a [[Denmark|Danish]]-[[Norway|Norwegian]] painter, known for his Norwegian landscapes and paintings of [[Bunad|folk costumes]]. He taught at the School of Drawing (''Tegneskolen'') in [[Oslo|Christiania]] from 1819 to 1851 where his students included budding romanticists such as [[Hans Gude]] and Johan F. Eckersberg.&lt;ref name="HFG"/&gt;

[[Adolph Tidemand]] (1814–1876) studied in  [[Copenhagen]], in [[Italy]] and finally in [[Düsseldorf]] where he settled. He often returned to Norway where he painted the old [[Norwegian farm culture]]. His best known painting is ''The bridal procession in Hardanger'' (together with Hans Gude, 1848) and ''Haugianerne'' (''[[Haugean]]s'') painted in 1852.

Norway’s new-found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as [[Kitty Kielland]], 1843–1914, an early female painter who studied under Gude and  [[Harriet Backer]], 1845–1932, another pioneer among female artists, influenced by impressionism.

==Impressionists and neo-romanticists==
[[Image:Christian Krohg-Albertine i politilægens venteværelse.jpg|thumb|[[Christian Krohg]], ''[[Albertine i politilægens venteværelse]]'' (Albertine at the Police Doctor's Waiting Room, 1885&amp;ndash;87)]]
[[Frits Thaulow]], 1847–1906, an impressionist, was initially a student of Hans Gude. He was later influenced by the art scene in [[Paris]] where he developed impressionist talents. Returning to Norway in 1880, he became one of the leading figures on the Norwegian art scene, together with [[Christian Krohg]] and [[Erik Werenskiold]].

[[Christian Krohg]], 1852–1925, a realist painter, was also influenced by the Paris scene. He is remembered for his paintings of prostitutes which caused something of a scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/nationalities/Norwegian.html Norwegian Artists from ArtCyclopedia]. Retrieved 25 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thorolf Holmboe]] (1866–1935) studied under [[Hans Gude]] in [[Berlin]] between 1886 and 1887 and [[Fernand Cormon]] in [[Paris]] between 1889 and 1891. He was inspired by many different styles at different points in his career, including [[naturalism (art)|Naturalism]], [[Neo-romanticism]], [[realism (art)|Realism]] and [[impressionism (art)|Impressionism]].

[[Nikolai Astrup]] (1880–1928) grew up in [[Jølster]] in the west of Norway. After studying art in [[Oslo]] and spending some time in [[Paris]] and in [[Germany]], he returned to Jølster where he specialised in painting expressionist landscapes with clear, strong colors. He is considered to be one of the greatest [[Norway|Norwegian]] artists from the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikolai-astrup.com/ Nikolai Astrup from nikolai-astrup.com.] Retrieved 28 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lars Hertervig]] (1830–1902) from  [[Tysvær]] in south-western Norway painted semi-fantastical works inspired by the coastal landscape in [[Ryfylke]]. Hertervig completed a number of works on paper using aquarelles and often making the paper base himself from scrapes of discarded pieces of paper. The art museum under the main museum, [[Stavanger Museum]], in Stavanger, Rogaland (previously [[Rogaland Museum of Fine Art]]) has the most significant collection of works by Hertervig in Norway. 

[[Harald Sohlberg]], (1869–1935), a neo-romanticist, is remembered for his paintings of [[Røros]], and the Norwegian "national painting" ''Winter's Night in Rondane''.

==Edvard Munch==
Norway's most famous artist is certainly [[Edvard Munch]] (1863–1944), a [[symbolist]]/[[expressionist]] who became world-famous for ''[[The Scream]]'', one of the most recognizable paintings in all art. It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man.&lt;ref&gt;Eggum, 1984, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names ==
[[File:Gunnar Berg Fra Svolvær havn.jpg|thumb|[[Gunnar Berg (painter)|Gunnar Berg]]'s ''From [[Svolvær]] harbour'', c. 1890. Being one of "the young dead", Berg is considered one of the finest painters of northern Norwegian nature.]]

'''''Nude''''' ([[1910 in art|1910]], {{lang-fr|Nu}}, {{lang-sr|Купачица}} / ''Kupačica'') is a [[painting]] by [[France|French]] [[impressionism|impressionist]] [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. It is [[oil on canvas]], and was painted in 1910. The painting is currently housed in the [[National Museum of Serbia]] in [[Belgrade]]. The painting was given to the Serbian people by [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia]].

== History ==

The painting was purchased in Paris in 1935 by [[Milan Kašanin]], contemporary director of the National Museum. It was paid for by joint contributions from the Museum, the Ministry of Culture and private donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Otvaranje Narodnog muzeja na "Blic" ZANOSNA RENOAROVA KUPAČICA|url=http://www.blic.rs/kultura/vesti/otvaranje-narodnog-muzeja-na-blic-zanosna-renoarova-kupacica/4tw0rgy|accessdate=1 October 2016|agency=Blic|publisher=Blic|date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was stolen in 1996 by an amateur [[Romani people|Roma]] thief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politika.rs/ilustro/2306/3.htm Zagonetka Renoarove slike] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the theft it was badly damaged and was recovered in poor condition, requiring a year of restoration. After the Renoir was stolen, the entire foreign art collection was moved to the museum warehouse to protect the collection until a better security system could be installed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arhiva.srbija.gov.rs/vesti/2004-04/08/345192.html Zatvorena izložba "Impresivno" u Narodnom muzeju u Beogradu] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Massa marittima, fonte e palazzo dell'abbondanza, albero della fecondità, 1265 circa 03.JPG|thumb|Phallus tree in the Fertility Fresco at [[Massa Marittima]], circa 1265]]

The '''phallus tree''' was an art motif common in [[Western Europe]] during the late [[Middle Ages]] and the beginning of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Phallus Tree: A Medieval and Renaissance Phenomenon'', Johan J. Mattelaer, MD, 14 January 2010, {{DOI|10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01668.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its concrete significance is hazy, but it appeared in bronze, illuminated manuscript, and paint; it manifested as bawdy humour, religious parody, political comment. The Tuscan Massa Marittima mural, featuring oversized phalluses, some erect, complete with testes, was [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] propaganda warning that if the [[Ghibellines]] were allowed to take control, they would bring with them sexual perversion and witchcraft.

'''Pierre-Antoine Poiteau''' (23 March 1766 [[Âmbleny]] – 27 February 1854) was a French [[botanist]], [[gardener]] and botanical artist.&lt;ref&gt;http://ctgpublishing.com/pierre-antoine-poiteau-biography/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

He was born in [[Ambleny]], [[France]].  After having worked in kitchen gardens and for the Parisian market gardeners, he was appointed by [[André Thouin]] (1746-1824) ''garçon jardinier'' in 1790 at the [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]] of [[Paris]].  There he studied the [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' ''Systema vegetabilium'' and the art of painting with the artist of the museum [[Gérard van Spaendonck]] (1746-1822) but his main influence is [[Redouté]] (1759-1840). Thouin named him, two years later, head of the Botanical school of Paris, but in 1793, Daubenton chose him to establish a botanic school and garden in Bergerac. This project failed and in 1796 Thouin offered Poiteau to go to [[Santo Domingo]]. He was arrested as soon as he landed because he did not have official papers to justify his presence. Soon afterwards he was in [[Haiti]], at the head of the new botanical garden of Cape. Receiving no wages, he had to join the administration as an assistant to Hédouville and Roume, the governors of the island. In 1802, he brought back to France six hundred packets of seeds and 1,200 species, all named and classified by him. Among them were 97 species of mushrooms and 30 species of lichens. He published, in Paris in 1808 with [[Pierre Jean François Turpin]] (1775-1840) whom he met in Haiti, ''Flora Parisiensis secundum systema sexuale deposita et plantarum circa Lutetiam sponte nascentium descriptiones, icones....''

After some years of free literary activities, he was appointed in 1815 head of the Royal tree nursery of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. In 1816, he published a description of the plants cultivated in the botanical garden of the School of medicine of Paris. Two years later, with [[Antoine Risso]] (1777-1845), he published ''Histoire naturelle des orangers'' (Natural history of the orange trees).

In 1818, Poiteau went to [[French Guiana]] where he supervised the cultures of the plantations of the royal houses. Back in France in 1822, he was appointed head gardener of the castle of [[Fontainebleau]]. From 1829 to 1851 he directed the ''Revue horticole'' (Horticultural review). In 1835, with Pierre-Jean-François Turpin, he published a new edition of the ''Traité des arbres fruitiers'' (Treatise of the fruit trees) by [[Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau]] (1700-1782) and, in 1846, ''Pomologie française. Recueil des plus beaux fruits cultivés en France...'' (French pomology). In 1848 and 1853 the two volumes of his ''Cours d'horticulture'' (Lessons of horticulture) were published. A member of many scientific societies, Poiteau later became head of the museum of natural history, to which he offered all the animals and plants he had brought back from Guiana. Poiteau discovered numerous species of plants and animals, he even created some families (''cyclanthae'', for example). As a gardener and a pomologist, he much contributed to the amelioration of the edible fruits. As an artist, he is appreciated and his colored lithographs are sought-after by amateurs. On this ground, he is often compared to [[Pierre-Joseph Redouté]].
He died in [[Paris]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10727">[[Image:Pierre Lévy.jpg|250px|thumb|Pierre Lévy]]
'''Pierre Lévy''' ({{IPA-fr|levi|lang}}; born 1956 in [[Tunis]]) is a [[French people|French]] philosopher, [[Culture theory|cultural theorist]] and [[media scholar]] who specializes in the understanding of the cultural and cognitive implications of digital technologies and the phenomenon of human collective intelligence.

He introduced the [[collective intelligence]] concept in his 1994 book ''L'intelligence collective: Pour une anthropologie du cyberspace'' (''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace'').&lt;ref&gt;L'intelligence collective. Pour une anthropologie du cyberspace, Paris, La Découverte, 1994 ({{ISBN|2-7071-2693-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Lévy's 1995 book, ''Qu'est-ce que le virtuel?'' (translated as ''Becoming Virtual: Reality in the Digital Age'') develops philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]]'s conception of "the virtual" as a dimension of reality that subsists with the actual but is irreducible to it. In 2001, he wrote the  book ''Cyberculture''.

Pierre Lévy currently teaches at the communication department of the [[University of Ottawa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article13 |title=ieml |publisher=ieml |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032913/http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article13 |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he holds a Canada Research Chair in Collective Intelligence. Lévy is fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] and received several awards and academic distinctions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Life and work==
Pierre Lévy is one of the major philosophers working on the implications of [[cyberspace]] and digital communications. Lévy has written a dozen of books that have been translated in more than 12 languages and are studied in many universities all over the world. His principal work, published in French in 1994 and translated into English, is entitled ''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace''.&lt;ref&gt;''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace'' {{ISBN|0-7382-0261-4}} Perseus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1990 Lévy published a book about the merging of digital networks and [[Hypertext|hypertextual]] communication. Levy's theory of knowledge spaces and the cosmopedia foreshadowed the emergence of Wikipedia and anticipates [[wikinomics]], and the efficacy of shared distributed knowledge systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Pierre|title=Collective Intelligence|year=1997|publisher=Plenium Trade|location=New York and London|isbn=0306456354|pages=215–220|quote=.  In the fourth space, "the subject of knowledge is shaped by its encyclopedia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to 1998 Lévy was Professor at the [[University of Paris VIII: Vincennes—Saint-Denis|University of Paris VIII]], where he studied the concept of collective intelligence and knowledge-based societies. He has contributed to many scholarly discourses about [[cyberculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cochran|first=Terry|title=Thinking at the Edge of the Galaxy: Pierre Levy's World Projection|journal=Boundary|year=1999|volume=2|series=26|issue=3|pages=63–85|url=http://muse.jhu.edu.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/journals/boundary/v026/26.3cochran.html|accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the editorial board of the ''[[Revue virtuelle]]'' project of the [[Pompidou Center]] in Paris from 1995 to 1997 and was the author of a report on cyberculture for the Council of Europe in 1996.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In the chapter [[Interactivity]] from his book ''Cyberculture'' (2001), Lévy argues that analogue communication (telephone, mail) differs from digital communication (email, chat) in terms of temporal organization and material involvement of their communication systems. He claims that [[interactivity]] is a vague term that "has more to do with finding the solution to a problem, the need to develop new ways to observe, design, and evaluate methods of communication, than it does with identifying a simple, unique characteristic that can be assigned to a given system".&lt;ref&gt;Lévy, Pierre. "Cyberculture". Univ. of Minnesota Press. 2001, p. 228. ({{ISBN|0816636109}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Jenkins]], among others, cites him as an important influence on theories of online collective intelligence.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In ''Becoming Virtual: Reality in the Digital Age'' Lévy explores the way we virtualise every aspect of our lives, from [[real time (media)]] interaction through language, to our actions through technology, and our social relations through institutions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} And in each case the mechanism is the same: we create some artifact, more or less material, which allows us to shift what's at stake away from the immediate here-and-now and towards a problematic where new possibilities open up.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Current project==
Lévy's current project focuses on the development of an [[Information Economy MetaLanguage]] (IEML) for the purposes of improving knowledge management as part of his works on the design of a universal system for [[semantic]] addressing of digital documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article9&amp;lang=en |title=ieml |publisher=ieml |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032920/http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article9&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Álvaro |first=Sandra |url=http://blogs.cccb.org/lab/en/article_ieml-projecte-per-a-un-nou-humanisme-entrevista-a-pierre-levy/ |title=IEML: A PROJECT FOR A NEW HUMANISM.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9485">[[Image:Codex Sangallensis 1092 recto.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Plan of Saint Gall. Reichenau, early 9th century.]]
The '''Plan of Saint Gall''' is a famous [[medieval]] [[architectural drawing]] of a [[Christian monasticism|monastic]] compound dating from the early 9th century. It is preserved in the [[Abbey library of Saint Gall|Stiftsbibliothek Sankt Gallen]], Ms 1092. 

It is the only surviving major architectural drawing from the roughly 700-year period between the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] and the 13th century. It is considered a [[national treasure]] of [[Switzerland]] and remains an object of intense interest among modern scholars, architects, artists and draftsmen for its uniqueness, its beauty, and the insights it provides into medieval culture.

==Overview==
The Plan depicts an entire [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monastic compound including churches, houses, stables, kitchens, workshops, brewery, infirmary, and even a special house for [[bloodletting]]. The Plan was never actually built, and was so named because it was kept at the famous medieval monastery library of the [[Abbey of St. Gall]], where it remains to this day. It was drawn in a [[scriptorium]] in [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]] in the third decade of the 9th century, dedicated to [[Gozbert de Saint-Gall|Abbot Gozbert]] (816–836) of [[Abbey of St. Gall|Saint Gall]].

The Plan was created from five [[parchment]]s sewn together measuring 45 inches by 31 inches (113&amp;nbsp;cm by 78&amp;nbsp;cm) and drawn in red ink lines for the buildings, and brown ink for lettered inscriptions. It is drawn to an "unusual" scale of 1:192 (although as explained in detail in "The Plan of St. Gall in brief" by Lorna Price, this is 1/16" to the foot, which would not be so surprising as necessary to place the overall plan onto this size piece of parchment). The reverse of the Plan was inscribed in the 12th century, after it had been folded into book form, with the ''[[Life of Saint Martin]]'' by [[Sulpicius Severus]]. About 350 partly rhyming appendices in the handwritings of two different scribes describe the functions of the buildings. The dedication to Abbot Gozbert is written in the margin.
[[Image:St gall plan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A copy of the plan]]
Because the plan does not correspond to any place that was actually built,&lt;ref&gt;The abbey church of the medieval period has been excavated in 1964–66, but its form does not reflect that on the plan. Excavations were reported in Horn, ''The Plan of St. Gall'', vol. 2, pp. 256–359.&lt;/ref&gt; just about every aspect of the Plan is disputed by modern scholars. Debates continue on things such as which system of measurement was used; whether the scale is a single scale for the entire plan or varied for different elements; if the plan is a copy from a lost prototype or the original; if it is reflective of a single individual's ideas, or those of monastic council. 

Despite the unknowns, much has been learned about medieval life from the Plan. The absence of heating in the dining hall, for instance, may not have been an oversight but was meant to discourage excessive enjoyment of meals. In the quarters for the 120–150 monks, their guests, and visitors, the ratio of [[toilet seat]]s was better than what modern hygienic codes would prescribe.

===The Dedication===
The plan was dedicated to Gozbertus, the Abbot of St Gall from 816–36. The text reads [as translated by Horn into English]&lt;blockquote&gt;For thee, my sweetest son Gozbertus, have I drawn this briefly annotated copy of the layout of the monastic buildings, with which you may exercise your ingenuity and recognize my devotion, whereby I trust you do not find me slow to satisfy your wishes. Do not imagine that I have undertaken this task supposing you to stand in need of our instruction, but rather believe that out of love of God and in the friendly zeal of brotherhood I have depicted this for you alone to scrutinise. Farewell in Christ, always mindful of us, Amen.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, ''Plan of St. Gall'', vol. 3, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Latin reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;Haec tibi dulcissime fili cozb(er)te de posicione officinarum paucis examplata direxi, quibus sollertiam exerceas tuam, meamq(ue) devotione(m) utcumq(ue) cognoscas, qua tuae bonae voluntari satisfacere me segnem non inveniri confido. Ne suspiceris autem me haic ideo elaborasse, quod vos putemus n(ost)ris indigere magisteriis, sed potius ob amore(m) dei tibi soli p(er) scrutinanda pinxisse amicabili fr(ater)nitatis intuitu crede. Vale in Chr(ist)o semp(er) memor n(ost)ri ame(n).&lt;ref&gt;Charles McClendon, The Origins of Medieval Architecture (London, 2005), p. 232, n. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Horn and Born===
[[Walter Horn]] and [[Ernest Born]] in 1979 published a 3-volume ''The Plan of St. Gall'' (Berkeley, Calif., University of California Press), which is widely considered to be the definitive work in English. A single-volume condensed edition was published in 1982 as ''The Plan of St. Gall - In Brief''.

According to Horn, the Plan was a copy of an original blueprint of an ideal monastery created at two [[Carolingian]] reform [[synod]]s held at [[Aachen]] in 816 and 817. The purpose of the synods was to establish Benedictine monasteries throughout the Carolingian Empire as a bulwark against encroaching Christian monastic missionaries from Britain and Ireland who were bringing Celtic lifestyle influences to the Continent (see [[Celtic art]]).

===Umberto Eco===
According to Earl Anderson ([[Cleveland State University]]), it is likely that [[Umberto Eco]] references the Plan in his novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'':

*"perhaps larger but less well proportioned" (p.&amp;nbsp;26): Adso (a character in the book) mentions actual monasteries that he had seen in Switzerland and France (St. Gall, Cluny, Fontenay), but the standard of "proportion" most likely alludes to the Carolingian (9th century) "Plan of St. Gall," which sets forth an architectural plan for an ideal monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csuohio.edu/english/earl/nr27.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404052144/http://www.csuohio.edu/english/earl/nr27.html |date=April 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Models===
The Plan has a tradition of model making. In 1965 Ernest Born and others created a scale model of the Plan for the ''Age of Charlemagne'' exhibition in [[Aachen]], Germany. This became the inspiration for the 1979 book, but was also the first in a tradition of modeling the plan. More recently the Plan has been modeled on computers using [[CAD software]].

===Campus Galli===
{{Main|Campus Galli}}
Campus Galli is a [[Carolingian]] [[monastic community]] under construction in [[Meßkirch]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]. The construction project includes plans to build a medieval monastery according to the early ninth-century Plan of Saint Gall using techniques from that era. The long-term financing of the project is to come from revenue generated from the site's operation as a tourist attraction. The construction site has been open for visitors since June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Campus Galli - karolingische Klosterstadt Meßkirch [http://www.campus-galli.de/ "Herzlich willkommen bei Campus Galli - karolingische Klosterstadt"] (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

===St. Gall Project===
The St. Gall Project was founded to produce a digital online presence for the Plan including models and an extensive online database on early medieval monastic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stgallplan.org |title=Codex Sangallensis 1902 |publisher=Stgallplan.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is directed by [[Patrick Geary]] ([[UCLA]]) and [[Bernard Frischer]] ([[University of Virginia]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frischerconsulting.com/frischer Bernard Frischer], official website.&lt;/ref&gt; with funding from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]. The website was released to the public in December 2007. Future resources will include intellectual and textual aspects of the Plan and monasticism; space for publication of new papers and research, lesson plans and teaching aides, blogs and chat rooms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3836">'''Post-romanticism''' or '''Postromanticism''' refers to a range of cultural endeavors and attitudes emerging in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, after the period of [[Romanticism]].

[[Herman Melville]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]] are post-Romantic writers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Milder, ''Exiled Royalties: Melville and the Life We Imagine'', New York: Oxford University Press US, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;41. {{ISBN|0-19-514232-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flaubert]]'s ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' is a post-Romantic novel.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Heath, ''Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary'', Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;13. {{ISBN|0-521-31483-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The period of post-romanticism in poetry is defined as the late nineteenth century, but includes the poetry of [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]&lt;ref&gt;Sybille Baumback and others, "A History of British Poetry", Trier: WVT. {{ISBN|978-3-86821-578-6}}. Section 19: Poetic Genres in the Victorian Age I: Letitia Elizabeth Landon’s and Alfred Lord Tennyson’s Post-Romantic Verse Narratives by Anne-Julia Zwierlein.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bradford, ''A Linguistic History of English Poetry'', New York: Routledge, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;134. {{ISBN|0-415-07057-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Romanticism in music ==
Post-romanticism in [[music]] referred to [[romantic music|Romantic]] composers who would use [[musical form|forms]] that were found typically in the [[Classical music|Classical]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] while still retaining aspects of the Romantic era. Among the most well known post-Romantic composers are [[Puccini|Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Sergei Rachmaninov]]. [[Arthur Berger (composer)|Arthur Berger]]&lt;!--in an interview with Virgil Thomson--&gt; describes the mysticism of [[La Jeune France]] as post-Romanticism rather than [[Neoromanticism (music)|neo-Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Virgil Thomson,. ''Virgil Thomson: A Reader: Selected Writings, 1924-1984'', edited by Richard Kostelanetz, New York: Routledge, 2002p.&amp;nbsp;268. {{ISBN|0-415-93795-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Pfitzner]] also wrote post-Romantic works such as his opera ''Palestrina''.

Quite unlike Late Romantic composers such as [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Alexander Scriabin]], the composers of the Post-Romantic created music that would use either or both traditional form and [[harmony]]. [[Béla Bartók]], for example, "in such Strauss-influenced works as ''[[Duke Bluebeard's Castle]]''," may be described as having still used "[[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] ['such intervals as fourths and sevenths'] for purposes of post-Romantic expression, not simply [always] as an appeal to the primal art of sound"—unlike [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and Strauss himself, who both believed in "a mythology of historical progress in Western music".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright,. ''Modernism and Music: An Anthology of Sources'',  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004pp.&amp;nbsp;243-44. {{ISBN|0-226-01267-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Reverse Television'' is a series of forty-four video portraits made by [[United States|American]] [[video artist]] [[Bill Viola]] in 1983, originally produced for [[broadcast television]] and later documented as a 15-minute video. These portraits depict people throughout [[Boston]] sitting in their living rooms, silently staring at the video camera as though it were a TV set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eai.org/title.htm?id=701|title=Reverse Television -- Portraits of Viewers (Compilation Tape)|website=Electronic Arts Intermix}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portraits were meant to take fit into the space normally occupied by television commercials and as such to "interrupt the continuity of the undifferentiated flow of the television picture, giving viewers the possibility of pondering their own position facing the screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moisdon|first1=Stéphanie|title=Reverse Television - Portraits of Viewers|url=http://www.newmedia-art.org/cgi-bin/show-oeu.asp?ID=150000000034594&amp;lg=GBR|website=New Media Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

"Reverse Television" was first broadcast by [[WGBH-TV]] 
In an interview with [[Raymond Bellour]], Bill Viola describes the compromises he had to negotiate through in the making and initial distribution of "Reverse Television."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellour|first1=Raymond|title=An Interview with Bill Viola|journal=T|date=Autumn 1985|volume=34|pages=91–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Viola wanted the video portraits to be presented once every hour for a two-week period in one-minute segments with "no label, no title, or anything" attached to them. Viola claims that such a long duration as well as an absence of identifying information was crucial to the piece, since the work was meant to be a disruption of the normal viewing experience of television.

WGBH-TV, wishing to keep broadcasting costs low, wanted to show the portraits in fifteen-second segments. The station also refused to broadcast the videos without a title, requesting that Viola include a full description of the piece at the beginning of each clip. In a confrontation with the station director, Viola ultimately agreed to show the clips in thirty second segments with text at the end of each clip stating his name and the date.

== Video Summary ==

The 1984 documentation of the project begins with text describing the project:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GrIN9m83zw|title=reverse television.mov|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;REVERSE TELEVISION is a project for broadcast television. A series of portrait recordings were made of people sitting in their homes, staring in silence at the camera.

Forty four portraits were made in the Boston area with subjects ranging in age from 16 to 93 years old. Ten continuous minutes were recorded with each person. An unbroken 1 minute segment of this material was to be broadcast.

The portraits would be shown each hour of the broadcast day as image inserts between programs. They would appear unannounced, with no titles before or after, and the series would run for several weeks.

WGBH TV Boston presented REVERSE TELEVISION from NOV. 14-28, 1983. They chose to air the portraits for 30 seconds each, showing them 5 times a day.

The following is a series of 15 second excerpts from all of the portraits. They are presented in the order they were recorded and represent a documentation of this project.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Rokushō'''|緑青}} is a traditional [[Japan|Japanese]] chemical compound used in the [[niiro]] process for artificially inducing [[patina|patination]] in decorative non-ferrous metals, especially several copper alloys, with the results being metals of the [[irogane]] class.  These "colour metals," virtually unknown outside [[Japan]] until the late 19th century, have achieved some popularity in craft circles in other parts of the world since then.

==Usage==
Rokushō is used to treat a number of metals, including raw natural copper, which holds impurities, purified copper, and copper alloy mixes with two to five metals, to produce irogane metals, including: [[shakudō]], an alloy of copper and gold, which becomes black to dark blue-violet; [[shibuichi]], an alloy of fine silver and copper (in a higher percentage than sterling), which turns grey to misty [[Aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]] or other shades of blue to green; [[kuromido]] which becomes dark coppery black.  

Rokushō was generally used to patinate all types of [[mokume-gane]] ("wood grain metal") as well. 

Although other patination agents can be used on these metals, some artisans prefer the rich colors achieved with traditional rokushō in the niiro process.

These metals are becoming increasingly popular in high-end artistic jewelry, especially in bi-metals (a layer of the alloy fused to another metal such as sterling).  Because rokushō has a dramatically different effect on sterling silver than on the alloys typically fused to it in bi-metals, a common technique in art jewelry is to engrave through the alloy layer in a pattern to reveal the silver underneath prior to patination.  This provides a rich contrast in color, highlighting the pattern.

==Formulation==
The formulae for rokushō are not published widely or freely, but passed on in the Japanese craft tradition.  However, some scholars have analysed samples of the material.  

Premixed rokushō can be purchased outside Japan through specialty jewelry suppliers. Additionally, several different formulas have been proposed to replicate the traditional product for those who prefer to make their own:

* In a container made of glass, porcelain, or copper, dissolve 6g copper acetate, 2g calcium carbonate, and 2g sodium hydroxide in 150ml water. After a week, siphon or decant the clear liquid from the top; just before use, add another 2g copper sulfate.{{clarify|reason=1) text says "add another 2g copper sulfate", but this is the first instance of copper sulfate in the recipe, 2) calcium carbonate is not soluble in water|date=June 2015}}
* Dissolve 4g [[copper acetate]], 1g [[copper nitrate]], 1g [[cupric chloride]], and 4g [[copper sulfate]] in 1 liter of distilled water.
* Dissolve 60g copper acetate and 60g copper sulfate in a 2 liter solution of white vinegar diluted 5-12% with water.

Rokusho is not used alone, but mixed with one or more other chemicals.  Further, metal to be processed is cleaned in advance of treatment, using a mild acid bath (oxalic or sulfuric acids are frequently used), scrubbing with [[daikon radish]] or pumice, and / or a surface abrasive, and often treated after patination also.

A '''shyrdak''' ({{lang-ky|шырдак}}, {{IPA-ky|ʃɯrˈdɑq|pron}}) or '''syrmak''' ({{lang-kk|сырмақ|translit=syrmaq}}, {{IPA-kk|sərˈmɑq|pron}}) is a stitched, and often colourful [[felt]]&lt;ref name="FergusJandosova2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergus|first1=Michael|last2=Jandosova|first2=Janar|title=Kazakhstan: Coming of Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAu9ttUqiJoC&amp;pg=PA213|year=2003|publisher=Stacey International|isbn=978-1-900988-61-2|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; floor-covering, usually handmade in [[Central Asia]].  [[Kazakhs]] and [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] alike traditionally make shyrdaks, but especially in [[Kyrgyzstan]], the tradition is still alive, and many of the products are sold to [[tourists]].

==Design==
[[File:Kyrgyz Republic Felt Rugs - Stierch.jpg|thumb|Steps in the process of making a shyrdak]]
It takes the wool from approximately five sheep to make one shyrdak rug.  The process is slow and labour-intensive. Traditionally shyrdak rugs have been made by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeology, Ethnology &amp; Anthropology of Eurasia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaoXAQAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography SB RAS Press|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once collected the wool is picked clean washed, dried then dyed. The Shyrdak is usually designed in an inlaid patchwork highly contrasting colours&lt;ref name="BloomBlair2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Jonathan|last2=Blair|first2=Sheila|title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture: Three-Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA377|date=14 May 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as red and green, yellow and black, brown and white. Once the wool is dried a brightly coloured pattern is laid on to a plain background this is then soaked with soap and water rolled up and literally pressed this process is repeated.

Once the pattern starts to hold, the rug is reversed soaked and rolled again after some hours the shyrdak rug is left to dry. Two contrasting layers of felt are the laid on top of one another and a pattern is then marked on the top layer in chalk.&lt;ref name="Turnau1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turnau|first=Irena|title=Hand-Felting in Europe and Asia: From the Middle Ages to the 20th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMofAQAAIAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Institute of the Archaeology and Ethnology Polish Academy of Sciences|isbn=978-83-85463-52-8|pages=80–2, 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is painstakingly and laboriously cut out with the felt maker frequently sharpening the knife which will blunt quickly.

This creates a stunning positive/negative style visual image usually full of symbolic motif images that represent things around them i.e. the water, goat horns, a yurt etc. Representations of sheep and shepherds are particularly common in Kazkahstan.&lt;ref name="Turnau1997" /&gt; The felt that is cut from the top layer is not wasted and is used to create another mirror image shyrdak with the reverse colours of the original shyrdak.

The '''South African National Youth Orchestra Foundation''' is a [[non-profit organisation]] in the [[music education]] and development sector. The Foundation supports the training and development of [[South Africa|South Africa’s]] young musicians through national courses, national and international tours and workshops, and networks nationally and internationally. It also assists regional [[youth orchestra]] and music education programmes countrywide. It organises youth [[orchestra]] courses, where the South African National Youth Orchestras are formed. This has included the South African National Youth Orchestra, South African National Concert Orchestra, the South African National Wind Orchestra, the South African National Youth Baroque Orchestra, South African National Youth Brass and the South African National Youth String Orchestra. Members of these orchestras are under the age of 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sanyo.org.za/about-us/mission-and-vision/ | title=South African National Youth Orchestra - Mission and Vision | date=4 March 2009 | accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Foundation==
[[File:Sanyologo.jpg]]

[[Sasol]] was the main sponsor from 1979-2014 when the Foundation was formed to look after the South African National Youth Orchestra (formed in 1964).  The Foundation has also been supported by [[De Beers]], [[Anton Rupert|Rupert]] Musiekstigting, Adcock-Ingram, [[Southern African Music Rights Organisation]] (SAMRO), Blackie and Associates, Primedia (1998 tour), AECI, and Business &amp; Arts South Africa over a number of years. SANYOF has a management team and is assisted by a large network of volunteers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sanyo.org.za/about-us/ | title=South African National Youth Orchestra Foundation | date=4 March 2009 | accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation is a cooperating member of the [[European Federation of National Youth Orchestras]] (EFNYO).

==Courses==
The orchestra courses are held every year during the school holidays, in a different city in South Africa. Courses have been presented in [[Bloemfontein]], [[Durban]], [[Cape Town]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Port Elizabeth]], [[Pretoria]], [[Potchefstroom]], [[Hartbeespoort]] and [[Stellenbosch]]. Repertoire includes a wide variety of works by [[Baroque music|baroque]], [[Romanticism|romantic]], [[20th-century music|20th century]] and contemporary composers, with an emphasis on performing works by South African composers. This course has also been known as an opportunity to participate in [[chamber music]], socialise and establish friendships.

==History==
The course first started as a holiday music camp at [[Hartbeespoort Dam]] in 1964, with 87 participants, organised by the South African Society of Music Teachers (SASMT). The early pioneers included Korie Koornhof, Arthur Wegelin, Paul Loeb van Zuilenburg, Diane Heller and Betty Pack together with the first conductor, Leo Quayle.

The seeds those early pioneers sowed quickly took root and in 1975 the SA National Youth Orchestra took part in the International Festival of Youth Orchestras in [[Aberdeen]], followed by a short tour of Europe three years later. In 1979, Sasol came on board as a founding partner of the National Youth Orchestra Foundation to provide infrastructure and organisational skills. Sasol remains a committed partner to this day, providing sponsorship for the annual youth orchestra course and its development initiatives.

[[Image:Parrish-911-detail.jpg|thumb|''The Cycle of Terror and Tragedy'' (detail) by Graydon Parrish]]
'''''The Cycle of Terror and Tragedy''''' is a painting by [[Graydon Parrish]].

==History==
In 2002, Douglas Hyland, the director of the [[New Britain Museum of American Art]], approached [[Graydon Parrish]] to create an allegorical tribute to the [[September 11 attacks]]. The completed painting, ''The Cycle of Terror and Tragedy'', is over 18 feet long and is one of the largest realist paintings ever created in America. Today it hangs in the Chase Wing of the New Britain Museum of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbmaa.wordpress.com/2010/09/10/collection-highlights-the-cycle-of-terror-and-tragedy-september-11-2001/|title=The Cycle of Terror and Tragedy: September 11, 2001|work=New Britain Museum of American Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nbmaa.wordpress.com/2010/02/11/collection-highlights-the-cycle-of-terror-and-tragedy-september-11-2001/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427042250/http://nbmaa.wordpress.com/2010/02/11/collection-highlights-the-cycle-of-terror-and-tragedy-september-11-2001/ |archivedate=2010-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The painting has been noted for its [[Academic art|academic style]], inspired both by [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|William Bouguereau]], and for its highly symbolic content, said to express the cycle of denial and tragedy.  It has been compared and contrasted with [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' and [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', both comments on [[Disaster|catastrophes]]. A review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' summarized that "Mr. Parrish has a fine arsenal of talent and ideas, but this particular work comes off as overly staged, showy and annoyingly melodramatic, the clichéd pomp and classical symbolism drowning out a gentler, more compassionate spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/18ctarts.html?ex=1179201600&amp;en=16a99e55f8182ad2&amp;ei=5070 |first=Benjamin |last=Genocchio|authorlink=Benjamin Genocchio|title= The Tragedy of 9/11, on a Long Sheet of Canvas|newspaper=New York Times|date= 18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Panero]], writing in ''[[The New Criterion]]'', believed "The cycle of terror and tragedy: September 11, 2001," is a pretty good painting that manages to be monumentally terrible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/posts.cfm/graydon-parrishs-cycle-of-terror-4351|title=Graydon Parrish&amp;rsquo;s &amp;rsquo;Cycle of Terror&amp;rsquo; by James Panero - The New Criterion|work=newcriterion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Aimee Pozorski wrote that "In fact, it is true that what Parrish has created is a lovely and symmetrical allegory: The twin bodies--strong, virile, and painted as if part of a [[Botticelli]] painting--are also allegories for the virile twin towers about to fall. The children holding planes represent the loss of innocence of an entire nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwmSBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=graydon+parrish+9/11&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y7LC_oyABx&amp;sig=BRwJbbrenP_NtzuN6tVEasHp5nE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XW_iVIzbI8TBggSo9oC4DQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=graydon%20parrish%209%2F11&amp;f=false|title=Falling After 9/11|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Vasnetsov Frog Princess.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Viktor Vasnetsov]], ''The Frog Tsarevna'', 1918.]]

'''The Frog Princess''' is a [[fairy tale]] that has multiple versions with various origins. It is classified as type 402, the animal bride, in the [[Aarne–Thompson|Aarne–Thompson index]].&lt;ref&gt;Georgias A. Megas, ''Folktales of Greece'', p 224, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Another tale of this type is ''[[Doll i' the Grass]]''.&lt;ref name="ashliman"&gt;D. L. Ashliman, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0402.html Animal Brides: folktales of Aarne–Thompson type 402 and related stories]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian language|Russian]] variants include the ''Frog Princess'' or ''[[Tsarevna]] Frog'' (''Царевна Лягушка'', ''Tsarevna Lyagushka'')&lt;ref&gt;{{wikisource-inline|Russian Wonder Tales/The Frog-Tzarevna|The Frog-Tzarevna}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also '''Vasilisa the Wise''' (''Василиса Премудрая'', ''Vasilisa Premudraya''); [[Alexander Afanasyev]] collected variants in his ''[[Narodnye russkie skazki]]''. [[Andrew Lang]] included an Italian variant titled '''The Frog''' in ''[[The Violet Fairy Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Violet Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/055.htm "The Frog"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italo Calvino]] included another Italian variant from Piedmont, '''The Prince Who Married a Frog''', in ''[[Italian Folktales]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, Italian Folktales p 438 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he noted that the tale was common throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, Italian Folktales p 718 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgios A. Megas included a Greek variant, '''The Enchanted Lake''', in ''Folktales of Greece''.&lt;ref&gt;Georgias A. Megas, ''Folktales of Greece'', p 49, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The [[Monarch|king]] (or an old peasant woman, in Lang's version) wants his three sons to marry. To accomplish this, he creates a test to help them find brides. The king tells each prince to shoot an arrow. According to the King's rules, each prince will find his bride where the arrow lands. The youngest son's arrow is picked up by a [[frog]]. The king assigns his three prospective daughters-in-law various tasks, such as spinning cloth and baking bread. In every task, the frog far outperforms the two other lazy brides-to-be. In some versions, the frog uses magic to accomplish the tasks, and though the other brides attempt to emulate the frog, they cannot perform the magic. Still, the young prince is ashamed of his frog bride until she is magically transformed into a human princess.

In Calvino's version, the princes use slings rather than bows and arrows. In the Greek version, the princes set out to find their brides one by one; the older two are already married by the time the youngest prince starts his quest. Another variation involves the sons chopping down trees and heading in the direction pointed by them in order to find their brides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/Out-everywhere-Tales-new-world/dp/0888994028 Out of the Everywhere: New Tales for Canada, Jan Andrews]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ivan Bilibin 054 full.jpeg|thumb|250px|Illustration to ''The Frog Tsarevna'' by [[Ivan Bilibin]]]]
In the Russian versions of the story, Prince Ivan and his two older brothers shoot arrows in different directions to find brides. The other brothers' arrows land in the houses of the daughters of an aristocratic and wealthy [[merchant]]. Ivan's arrow lands in the mouth of a frog in a swamp, who turns into a princess at night. The Frog Princess, named Vasilisa the Wise, is a beautiful, intelligent, friendly, skilled girl who was forced to spend 3 years in a frog's skin for disobeying [[Koschei]]. Her final test may be to dance at the king's banquet. The Frog Princess sheds her skin, and the prince then burns it, to her dismay. Had the prince been patient, the Frog Princess would have been freed but instead he loses her. He then sets out to find her again and meets with [[Baba Yaga]], whom he impresses with his spirit, asking why she has not offered him hospitality. She tells him that Koschei is holding his bride captive and explains how to find the magic needle needed to rescue his bride. In another version, the prince's bride flies into Baba Yaga's hut as a [[bird]]. The prince catches her, she turns into a [[lizard]], and he cannot hold on. Baba Yaga rebukes him and sends him to her sister, where he fails again. However, when he is sent to the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] sister, he catches her and no [[Shapeshifting#Transformation chase|transformations]] can break her free again.

In some versions of the story, the Frog Princess' transformation is a reward for her good nature. In one version, she is transformed by witches for their amusement. In yet another version, she is revealed to have been an enchanted princess all along.

==Variants==
This tale is closely related to ''[[Puddocky]]'' and its variants, in which a king sets three tasks to his sons to determine which is best suited to rule the country, and a transformed frog helps the youngest prince.

==Adaptations==
* ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful (1939 film)|Vasilisa the Beautiful]]'', a 1939 Soviet film directed by [[Aleksandr Rou]], is based on this plot. It was the first large-budget feature in the [[Soviet Union]] to use fantasy elements, as opposed to the [[Socialist realism|realistic]] style long favored politically.&lt;ref&gt;James Graham, [http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html Baba Yaga in Film] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109100659/http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html |date=2013-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1953 the director [[Mikhail Tsekhanovsky]] had the idea of animating this popular national fairy tale. Production took two years, and the premiere took place in December, 1954. At present the film is included in the gold classics of "[[Soyuzmultfilm]]". &lt;!-- In 1960 it won the "Silver Oak Leaf" prize on the [[IFF]] in Mar del Plata (Argentina).  SEE TALK PAGE, "Mar del Plata".--&gt;
* ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful (1977 film)|Vasilisa the Beautiful]]'', a 1977 Soviet animated film is also based on this fairy tale.
* In 1996, a animated Russian version based on an in-depth version of the tale in the film "Classic Fairy Tales From Around the World" on VHS. This version tells of how the beautiful Princess Vasilisa was kidnapped and cursed by the evil wizard Kashay to make her his bride and only the love of the handsome Prince Ivan can free her.
* Taking inspiration from the Russian story, Vasilisa appears to assist Hellboy against Koschei in the 2007 [[comic book]] ''[[Hellboy: Darkness Calls]]''.
* The Frog Princess was featured in ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', where it was depicted in a country setting. The episode features the voice talents of [[Jasmine Guy]] as Frog Princess Lylah, [[Greg Kinnear]] as Prince Gavin, [[Wallace Langham]] as Prince Bobby, [[Mary Gross]] as Elise, and [[Beau Bridges]] as King Big Daddy.

"'''This Used to Be My Playground'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. It is the theme for the film ''[[A League of Their Own]]'', which starred Madonna, and portrayed a fictionalized account of the real-life [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]]. Madonna was asked to record a song for the film's soundtrack. At that time she was busy recording her fifth studio album, ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'',  with producer [[Shep Pettibone]]. They worked on some ideas and came up with "This Used to Be My Playground" in two days. Once presented to director [[Penny Marshall]]'s team, the song was released as a standalone single on June 16, 1992, by [[Warner Bros. Records]]. However, it was not available on the film's soundtrack due to contractual obligations and was later added to the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]-inspired ''[[Barcelona Gold]]'' compilation album, released that summer. The song was included on Madonna's 1995 ballads compilation ''[[Something to Remember]]''.

Written and produced by Madonna and Pettibone, "This Used to Be My Playground" was the first time that Pettibone worked with live string [[arrangement]]. Madonna recorded the song on a [[Shure SM57]] microphone, with instrumentation from piano, organ, strings and a basic drum sounds. During the final recording, the duo had to redo the whole orchestra section to tailor it for the song. "This Used to Be My Playground" starts with a keyboard introduction and strings, with Madonna singing in expressive but subdued vocals. Its [[verse (popular music)|verse]] and [[refrain|chorus]] merge into each other for having a continuity in the song, but the track ends abruptly. Lyrically it discusses visiting one's childhood places and not letting go of the past.

The song received positive reviews from critics, who noted it as an essential addition in Madonna's repertoire. The song earned the singer a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]. It was a commercial success, reaching number-one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; the track was Madonna's tenth chart-topping single, breaking her tie with [[Whitney Houston]] to become the female artist with the most number one singles at that time. It also reached the top of the charts in Canada, Finland, Italy and Sweden, while reaching the top-ten of the charts in Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

==Background and release==
[[File:Penny Marshall 1976.png|thumb|upright|Madonna starred in the film ''[[A League of Their Own]]'', which was directed by [[Penny Marshall]] (''pictured'').]]
In 1992, Madonna starred in the [[Penny Marshall]] directed film ''[[A League of Their Own]]'', which portrayed a fictionalized account of the real-life [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] (AAGPBL).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2008|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia Records]] representatives presented music supervisor Jay Landers with the film's script. Together with Michael Dilbeck, head of music for [[Columbia Pictures]], they decided to compose a soundtrack for the film. According to Landers, Marshall being well connected to the music community also helped them choose the artists they wanted to work with. The director wanted the music and songs to be performed by contemporary artists, but catering to the period of 1943–44, which was the film's timeline. [[Carole King]] had already written the opening song for ''A League of Their Own'', and Madonna being associated with it, Columbia wanted her to record another song. Lars recalled that there was some "early hesitation" if Madonna's character should be kept the same or separated from that in the film and the song, and in the end they decided to go with the latter concept.&lt;ref name="fred"&gt;{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the shooting was over, Madonna was busy in the recording sessions for her fifth studio album, ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' with producer [[Shep Pettibone]]. Throughout January–March 1992, Madonna and Pettibone worked on [[demo (music)|demo]]s for the album and finally decided on 15 of them.&lt;ref name="eroticadiaries"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sheppettibone.com/sp_erotica_diaries.htm |title=Erotica Diaries |last=Pettibone |first=Shep |authorlink=Shep Pettibone |publisher=ShepPettibone.com |accessdate=July 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67kwTe4KB?url=http://www.sheppettibone.com/sp_erotica_diaries.htm |archivedate=May 18, 2012 |year=1992 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lars called Madonna and asked her to record a song for the film, the singer and Pettibone had just completed working on the ballad "[[Rain (Madonna song)|Rain]]". Madonna admitted that she did not have any material for the film and Lars explained that Marshall wanted only a ballad. Pettibone composed a track the same night and Madonna had some ideas she wanted to incorporate.&lt;ref name="fred"/&gt; She came up with the melody of "This Used to Be My Playground" by humming over computer-generated chords and rewrote a string arrangement while an orchestra waited in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/madonnas-50-greatest-songs-w430518/this-used-to-be-my-playground-from-barcelona-gold-1992-w431107|title=Madonna’s 50 Greatest Songs|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 27, 2016|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Madonna described the process as "assignment writing" since it was completely separate from her ''Erotica'' sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/03/madonna-pornographic-pictures-naked-women-interview|title=Madonna: 'I don't see anything pornographic about beautiful pictures of naked women'|last=Martin|first=Gavin|date=September 8, 1992|accessdate=March 1, 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took them two days to write and produce the song, and the final version was submitted to Marshall's team. Lars recalled that they "immediately loved it... We all thought it would be a very successful record and we knew right away it would be perfect."&lt;ref name="fred"/&gt;

Due to contractual reasons, the track could not be included on the official ''A League of Their Own'' soundtrack; instead, it was included on the compilation ''[[Barcelona Gold]]'', which was released to promote the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilker|first1=Deborah|title=Madonna hit single not on soundtrack|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19920724&amp;id=3qlJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VQ4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1445,2433212&amp;hl=en|accessdate=February 27, 2016|work=[[Bangor Daily News]]|date=July 24, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Chris|title=Artists for Warner Olympics album, Coke tie-in detected|journal=Billboard|date=June 27, 1992|page=3|volume=104|issue=26|issn= 0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This Used to Be My Playground" was officially released as a standalone [[single (music)|single]] to promote the film, on June 16, 1992, by [[Warner Bros.

==Recording and composition==
Recording the track was a new experience for Pettibone since it was the first time that he worked with live musicians and arrangements. Pettibone took the demo of the song, and added live [[drum machine|drums]], [[piano]] and [[string arrangement|strings]] to it. They did not have any strings written originally for the song, and chose composer Jeremy Lubbock for the music [[arrangement]]; Lubbock had previously worked with Madonna on her soundtrack album ''[[I'm Breathless]]'' (1990).&lt;ref name="fred"/&gt; Madonna recorded the song on a [[Shure SM57]] microphone, with the melody being played over and over again, accompanied by the piano, [[Electronic organ|organ]], strings and a basic rim-looping sound on a portable [[Macintosh]] computer. Pettibone spent the rest of the recording session working on the [[verse (popular music)|verses]] and final structure of "This Used to Be My Playground" was completed. The day after the song was finished, Madonna traveled to [[Oregon]] to work on her next film, ''[[Body of Evidence (1993 film)|Body of Evidence]]'', giving Pettibone the time to finish off the songs for ''Erotica''.&lt;ref name="eroticadiaries"/&gt;

The duo met again in May 1992 at Oceanway Studios in Los Angeles to complete the orchestration of the song. Lubbock's arrangement was chosen for adding the final touches and the recording started. However, Madonna and Pettibone did not like the orchestra parts and wanted to redo the whole composition. The producer recalled, "Madonna and I had to change the whole arrangement, right there in the studio, with a full orchestra sitting there getting paid for taking up space—around $15,000 for three hours, $3000 for every half-hour over that. And of course, Lubbock was talking to two people who didn't know a [[C (musical note)|C]] from a [[B (musical note)|B natural]]. The pressure was on".&lt;ref name="eroticadiaries"/&gt; So they stood near Pettibone's Mac and sang the notes, with Lubbock correcting them. The total recording was finished off in 2 hours and 58 minutes, thereby saving to pay the orchestra the extra fees. The last recording of the song was on [[Memorial Day]] where Madonna re-did the lead vocals and improved them. Together they did some final edits of the track and finished it.&lt;ref name="eroticadiaries"/&gt;

"This Used to Be My Playground" features a [[Electronic keyboard|keyboard]] [[introduction (music)|introduction]], followed by the strings and the song starts.&lt;ref name="rik"/&gt; Musically, the song is set in the time signature of [[common time]] with a slow [[tempo]] of 77 [[beats per minute]]. It is composed in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[G minor]] with Madonna vocals ranging from the chords of G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to B{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The song follows a basic sequence of Gm–F/G–E{{music|flat}}maj&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;–Dm&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;–Gsus–G as its [[chord progression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0119873|title=Madonna 'This Used to Be My Playground' Sheet Music|publisher=Musicnotes.com|accessdate=February 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chords have an unexpected flow in terms of the beginning and the ending, moving from E{{music|flat}} down to Gm and momentarily to [[F major]], then going back to the previous sequence again. The song has a lush, [[neoromanticism (music)|romantic]] quality, with the melody going through different ranges and peaks, and the verse and the chorus flow into each other, making it sound seamless. Madonna sings in subdued but expressive vocals, aided by the strings and background singers during the third verse. Towards the end the singer's voice is [[double tracking|double tracked]] and produces little amount of roughness.&lt;ref name="rik"/&gt; Lyrically the song talks about Madonna revisiting the places from her childhood ("This used to be my playground / This used to be my childhood dream"), and evokes the songwriting on her fourth studio album, ''[[Like a Prayer (album)|Like a Prayer]]'' (1989). The singer is in a dilemma between choosing the past and letting go, concluding that the latter is difficult ("Say goodbye to yesterday (the dream) / Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say))". The track has a sudden ending with the orchestra and the backing vocal uttering "Wishing you were here with me", the line addressed to Madonna's mother.&lt;ref name="rik"/&gt;

==Critical response==
After its release, "This Used to Be My Playground" received positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]]. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of ''[[Madonna: An Intimate Biography]]'', called the track a "melancholic performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2008|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michelle Morgan, author of the book ''Madonna'', described it as a "beautiful ballad".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|2015|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Humberto Quiroga Lavié called it one of Madonna's best ballads in his essay ''Secretos y Misterios de Hombres y Mujeres''.&lt;ref name="Ensayo Judicial"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K5kjn9hxAggC|title=Secretos y Misterios de Hombres y Mujeres |last=Quiroga Lavié |first=Humberto |date=|accessdate=November 15, 2015|format=essay |language=Spanish |trans-title=Secrets and Mysteries of men and women }}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Rikky Rooksby wrote in his book ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna'', that the song was appropriate for the film and its nostalgic moment towards the end, showing the characters grown up and reuniting at a museum opened for themselves and the titular league. He called it "one of Madonna's very best recordings and most expressive single".&lt;ref name="rik"&gt;{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; While reviewing ''Something to Remember'', author [[Dodson and Fogg|Chris Wade]] wrote in his book ''The Music of Madonna'', that the song conjured up a "strangely sad, nostalgic feel, reminding ourselves of memories from yesteryear". He commended Madonna's vocals calling it as the song's "premier sound" and adding that the way "she sings and captures the melancholic melody is heartbreaking [...] it's one of her finest ever ballads."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wade|2016|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Encyclopedia Madonnica'' writer and journalist [[Matthew Rettenmund]] noted in the book that the song's rise to the top of the charts was aided by its "honest delivery and aching sense of loneliness, regret and nostalgia for friendship lost."&lt;ref name="retten"&gt;{{harvnb|Rettenmund|2016|p=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Jacobs from ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', placed it at number 32 on his list "The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles". He wrote: "What's surprising is that this heartfelt ballad's release was sandwiched between '[[Justify My Love]]' and '[[Erotica (song)|Erotica]]', which corroborates the many checkered crowns that Madonna can wear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Matthew|title=The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/22/the-definitive-ranking-of-madonna-singles_n_5078934.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=September 18, 2015|date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[AllMusic]]'s Jose F. Promis called it "a quiet predecessor to her most notorious album ''Erotica''". Promis also believed that the single version of the song was worth of collecting since it was not released in CD version in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/this-used-to-be-my-playground-mw0000259371|title=Madonna &gt; This Used to Be My Playground|last=Promis|first=Jose F.|date=July 27, 1999|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sal Cinquemani from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'', called it one of the singer's "soundtrack gems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/madonna-ghv2|title=Madonna: GHV2&amp;nbsp;– Music Review |last=Cinequemani|first=Sal|work=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=November 8, 2001|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the ''[[Deseret News]]'', Chris Hicks called the song "a lovely change-of-pace number" for Madonna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hicks|first1=Chris|title=Madonna's All Over the Place, But Her 'Playground' Is Not|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/240456/MADONNAS-ALL-OVER-THE-PLACE-BUT-HER-PLAYGROUND-IS-NOT.html?pg=all|work=[[Deseret News]]|accessdate=February 18, 2016|date=August 3, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The accompanying [[music video]], directed by [[Alek Keshishian]], was filmed in June 1992 at [[Famous Players Film Company|Raleigh Studios]] in [[Hollywood, California]] and [[Malibu, California|Malibu Beach]]. It premiered on [[MTV]] on June 30, 1992, a day before the release of ''A League of Their Own''.&lt;ref name="retten"/&gt; The video shows a man viewing a photo album, as Madonna sings in different settings from within the various pictures. Scenes from ''A League of Their Own'' also appear on the album during and after the song's instrumental break. As the video ends, the man having reached the end of the album, then scrolls backwards through the previous pages. As a whole, the video wherein a man viewing a photo album tells of bringing back childhood memories, but even tells that never hold on to the past. The video was commercially released in 2004 as a bonus feature on the 2-disc special edition DVD of ''A League of Their Own''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/57380/league-of-their-own-a/ |title=A League of Their Own: Blu Ray Video|publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rettenmund, unlike most music videos related to film soundtracks, "This Used to Be My Playground" did not give emphasis on having shots from the film in the video itself. Instead Keshishian and Madonna chose introspection as the theme, with simple images to portray them. Rettenmund notes, "At the end, the man who has been looking back at his scrapbook of Madonna lays his head down, sealing the video with the perfect bit of sadness to resonate with Madonna's ennui."&lt;ref name="retten"/&gt;

The video has been compared to [[Boy George]]'s video for his 1987 single, "To Be Reborn", released less than five years before "This Used to Be My Playground". In George's video, he also appears on pages of a photo album, performing the song. George himself stated in his autobiography that he was "furious" after watching Madonna's video and renamed it "This Used to Be My Video".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|George|1995|p=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2011/03/boy-george-interview?page=last |title=Interview: Boy George on Lady Gaga, Madonna, Adele and Much More! |accessdate=December 28, 2012 |publisher=[[AfterEllen.com and TheBacklot.com|AfterEllen.com]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306133158/http://www.afterelton.com/people/2011/03/boy-george-interview?page=0%2C1 |archivedate=March 6, 2011 |last=Rotter |first=Josh |date=March 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas McEvilley''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|k|ˈ|ɛ|v|ᵻ|l|i}}; July 13, 1939 &amp;ndash; March 2, 2013) was an [[United States|American]] [[art critic]], poet, novelist, and scholar. He was a Distinguished Lecturer in [[art history|Art History]] at [[Rice University]]&lt;ref name = "TME 96"&gt;Thomas McEvilley, [[G. Roger Denson]] (1996), ''Capacity: : History, the World, and the Self in Contemporary Art and Criticism''. Routledge. {{ISBN|90-5701-051-8}}: This information is given on the backpage of this book.&lt;/ref&gt; and founder and former chair of the Department of Art Criticism and Writing at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="MPC"/&gt;

==Work==
McEvilley was an expert in the fields of [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[India]]n culture, history of religion and philosophy, and art. He published several books and hundreds of scholarly monographs, articles, catalog essays, and reviews on early Greek and Indian poetry, philosophy, and religion as well as on contemporary art and culture.

===Art and Otherness===
In his 1992 book ''Art &amp; Otherness: Crisis in Cultural Identity'', McEvilley collected and revised twelve essays from the 1980s in the midst of the [[Culture Wars]], the roiling debate regarding the predominance of white, male, Western culture in academia and visual art, and the need for that supremacy to be challenged and opened up to other points of view. McEvilley did this in pointed fashion in "Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief," his influential jeremiad against the underlying assumptions that framed the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s 1984 exhibition ''Primitivism and Twentieth Century Art''.&lt;ref&gt;http://brooklynrail.org/2013/05/artseen/art-criticism-that-made-a-difference&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toward a Redefinition of Painting for the Post-Modern Era===
In his 1993 book ''The Exile’s Return: Toward a Redefinition of Painting for the Post-Modern Era'', McEvilley made an important contribution to the late twentieth century "death of painting" debate. He noted that after two decades of decline in importance as a medium, painting revived around 1980. In its return from exile, painting assumed a new theoretical basis in [[postmodern]] cultural theory, together with a new kind of self-awareness and interest in its own limitations.

===Heads It's Form, Tails It's Not Content===
In the article "Heads it's Form, Tails it's not Content" McEvilley describes a theoretical framework for the formalist project presented by postwar critics such as [[Clement Greenberg]], [[Michael Fried]] and [[Sheldon Nodelman]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas McEvilley (1996), "Heads It's Form, Tails It's Not Content", in: ''Artforum'' 21.3 ( Nov.1982) : 50-61. Later collected in: ''Capacity: The History, the World, and the Self in Contemporary Art and Criticism'', by Thomas McEvilley and G. Roger Denson. Routledge: Taylor &amp; Francis Group. {{ISBN|90-5701-051-8}}. Page 22-44.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that formalist ideas are rooted in [[Neoplatonism]] and as such deal with the problem of content by claiming that content is embedded within form. [[Formalism (linguistics)|Formalism]] is based on a [[linguistic]] model that [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] argued is given content through the unconscious. In adopting a formalist approach, a critic cannot ignore the content that accompanies every deployment of form.

===Sculpture in the Age of Doubt===
In the book ''Sculpture in the Age of Doubt'' (1999), McEvilley analyzes the intellectual issues surrounding the [[postmodern movement]] in the course of 20th-century sculpture.

===The Shape of Ancient Thought===
In ''The Shape of Ancient Thought'', McEvilley explores the foundations of [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. He argues that today’s [[Western world]] must be considered the product of both Greek and Indian thought, both [[Western philosophy]] and [[Eastern philosophies]]. He shows how [[trade]], [[imperialism]] and currents of [[human migration|migration]] allowed cultural philosophies to intermingle freely throughout [[India]], [[Egypt]], [[Greece]] and the ancient [[Near East]]. This book spans thirty years of McEvilley's research, from 1970 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Thomas | last=McEvilley | title=The Shape of Ancient Thought | publisher=Allworth Communications | year=2002 | isbn=1-58115-203-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal and education==
McEvilley was born in [[Cincinnati]]. He studied [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[classical philosophy]] in the [[classics]] programs of the [[University of Cincinnati]]&lt;ref name = "TME 96"/&gt; where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], and the [[University of Washington]], where he received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]].&lt;ref name ="SVA 07"/&gt; He then returned to Cincinnati, where he received a [[Ph.D.]] in [[classical philology]]. He also retained a strong interest in [[modern art]], reinforced by the artists of his acquaintance.

In 1969, McEvilley joined the faculty of [[Rice University]], where he spent the better part of his teaching career.&lt;ref name="TME 04"&gt;Thomas McEvilley (2004). [https://web.archive.org/web/20050310002120/http://slought.org/content/11285/  "Art and Cognition."]. Slought Foundation Online Content. 11 December 2004, retrieved 4 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was a visiting professor at [[Yale University]] and the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], among others. He taught numerous courses in [[Greek culture|Greek]] and [[Indian culture]], [[history of religion]] and [[History of philosophy|philosophy]]. In 2008 he retired from teaching after 41 years, residing in [[New York City]] and in [[upstate New York]] in the [[Catskills]].

He received numerous awards, including the Semple Prize at the University of Cincinnati, a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Critics grant, a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright fellowship]] in 1993, an NEA critic’s grant, and the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award (1993) for Distinction in Art Criticism from the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name = "TME 04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McEvilley was a contributing editor of ''[[Artforum]]'' and editor in chief of ''Contemporanea''.&lt;ref name="SVA 07"&gt;[http://www.schoolofvisualarts.edu/CatalogRequests/catalogs/GraduateCatalog.pdf School of VISUAL ARTS, graduate programs 2007-2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828040049/http://www.schoolofvisualarts.edu/CatalogRequests/catalogs/GraduateCatalog.pdf |date=2008-08-28 }}, Retrieved 4 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

McEvilley died on March 2, 2013 of complications from [[cancer]] at [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]]. He was 73. He is survived by his wife, the artist Joyce Burstein; two sons from a former marriage, Thomas and Monte; a sister, Ellen M. Griffin; and two grandchildren. His son Alexander predeceased him. He was married twice earlier; both marriages ended in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas McEvilley, Critic and Defender of Non-Western Art, Dies at 73|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/arts/thomas-mcevilley-critic-and-scholar-of-non-western-art-dies-at-73.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''troubadour''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|t|r|uː|b|ə|d|ʊər|}}, {{IPA-fr|tʁubaduʁ|lang}}; {{lang-oc|trobador}}, {{IPA-oc|tɾuβaˈðu|IPA}}&lt;!--, &lt;small&gt;archaically:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-oc|tɾuβaˈðor|}}{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the Old Occitan pronunciation|date=September 2013}}--&gt;) was a composer and performer of [[Old Occitan]] [[lyric poetry]] during the [[High Middle Ages]] (1100–1350). Since the word ''troubadour'' is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a [[trobairitz]].

The troubadour school or tradition began in the late 11th century in [[Occitania]], but it subsequently spread to Italy and Spain. Under the influence of the troubadours, related movements sprang up throughout Europe: the [[Minnesang]] in Germany, ''[[trovadorismo]]'' in [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]] and Portugal, and that of the [[trouvère]]s in northern France. [[Dante Alighieri]] in his ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' defined the troubadour lyric as ''fictio rethorica musicaque poita'': rhetorical, musical, and poetical fiction. After the "classical" period around the turn of the 13th century and a mid-century resurgence, the art of the troubadours declined in the 14th century and around the time of the [[Black Death]] (1348) it died out. 

The texts of troubadour songs deal mainly with themes of [[chivalry]] and [[courtly love]]. Most were metaphysical, intellectual, and formulaic. Many were humorous or vulgar satires. Works can be grouped into three styles: the ''[[trobar leu]]'' (light), ''[[trobar ric]]'' (rich), and ''[[trobar clus]]'' (closed). Likewise there were many [[genre]]s, the most popular being the ''[[canso (song)|canso]]'', but ''[[sirventes]]'' and ''[[tenso]]s'' were especially popular in the post-classical period.

==Etymology of name==
The oldest mention of the word ''troubadour'' as ''trobadors'' is found in a 12th-century Occitan text by [[Cercamon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolf|first=George|title=The Poetry of Cercamon and Jaufre Rudel.|year=1983|publisher=Garland Publishing|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word ''troubadour'' is an exact rendition from a French word first recorded in 1575 in an historical context to mean "langue d'oc poet at the court in the 12th and 13th century" ([[Jean de Nostredame]], ''Vies des anciens Poètes provençaux'', p.&amp;nbsp;14 in Gdf. Compl.).&lt;ref name="cnrtl.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/troubadour|title=TROUBADOUR : Etymologie de TROUBADOUR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French word is borrowed itself from the Occitan word ''trobador''. It is the [[oblique case]] of the [[nominative]] ''trobaire'' “composer", related to ''trobar'' “to compose, to discuss, to invent" ([[Wace]], ''Brut'', editions I. Arnold, 3342) It may come from the hypothetical [[Late Latin]] *''tropāre'' “to compose, to invent a poem" by regular [[phonetic change]]. This recreated form is deduced from the Latin root ''tropus'', meaning a [[Trope (music)|trope]] and the various meanings of the Old Occitan related words. In turn, the Latin word derives ultimately from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''τρόπος'' (''tropos''), meaning "turn, manner".&lt;ref name=chaytor&gt;Chaytor, [http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Troubadours1.html Part 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; B [[Intervocal]] Latin [p] shifted regularly to [b] in Occitan (cf. Latin ''sapere'' &gt; Occitan ''saber'' “to know") (cf. Latin ''sapere'' &gt; ''savoir''). The Latin suffix ''-ātor'', ''-atōris'' explains the Occitan suffix, according to its [[declension]] and [[Diacritical mark|accentuation]] : Gallo-Romance &lt;small&gt;*TROPĀTOR&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Allières, ''La formation de la langue française'', coll. Que sais-je ?, éditions PUF, 1982, p. 49.  2) Imparisyllabiques β) Mots en -OR -ŌRE.&lt;/ref&gt; &gt; Occitan ''trobaire'' (subject case) and &lt;small&gt;*TROPATŌRE&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="ALLIÈRES 49"&gt;ALLIÈRES 49.&lt;/ref&gt; &gt; Occitan ''trobador'' « troubadour » (oblique case).

There is an alternative theory to explain the meaning of ''trobar'' as “to compose, to discuss, to invent". It has the support of some historians, specialists of literature and musicologists to justify of the troubadours' origins in Arabic [[Andalusian classical music|Andalusian musical]] practices. According to them, the Arabic word ''ṭaraba'' “song" (from the [[triliteral]] root Ṭ-R-B (طرب) “provoke emotion, excitement, agitation; make music, entertain by singing") could partly be the etymon of the verb ''trobar''.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Rosa Menocal (1985), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/474171 "Pride and Prejudice in Medieval Studies: European and Oriental"], ''Hispanic Review'', '''53''':1, 61–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The origin and meaning of courtly love: a critical study of European scholarship|author=Roger Boase|page=131|year=1977|publisher=Manchester University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Arabic root had already been proposed before : Ḍ-R-B (ضرب) “strike", by extension “play a musical instrument".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ahess_0395-2649_1966_num_21_5_421446 Richard Lemay, « À propos de l'origine arabe de l'art des troubadours », ''Annales. Économies, sociétés, civilisations'', vol. 21, n°5, 1966, p. 991 (French)]&lt;/ref&gt; They entertain the possibility that the nearly homophonous Ḍ-R-B root may have contributed to the sense of the newly coined Romance verb ''trobar''.

Some proponents of this theory argue, only on cultural grounds, that both etymologies may well be correct, and that there may have been a conscious poetic exploitation of the [[Phonology|phonological]] coincidence between ''trobar'' and the triliteral Arabic root Ṭ-R-B when [[Sufism|Sufi Islamic]] musical forms with a love theme first spread from [[Al-Andalus]] to southern France. It has also been pointed out that the concepts of "finding", "music", "love", and "ardour" — the precise semantic field attached to the word troubadour — are allied in Arabic under a single root W-J-D (وجد) that plays a major role in Sufic discussions of music, and that the word troubadour may in part reflect this.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Idries Shah]], ''The Sufis''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the linguistic facts do not support a hypothetical theory : the word ''trover'' is mentioned in French as soon as the 10th century before ''trobar'' in Occitan (see above) and the word ''trovere'' &gt; ''trouvère'' appears almost simultaneously in French as ''trobador'' in Occitan (see above).

In archaic and classical troubadour poetry, the word is only used in a mocking sense, having more or less the meaning of "somebody who makes things up". Cercamon writes:
:''Ist trobador, entre ver e mentir,''
:''Afollon drutz e molhers et espos,''
:''E van dizen qu'Amors vay en biays''
::(These troubadours, between truth and lies/corrupt lovers, women and husbands,/ and keep saying that Love proceeds obliquely).&lt;ref&gt;''Puois nostre temps comens'a brunezir''; read the whole text [http://www.trobar.org/troubadours/cercamon/cmn5.php here]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peire d'Alvernha]] also begins his famous mockery of contemporary authors ''cantarai d'aquest trobadors'',&lt;ref&gt;read the whole text [http://www.trobar.org/troubadours/alvernha/pealv12.php here]&lt;/ref&gt; after which he proceeds to explain why none of them is worth anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Del Monte|first=A.|title=Peire d'Alvernha, Liriche|year=1955|location=Turin}}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to themselves seriously, troubadours almost invariably use the word "chantaire" (singer).

==Origins==
The early study of the troubadours focused intensely on their origins. No academic consensus was ever achieved in the area. Today, one can distinguish at least eleven competing theories (the adjectives used below are a blend from the [[Grove Dictionary of Music]] and Roger Boase's ''The Origins and Meaning of Courtly Love''):

#'''Arabic''' (also '''Arabist''' or '''Hispano-Arabic''')&lt;br&gt;The sixteenth century Italian historian Giammaria Barbieri was perhaps the first to suggest Arabian influences on the music of the troubadours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Diminutives in the "dīwān" of Ibn Quzmān: A Product of Their Hispanic Milieu?|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|volume=52|issue=2|year=1989|page=241|last1=Abu-Haidar|first1=JA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars like J.B. Trend have asserted that the poetry of troubadours is connected to Arabic poetry written in Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Veldeman|first1=Marie-Christine|year=2001|volume=28|issue=2|page=87-100|journal=Equivalences|title=Egypt, or the quest for syncretism and spiritual wholeness in Lawrence Durrell's Avignon Quintet}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have attempted to find direct evidence of this influence. In examining the works of [[William IX of Aquitaine]], [[Évariste Lévi-Provençal]] and other scholars found three lines that they believed were in some form of Arabic, indicating a potential Andalusian origin for his works. The scholars attempted to translate the lines in question, though the medievalist Istvan Frank contended that the lines were not Arabic at all, but instead the result of the rewriting of the original by a later scribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malkin|first1=Peter|title=Provence and Pound|page=326|publisher=University of California|year=1979|isbn=978-0520034884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=“Beech1992”&gt;{{cite journal|title= Troubadour Contacts with Muslim Spain and Knowledge of Arabic: New Evidence Concerning William IX of Aquitaine |journal=Romania|year=1992|page=14-26|last1=Beech|first1=George T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars like [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]] stated that the troubadour tradition was created by William, who had been influenced by [[Moorish]] music and poetry while fighting with the [[Reconquista]]. However, George T. Beech states that there is only one documented battle that William fought in Spain, and it occurred towards the end of his life. Beech adds that while the sources of William’s inspirations are uncertain, he and his father did have Spanish individuals within their extended family, and he may have been friendly with some Europeans who could speak the Arabic language.&lt;ref name=“Beech1992” /&gt; Regardless of William's personal involvement in the tradition's creation, [[Magda Bogin]] states that Arab poetry was likely one of several influences on European “courtly love poetry”, citing [[Ibn Hazm]]’s “[[The Ring of the Dove]]” as an example of a similar Arab tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogin|first1=Magda|last2=Bogin|first2=Meg|title=The Women Troubadours|year=1995|publisher=WW Norton|page=46-47|isbn=978-0393009651}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of transmission from Arab Spain to the rest of Europe did exist, such as the [[Toledo School of Translators]], though it only began translating major romances from Arabic into Latin in the second half of the thirteenth century, with [[Expurgation|objectionable sexual content]] removed in deference to the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1997|isbn=978-0415609845|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies|editor=Mona Baker and Kirsten Malmkjaer|page=553|chapter=Spanish tradition|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#'''Bernardine-Marianist''' or '''Christian'''&lt;br&gt;According to this theory, it was the theology espoused by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and the increasingly important [[Mariology]] that most strongly influenced the development of the troubadour genre. Specifically, the emphasis on religious and spiritual love, disinterestedness, mysticism, and devotion to Mary explained "courtly love". The emphasis of the reforming [[Robert of Arbrissel]] on "matronage" to achieve his ends can explain the troubadour attitude towards women.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald A. Bond, "Origins", in Akehurst and Davis, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronologically, however, this hypothesis is hard to sustain (the forces believed to have given rise to the phenomenon arrived later than it). But the influence of Bernardine and Marian theology can be retained without the origins theory. This theory was advanced early by Eduard Wechssler and further by Dmitri Scheludko (who emphasises the [[Cluniac Reform]]) and Guido Errante. Mario Casella and Leo Spitzer have added "[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]]" influence to it.
#'''Celtic''' or '''Chivalric-Matriarchal'''&lt;br&gt;The survival of pre-Christian sexual ''mores'' and warrior codes from [[matriarchal]] societies, be they [[Celt]]ic, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], or [[Pictish]], among the aristocracy of Europe can account for the idea (fusion) of "courtly love". The existence of pre-Christian matriarchy has usually been treated with scepticism as has the persistence of underlying paganism in high medieval Europe.
#'''Classical Latin'''&lt;br&gt;The classical Latin theory emphasises parallels between [[Ovid]], especially his ''Amores'' and ''Ars amatoria'', and the lyric of courtly love. The ''aetas ovidiana'' that predominated in the 11th century in and around [[Orléans]], the quasi-[[Cicero]]nian ideology that held sway in the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial court]], and the scraps of [[Plato]] then available to scholars have all been cited as classical influences on troubadour poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald A. Bond, "Origins", in Akehurst and Davis, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;
#('''Crypto-''')'''Cathar'''&lt;br&gt;According to this thesis, troubadour poetry is a reflection of [[Cathar]] religious doctrine. While the theory is supported by the traditional and near-universal account of the decline of the troubadours coinciding with the suppression of Catharism during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (first half of the 13th century), support for it has come in waves. The explicitly Catholic meaning of many early troubadour works also works against the theory.
#'''Liturgical'''&lt;br&gt;The troubadour lyric may be a development of the Christian [[liturgy]] and [[hymnody]]. The influence of the [[Song of Songs]] has even been suggested. There is no preceding [[Latin poetry]] resembling that of the troubadours. On those grounds, no theory of the latter's origins in classical or post-classical Latin can be constructed, but that has not deterred some, who believe that a pre-existing Latin corpus must merely be lost to us.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; That many troubadours received their grammatical training in Latin through the Church (from ''clerici'', clerics) and that many were trained musically by the Church is well-attested. The musical school of [[St. Martial's Abbey, Limoges|Saint Martial's]] at [[Limoges]] has been singled out in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; "Para-liturgical" [[trope (literature)|trope]]s were in use there in the era preceding the troubadours' appearance.
#'''Feudal-social''' or '''-sociological'''&lt;br&gt;This theory or set of related theories has gained ground in the 20th century. It is more a methodological approach to the question than a theory; it asks not from where the content or form of the lyric came but rather in what situation/circumstances did it arise.&lt;ref name=menocal47&gt;Menocal, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Marxist]] influence, [[Erich Köhler]], [[Marc Bloch]], and [[Georges Duby]] have suggested that the "essential hegemony" in the castle of the lord's wife during his absence was a driving force. The use of [[feudal]] terminology in troubadour poems is seen as evidence. This theory has been developed away from sociological towards [[psychological]] explanation.
#'''Folklore''' or '''Spring Folk Ritual'''&lt;br&gt;According to [[María Rosa Menocal]], [[Alfred Jeanroy]] first suggested that [[folklore]] and [[oral tradition]] gave rise to troubadour poetry in 1883. According to F. M. Warren, it was [[Gaston Paris]], Jeanroy's reviewer, in 1891 who first located troubadour origins in the festive dances of women hearkening the spring in the [[Loire Valley]]. This theory has since been widely discredited, but the discovery of the ''[[jarcha]]s'' raises the question of the extent of literature (oral or written) in the 11th century and earlier.&lt;ref name=menocal47/&gt;
#'''Medieval Latin''' or '''Mediolatin''' ('''Goliardic''')&lt;br&gt;Hans Spanke analysed the intertextual connexion between vernacular and [[medieval Latin]] (such as [[Goliardic]]) songs. This theory is supported by Reto Bezzola, Peter Dronke, and musicologist [[Jacques Chailley]]. According to them, ''trobar'' means "inventing a trope", the trope being a poem where the words are used with a meaning different from their common signification, i.e. [[metaphor]] and [[metonymy]]. This poem was originally inserted in a serial of modulations ending a liturgic song. Then the trope became an autonomous piece organized in stanza form.&lt;ref name="DITL"&gt;[http://www.ditl.info/arttest/art4482.php Troubadour], ''Observatoire de terminologie littéraire'', [[University of Limoges]], France.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of late 11th-century poets of the "[[Loire school]]", such as [[Marbod of Rennes]] and [[Hildebert of Lavardin]], is stressed in this connexion by Brinkmann.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald A. Bond, "Origins", in Akehurst and Davis, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Neoplatonic'''&lt;br&gt;This theory is one of the more intellectualising. The "ennobling effects of love" in specific have been identified as [[Neoplatonic]].&lt;ref&gt;Menocal, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; It is viewed either as a strength or weakness that this theory requires a second theory about how the Neoplatonism was transmitted to the troubadours; perhaps it can be coupled with one of the other origins stories or perhaps it is just peripheral. Käte Axhausen has "exploited" this theory and A. J. Denomy has linked it with the Arabist (through [[Avicenna]]) and the Cathar (through [[John Scotus Eriugena]]).&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vilém9.jpg|thumb|left|[[William IX of Aquitaine]] portrayed as a knight, who first composed poetry on returning from the [[Crusade of 1101]]]]

===Early period===
The earliest troubadour whose work survives is Guilhèm de Peitieus, better known as Duke [[William IX of Aquitaine]] (1071–1126). Peter Dronke, author of ''The Medieval Lyric'', however, believes that "[his] songs represent not the beginnings of a tradition but summits of achievement in that tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dronke, ''The Medieval Lyric'', Perennial Library, 1968. p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; His name has been preserved because he was the [[Duke of Aquitaine]], but his work plays with already established structures; [[Eble II of Ventadorn]] is often credited as a predecessor, though none of his work survives. [[Orderic Vitalis]] referred to William composing songs about his experiences on his return from the [[Crusade of 1101]] (c. 1102). This may be the earliest reference to troubadour lyrics. Orderic also provides us (1135) with what may be the first description of a troubadour performance: an eyewitness account of William of Aquitaine.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Picauensis uero dux ... miserias captiuitatis suae ... coram regibus et magnatis atque Christianis coetibus multotiens retulit rythmicis uersibus cum facetis modulationibus''. (X.21)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then the Poitevin duke ... the miseries of his captivity ... before kings, magnates, and Christian assemblies many times related with rhythmic verses and witty measures.&lt;ref&gt;Translation based on [[Marjorie Chibnall]], in Bond, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Spread===
[[File:Troubadours berlin.jpg|thumb|200px|Trobadours, 14th century]]
The first half of the 12th century saw relatively few recorded troubadours. Only in the last decades of the century did troubadour activity explode. Almost half of all troubadour works that survive are from the period 1180–1220.&lt;ref&gt;Paden, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;
In total, moreover, there are over 2,500 troubadour lyrics available to be studied as lingusitic artifacts (Akehurst, 23).
The troubadour tradition seems to have begun in western Aquitaine ([[Poitou]] and [[Saintonge]]) and [[Gascony]], from there spreading over into eastern Aquitaine ([[Limousin (province)|Limousin]] and [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]]) and [[Provence]]. At its height it had become popular in [[Languedoc]] and the regions of [[Rouergue]], [[Toulouse]], and [[Quercy]] (c. 1200). Finally, in the early 13th century it began to spread into first Italy and then [[Catalonia]], whence to the rest of Spain and to Portugal. This development has been called the ''rayonnement des troubadours'' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɛjɔnmɑ̃ dɛ tʁubaduːʁ|pron}}).&lt;ref&gt;Paden, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical period===
The classical period of troubadour activity lasted from about 1170 until about 1213. The most famous names among the ranks of troubadours belong to this period. During this period the lyric art of the troubadours reached the height of its popularity and the number of surviving poems is greatest from this period. During this period the ''[[Canso (song)|canso]]'', or love song, became distinguishable as a genre. The master of the ''canso'' and the troubadour who epitomises the classical period is [[Bernart de Ventadorn]]. He was highly regarded by his contemporaries, as were [[Giraut de Bornelh]], reputed by his biographer to be the greatest composer of melodies to ever live, and [[Bertran de Born]], the master of the ''[[sirventes]]'', or political song, which became increasingly popular in this period.

The classical period came to be seen by later generations, especially in the 14th and 15th centuries and outside of Occitania, as representing the high point of lyric poetry and models to be emulated. The language of the classic poets, its grammar and vocabulary, their style and themes, were the ideal to which poets of the troubadour revival in Toulouse and their Catalan and Castilian contemporaries aspired. During the classical period the "rules" of poetic composition had first become standardised and written down, first by [[Raimon Vidal]] and then by [[Uc Faidit]].

==Lives==
{{see also|List of troubadours and trobairitz|Minstrel|Vida (Occitan literary form)|Razo|Consistori del Gay Saber|Consistori de Barcelona}}
The 450 or so troubadours known to historians came from a variety of backgrounds. They made their living in a variety of ways, lived and travelled in many different places, and were actors in many types of social context. The troubadours were not wandering entertainers. Typically, they stayed in one place for a lengthy period of time under the patronage of a wealthy nobleman or woman. Many did travel extensively, however, sojourning at one court and then another.

===Status===
The earliest known troubadour, the Duke of Aquitaine, came from the high nobility. He was followed immediately by two poets of unknown origins, known only by their sobriquets, [[Cercamon]] and [[Marcabru]], and by a member of the princely class, [[Jaufre Rudel]]. Many troubadours are described in their ''vidas'' as poor knights. It was one of the most common descriptors of status: [[Berenguier de Palazol]], [[Gausbert Amiel]], [[Guilhem Ademar]], [[Guiraudo lo Ros]], [[Marcabru]], [[Peire de Maensac]], [[Peirol]], [[Raimon de Miraval]], [[Rigaut de Berbezilh]], and [[Uc de Pena]]. [[Albertet de Sestaro]] is described as the son of a noble jongleur, presumably a [[Petty nobility|petty noble]] lineage.

Later troubadours especially could belong to lower classes, ranging from the middle class of merchants and "burgers" (persons of urban standing) to tradesmen and others who worked with their hands. [[Salh d'Escola]] and [[Elias de Barjols]] were described as the sons of merchants and [[Elias Fonsalada]] was the son of a burger and jongleur. [[Perdigon]] was the son of a "poor fisherman" and [[Elias Cairel]] of a blacksmith. [[Arnaut de Mareuil]] is specified in his ''vida'' as coming from a poor family, but whether this family was poor by noble standards or more global ones is not apparent.

Many troubadours also possessed a clerical education. For some this was their springboard to composition, since their clerical education equipped them with an understanding of musical and poetic forms as well as vocal training. The ''vidas'' of the following troubadours note their clerical status: [[Aimeric de Belenoi]], [[Folquet de Marselha]] (who became a bishop), [[Gui d'Ussel]], [[Guillem Ramon de Gironella]], [[Jofre de Foixà]] (who became an abbot), [[Peire de Bussignac]], [[Peire Rogier]], [[Raimon de Cornet]], [[Uc Brunet]], and [[Uc de Saint Circ]].

===''Trobadors'' and ''joglars''===
[[File:Vielles and Citole, Manuscript T (El Escorial, Biblioteca del Real Monasterio, MS. T. I. 1), fol. 5r, detail.jpg|thumb|right|Musicians in the time of the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]. These were in the court of the king, two [[vielle]] players and one [[citoler]].]]

The Occitan words ''trobador'' and ''trobaire'' are relatively rare compared with the verb ''trobar'' (compose, invent), which was usually applied to the writing of poetry. It signified that a poem was original to an author (''trobador'') and was not merely sung or played by one. The term was used mostly for poetry only and in more careful works, like the ''vidas'', is not generally applied to the composition of music or to singing, though the troubadour's poetry itself is not so careful. Sometime in the middle of the 12th century, however, a distinction was definitely being made between an inventor of original verse and the performers of others'. These last were called ''joglars'', from the Latin ''ioculatores'', giving rise also to the French ''jongleur'', Castilian ''juglar'', and English [[juggler]], which has come to refer to a more specific breed of performer. The medieval ''jongleur/joglar'' is really a [[minstrel]].

At the height of troubadour poetry (the "classical period"), troubadours are often found attacking ''jongleurs'' and at least two small genres arose around the theme: the ''ensenhamen joglaresc'' and the ''sirventes joglaresc''. These terms are debated, however, since the adjective ''joglaresc'' seems to imply "in the manner of the ''jongleurs''". Inevitably, however, pieces of these genres are verbal attacks at ''jongleurs'', in general and in specific, with named individuals being called out. It is clear, for example from the poetry of [[Bertran de Born]], that ''jongleurs'' were performers who did not usually  compose.They often performed the troubadour's songs: singing, playing instruments, dancing, and even doing acrobatics.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest reference to the ''[[basse danse]]'' comes from [[Raimon de Cornet]], who attributes it to the ''jongleurs'' of the mid-14th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 13th century [[Guiraut Riquier]] bemoaned the inexactness of his contemporaries and wrote a letter to [[Alfonso X of Castile]], a noted patron of literature and learning of all kinds, for clarification on the proper reference of the terms ''trobador'' and ''joglar''. According to Riquier, every vocation deserved a name of its own and the sloppy usage of ''joglar'' assured that it covered a multitude of activities, some, no doubt, with which Riquier did not wish to be associated. In the end Riquier argued—and Alfonso X seems to agree, though his "response" was probably penned by Riquier—that a ''joglar'' was a courtly entertainer (as opposed to popular or low-class one) and a troubadour was a poet and composer.

Despite the distinctions noted, many troubadours were also known as jongleurs, either before they began composing or alongside. [[Aimeric de Belenoi]], [[Aimeric de Sarlat]], [[Albertet Cailla]], [[Arnaut de Mareuil]], [[Elias de Barjols]], [[Elias Fonsalada]], [[Falquet de Romans]], [[Guillem Magret]], [[Guiraut de Calanso]], [[Nicoletto da Torino]], [[Peire Raimon de Tolosa]], [[Peire Rogier]], [[Peire de Valeira]], [[Peirol]], [[Pistoleta]], [[Perdigon]], [[Salh d'Escola]], [[Uc de la Bacalaria]], [[Uc Brunet]], and [[Uc de Saint Circ]] were jongleur-troubadours.

===''Vidas'' and ''razos''===

A ''vida'' is a brief prose biography, written in [[Occitan]], of a troubadour. The word ''vida'' means "life" in Occitan. In the [[chansonnier]]s, the manuscript collections of medieval troubadour poetry, the works of a particular author are often accompanied by a short prose biography. The ''vidas'' are important early works of vernacular prose nonfiction. Nevertheless, it appears that many of them derive their facts from literal readings of their objects' poems, which leaves their historical reliability in doubt. Most of the ''vidas'' were composed in Italy in the 1220s, many by [[Uc de Saint Circ]].

A ''razo'' (from Occitan for "reason") was a similar short piece of Occitan prose detailing the circumstances of a particular composition. A ''razo'' normally introduced the poem it explained; it might, however, share some of the characteristics of a ''vida''. The ''razos'' suffer from the same problems as the ''vidas'' in terms of reliability. Many are likewise the work of Uc de Saint Circ.

[[File:Perceval Doria.jpg|thumb|right|Late 16th-century Italian cursive on paper, recording a song of Perceval Doria]]

===''Podestà''-troubadours===
A phenomenon arose in Italy, recognised around the turn of the 20th century by Giulio Bertoni, of men serving in several cities as ''[[podestà]]s'' on behalf of either the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph or Ghibelline]] party and writing political verse in Occitan rhyme. These figures generally came from the urban middle class. They aspired to high culture and though, unlike the nobility, they were not patrons of literature, they were its disseminators and its readers.

The first ''podestà''-troubadour was [[Rambertino Buvalelli]], possibly the first native Italian troubadour, who was ''podestà'' of [[Genoa]] between 1218 and 1221. Rambertino, a Guelph, served at one time or another as ''podestà'' of [[Brescia]], [[Milan]], [[Parma]], [[Mantua]], and [[Verona]]. It was probably during his three-year tenure there that he introduced Occitan lyric poetry to the city, which was later to develop a flourishing Occitan literary culture.

Among the ''podestà''-troubadours to follow Rambertino, four were from Genoa: the Guelphs [[Luca Grimaldi]], who also served in Florence, Milan, and [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]], and [[Luchetto Gattilusio]], who served in Milan, [[Cremona]], and Bologna, and the Ghibellines [[Perceval Doria]], who served in [[Arles]], [[Avignon]], [[Asti]], and [[Parma]], and [[Simon Doria]], sometime ''podestà'' of [[Savona]] and [[Albenga]]. Among the non-Genoese ''podestà''-troubadours was [[Alberico da Romano]], a nobleman of high rank who governed [[Vicenza]] and [[Treviso]] as variously a Ghibelline and a Guelph. He was a patron as well as a composer of Occitan lyric.

Mention should be made of the Provençal troubadour [[Isnart d'Entrevenas]], who was ''podestà'' of Arles in 1220, though he does not fit the phenomenon Giulio Bertoni first identified in Italy.

===Trobairitz===
{{main|Trobairitz}}
The ''trobairitz'' were the female troubadours, the first female composers of [[secular music]] in the Western tradition. The word ''trobairitz'' was first used in the 13th-century ''[[Romance of Flamenca]]'' and its derivation is the same as that of ''trobaire'' but in feminine form. There were also female counterparts to the ''joglars'': the ''[[joglaresse|joglaresas]]''. The number of trobairitz varies between sources: there were twenty or twenty-one named trobairitz, plus an additional poet known only as [[Domna H.]] There are several anonymous texts ascribed to women; the total number of trobairitz texts varies from twenty-three (Schultz-Gora), twenty-five ([[Pierre Bec|Bec]]), thirty-six (Bruckner, White, and Shepard), and forty-six (Rieger). Only one melody composed by a trobairitz (the [[Beatritz de Dia|Comtessa de Dia]]) survives. Out of a total of about 450 troubadours and 2,500 troubadour works, the trobairitz and their corpus form a minor but interesting and informative portion. They are, therefore, quite well studied.

[[File:BnF ms. 12473 fol. 110v - Na Castelloza (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Castelloza]]

The trobairitz were in most respects as varied a lot as their male counterparts, with the general exceptions of their poetic style and their provenance. They wrote predominantly ''[[cansos]]'' and ''[[tenso]]s''; only one ''sirventes'' by a named woman, [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]], survives (though two anonymous ones are attributed to women). One ''[[salut d'amor]]'', by a woman ([[Azalais d'Altier]]) to a woman ([[Clara d'Anduza]]) is also extant and one anonymous ''[[planh]]'' is usually assigned a female authorship. They wrote almost entirely within the ''[[trobar leu]]'' style; only two poems, one by [[Lombarda]] and another [[Alais, Yselda, and Carenza]], are usually considered to belong to the more demanding ''[[trobar clus]]''. None of the trobairitz were prolific, or if they were their work has not survived. Only two have left us more than one piece: the Comtessa de Dia, with four, and [[Castelloza]], with three or four. One of the known trobairitz, [[Gaudairença]], wrote a song entitled ''Coblas e dansas'', which has not survived; no other piece of hers has either.

The trobairitz came almost to a woman from [[Occitania]]. There are representatives from the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], [[Provence]], [[Languedoc]], the [[Dauphiné]], [[Toulousain]], and the [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]]. One trobairitz, [[Ysabella (trobairitz)|Ysabella]], may have been born in [[Périgord]], Northern Italy, [[Latin Empire|Greece]], or [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Palestine]]. All the trobairitz whose families we know were high-born ladies; only one, Lombarda, was probably of the merchant class. All the trobairitz known by name lived around the same time: the late 12th and the early 13th century (c. 1170 – c. 1260). The earliest was probably [[Tibors de Sarenom]], who was active in the 1150s (the date of her known composition is uncertain). The latest was either [[Garsenda of Forcalquier]], who died in 1242, though her period of poetic patronage and composition probably occurred a quarter century earlier, or [[Guilleuma de Rosers]], who composed a ''tenso'' with [[Lanfranc Cigala]], known between 1235 and 1257. There exist brief prose biographies—''[[Vida (Occitan literary form)|vidas]]''—for eight trobairitz: [[Almucs de Castelnau]] (actually a ''[[razo]]''), [[Azalais de Porcairagues]], the Comtessa de Dia, Castelloza, [[Iseut de Capio]] (also a ''razo''), Lombarda, [[Maria de Ventadorn]], and Tibors de Sarenom.

==Works==

===Schools and styles===

Three main styles of Occitan lyric poetry have been identified: the ''[[trobar leu]]'' (light), ''[[trobar ric]]'' (rich), and ''[[trobar clus]]'' (closed, [[Hermeticism|hermetic]]). The first was by far the most common: the wording is straightforward and relatively simple compared to the ''ric'' and literary devices are less common than in the ''clus''. This style was the most accessible and it was immensely popular. The most famous poet of the ''trobar leu'' was [[Bernart de Ventadorn]]. The ''trobar clus'' regularly escapes modern scholarly interpretation. Words are commonly used metaphorically and symbolically and what a poem appears to be about on its surface is rarely what is intended by the poet or understood by audiences "in the know". The ''clus'' style was invented early by [[Marcabru]] but only favoured by a few masters thereafter. The ''trobar ric'' style is not as opaque as the ''clus'', rather it employs a rich vocabulary, using many words, rare words, invented words, and unusual, colourful wordings.

Modern scholars recognise several "schools" in the troubadour tradition. Among the earliest is a school of followers of Marcabru, sometimes called the "Marcabrunian school": [[Bernart Marti]], [[Bernart de Venzac]], [[Gavaudan]], and [[Peire d'Alvernhe]]. These poets favoured the ''trobar clus'' or ''ric'' or a hybrid of the two. They were often moralising in tone and critical of contemporary courtly society. Another early school, whose style seems to have fallen out of favour, was the "Gascon school" of [[Cercamon]], [[Peire de Valeira]], and [[Guiraut de Calanso]]. Cercamon was said by his biographer to have composed in the "old style" (''la uzansa antiga'') and Guiraut's songs were ''d'aquella saison'' ("of that time"). This style of poetry seems to be attached to early troubadours from [[Gascony]] and was characterised by references to nature: leaves, flowers, birds, and their songs. This Gascon "literary fad" was unpopular in [[Provence]] in the early 13th century, harming the reputation of the poets associated with it.

In the late 13th century a school arose at [[Béziers]], once the centre of pre-Albigensian Languedoc and of the Trencavel lordships, in the 1260s–80s. Three poets epitomise this "school": [[Bernart d'Auriac]], [[Joan Esteve]], [[Joan Miralhas]], and [[Raimon Gaucelm]]. All three were natives of Béziers and lived there. All three were members of the urban middle class and no courtesans: Miralhas was possibly a potter and Bernart was a ''mayestre'' (teacher). All three were supporters of the French king [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] and the French aristocracy against the native Occitan nobility. They have been described as "Gallicised". Raimon Gaucelm supported the [[Eighth Crusade]] and even wrote a ''planh'', the only known one of its kind, to a burgher of Béziers. Joan Esteve and Bernart both composed in support of the French in the [[Aragonese Crusade]]. The Béziers are a shining example of the transformation of Occitania in the aftermath of the Albigensian Crusade, but also of the ability of troubadours to survive it.

===Genres===
Troubadours, at least after their style became established, usually followed some set of "rules", like those of the ''[[Leys d'amors]]'' (compiled between 1328 and 1337). Initially all troubadour verses were called simply ''vers'', yet this soon came to be reserved for only love songs and was later replaced by ''canso'', though the term lived on as an antique expression for the troubadours' early works and was even employed with a more technically meaning by the last generation of troubadours (mid-14th century), when it was thought to derive from the Latin word ''verus'' (truth) and was thus used to describe moralising or didactic pieces. The early troubadours developed many genres and these only proliferated as rules of composition came to be put in writing. The known genres are:
*''[[Alba (poetry)|Alba]]'' (morning song)— the song of a lover as dawn approaches, often with a watchman warning of the approach of a lady's jealous husband
*''[[Arlabecca]]''— a song defined by poetic metre, but perhaps once related to the [[rebec]]
*''[[Canso (song)|Canso]]'', originally ''vers'', also ''chanso'' or ''canço''— the love song, usually consisting of five or six [[stanza]]s with an [[envoi]]
*''[[Cobla (Occitan literary term)|Cobla esparsa]]''— a stand-alone stanza
*''[[Comiat]]''— a song renouncing a lover
*[[Crusade song]] (''canso de crozada'')— a song about the [[Crusades]], usually encouraging them
*''[[Dansa]]'' or ''balada''— a lively dance song with a [[refrain]]
*''[[Descort]]''— a song heavily discordant in verse form and/or feeling
*''[[Desdansa]]''— a dance designed for sad occasions
*''[[Devinalh]]''— a riddle or cryptogram
*''[[Ensenhamen]]''— a long didactic poem, usually not divided into stanzas, teaching a moral or practical lesson
*''[[Enuig]]''— a poem expressing indignation or feelings of insult
*''[[Escondig]]''— a lover's apology
*''[[Estampida]]''— a dance-like song
*''[[Gap (song)|Gap]]''— a boasting song, often presented as a challenge, often similar to modern sports chants
*''[[Maldit]]''— a song complaining about a lady's behaviour and character
*''[[Partimen]]''— a poetical exchange between two or more poets in which one is presented with a dilemma by another and responds
*''[[Pastorela]]''— the tale of the love request of a [[knight]] to a [[shepherdess]]
*''[[Planh]]''— a lament, especially on the death of some important figure
*''[[Plazer]]''— a poem expressing pleasure
*''[[Salut d'amor]]''— a love letter addressed to another, not always one's lover
*''[[Serena (song)|Serena]]''— the song of a lover waiting impatiently for the evening (to consummate his love)
*''[[Sestina]]''— highly structured verse form
*''[[Sirventes]]''— a political poem or [[satire]], originally put in the mouth of a paid soldier (''sirvens'')
*[[Sonnet]] (''sonet'')— an Italian genre imported into Occitan verse in the 13th century
*''[[Tenso]]''— a poetical debate which was usually an exchange between two poets, but could be fictional
*''[[Torneyamen]]''— a poetical debate between three or more persons, often with a judge (like a tournament)
*''[[Viadeyra|Viadeira]]''— a traveller's complaint

All these genres were highly fluid. A cross between a ''sirventes'' and a ''canso'' was a ''meg-sirventes'' (half-''sirventes'').&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes ''canso-sirventes'' or ''sirventes-canso'' was used. [[Bertran de Born]] uses the term ''miei sirventes''.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tenso'' could be "invented" by a single poet; an ''alba'' or ''canso'' could be written with religious significance, addressed to God or the Virgin; and a ''sirventes'' may be nothing more than a political attack. The ''maldit'' and the ''comiat'' were often connected as a ''maldit-comiat'' and they could be used to attack and renounce a figure other than a lady or a lover, like a commanding officer (when combined, in a way, with the ''sirventes'').

[[Peire Bremon Ricas Novas]] uses the term ''mieja chanso'' (half song) and [[Cerverí de Girona]] uses a similar phrase, ''miga canço'', both to refer to a short ''canso'' and not a mixture of genres as sometimes supposed. Cerverí's ''mig'' (or ''meig'') ''vers e miga canço'' was a ''vers'' in the new sense (a moralising song) that was also highly critical and thus combined the ''canso'' and the ''sirventes''. Among the more than one hundred works of Cerverí de Girona are many songs with unique labels, which may correspond more to "titles" than "genres", but that is debatable: ''peguesca'' (nonsense), ''espingadura'' ([[flageolet]] song), ''libel'' (legal petition), ''esdemessa'' (leap), ''somni'' (dream), ''acuyndamen'' (challenge), ''desirança'' (nostalgia), ''aniversari'' (anniversary), ''serena'' (serene).&lt;ref&gt;Frank M. Chambers (1985), ''An Introduction to Old Provençal Versification'', (Darby, PA: Diane Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87169-167-1}}.), pp. 195–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most "Crusading songs" are classified either as ''cansos'' or ''sirventes'' but sometimes separately. Some styles became popular in other languages and in other literary or musical traditions. In [[French literature|French]], the ''alba'' became the ''[[aubade]]'', the ''pastorela'' the ''[[pastourelle]]'', and the ''partimen'' the ''[[jeu parti]]''. The ''sestina'' became popular in [[Italian literature]]. The troubadours were not averse to borrowing either. The ''planh'' developed out of the Latin ''[[planctus]]'' and the sonnet was stolen from the [[Sicilian School]]. The [[basse danse]] (''bassa dansa'') was first mentioned in the troubadour tradition (c. 1324), but only as being performed by jongleurs.

===Performance===
Troubadours performed their own songs. Jongleurs (performers) and ''cantaires'' (singers) also performed troubadours' songs. They could work from [[chansonnier]]s, many of which have survived, or possibly from more rudimentary (and temporary) songbooks, none of which have survived, if they even existed. Some troubadours, like [[Arnaut de Maruelh]], had their own jongleurs who were dedicated to singing their patron's work. Arnaut's ''joglar et cantaire'', probably both a singer and a messenger, who carried his love songs to his lady, was [[Pistoleta]]. The messenger was commonplace in troubadour poetry; many songs reference a messenger who will bring it to its intended ear. A troubadour often stayed with a noble patron of his own and entertained his court with his songs. Court songs could be used not only as entertainment but also as propaganda, praising the patron, mocking his enemies, encouraging his wars, teaching ethics and etiquette, and maintaining religious unity.

The court was not the only venue for troubadour performance. Competitions were held from an early date. According to the ''vida'' of the [[Monge de Montaudon]], he received a [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrow hawk]], a prized hunting bird, for his poetry from the ''cour du Puy'', some sort of poetry society associated with the court of [[Alfonso II of Aragon]]. The most famous contests were held in the twilight of the troubadours in the 14th and 15th centuries. The ''[[jocs florals]]'' held by the [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] at [[Toulouse]], by [[Peter IV of Aragon]] at [[Lleida]], and the [[Consistori de Barcelona|Consistori de la Gaya Sciència]] at [[Barcelona]] awarded floral prizes to the best poetry in various categories, judging it by its accordance with a code called the ''[[Leys d'amors]]''.

Troubadour songs are still performed and recorded today, albeit rarely.
{{Listen|filename=A Chantar2.ogg|title=A chantar m'er|description=The only existing song by a ''trobairitz'' which survives with music.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

===Music===
Troubadour songs were usually [[monophony|monophonic]]. Fewer than 300 melodies out of an estimated 2500 survive.&lt;ref&gt;''The Grove Concise Dictionary of Music'' edited by Stanley Sadie. Macmillan Press Ltd., London.&lt;/ref&gt; Most were composed by the troubadours themselves. Some were set to pre-existing pieces of music. [[Raimbaut de Vaqueyras]] wrote his ''Kalenda maya'' ("The Calends of May") to music composed by jongleurs at [[Montferrat]].

===Grammars and dictionaries===
Beginning in the early 13th century, the spread of Occitan verse demanded grammars and dictionaries, especially for those whose native tongue was not Occitan, such as the Catalan and Italian troubadours, and their imitators. The production of such works only increased with the academisation of the troubadour lyric in the 14th century.

==Legacy==
{{main|Occitan literature}}

===Transmission===
Some 2,600 poems or fragments of poems have survived from around 450 identifiable troubadours. They are largely preserved in songbooks called ''[[chansonnier]]s'' made for wealthy patrons.

Troubadour songs are generally referred to by their [[incipit]]s, that is, their opening lines. If this is long, or after it has already been mentioned, an abbreviation of the incipit may be used for convenience. A few troubadour songs are known by "nicknames", thus ''D'un sirventes far'' by [[Guilhem Figueira]] is commonly called the ''Sirventes contra Roma''. When a writer seeks to avoid using unglossed Occitan, the incipit of the song may be given in translation instead or a title may even be invented to reflect the theme of the work. Especially in translations designed for a popular audience, such as Ezra Pound's, English titles are commonly invented by the translator/editor. There are examples, however, of troubadour songs given Occitan titles in the manuscripts, such as an anonymous ''pastorela'' that begins ''Mentre per una ribeira'', which is entitled ''Porquieira''.

===Table of chansonniers===
The number of Occitan parchment chansonniers given as extant varies between authors, depending on how they treat fragmentary and multilingual manuscripts. Conventionally, fragments are classified as fragments of the surviving chansonnier they most closely resemble and not as chansonniers in their own right. Some chansonniers have received both Occitan and French letters: troubadour D is trouvère H, W is M and X is U. The lettering (''siglas'') was introduced by [[Karl Bartsch]], who placed sources he considered more reliable higher in the alphabet. This system is imperfect, however, since many of the chansonniers produced for an Italian audience are heavily edited and do not necessarily more closely resemble the original compositions. While parchment chansonniers are more durable, paper ones also exist and have received lower-case ''siglas''.&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt and Kay, "Appendix 4", 303–04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paden, "Manuscripts", in Akehurst and Davis, 329.&lt;/ref&gt;
