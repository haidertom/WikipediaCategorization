'''Animalcule''' ("little animal", from Latin ''animal'' + the diminutive suffix ''-culum'') is an older term for a microscopic [[animal]] or [[protozoa]]n. The concept appears to have been proposed at least as early as c. 30 BC, as evidenced by the following translation from [[Marcus Varro]]'s ''Rerum Rusticarum Libri Tres'': 

'Note also if there be any swampy ground, both for the reasons given above, and because certain minute animals, invisible to the eye, breed there, and, borne by the air, reach the inside of the body by way of the mouth and nose, and cause diseases which are difficult to be rid of.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Storr-Best|first1=Lloyd|title=Varro on farming. M. Terenti Varronis Rerum rusticarum libri tres.|date=1912|publisher=G. Bell and Sons|location=London|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some better-known animalcules include: 

* ''[[Actinophryid|Actinophrys]]'', and other [[heliozoa]], called sun animalcules
* ''[[Amoeba proteus|Amoeba]]'', called ''Proteus animalcule''
* ''[[Noctiluca scintillans]]'', commonly called the 'Sea Sparkles'
* ''[[Paramecium]]'', called slipper animalcules
* ''[[Rotifer]]s'', called wheel animalcules
* ''[[Stentor (genus)|Stentor]]'', called trumpet animalcules
* ''[[Vorticella]]'', and other [[peritrich]]s, called bell animalcules

The term was also used by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], the 17th-century [[Preformationism|preformationist]] and the discoverer of [[microorganism]]s, to describe them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buckley|first1=Don MSc|last2=Miller|first2=Zipporah MA(Ed)|last3=Padilla|first3=Michael J PhD|last4=Thornton|first4=Kathryn PhD |last5=Wysession |first5= Michael PhD |title=Indiana Interactive Science Grade 7 |date=2012|page=500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word appears in adjectival form in the [[Major-General's Song]], in which Major-General Stanley sings, "I know the [[binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] of beings animalculous..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.naic.edu/~gibson/poems/gilbert1.html |title=I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General |others=Paragraph #2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6034">'''Automated mineralogy''' is a generic term describing a range of [[analytical solution]]s, areas of [[commercial enterprise]], and a growing field of [[scientific research]] and engineering applications involving largely [[automated]] and [[wikt:quantitative|quantitative]] [[analysis]] of [[mineral]]s, [[rock (geology)|rock]]s and man-made materials.

==Technology==
Automated mineralogy analytical solutions are characterised by integrating largely automated measurement techniques based on [[Scanning Electron Microscopy]] (SEM) and [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS). Commercially available lab-based solutions include [[QEMSCAN]] and Mineral Liberation Analyzer ([[Mineral Liberation Analyzer|MLA]]) from [[FEI Company]], Mineralogic from [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]], INCAMineral from [[Oxford Instruments]], the TIMA  (Tescan integrated mineral analyzer) from [[TESCAN]] and AMICS from [[Bruker]]. The first oil &amp; gas wellsite solution was launched jointly by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] and CGG Veritas in 2011 called RoqSCAN. This was followed approximately 6 months later by the release of QEMSCAN Wellsite by [[FEI Company]].  More recently in 2016, a ruggedized mine site solution for mining and mineral processing was launched by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] called MinSCAN.

==Business==
The business of automated mineralogy is concerned with the [[commercialisation]] of the technology and software in terms of development and marketing of integrated solutions. This includes all aspects of: [[Customer service|service]]; [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]]; [[customer support]]; [[R&amp;D]]; [[marketing]] and [[sales]]. Customers of automated mineralogy solutions include: [[laboratory|laboratory facilities]]; [[Mining|mine sites]], [[well sites]], and [[research institute|research institutions]].

==Applications==
Automated mineralogy solutions are applied in a variety of fields requiring statistically reliable, quantitative mineralogical information. These include the following sectors: [[mining]];&lt;ref&gt;Goodall, W.R., Scales, P.J., Butcher, A.R. 2005.

==History of the use of the term==
The first recorded use of the term ''automated mineralogy'' in technical journals can be traced back to seminal papers in the late eighties early nineties describing [[QEMSCAN]] technology and applications.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, D.,  Gottlieb, P.,  Jackson, R., Wilkie, G., Stewart, P. 1988. Measurement in section of particles of known composition. ''Minerals Engineering'', '''1''', 4, 317-326. {{doi|10.1016/0892-6875(88)90021-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, D.N.,  Gottlieb, P. 1991. Application of automated quantitative mineralogy in mineral processing . ''Minerals Engineering'', '''4''', 7-11, 753-762. {{doi|10.1016/0892-6875(91)90063-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained significant popularity after it was used to name a new international conference in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.min-eng.com/automatedmineralogy06/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6300">'''BeeLine Reader''' is a software system which adds color gradients to digital text to improve reading ability and focus. The text at the end of each line is colored the same as the beginning of the next, so the color of the text acts as a flagpost that directs the reader's eyes through the text more easily. In each line, the color of the text transitions from one color to another, with each character being slightly different than the preceding and following characters. 

The system is available as an extension in [[Google Chrome]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beeline-reader/ifjafammaookpiajfbedmacfldaiamgg?hl=en|title=BeeLine Reader|website=chrome.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/beelinereader/|title=BeeLine Reader – Add-ons for Firefox|website=addons.mozilla.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as a PDF viewer&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beeline-reader-pdf-viewer/pmeknoingfjncbdhempgnkdgojickcko/overview|title=BeeLine Reader PDF Viewer|website=chrome.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and as an iOS app&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beeline-reader/id938026867?mt=8|title=BeeLine Reader|website=App Store|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/a-better-way-to-read/482127/ |title=A Better Way to Read—in Color |last=Hamblin |first=James |work=The Atlantic |access-date=2018-05-12 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mind"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schneps |first=Matthew |date=2015-01-01 |title=Using Technology to Break the Speed Barrier of Reading |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286935964_Using_Technology_to_Break_the_Speed_Barrier_of_Reading |journal=Scientific American MIND}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cc"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rodrigue |first=Tanya K. |date=2017-12-01 |title=The Digital Reader, The Alphabetic Writer, and The Space Between: A Study in Digital Reading and Source-Based Writing |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S8755461516301062 |journal=Computers and Composition |language=en |volume=46 |pages=4–20 |doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2017.09.005 |issn=8755-4615}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools are mainly designed for use with web-based text, but can also be used to read Amazon Kindle books on iPad and via browser extension.

==Overview==
CSTARS is a state-of-the-art real-time satellite reception and analysis facility located in southern [[Miami-Dade county, Florida]]. Its mission is collect [[satellite imagery]] for environmental monitoring of [[hurricanes]], [[volcanoes]], [[landslides]] and other natural or man made [[disasters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/spring03/journal.html#ujstory6 "CSTARS yields new perspectives on Earth" Miami Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013213304/http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/spring03/journal.html#ujstory6 |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the University of Miami purchased the [[United States Naval Observatory]] Secondary National Time Standard Facility. The purchase included {{convert|78|acre|m2}} of land with several buildings and a 20-meter [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] once used for [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miami.edu/research/10oct2002.pdf "Research Notes" eVeritas]&lt;/ref&gt; This large antenna is currently used to support scientific communications with the [[Antarctic]] (on behalf of the [[National Science Foundation]]). Two 11 meter [[X-band]] antennas were added to create a high bandwidth data reception capability for the [[downlink]] of satellite image data. Scientists and staff perform research and analysis activities on-site as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/about-cstars About CSTARS ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708043628/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/about-cstars |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station mask covers a very large area stretching from [[Hudson Bay]] in northeastern Canada down to northern [[South America]] in the south.  The mask includes [[Central America]], the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Caribbean Basin]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and much of the Eastern US including [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/technical-aspects CSTARS Coverage Area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708042258/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/technical-aspects |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CSTARS provides a [[VoIP]] communication system for the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]].&lt;ref name=dhs/&gt;

CSTARS is located on the Richmond campus of the [[University of Miami]] at {{Coord|25.6137|-80.384|display=inline,title}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/facility CSTARS Site Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708041603/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/facility |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hurricane Katrina Damage Assessment and Disaster Relief ==
CSTARS played a vital role in the damage assessment and relief efforts of [[New Orleans]] and the [[Gulf Coast]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2005/09/ Soundings Sep. 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004074650/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2005/09/ |date=October 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first remote sensing images illustrating the extent of the [[flooding]] in New Orleans were collected at CSTARS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spotimage.fr/web/en/910-new-orleans-usa.php SPOT Imagery of New Orleans, Aug. 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ==
The United States [[Department of Homeland Security]] has included CSTARS as one of its "Centers of Excellence" so that CSTARS will work with the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] to research [[port]] security and maritime [[Environmental monitoring|monitoring]] issues.&lt;ref name=dhs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/pressreleases/20080304-cstars.html|title=University of Miami’s CSTARS To Form Part of U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Center of Excellence for Maritime Security|work=Press Release|date=March 4, 2008|accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2008/09/soundings_09-08.pdf CSTARS: PROTECTING OUR PORTS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725003309/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2008/09/soundings_09-08.pdf |date=July 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project with Office of Naval Research (ONR) ==
The [[Office of Naval Research]] awarded CSTARS a grant to support satellite based research studies on internal [[Swell (ocean)|waves]] and [[typhoons]] in the western [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/1,1770,2593-1;65847-3,00.html A Wave of Support for Satellite Research]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211031615/http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/1%2C1770%2C2593-1%3B65847-3%2C00.html |date=February 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Palau ==
CSTARS participated in a [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] study to examine how to protect one of the largest Marine Protected (MPA) areas in the world through the utilization of commercially available earth imaging satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2016/05/palau_monitoring_control_and_surveillance.pdf ''The Republic of Palau Exclusive Economic Zone MONITORING, CONTROL, AND SURVEILLANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admiral James G. Stavridis on CSTARS ==
Admiral [[James Stavridis]], former commanding officer of [[United States Southern Command]], writes about CSTARS in his book [https://web.archive.org/web/20120819083952/http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis.html ''Partnership for the Americas'']. In chapter 7 entitled "Innovation", he describes how CSTARS aided SOUTHCOM in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts during his tenure in the SOUTHCOM AOR (i.e., in Latin America and the Caribbean):

{{quotation|Another success story can be found in an academia innovation partnership formed with the University of Miami’s Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS). The concept of using CSTARS was to determine how well access to a constellation of unclassified commercial satellites could support traditional Southern Command missions. Initial demonstrations were conducted with promising results. Subsequent letters of endorsements and demand signals for future use of CSTARS were published and promulgated to various centers of excellence and a funding mechanism was established within Southern Command. Within a year of the initial CSTARS demonstrations, hurricanes ravaged Haiti in 2008 and Southern Command responded with assistance, including an impromptu emergency redeployment of USS Kearsarge from its previously scheduled mission. Assessment of inland damage caused by the hurricanes was a critical need to the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts, and CSTARS provided vital imagery to those operations to quickly determine areas of highest damage and evaluation of inland infrastructure. Unclassified CSTARS imagery and information were then rapidly broadcast and distributed to both DOD and interagency responders via unclassified email. This response was only possible due to the groundwork laid during the initial CSTARS demonstration and a long-term vision for follow-on support made possible by CSTARS to Southern Command.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis-ch7.html ''Partnership for the Americas''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917043652/http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis-ch7.html |date=September 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Overview==
Unlike traditional engineering disciplines, engineering science/physics is not necessarily confined to a particular branch of science, engineering or physics. Instead, engineering science/physics is meant to provide a more thorough grounding in [[applied physics]] for a selected specialty such as [[optics]], [[quantum physics]], [[materials science]], [[applied mechanics]], [[electronics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[microfabrication]], [[microelectronics]], [[computing]], [[photonics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[nuclear engineering]], [[biophysics]], [[control theory]], [[aerodynamics]], [[energy]], [[solid-state physics]], etc. It is the discipline devoted to creating and optimizing engineering solutions through enhanced understanding and integrated application of mathematical, scientific, statistical, and engineering principles. The discipline is also meant for cross-functionality and bridges the gap between theoretical science and practical engineering with emphasis in [[research]] and development, design, and analysis.

It is notable that in many languages the term for "engineering physics" would be directly translated into [[English language|English]] as "technical physics". In some countries, both what would be translated as "engineering physics" and what would be translated as "technical physics" are disciplines leading to academic degrees, with the former specializing in nuclear power research, and the latter closer to engineering physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2001/10/07/0655.htm | title=2002 Applications for graduate study open in Shanghai Research Institute of Technical Physics (上海技术物理研究所2002年招生) | publisher=Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院) | date=2001-10-07 | accessdate=2008-09-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080607130833/http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2001/10/07/0655.htm &lt;!--Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some institutions, an engineering (or applied) physics major is a discipline or specialization within the scope of engineering science, or applied science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eas.caltech.edu/ Division of Engineering and Applied Science, California Institute of Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/majors/engineering_physics.htm Engineering Physics, Division of Engineering Science, University of Toronto]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beam.vt.edu/about/esm.php Engineering Science and Mechanics program at Virginia Tech]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many universities, engineering science programs may be offered at the levels of B.Tech, [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]], [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] Usually, a core of basic and advanced courses in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[biology]] forms the foundation of the [[curriculum]], while typical elective areas may include [[fluid dynamics]], [[quantum physics]], [[economics]], [[plasma physics]], [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], [[solid mechanics]], [[operations research]], [[quantitative finance]], information technology and engineering, [[dynamical systems]], [[bioengineering]], [[environmental engineering]], computational engineering, engineering mathematics and [[statistics]], [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state device]]s, [[materials science]], [[electromagnetism]], [[nanoscience]], [[nanotechnology]], [[energy]], and [[optics]]. While typical undergraduate engineering programs generally focus on the application of established methods to the design and analysis of engineering solutions, undergraduate program in engineering science focuses on the creation and use of more advanced experimental or computational techniques where standard approaches are inadequate (i.e., development of engineering solutions to contemporary problems in the physical and life sciences by applying fundamental principles).

[[File:Memento Timeline.png|thumb|230px|Timeline of fabula vs syuzhet in ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'']]
'''Fabula''' ({{lang-rus|фабула|p=ˈfabʊlə}}) and '''syuzhet'''&lt;ref&gt;Also [[romanization of Russian|romanised]] as ''sjuzhet'', ''sujet'', ''sjužet'', ''siuzhet'' or ''suzet''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-rus|сюжет|p=sʲʊˈʐɛt|a=Ru-сюжет.ogg}}) are terms originating in [[Russian formalism]] and employed in [[narratology]] that describe [[narrative]] construction. Syuzhet is an employment of narrative and fabula is the chronological order of the events contained in the story. They were first used in this sense by [[Vladimir Propp]] and [[Viktor Shklovsky]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The fabula is "the raw material of a story", and syuzhet is "the way a story is organized".&lt;ref&gt;Cobley, Paul. "Narratology." The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics]]'', narrative plots are supposed to have a beginning, middle and end. This is often achieved in film and novels via [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s or [[flashforward]]s. For example, the film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' starts with the death of the main character, and then tells his life through flashbacks interspersed with a journalist's present-time investigation of Kane's life. The fabula of the film is the actual story of Kane's life the way it happened in chronological order, while the syuzhet is the way the story is told throughout the movie, including flashbacks.

==Critical reviews==

===Poststructuralism===
[[Jonathan Culler]] in ''The Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction'' (1981) notes a certain contradiction in assigning priority to either fabula or syuzhet (170-172). The operative assumption amongst many literary critics is that fabula precedes the syuzhet, which provides one of many ways of rendering what took place in the story. Culler argues that one can also understand fabula as a production of the syuzhet, whereby certain events are created and ordered at the level of story in order to produce a meaningful narrative. Critics, he argues, subscribe to a view in which fabula precedes syuzhet when debating the significance of a character's actions, but adopt the opposite view when they discuss the "appropriateness" of a narrative's ending (178). 

[[Jacques Derrida]] (1979) is also critical of the logocentric hierarchic ordering of syuzhet and fabula. He raises the question, "What if there are story ways of telling as well as narrative ways of telling? And if so, how is it that narrative in the American-European tradition has become privileged over story?" One answer is that narrative is both syuzhet (employment) and a subjection of fabula (the stuff of story, represented through narrative). For example, Derrida views narrative as having a terrible secret, in its way of oppressing story:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question-of-narrative covers, with a certain modesty, a demand for narrative, a violent putting-to-the-question, an instrument of torture working to wring out the narrative as if it were a terrible secret, in ways that can go from the most archaic police methods to refinements for making (and even letting) one talk unsurpassed in neutrality and politeness, most respectfully medical, psychiatric, and even psychoanalytic. (Derrida, 1979: 94).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If story is more than fabula, dominated by narrative, it could have its own manner of discourse, rather than being subordinate to narrative. Derrida plays with just such an idea as follows in setting story in relation to its homonym:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each "story" (and each occurrence of the word "story", each "story" in the story) is part of the other, makes the other part (of itself), each "story" is at once larger and smaller than itself, includes itself without including (or comprehending) itself, identifies itself with itself even as it remains utterly different from its homonym. (Derrida, 1979: 99-100).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Symbolic interactionism===
[[Jerome Bruner]] also raises issues about fabula and syuzhet. He summarizes syuzhet as the plot of narrative, and fabula as a timeless underlying theme (Bruner, 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;7, 17-21). Bruner wants fabula to be a little more "loose fitting a constraint" on story: "I think we would do well with as loose fitting a constraint as we can manage concerning what a story must 'be' to be a story" (p.&amp;nbsp;17).

The problem for Bruner is to explore the underlying narrative structures (syuzhets) in not only Russian formalism, but also [[Structuralism|French Structuralism]] ([[Roland Barthes]], [[Tzvetan Todorov]] and others). The European formalists posit narrative grammars (i.e. Todorov's simple transformations of mode, intention, result, manner, aspect and status, as well as complex transformations of appearance, knowledge, supposition, description, subjectification and attitude). For Bruner, the story (fabula stuff) becomes the "virtual text" (p.&amp;nbsp;32) to the narrative grammars. "Nevertheless, Shotter suggests that Bruner failed to engage these 'particularities of otherness' in favour of abstractive explanation of meaning-making processes rather than in a description of dialogical performances" (Mos, 2003: 2). In other words, there is a need to consider how narrative pursues grammars and abstract meaning frames, whereas story can be dialogic and in the web of the social.

===Language studies===
[[Mikhail Bakhtin]] is also not convinced that fabula and syuzhet is a complete explanation of the relationship of narrative and story. Like Derrida, he is suspicious of the hegemony of narrative over story.

For Bakhtin (1973: 12) "narrative genres are always enclosed in a solid and unshakable monological framework." Story, for Bakhtin, is decidedly more dialogue-based, for example in the "polyphonic manner of the story" (Bakhtin, 1973: 60).

[[Benjamin Whorf]] (1956: 256), following up an observation by [[Franz Boas]], contended that the [[Hopi]] Indians do not experience themselves, or life as narrative grammar, or pattern. Rather than past-present-future, as segregated syuzhet, the Hopi experience is one of "eventing." Shotter (1993: 109) refers to Whorf's "eventing" and to the Hopi's differences with Euro-American space and time.

A '''flat grave''' is a [[burial]] in a simple oval or rectangular pit. The pit is filled with earth, but the grave is not marked above the surface by any means such as a [[tumulus]] or upstanding earthwork.&lt;ref name=darv /&gt; Both intact human bodies (skeletal grave) and cremated remains (urn grave) were buried in the graves.

==History==
This simple method of burial was used often by [[prehistory|prehistoric]] peoples. It was used during the [[Funnelbeaker culture]] and [[Corded Ware culture]]. It was characteristic of the [[Urnfield culture]] which stored cremated remains in [[urn]]s and buried them in flat graves.

Burial customs did not always follow a pattern of continuously increasing sophistication in history. During the early [[La Tène culture]] the deceased were optionally cremated and then interred in tumulus tombs, but this changed during the later period. At that time tumulus tombs became rare and the interment of cremated remains in flat graves was the dominant method of burial again.&lt;ref name=hube /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3762">The '''Freeman law''' is a statement in astronomy which says that [[disk galaxy|disk galaxies]] have the same [[surface brightness]], Σ at the center. It was described in 1970 by [[Ken Freeman (astronomer)|Ken Freeman]].&lt;ref name="McGaugh"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/9505062|last1=McGaugh|first1=S. S|title=Galaxy Selection and the Surface Brightness Distribution|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=110|issue=1995|pages=573|last2=Bothun|first2=G. D|last3=Schombert|first3=J. M|year=1995|doi=10.1086/117543|bibcode=1995AJ....110..573M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Freeman, Kenneth C.|title=On the disks of spiral and S0 galaxies|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=160|issue=3|year=1970|pages=811–830|bibcode=1970ApJ...160..811F|doi=10.1086/150474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Freeman law was confirmed in year 2010 for a sample of 30000 [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] galaxy images &lt;ref name="Fathi"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1009.2692|last1=Fathi|first1=Kambiz|title=Revisiting the Scale Length-mu0 Plane and the Freeman Law in the Local Universe|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=722|pages=L120|year=2010|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/722/1/L120|bibcode=2010ApJ...722L.120F}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it can be used with the [[Tully-Fisher relation]] to determine the [[luminosity]] and therefore distance of an observed galaxy.

However more recently it has been argued that the Freeman law is an effect of [[selection bias]].&lt;ref name="McGaugh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota State University, "{{cite web |url=http://odin.physastro.mnsu.edu/~eskridge/astr225/week10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706235131/http://odin.physastro.mnsu.edu/~eskridge/astr225/week10.html |archivedate=2007-07-06 |df= }}"&lt;/ref&gt; The Freeman law is sometimes called the Fish-Freeman effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Disney, M.|author2=Phillipps, S.|year=1983|title=The visibility of galaxies as a function of central surface brightness|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=205|issue=4|pages=1253–1265|doi=10.1093/mnras/205.4.1253|bibcode=1983MNRAS.205.1253D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fish law==
The '''Fish law''' (or Fish's law) in astronomy is the analogue for the Freeman law with disk galaxies replaced by [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. It was described in 1964 by Robert A. Fish based on photometric results for 29 elliptical galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fish, Robert A.|title=A Mass-Potential Relationship in Elliptical Galaxies and Some Inferences Concerning the Formation and Evolution of Galaxies|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=139|issue=1|year=1964|pages=284–305|bibcode=1964ApJ...139..284F|doi=10.1086/147753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)==
According to Brada and [[Mordehai Milgrom|Milgrom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brada, Rafael|author2=Milgrom, Mordehai|title=The modified dynamics (MOND) predicts an absolute maximum to the acceleration produced by 'dark halos'|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=512|issue=17|pages=L17|date=December 1998|arxiv=astro-ph/9812117|doi=10.1086/311871|bibcode=1999ApJ...512L..17B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|The acceleration constant of the modified dynamics ([[MOND]]), ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', appears in various predicted regularities pertinent to galaxies. For example, it features as an upper cutoff to the mean surface density (or mean surface brightness translated with ''[[List of common astronomy symbols#Mass comparison|M]]/[[List of common astronomy symbols#Luminosity comparison|L]]'') of galaxies, as observed and formulated in the Freeman law for disks, and of the Fish law for ellipticals.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5068">The '''global hectare''' (gha) is a measurement unit for the [[ecological footprint]] of people or activities and the [[biocapacity]] of the [[earth]] or its regions. One global hectare is the world's annual amount of biological production for human use and human waste assimilation, per hectare of biologically productive land and fisheries.

It measures production and consumption of different products. It starts with the total biological production and waste assimilation in the world, including crops, forests (both wood production and CO2 absorption), grazing and fishing.&lt;ref name="borucke2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Borucke |first=Michael |last2=Moore |first2=David |last3=Cranston |first3=Gemma |last4=Gracey |first4=Kyle |last5=Iha |first5=Katsunori |last6=Larson |first6=Joy |last7=Lazarus |first7=Elias |last8=Morales |first8=Juan Carlos |last9=Wackernagel |first9=Mathis |title=Accounting for demand and supply of the biosphere's regenerative capacity: The National Footprint Accounts’ underlying methodology and framework |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.08.005 |department=The Living Planet Report 2016 cites this paper to explain the "conversion from actual land areas to global hectares." |journal=Ecological Indicators |volume=24 |pages=518–533 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The total of these kinds of production, weighted by the richness of the land they use,&lt;ref name="borucke2013" /&gt; is divided by the number of hectares used. The calculation does not include [[desert]]s, [[glacier]]s, and the [[open ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/frequently_asked_questions/#method2|work=Footprint Basics|publisher=[[Global Footprint Network]]|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Global hectares per person" refers to the amount of production and waste assimilation per person on the planet. In 2012 there were approximately 12.2 billion global hectares of production and waste assimilation, averaging 1.7 global hectares per person.&lt;ref name="lpr2016"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/lpr_2016/ |title=Living Planet Report 2016 |last=WWF |publisher=WWF International |year=2016 |isbn=978-2-940529-40-7 |location=Gland, Switzerland |pages=77 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consumption totaled 20.1 billion global hectares or 2.8 global hectares per person, meaning about 65% more was consumed than produced. This is possible because there are natural reserves all around the globe that function as backup food, material and energy supplies, although only for a relatively short period of time. Due to rapid population growth, these reserves are being depleted at an ever increasing tempo. See [[Earth Overshoot Day]].

Opponents and defenders of the concept have discussed its strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name="question"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Galli |first=Alessandro |last2=Giampietro |first2=Mario |last3=Goldfinger |first3=Steve |last4=Lazarus |first4=Elias |last5=Lin |first5=David |last6=Saltelli |first6=Andrea |last7=Wackernagel |first7=Mathis |last8=Müller |first8=Felix |title=Questioning the Ecological Footprint |url=http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/footprint_PUBLISHED.pdf |journal=Ecological Indicators |volume=69 |pages=224–232 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.04.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The global hectare is a useful measure of biocapacity as it can convert things like [[Human#Diet|human dietary requirements]] into common units, which can show how many [[people]] a certain region on earth can sustain, assuming current [[technology|technologies]] and [[agriculture|agricultural]] methods. It can be used as a way of determining the relative carrying capacity of the earth.

Different hectares of land can provide different amounts of global hectares. For example, a hectare of lush area with high [[rainfall]] would scale higher in global hectares than would a hectare of desert.

It can also be used to show that consuming different foods may increase the earth's ability to support larger populations. To illustrate, [[meat production|producing meat]] generally requires more land and energy than what producing vegetables requires; sustaining a meat-based diet would require a less populated planet.

==Hectare equivalents==
On average, a global hectare can be produced in the area of a standard hectare. A [[hectare]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|k|t|ɛər}}; symbol '''ha''') is a unit of area equal to {{convert|10000|m2|sigfig=6}} (a square 100 metres on each side or 328 feet on each side), 2.471 acres, 0.01 square kilometers, 0.00386102 square miles, or one square [[hectometre]] (100 metres squared).

== United States ==
Though grazing rights have never been codified in [[United States]] law, the concept of such rights descends from the English concept of the commons, a piece of land over which people, often neighboring landowners, could exercise one of a number of traditional rights, including livestock grazing.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, K.R. 2002. Public Lands and Political Meaning: Ranchers, the Government, and the Property Between Them. Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 19th century, the traditional practice of grazing open rangeland in the United States was rarely disputed because of the sheer amount of unsettled open land. However, as the population of the western United States increased in the mid-to-late 19th century, range wars often erupted over the ranchers' perceived rights to graze their cattle as western rangelands deteriorated with overuse.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischner, T. L. 2009. Livestock grazing and wildlife conservation in the American West: historical, policy and conservation biology perspectives. Wild Rangelands: Conserving Wildlife While Maintaining Livestock in Semi-Arid Ecosystems (eds J. T. du Toit, R. Kock and J. C. Deutsch). Chidester, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, p. 235-265. pdoi: 10.1002/9781444317091.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the [[Taylor Grazing Act]] formally set out the federal government's powers and policy on grazing federal lands in the [[western United States]] by establishing the Division of Grazing and procedures for issuing permits to graze federal lands for a fixed period of time. The Division of Grazing was renamed the US Grazing Service in 1939 and then merged in 1946 with the General Land Office to become the [[Bureau of Land Management]], which along with the [[United States Forest Service]] oversees public lands grazing in 16 western states today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/grazing.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, grazing was never established as a legal right in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;Donahue D. 2005. Western grazing: the capture of grass, ground, and government. Environmental Law 35:721-806.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Taylor Grazing Act authorized only the permitted use of lands designated as available for livestock grazing while specifying that grazing permits "convey no right, title, or interest" to such lands.&lt;ref&gt;United States Code of Federal Regulations 4130.2 (c) Retrieved from http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=65dfe1cec94944c989e83b4eb39cd3ba;rgn=div5;view=text;node=43%3A2.1.1.4.92;idno=43;cc=ecfr#PartTop&lt;/ref&gt; Although the regulations stipulated by the Taylor Grazing Act apply only to grazing on Bureau of Land Management lands, the Chief of the Forest Service is authorized to permit or suspend grazing on Forest Service administered property, and many Forest Service grazing regulations resemble those of the Taylor Grazing Act.&lt;ref&gt;United States Code of Federal Regulations 36 § 222.1-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dalmatia ==
In [[Dalmatia]], [[judgment]]s about grazing rights are a fundamental part of the [[jurisprudence]]. The oldest court verdict in Dalmatia in a court case about grazing rights dates from the 14th century. It is a [[usufruct]] of [[property]], which belongs to someone else, or it is a use of a property. Use of someone else's  property requires a [[contract]] (written or not) about the usufruct. The court may declare parts of the contract as unlawful.

If there is no contract, [[common law]] (also called [[case law]]) comes to apply. The decisions on who was allowed to judge on grazing rights cases were different in the [[Middle Ages]], which reasoned in [[tradition]] and in the natural resources in each area, such as water, meadows, lawns and others. Some [[peasant]]s wrote their own [[statute]], like [[Poljica republic]] in 1440. Also, some [[duke]]s wrote together with some peasants their own statute, like [[Law codex of Vinodol]] from 1288.&lt;ref&gt;Magyar Országos Levéltár&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11520">'''Himbo''', a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''him'' and ''[[bimbo]]'', is a [[slang]] term for an attractive but vacuous man. The word was first used in 1988.&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/himbo Merriam Webster Dictionary], retrieved January 22, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term and the [[stereotype]] it describes have generated a range of commentary and reactions from writers, entertainers, linguists, and cultural analysts.

== Etymology and definitions ==

Several dictionaries cite 1988 as the first time the word himbo was used. By then, the word ''bimbo'', which earlier in the 20th century had been used for both males and females, was being used predominately for females, so himbo, a combination of "him" and "bimbo", was coined to refer specifically to males.&lt;ref name=Merriam /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=himbo Etymology online] retrieved January 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'' cites a 1988 ''[[Washington Post]]'' description of a "macho himbo who strutted the Croisette wearing a 16 foot python like a stole around his shoulders and neck".&lt;ref name=Partridge&gt;Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor, The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'', Routledge, Nov 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|Partridge]] defines himbo as "a man objectified by his good looks and presumed lack of intellectual qualities, a man who trades on this image, a gigolo".&lt;ref name=Partridge /&gt;

[[Merriam-Webster]]'s definition is "an attractive but vacuous man".&lt;ref name=Merriam /&gt;

Another slang dictionary emphasizes the sexual connotation of the word, describing it as "a male version of a bimbo, [[whore]] or [[slut]]", and using the example, "He's such a himbo he'd sleep with anything that has a pulse."&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Peckham, ''Urban Dictionary: Freshest Street Slang Defined'', Andrews McMeel Publishing, Apr 24, 2012, p.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in popular culture==

===20th century===

In 1995, Sherry Sylvester of [[CNN]] interviewed male [[Hollywood]] celebrities about the use of the term 'himbo' and sexual objectification of men in entertainment and received a range of reactions. "There's a great word," said actor [[Keanu Reeves]]. "I love that. I read that and laughed my head off." [[Tom Selleck]] said he was "always flattered to be called a sex symbol" but [[Sylvester Stallone]] said he had fought "the stereotype that brawny means brainless" for years. [[David Charvet]] of ''[[Baywatch]]'' noted, "You find yourself doing a show for three years where you are sticking your chest out and your shoulders are back and you're holding in your stomach and you realize that that's so boring after awhile."&lt;ref&gt;Sherry Sylvester, "[http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/hunks Hollywood Hunks-Just a Bunch of Himbos", CNN Los Angeles, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1994 interview, sociologist Michael Kimmel, who analyzes the himbo stereotype in his book ''Manhood in America: A Cultural History'', said there are two types of himbos, those created for women, like the model [[Fabio Lanzoni|Fabio]], or the actor [[Woody Harrelson]], and those created for men, like [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] or [[Sylvester Stallone]]. The man's himbo, says Kimmel, is usually known for having some kind of prowess, like [[Charles Atlas]] or Stallone, whereas the woman's himbo is 'kinder and gentler' like Harrelson or, like Fabio, "a male [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]... famous for doing very little."&lt;ref name=Sentinel&gt;[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-06-16/lifestyle/9406140552_1_fabio-kimmel-white-men Susan Campbell, "Man As Object Becomes A Himbo", ''The Sun-Sentinel'', June 16, 1994], retrieved January 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Kimmel, Manhood in America: A Cultural History Oxford University Press, 2012 -&lt;/ref&gt;

"You could legitimately call it a victory for men, that we now have men famous for doing nothing," Kimmel noted. He also observes that the origin of the himbo stereotype can be seen in mid 20th century television shows, whose audiences were primarily women, "that traditionally present Mother as the all-wise and Father as a bit of a bumbling idiot".&lt;ref name=Sentinel /&gt;

In her 1995 book, ''Beyond the Double Bind: Women and Leadership'', communications professor [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]]
uses bimbo and himbo as examples of 'linguistic reversal' which "creates a range of condemnation applicable to men that mirrors that for women."
"Each of these moves invites us to examine our presuppositions", she states, and "makes it less likely that language penalizing women will be taken for granted in future exchanges." Another example she cites is [[trophy wife]] and [[trophy husband]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Hall Jamieson, ''Beyond the Double Bind: Women and Leadership'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;

Season 1 Episode 8 of the TV series ''[[Oh, Grow Up]]'' was called "Himbo" (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/oh-grow-up/episode-8-season-1/himbo/100334/ TV Guide, 1999], retrieved January 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===

In 2006, ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' editor [[Atoosa Rubenstein]] and psychologist [[Jeff Gardere|Jeff Gradere]] spoke on the [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today Show'']] about the "himbo cultural phenomenon". Rubenstein describes variations of himbos like the Hound Dog Himbo and the Socialite Himbo, and compares current actors to the different categories. ""The girls love [himbos] because they are malleable." she said. "As women become more successful, they want a guy who isn't going to take over their lives....they are the wave of the future." Gradere was more critical of the phenomenon, saying that boys trying to 'dumb down' or use their sexuality to get attention or financial support was no better than girls doing the same thing." "We understand the value of women taking on more masculine roles and men assuming what were once considered more traditional female roles. However, somewhere along the way, himbos have warped this idea and turned it into a free ride at the expense of women, which is disrespectful and manipulative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.com/news/girls-can-be-bimbos-can-guys-be-himbos-wbna13450344 Girls Can Be Bimbos, Can Guys Be Himbos? ''Today'', 2006], retrieved January 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauren Bans of ''[[GQ Magazine]]'' discussed the rise of the himbo character in entertainment in her 2012 article, "Bimbos with Balls", noting the proliferation of "a new breed of buffed up hollow men" was replacing female bimbo characters in shows like ''[[New Girl]]'', ''[[Cougar Town]]'', and ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', ''[[30 Rock]]'', as well as movies like ''[[Magic Mike]]'' and ''[[Showgirls]]''. Citing even earlier himbo appearances in ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'', Bans theorizes that the 21st century has spawned a "Golden Age of himbodom", based on a new Hollywood vision of women as "crass sexual aggressors" who "need subjects to crassly sexually aggress".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gq.com/story/himbos-dumb-muscle-movie-characters-actors-magic-mike Lauren Bans, "The Rise of the Himbo: Bimbos with Balls," GQ, May 9, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the chapter "Let's Hear it for the Boy Toy" of their book ''The Hookup Handbook: A Single Girl's Guide to Living It Up'', authors Jessica Rozler and Andrea Lavinthal describe a variety of himbo 'types' such as actors, bartenders, models, and personal trainers, as well as identifying features of different kinds of "Himbo Hookups", including The Beauty and The Beast Complex, the Sugar Mama, and so on.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jessica Rozler, Andrea Lavinthal, ''The Hookup Handbook: A Single Girl's Guide to Living It Up'', Simon and Schuster, Jun 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Christian Toto criticized the himbo trend as a kind of '[[Sexual objectification|reverse objectification]]' for men, setting a double standard in which it has become more acceptable for men to be sex objects than women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acculturated.com/himbo-problem Christian Toto,"The Rise of the Himbo and the Problem of Reverse Objectification," ''Acculturated.com'', August 11, 2016] retrieved January 24, 2016/&lt;/ref&gt;

Noreen Malone of ''[[The New Republic]]'' correlates the rise of the Himbo stereotype and its "ornamental masculinity" with the disappearance of opportunities for 'real expressions of manly manliness', especially for working class men, as well as to a shift in power dynamics between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Noreen Malone, [https://newrepublic.com/article/105754/noreen-malone-rise-himbo-why-playing-dumb-working-ryan-lochte The Rise of the Himbo, Why Playing Dumb Is Working For Ryan Lochte, ''New Republic'', August 2, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 episode of the TV series ''[[Freddie (TV series)|Freddie]]'' was called "Freddie the Himbo".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/freddie/episode-10-season-1/freddie-the-himbo/192253/ TV Guide, 2006], retrieved January 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Synonyms for himbo include ''bimboy'', ''mimbo'', [[Boy toy (sexual term)|boy toy]] and ''Blank Chuck''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles Jaffe, T''he Hamptons Dictionary: The Essential Guide to Class Warfare'', Red Wheel Weiser, Apr 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tony Thorne, ''Dictionary of Contemporary Slang'', A&amp;C Black, Feb 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jamaica|Jamaican]] version, according to ''Dancehall Dictionary'', which defines himbo as 'a young man paid for his sexual services by an older woman," is 'tadpole'.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Williams, Shawn Grant, ''Dancehall Dictionary: Learning to speak like a Jamaican'', Joan williams, Feb 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech on [[hookup culture]] at [[Chico State University]], a presenter included himbo on a list of synonyms for 'sexually promiscuous man' that also included ''Casanova'', ''ladies man'', ''prostitute'', ''man hoe'', and ''Benedict''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rce.csuchico.edu/sites/default/files/online/wcmaterials/Hooking%20Up%20-%20Sex,%20Alcohol%20and%20Regret.pdf Anna Lind Thomas, ''Hooking Up, Alcohol Sex and Regret'', Chico State University], p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[UK]] reader survey reported in the book ''Language, Power and Society'', himbo was offered as a synonym for [[toy boy]], along with other expressions like ''joy boy'', ''lap chap'', and ''boncubine''.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Thomas, Shân Wareing, ''Language, Society and Power: An Introduction'', Routledge, Sep 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have continued in the late 20th and early 21st centuries to use the original term "bimbo" when referring to someone as an unintelligent, vacuous, or brutish man, such as a reporter's description of [[Dan Quayle]]&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Hall, Beyond the Double Bind: Women and Leadership, Jamieson Oxford University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; or Stephen Richter's reflections on [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2015/08/12/donald_trump_is_the_true_bimbo_megyn_kelly_fox_news_and_a_lesson_in_sexism/ Stephen Richter,"Donald Trump is the True Bimbo", ''Salon.com'', August 12, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobalist.com/donald-trump-outs-himself-as-bimbo/ Stephen Richter, "Donald Trump Outs Himself as a Bimbo," ''The Globalist'', April 4, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land-use forecasting''' undertakes to project the distribution and intensity of [[trip generation|trip generating]] activities in the [[metropolitan area|urban area]].  In practice, land-use models are [[demand]]-driven, using as inputs the aggregate information on growth produced by an aggregate [[economic forecasting]] activity.  Land-use estimates are inputs to the [[transportation planning]] process.

The discussion of land-use forecasting to follow begins with a review of the [[Chicago Area Transportation Study]] (CATS) effort.  CATS researchers did interesting work, but did not produce a transferable forecasting model, and researchers elsewhere worked to develop models.  After reviewing the CATS work, the discussion will turn to the first model to be widely known and emulated:  the Lowry model developed by [[Ira S. Lowry]] when he was working for the [[Pittsburgh Regional Economic Study]].  Second and third generation Lowry models are now available and widely used, as well as interesting features incorporated in models that are not widely used.

Today, the transportation planning activities attached to [[metropolitan planning organization]]s are the loci for the care and feeding of regional land-use models. In the US, interest in and use of models is growing rapidly, after an extended period of limited use.  Interest is also substantial in Europe and elsewhere.

Even though the majority of [[metropolitan planning agencies]] in the US do not use formal land-use models, we need to understand the subject:  the concepts and analytic tools shape how land-use/transportation matters are thought about and handled; there is a good bit of interest in the research community where there have been important developments; and a new generation of land-use models such as [[Land Use Evolution and Impact Assessment Model|LEAM]] and [[UrbanSim]] has developed since the 1990s that depart from these  aggregate models, and incorporate innovations in discrete choice modeling, microsimulation, dynamics, and geographic information systems.

== Land-use analysis at the Chicago Area Transportation Study ==

In brief, the CATS analysis of the 1950s was “by mind and hand” distribute growth.  The product was maps developed with a rule-based process. The rules by which land use was allocated were based on state-of-the art knowledge and concepts, and it hard to fault CATS on those grounds.  The CATS took advantage of [[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]]’s extensive work on the distribution of population densities around city centers.  Theories of city form were available, sector and [[concentric circle]] concepts, in particular.  Urban ecology notions were important at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[University of Michigan]].  Sociologists and demographers at the University of Chicago had begun its series of neighborhood surveys with an ecological flavor.  [[Douglas Carroll]], the CATS director, had studied with [[Amos Hawley]], an urban ecologist at Michigan.

[[Image:DensityGradient.png|right|350px|Stylized Urban Density Gradient]]

Colin Clark studied the population densities of many cities, and he found traces similar to those in the figure.  Historic data show how the density line has changed over the years.  To project the future, one uses changes in the parameters as a function of time to project the shape of density in the future, say in 20 years. The city spreads glacier-like.  The area under the curve is given by population forecasts.

The CATS did extensive land use and activity surveys, taking advantage of the City work done by the Chicago Planning Commission.  Hock’s work forecasting activities said what the land uses—activities were that would be accommodated under the density curve.  Existing land-use data were arrayed in cross section.  Land uses were allocated in a manner consistent with the existing pattern.
	
The study area was divided into [[transportation analysis zones]]:  small zones where there was a lot of activity, larger zones elsewhere.  The original CATS scheme reflected its Illinois State connections.  Zones extended well away from the city. The zones were defined to take advantage of Census data at the block and minor civil division levels.  They also strived for homogeneous land use and urban ecology attributes.

The first land use forecasts at CATS arrayed developments using “by hand” techniques, as stated.  We do not fault the “by hand” technique – the then state of computers and data systems forced it.  It was a rule based land use allocation.  Growth was the forcing function, as were inputs from the economic study.  Growth said that the population density envelope would have to shift.  The land uses implied by the mix of activities were allocated from “Where is the land available?” and “What’s the use now?” Considerations.   Certain types of activities allocate easily: steel mills, warehouses, etc.

Conceptually, the allocation rules seem important.  There is lot of [[spatial autocorrelation]] in urban land uses; it's driven by historical path dependence:  this sort of thing got started here and seeds more of the same.  This autocorrelation was lost somewhat in the step from “by hand” to analytic models.

The CATS procedure was not viewed with favor by the emerging Urban Transportation Planning professional peer group, and in the late 1950s there was interest in the development of analytic forecasting procedures.  At about the same time, similar interests emerged to meet urban redevelopment and sewer planning needs, and interest in analytic urban analysis emerged in political science, economics, and geography.

== Lowry model ==
[[Image:LowryModel.png|right|600px|Flowchart of Lowry model]]

Hard on the heels of the CATS work, several agencies and investigators began to explore analytic forecasting techniques, and between 1956 and the early 1960s a number of modeling techniques evolved. Irwin (1965) provides a review of the status of emerging models.  One of the models, the Lowry model, was widely adopted.

Supported at first by local organizations and later by a [[Ford Foundation]] grant to the [[RAND Corporation]], Ira S. Lowry undertook a three-year study in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.  (Work at RAND will be discussed later.)  The environment was data rich, and there were good professional relationships available in the emerging emphasis on location and regional economies in the Economics Department at the University of Pittsburgh under the leadership of [[Edgar M. Hoover]]. The structure of the Lowry model is shown on the flow chart.

The flow chart gives the logic of the Lowry model.  It is demand driven.  First, the model responds to an increase in basic employment.  It then responds to the consequent impacts on service activities.  As Lowry treated his model and as the flow chart indicates, the model is solved by iteration.  But the structure of the model is such that iteration is not necessary.

Although the language giving justification for the model specification is an economic language and Lowry is an economist, the model is not an economic model.  Prices, markets, and the like do not enter.

A review of Lowry's publication will suggest reasons why his approach has been widely adopted.  The publication was the first full elaboration of a model, data analysis and handling problems, and computations.  Lowry's writing is excellent.  He is candid and discusses his reasoning in a clear fashion.  One can imagine an analyst elsewhere reading Lowry and thinking, “Yes, I can do that.”

The [[diffusion of innovations]] of the model is interesting.  Lowry was not involved in consulting, and his word of mouth contacts with transportation professionals were quite limited.  His interest was and is in housing economics.  Lowry did little or no “selling.”  We learn that people will pay attention to good writing and an idea whose time has come.

The model makes extensive use of [[trip distribution|gravity or interaction decaying with distance]] functions.  Use of “gravity model” ideas was common at the time Lowry developed his model; indeed, the idea of the gravity model was at least 100 years old at the time.  It was under much refinement at the time of Lowry's work; persons such as [[Alan Voorhees]], [[Mort Schneider]], [[John Hamburg]], [[Roger Creighon]], and [[Walter Hansen]] made important contributions.  (See Carrothers 1956).

The Lowry model provided a point of departure for work in a number of places.  Goldner (1971) traces its impact and modifications made.  [[Steven Putnam]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] used it to develop PLUM ([[projective land use model]]) and I(incremental)PLUM.  We estimate that Lowry derivatives are used in most MPO studies, but most of today's workers do not recognize the Lowry heritage, the derivatives are one or two steps away from the mother logic.

== Penn-Jersey model ==
[[Image:Penn-Jersey.png|right|600 px|Flowchart of Penn-Jersey land-use forecasting model]]

The P-J (Penn-Jersey, greater [[Philadelphia]] area) analysis had little impact on planning practice. However, it illustrates what planners might have done, given available knowledge building blocks. It is an introduction to some of the work by researchers who are not practicing planners.

The P-J study scoped widely for concepts and techniques.  It scoped well beyond the CATS and Lowry efforts, especially taking advantage of things that had come along in the late 1950s.  It was well funded and viewed by the State and the [[Federal Highway Administration|Bureau of Public Roads]] as a research and a practical planning effort.  Its director's background was in public administration, and leading personnel were associated with the urban planning department at the University of Pennsylvania.  The P-J study was planning and policy oriented.

The P-J study drew on several factors "in the air". First, there was a lot of excitement about economic activity analysis and the applied math that it used, at first, linear programming.  [[T. J. Koopmans]], the developer of activity analysis, had worked in transportation.  There was pull for transportation (and communications) applications, and the tools and interested professionals were available.

There was work on flows on networks, through nodes, and activity location.  Orden (1956) had suggested the use of conservation equations when networks involved intermediate modes; flows from raw material sources through manufacturing plants to market were treated by Beckmann and [[Jacob Marschak|Marschak]] (1955) and Goldman (1958) had treated commodity flows and the management of empty vehicles.

Maximal flow and synthesis problems were also treated (Boldreff 1955, Gomory and Hu 1962, Ford and Fulkerson 1956, Kalaba and Juncosa 1956, Pollack 1964).  [[Michel Balinski|Balinski]] (1960) considered the problem of fixed cost. Finally, Cooper (1963) considered the problem of optimal location of nodes. The problem of investment in link capacity was treated by Garrison and Marble (1958) and the issue of the relationship between the length of the planning time-unit and investment decisions was raised by Quandt  (1960) and Pearman (1974).

A second set of building blocks was evolving in [[location economics]], [[regional science]], and [[geography]].  Edgar Dunn (1954) undertook an extension of the classic [[von Thünen]] analysis of the location of rural land uses. Also, there had been a good bit of work in Europe on the interrelations of economic activity and transportation, especially during the railroad deployment era, by German and Scandinavian economists.  That work was synthesized and augmented in the 1930s by [[August Lösch]], and his ''[[The Location of Economic Activities]]'' was translated into English during the late 1940s.  Edgar Hoover's work with the same title was also published in the late 1940s. Dunn's analysis was mainly graphical; static equilibrium was claimed by counting equations and unknowns.  There was no empirical work (unlike Garrison 1958). For its time, Dunn's was a rather elegant work.

[[William Alonso]]'s (1964) work soon followed.  It was modeled closely on Dunn's and also was a University of Pennsylvania product.  Although Alonso's book was not published until 1964, its content was fairly widely known earlier, having been the subject of papers at professional meetings and Committee on Urban Economics (CUE) seminars.  Alonso's work became much more widely known than Dunn's, perhaps because it focused on “new” urban problems.  It introduced the notion of bid rent and treated the question of the amount of land consumed as a function of land rent.
	
Wingo (1961) was also available.  It was different in style and thrust from Alonso and Dunn's books and touched more on policy and planning issues. Dunn's important, but little noted, book undertook analysis of location rent, the rent referred to by Marshall as situation rent.  Its key equation was:

&lt;math&gt;
R = Y\left( {P - c} \right) - Ytd
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
''R'' = rent per unit of land,			
''P'' = market price per unit of product,			
''c'' = cost of production per unit of product,
''d'' = distance to market, and
''t'' = unit transportation cost.

In addition, there were also demand and supply schedules.

This formulation by Dunn is very useful, for it indicates how land rent ties to transportation cost.  Alonso's urban analysis starting point was similar to Dunn's, though he gave more attention to market clearing by actors bidding for space.

The question of exactly how rents tied to transportation was sharpened by those who took advantage of the duality properties of linear programming.  First, there was a spatial price equilibrium perspective, as in Henderson (1957, 1958) Next, Stevens (1961) merged rent and transportation concepts in a simple, interesting paper.  In addition, Stevens showed some optimality characteristics and discussed decentralized decision-making.  This simple paper is worth studying for its own sake and because the model in the P-J study took the analysis into the urban area, a considerable step.

Stevens 1961 paper used the linear programming version of the transportation, assignment, translocation of masses problem of Koopmans, Hitchcock, and Kantorovich.  His analysis provided an explicit link between transportation and location rent.  It was quite transparent, and it can be extended simply. In response to the initiation of the P-J study, Herbert and Stevens (1960) developed the core model of the P-J Study.  Note that this paper was published before the 1961 paper.  Even so, the 1961 paper came first in Stevens’ thinking.

The Herbert–Stevens model was housing centered, and the overall study had the view that the purpose of transportation investments and related policy choices was to make Philadelphia a good place to live.  Similar to the 1961 Stevens paper, the model assumed that individual choices would lead to overall optimization.

The P-J region was divided into ''u'' small areas recognizing ''n'' household groups and ''m'' residential bundles.  Each residential bundle was defined on the house of apartment, the amenity level in the neighborhood (parks, schools, etc.), and the trip set associated with the site. There is an objective function:

&lt;math&gt;
\max Z = \sum_{k = 1}^u {\sum_{i = 1}^n {\sum_{h = 1}^m {x_{ih}^k \left( {b_{ih}  - c_{ih}^k } \right)} } } \quad x_{ih}^k  \geq 0
&lt;/math&gt;

	
wherein x&lt;sub&gt;ihk&lt;/sub&gt;  is the number of households in group ''i'' selecting residential bundle ''h'' in area ''k''.  The items in brackets are bih  (the budget allocated by ''i'' to bundle ''h'') and c&lt;sub&gt;ihk&lt;/sub&gt;, the purchase cost of ''h'' in area ''k''.  In short, the sum of the differences between what households are willing to pay and what they have to pay is maximized; a surplus is maximized.  The equation says nothing about who gets the surplus:  it is divided between households and those who supply housing in some unknown way. There is a constraint equation for each area limiting the land use for housing to the land supply available.

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i = 1}^n {\sum_{h = 1}^m {s_{ih} x_{ih}^k } }  \leq L^k 
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
s&lt;sub&gt;ih&lt;/sub&gt; = land used for bundle ''h''
L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = land supply in area ''k''

And there is a constraint equation for each household group assuring that all folks can find housing.

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k = 1}^u {\sum_{h = 1}^m {x_{ih}^k } }  = N_i 
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = number of households in group ''i''

A policy variable is explicit, the land available in areas.  Land can be made available by changing zoning and land redevelopment.  Another policy variable is explicit when we write the dual of the maximization problem, namely:

&lt;math&gt;
\min Z' = \sum_{k = 1}^u {r^k L^k  + \sum_{i = 1}^n {v_i \left( { - N_i } \right)} } 
&lt;/math&gt;

Subject to:

&lt;math&gt;
  s_{ih} r^k  - v_i  \geq b_{ih}  - c_{ih}^k
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
  r^k  \geq 0  
&lt;/math&gt;

The variables are ''r&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' (rent in area ''k'') and ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' an unrestricted subsidy variable specific to each household group.  Common sense says that a policy will be better for some than others, and that is reasoning behind the subsidy variable.  The subsidy variable is also a policy variable because society may choose to subsidize housing budgets for some groups.  The constraint equations may force such policy actions.

It is apparent that the Herbert–Stevens scheme is a very interesting one.  It is also apparent that it is housing centered, and the tie to transportation planning is weak.  That question is answered when we examine the overall scheme for study, the flow chart of a single iteration of the model.  How the scheme works requires little study. The chart doesn’t say much about transportation.  Changes in the transportation system are displayed on the chart as if they are a policy matter.

The word “simulate” appears in boxes five, eight, and nine.  The P-J modelers would say, “We are making choices about transportation improvements by examining the ways improvements work their way through urban development.  The measure of merit is the economic surplus created in housing.”

Academics paid attention to the P-J study.  The Committee on Urban Economics was active at the time.  The committee was funded by the Ford Foundation to assist in the development of the nascent urban economics field.  It often met in Philadelphia for review of the P-J work.  Stevens and Herbert were less involved as the study went along. Harris gave intellectual leadership, and he published a fair amount about the study (1961, 1962). However, the P-J influence on planning practice was nil.  The study didn’t put transportation up front.  There were unsolvable data problems.  Much was promised but never delivered.  The Lowry model was already available.

== Kain model ==
{{tone|date=October 2011}}
[[Image:KainModel (1).png|right|600px|Figure – Causal arrow diagram illustrating Kain's econometric model for transportation demand]]
About 1960, the [[Ford Foundation]] made a grant to the [[RAND Corporation]] to support work on urban transportation problems.  (Lowry's work was supported in part by that grant)  The work was housed in the logistics division of RAND, where the economists at RAND were housed.  The head of that division was then Charles Zwick, who had worked on transportation topics previously.

The RAND work ranged from new technology and the cost of tunneling to urban planning models and analyses with policy implications.  Some of the researchers at RAND were regular employees.  Most, however, were imported for short periods of time.  The work was published in several formats:  first in the RAND P series and RM series and then in professional publications or in book form.  Often, a single piece of work is available in differing forms at different places in the literature.

In spite of the diversity of topics and styles of work, one theme runs through the RAND work – the search for economic policy guides.  We see that theme in Kain (1962), which is discussed by de Neufville and Stafford, and the figure is adapted from their book.

Kain's model dealt with direct and indirect effects.  Suppose income increases.  The increase has a direct effect on travel time and indirect effects through the use of land, auto ownership, and chopice of mode. Work supported at RAND also resulted in Meyer, Kain and Wohl (1964).	These parts of the work at RAND had considerable influence on subsequent analysis (but not so much on practice as on policy).  John Meyer became President of the National Bureau of Economic Research and worked to refocus its lines of work.  Urban analysis Kain-style formed the core of a several-year effort and yielded book length publications (see, e.g., G. Ingram, et al., The NBER Urban Simulation Model, Columbia Univ. Press, 1972).  After serving in the Air Force, Kain moved to Harvard, first to redirect the Urban Planning Department.  After a time, he relocated at the Kennedy School, and he, along with José A. Gómez-Ibáñez, John Meyer, and C. Ingram, lead much work in an economic-policy analysis style. Martin Wohl moved on from RAND, eventually, to Carnegie-Mellon University, where he continued his style of work (e.g. Wohl 1984).

==Policy-oriented gaming ==

The notion that the impact of policy on urban development might be simulated was the theme for a conference at Cornell in the early 1960s; collegiums were formed, several streams of work emerged.  Several persons developed rather simple (from today's view) simulation games.  Land-use development was the outcome of gravitational type forces and the issue faced was that of conflicts between developers and planners when planners intervened in growth.  [[CLUG]] and [[METROPOLIS]] are two rather well known products from this stream of work (they were the [[SimCity]] of their day); there must be twenty or thirty other similar planner vs. developer in the political context games.  There seems to have been little serious attempt to analyze use of these games for policy formulation and decision-making, except for work at the firm Environmetrics.

Peter House, one of the Cornell Conference veterans, established environmetrics early in the 1960s.  It, too, started with relatively simple gaming ideas.  Over about a ten-year period, the comprehensiveness of gaming devices was gradually improved and, unlike the other gaming approaches, transportation played a role in their formulation.  Environmetrics’ work moved into the Environmental Protection Agency and was continued for a time at the EPA Washington Environmental Studies Center.

A model known as River Basin was generalized to GEM (general environmental assessment model) and then birthed SEAS (strategic environmental assessment model) and SOS (Son of SEAS).  There was quite a bit of development as the models were generalized, too much to be discussed here.

The most interesting thing to be noted is change in the way the use of the models evolved.  Use shifted from a “playing games” stance to an “evaluate the impact of federal policy” stance.  The model (both equations and data) is viewed as a generalized city or cities.  It responds to the question: What would be the impact of proposed policies on cities?

An example of generalized question answering is LaBelle and Moses (1983) La Belle and Moses implement the UTP process on typical cities to assess the impact of several policies.  There is no mystery why this approach was used.  House had moved from the EPA to the DOE, and the study was prepared for his office.

== University of North Carolina ==

A group at Chapel Hill, mainly under the leadership of Stuart Chapin, began its work with simple analysis devices somewhat similar to those used in games.  Results include Chapin (1965), Chapin and H. C. Hightower (1966) and Chapin and Weiss (1968). That group subsequently focused on (1) the ways in which individuals make tradeoffs in selecting residential property, (2) the roles of developers and developer decisions in the urban development process, and (3) information about choices obtained from survey research. Lansing and Muller  (1964 and 1967) at the Survey Research Center worked in cooperation with the Chapel Hill Group in developing some of this latter information.

The first work was on simple, probabilistic growth models.  It quickly moved from this style to game-like interviews to investigate preferences for housing.  Persons interviewed would be given “money” and a set of housing attributes – sidewalks, garage, numbers of rooms, lot size, etc.  How do they spend their money? This is an early version of the game The Sims. The work also began to examine developer behavior, as mentioned. (See: Kaiser 1972).

== Reviews and surveys ==

In addition to reviews at CUE meetings and sessions at professional meetings, there have been a number of organized efforts to review progress in land-use modeling.  An early effort was the May 1965 issue of the [[Journal of the American Institute of Planners]] edited by B. Harris.  The next major effort was a Highway Research Board Conference in June, 1967 (HRB 1968) and this was most constructive.  This reference contains a review paper by Lowry, comments by Chapin, Alonso, and others.  Of special interest is Appendix A, which listed several ways that analysis devices had been adapted for use.  Robinson (1972) gives the flavor of urban redevelopment oriented modeling. And there have been critical reviews (e.g. Brewer 1973, Lee 1974).  Pack (1978) addresses agency practice; it reviews four models and a number of case studies of applications.  (See also Zettel and Carll 1962 and Pack and Pack 1977). The discussion above has been limited to models that most affected practice (Lowry) and theory (P-J, etc.) there are a dozen more that are noted in reviews.  Several of those deal with retail and industry location.  There are several that were oriented to urban redevelopment projects where transportation was not at issue.

== Discussion ==

Lowry-derived land-use analysis tools reside in the MPOs.  The MPOs also have a considerable data capability including census tapes and programs, land-use information of varied quality, and survey experiences and survey-based data.  Although large model work continues, fine detail analysis dominates agency and consultant work in the US. One reason is the requirement for environmental impact statements.  Energy, noise, and air pollution have been of concern, and techniques special to the analysis of these topics have been developed.  Recently, interest has increased in the uses of developer fees and/or other developer transportation related actions.  Perceived shortages for funds for highways and transit are one motive for extracting resources or actions from developers.  There's also the long-standing ethic that those who occasion costs should pay. Finally, there is a small amount of theoretical or academic work.  Small is the operative word.  There are few researchers and the literature is limited.

The discussion to follow will first emphasize the latter, theory-oriented work.  It will then turn to a renewed interest in planning models in the international arena. Modern behavioral, academic, or theory-based analysis of transportation and land-use date from about 1965.  By modern we mean analysis that derives aggregate results from micro behavior.  First models were Herbert-Stevens in character.  Similar to the P-J model, they:

* Treated land as the constraining resource and land-use choices given land rent variations as the critical behavior.
* Imagined roles for policy makers.
* Emphasized residential land uses and ignored interdependencies in land uses.
* Used closed system, comparative statics ways of thinking.
* And gave no special attention to transportation.

There have been three major developments subsequently:  
#. Consideration of transportation activities and labor and capital inputs in addition to land inputs,
#. Efforts to use dynamic, open system ways of thinking, and
#. Inquiry into how micro choice behavior yields macro results.

The Herbert-Stevens model was not a behavioral model in the sense that it did not try to map from micro to macro behavior.  It did assume rational, maximizing behavior by locators.  But that was attached to macro behavior and policy by assumed some centralized authority that provided subsidies.  Wheaton (1974) and Anderson (1982) modified the Herbert-Stevens approach in different, but fairly simple, ways to deal with the artificiality of the Herbert-Stevens formulation.

An alternative to the P-J, Herbert-Stevens tradition was seeded when Edwin S. Mills, who is known as the father of modern urban economics, took on the problem of scoping more widely. Beginning with Mills (1972), Mills has developed a line of work yielding more publications and follow on work by others, especially his students.

Using a Manhattan geometry, Mills incorporated a transportation component in his analysis. Homogeneous zones defined by the transportation system were analyzed as positioned x integer steps away from the central zone via the Manhattan geometry.  Mills treated congestion by assigning integer measures to levels of service, and he considered the costs of increasing capacity. To organize flows, Mills assumed a single export facility in the central node.  He allowed capital-land rent trade offs yielding the tallest buildings in the central zones.

Stating this in a rather long but not difficult to understand linear programming format, Mills’ system minimizes land, capital, labor, and congestion costs, subject to a series of constraints on the quantities affecting the system.  One set of these is the exogenously gives vector of export levels. Mills (1974a,b) permitted exports from non-central zones, and other modifications shifted the ways congestion is measured and allowed for more than one mode of transport.

With respect to activities, Mills introduced an input-output type coefficient for activities; aqrs, denotes land input q per unit of output r using production technique s. T.J. Kim (1979) has followed the Mills tradition through the addition of articulating sectors. The work briefly reviewed above adheres to a closed form, comparative statics manner of thinking.  This note now will turn to dynamics.

The literature gives rather varied statements on what consideration of dynamics means.  Most often, there is the comment that time is considered in an explicit fashion, and analysis becomes dynamic when results are run out over time.  In that sense, the P-J model was a dynamic model.  Sometimes, dynamics are operationalized by allowing things that were assumed static to change with time.  Capital gets attention.  Most of the models of the type discussed previously assume that capital is malleable, and one considers dynamics if capital is taken as durable yet subject to ageing – e.g., a building once built stays there but gets older and less effective.  On the people side, intra-urban migration is considered.  Sometimes too, there is an information context.  Models assume perfect information and foresight.  Let's relax that assumption.

Anas (1978) is an example of a paper that is “dynamic” because it considers durable capital and limited information about the future.  Residents were mobile; some housing stock was durable (outlying), but central city housing stock was subject to obsolescence and abandonment.

Persons working in other traditions tend to emphasize feedbacks and stability (or the lack of stability) when they think “dynamics,” and there is some literature reflecting those modes of thought.  The best known is Forester (1968), which set off an enormous amount of critique and some follow on thoughtful extensions (e.g., Chen (ed), 1972)

Robert Crosby in the University Research Office of the US DOT was very much interested in the applications of dynamics to urban analysis, and when the DOT program was active some work was sponsored (Kahn (ed) 1981). The funding for that work ended, and we doubt if any new work was seeded.

The analyses discussed use land rent ideas.  The direct relation between transportation and land rent is assumed, e.g., as per Stevens.  There is some work that takes a less simple view of land rent.  An interesting example is Thrall (1987).  Thrall introduces a consumption theory of land rent that includes income effects; utility is broadly considered.  Thrall manages both to simplify analytic treatment making the theory readily accessible and develop insights about policy and transportation.

Future land use can be forecasted by using methods of Artificial Intelligence and discrete mathematics (Papadimitriou, 2012).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20488">[[File:Hierarchical Model Mental Lexicon.png|thumb|right|280px|Adapted from the Hierarchical Model of Collins and Quillian (1969)]]

The '''mental lexicon''' is defined as a mental dictionary that contains information regarding a word's meaning, pronunciation, syntactic characteristics, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackendoff|first=R.S|title=Foundations of Language: Brain, Meaning, Grammar, and Evolution|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mental lexicon is a construct used in [[linguistics]] and [[psycholinguistics]] to refer to individual speakers' lexical, or word, [[Mental representation|representations]]. However, not all scientists agree as to the utility of the mental lexicon as a scientific construct.

The mental lexicon differs from the [[lexicon]] in that it is not just a general collection of words; instead, it deals with how those words are activated, stored, processed, and retrieved by each speaker. An individual's mental lexicon changes and grows as new words are learned and is always developing, but there are several theorists that argue exactly how this occurs. Some theories about the mental lexicon include the spectrum theory, the [[dual-coding theory]], [[Chomsky]]'s [[Universal grammar|nativist theory]], as well as the semantic network theory. Scientists also study the areas of the brain involved in lexical representations. The following addresses some of the physiological, social, and linguistic aspects of the mental lexicon.

Recent studies have also shown the possibility that the mental lexicon can shrink as an individual ages, limiting the number of words they can remember and learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takashima,|first=H|author2=J Yamada|title=Shrinkage of the mental lexicon of Kanji in an elderly Japanese woman: The effect of a 10-year passage of time.|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology|year=2010|volume=25|pages=105–115|doi=10.1007/s10823-009-9106-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of a second mental lexicon (L2) in bilingual speakers has also emerged as a topic of interest, suggesting that a speaker's multiple languages are not stored together, but as separate entities that are actively chosen from in each linguistic situation.&lt;ref name=jiang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Nan|title=Lexical Representation and Development in a Second Language|journal=Applied Linguistics|year=2000|volume=21|pages=47–77|doi=10.1093/applin/21.1.47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of inquiry==
Although the mental lexicon is often called a mental "dictionary", in actuality, research suggests that it differs greatly from a dictionary. For example, the mental lexicon is not organized alphabetically like a dictionary; rather, it seems to be organized in a more complex manner, with links between phonologically and semantically related lexical items.&lt;ref name = "Jean"&gt;{{cite book | author = Aitchison, Jean | title = Words in the Mind: An Introduction to the Mental Lexicon | location = Malden, MA | publisher = Blackwell | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is suggested by evidence of phenomena such as [[slips of the tongue]], which showed that replacing words such as ''anecdote'' for ''antidote''.&lt;ref name = "Jean"/&gt;

Also, while dictionaries contain a fixed number of words to be counted, and remain outdated as language is continually changing, the mental lexicon consistently updates itself with new words and word meanings, while getting rid of old, unused words. The active nature of the mental lexicon makes any dictionary comparison unhelpful.&lt;ref name = "CLA"&gt;{{cite book | title = Contemporary Linguistic Analysis (5th Custom Edition for U of A) | publisher = Pearson Custom Publishing | location = Toronto, ON | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is continuing to identify the exact way that words are linked and accessed. A common method to analyze these connections is through a [[lexical decision task|lexical decision]]  task.&lt;ref name="CLA"/&gt;

'''Lexical Decision Tasks''' have been used for many years to access how the mental lexicon is structured. Participants in this task are required to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to a string of letters presented on a screen to say if the string is a non-word or a real word.&lt;ref name=altman&gt;{{cite book|last=Altman|first=Gerry|title=The Ascent of Babel: An Exploration of Language, Mind, and Understanding|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0198523777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction times from this task indicate that certain words are more "active" in participants' minds after related words have been presented. An example of this would be to present the word "bread" to the participant and then see an decreased reaction time later to the word "butter". Since the word "bread" had activated all related words, including "butter", this decreased reaction time demonstrates that related words are stored closely in the mental lexicon.&lt;ref name=altman /&gt; By doing lexical decision tasks, researchers have been able to analyze what words are stored with what related counterparts, and what can activate these words.

==Theories and perspectives==
Not all linguists and psychologists believe in the mental lexicon's existence and there is much controversy over the concept. One theory about the mental lexicon states that it organizes our knowledge about words "in some sort of dictionary."&lt;ref name="Access"&gt;{{ cite book | title = Accessing the Mental Lexicon | url = http://homepage.mac.com/gerry_altmann/babel/assets/Chapter-6.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090807014649/http://homepage.mac.com/gerry_altmann/babel/assets/Chapter-6.pdf | archivedate = 2009-08-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another states that the mental lexicon is "a collection of highly complex neural circuits".&lt;ref name = "Access"/&gt; The latter, '''Semantic Network Theory''', proposes the idea of ''spreading activation'', which is a hypothetical mental process that takes place when one of the nodes in the semantic network is activated, and proposes three ways this is done: priming effects, neighborhood effects, and frequency effects, which have all been studied in depth over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forster|first=Kenneth|author2=Chambers|title=Lexical Access and Naming Time|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|date=December 1973|volume=12|issue=6|pages=627–635|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(73)80042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marslen-Wilson|first=William|title=Functional Parallelism in Spoken Word-Recognition|journal=Cognition|date=March 1987|volume=25|issue=1–2|pages=71–102|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90005-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Priming''' is a term used in Lexical Decision Tasks that accounts for decreased reaction times of related words. Interchangeable with the word "activation" in many cases, priming refers to the ability to have related words assist in the reaction times of others. In the example above, the word bread "primed" butter to be retrieved quicker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Traxler|first=Matthew|title=Introduction to Psycholinguistics: Understanding Language Science|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1405198621}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Neighborhood Effects''' refer to the activation of all similar "neighbors" of a target word. Neighbors are defined as items that are highly confusable with the target word due to overlapping features of other words. An example of this would be that the word "game" has the neighbors "came, dame, fame, lame, name, same, tame, gale, gape, gate, and gave," giving it a neighborhood size of 11 because 11 new words can be constructed by only changing 1 letter of "game". The neighborhood effect claims that words with larger neighborhood sizes will have quicker reaction times in a lexical decision task suggesting that neighbors facilitate the activation of other neighborhood words.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Sally|title=Frequency and Neighborhood Effects on Lexical Access: Activation or Search?|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=September 1989|volume=15|issue=5|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.15.5.802|pages=802–814}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Frequency Effects''' suggest that words that are frequent in an individual's language are recognized faster than words that are infrequent. Forster and Chambers, 1973, found that high frequency words were named faster than low frequency ones, and Whaley, 1978 found that high frequency words were responded to faster than low frequency ones in a lexical decision task.&lt;ref name="Access"/&gt;

In the '''spectrum theory''', at one end "each phonological form is connected to one complex semantic representation", at the opposite end, homonyms and polysemes have their "own semantic representation[s]".&lt;ref name = "Brown"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brown, S. W | title = Polysemy in the Mental Lexicon. Colorado Research in Linguistics | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | year = 2008 |url=http://www.colorado.edu/ling/CRIL/Volume21_Issue1/paper_BROWN.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The middle of the spectrum contains the theories that "suggest that related senses share a general or core semantic representation".&lt;ref name = "Brown"/&gt; The "[[dual coding theory]] (DCT)"&lt;ref name = "Paivio"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Paivio, A | title = Dual coding theory and the mental lexicon | journal = The Mental Lexicon | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–230 | year = 2010 | doi=10.1075/ml.5.2.04pai}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrasts multiple and [[common coding theory|common coding theories]]. DCT is "an internalized nonverbal system that directly represents the perceptual properties and affordances of nonverbal objects and events, and an internalized verbal system that deals directly with linguistic stimuli and responses".&lt;ref name = "Paivio"/&gt; Similarly, we do not observe words "as elements in a data structure" that are "retrieved from memory, but rather as stimuli that alter mental states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Elman, J. L | title = Lexical knowledge without a lexicon? | journal = The Mental Lexicon | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–33 | year = 2011 | doi=10.1075/ml.6.1.01elm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others work around Chomsky's theory that "all syntactic and semantic features are included directly in the abstract mental representation of a lexical word".&lt;ref name = "Paivio"/&gt;

==Development==

=== First language development ===
[[File:Chart updated.jpg|thumb|Average vocabulary size of an English-speaking child by age.]]One aspect of research on the development of the mental lexicon has focused on vocabulary growth. Converging research suggests that at least English children learn several words a day throughout development. The figure at left illustrates the growth curve of a typical English-speaking child's vocabulary size.&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt;

The words acquired in the early stages of language development tend to be nouns or nounlike, and there are some similarities in first words across children (e.g., ''mama, daddy, dog'').&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt; [[Fast mapping]] is the idea that children may be able to gain at least partial information about the meaning of a word from how it is used in a sentence, what words it is contrasted with, as well as other factors. This allows the child to quickly hypothesize about the meaning of a word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heibeck|first=Tracy|author2=Ellen M. Markman|title=Word Learning in Children: An Examination of Fast Mapping|journal=Child Development|year=1987|volume=58|pages=1021–1034|doi=10.2307/1130543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that, despite the [[fast mapping]] hypothesis, words are not just learned as soon as we are exposed to them, each word needs some type of activation and/or acknowledgement before it is permanently and effectively stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Miller |first= G.A |year= 1986|title= Dictionaries in the mind |journal= Language and Cognitive Processes |volume= 1|issue=3 |pages=171–185 |doi=10.1080/01690968608407059}}&lt;/ref&gt; For young children, the word may be accurately stored in their mental lexicon, and they can recognize when an adult produces the incorrect version of the word, but they may not be able to produce the word accurately.&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt;{{Clear}}

As a child acquires their vocabulary, two separate aspects of the mental lexicon develop named the [[lexeme]] and the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]].&lt;ref name=jiang /&gt; The lexeme is defined as the part of the mental lexicon that stores morphological and formal information about a word, such as the different versions of spelling and pronunciation of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levelt | first=Willem| authorlink = Willem Levelt | title=Accessing Words in Speech Production: Stages, Processes and Representations|journal=Cognition|year=1992|volume=42|issue=1–3|pages=1–22|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(92)90038-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lemma is defined as the structure within the mental lexicon that stores semantic and syntactic information about a word, such as part of speech and the meaning of the word. Research has shown that the lemma develops first when a word is acquired into a child's vocabulary, and then with repeated exposure the lexeme develops.&lt;ref name=jiang /&gt;

[[File:Structure of a lexical entry.png|thumb|The Internal Structure of a Lexical Entry (adapted from [[Willem Levelt|Levelt]] 1989).]]

=== Bilingual development ===

The development of the mental lexicon in bilingual children has increased in research over recent years, and has shown many complexities including the notion that bilingual speakers contain additional and separate mental lexicons for their other languages. Selecting between two or more different lexicons has shown to have benefits extending past language processes. Bilinguals significantly outperform their monolingual counterparts on executive control tasks. Researchers suggest that this enhanced cognitive ability comes from continually choosing between L1 and L2 mental lexicons.&lt;ref name=bia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bialystok|first=Ellen|title=Reshaping the Mind: The Benefits of Bilingualism|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2011|volume=65|issue=4|pages=229–235|doi=10.1037/a0025406|pmc=4341987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilinguals have also shown resilience against the onset of Alzheimer's disease, monolinguals being an average of 71.4 years old and the bilinguals 75.5 years old when symptoms of dementia were detected, a difference of 4.1 years.&lt;ref name=bia /&gt;

==Brain==
Studies have shown that the [[temporal lobe|temporal]] and [[parietal lobe|parietal]] lobes in the left hemisphere are particularly relevant for the processing of lexical items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pulvermüller, F. | title = Nouns and verbs in the intact brain: Evidence from event-related potentials and high-frequency cortical responses | journal = Tübingen: Oxford Journals | volume = 9 | pages = 497–506 | year = 1999 | doi=10.1093/cercor/9.5.497}} http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/5/497.short&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are some hypotheses pertaining to semantic comprehension in the brain:

# '''Organized Unitary Content Hypothesis (OUCH):''' this hypothesis posits that lexical items that co-occur with high frequency are stored in the same area in the brain.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adorni, R. |author2=Proverbio, A. | title = New insights into name category-related effects: is the age of acquisition a possible factor? | journal = Milan: BioMed Central | volume = 5 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2009 | pmc=2726156 | pmid=19640289 | doi=10.1186/1744-9081-5-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Domain-Specific Hypothesis:''' this hypothesis uses the theory of evolution to posit that certain categories that have an evolutionary advantage over others (such as useful items like tools) have their specialized and functionally dissociated neural circuits in the brain.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"/&gt;
# '''Sensory/Functional Hypothesis:''' this hypothesis posits that the ability to identify (i.e. be able to recognize and name) living things depends on visual information, while the ability to identify non-living things depends on functional information. Thus this hypothesis implies that modality-specific subsystems compose an overarching semantic network of lexical items.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"/&gt;

==Impaired access ==

[[Anomic aphasia]], [[aphasia]] ([[expressive aphasia|expressive]] + [[receptive aphasia]]) and [[Alzheimer's disease]] can all affect recalling or retrieving words.  Anomia renders a person completely unable to name familiar objects, places and people,&lt;ref name = "Speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speech-therapy-on-video.com/receptiveaphasia.html |title=Improving Receptive Aphasia: Your Source of Information and solutions |publisher=Speech-therapy-on-video.com |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a involves specific naming difficulties; sufferers of anomia have difficulties recalling words.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Anomia is a lesser level of dysfunction, a severe form of the "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon where the brain cannot recall the desired word.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Stroke, head trauma and brain tumors can cause anomia.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt;

Expressive and receptive aphasia are neurological language disorders.&lt;ref name = "Diseases"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alldiseases.org/what-is-a-dysnomia/ |title=What Is A Dysnomia? |publisher=Alldiseases.org |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive aphasia limits the ability to convey thoughts through the use of speech, language or writing.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Receptive aphasia affects a person's ability to comprehend spoken words, causing disordered sentences that have little or no meaning and which can include addition of [[nonce words]].&lt;ref name = "Diseases"/&gt;

Harry Whitaker states that Alzheimer's disease patients are forgetful of proper names. Patients have difficulty generating names, especially with phonological tasks such as words starting with a certain letter.&lt;ref name = "Whitaker"&gt;{{cite book | author = Whitaker, Harry A | title = Concise Encyclopedia of Brain and Language  | chapter =  Alzheimer's Disease | pages = 19–22| location = Oxford, UK: Elsevier Ltd | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have word-retrieval difficulties in spontaneous speech but still have relatively preserved naming of presented stimuli.&lt;ref name = "Whitaker"/&gt; Later, loss of naming of low-frequency lexical items occurs. Eventually, the loss of ability to comprehend and name the same lexical item indicates semantic loss of the lexical item.

== Shrinking ==

The majority of current research focuses on the acquisition and functioning of the mental lexicon, without much focus on what happens to the mental lexicon over time. Current studies suggest that as individuals age, they become less capable of storing and remembering words indicating that their "mental dictionary" is, in fact, shrinking. One study showed that the size of a Japanese woman's healthy mental lexicon of kanji shrank at a rate of approximately 1% per year between ages 83 and 93 on average. This was tested through a simple naming task once when the subject was 83, and then again at the age of 93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takashima|first=H|author2=J Yamada|title=Shrinkage of the mental lexicon of Kanji in an elderly Japanese woman: The effect of a 10-year passage of time |year=2010|volume=25|issue=1|pages=105–115|doi=10.1007/s10823-009-9106-x|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==

===Storage of acronyms===

As research on the mental lexicon continues to expand into our modern world of abbreviations, researchers have begun to question whether the mental lexicon has the capacity to store acronyms as well as words. Using a lexical decision task with acronyms as priming words, researchers saw that acronyms could in fact prime other related information. This finding suggests that acronyms are stored alongside their related information in the mental lexicon just as a word would be. Research also demonstrated that these acronyms would still prime related information despite inaccurate capitalization (i.e. bbc had the same priming effects as BBC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brysbaert|first=M|author2=S Speybroeck |author3=D Vanderelst |title=Is there room for the BBC in the mental lexicon? On the recognition of acronyms.|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2009|volume=62|issue=9|pages=1832–1842|doi=10.1080/17470210802585471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Michelson stellar interferometer''' is one of the earliest [[astronomical interferometer]]s built and used. The interferometer was proposed by [[Albert A. Michelson]] in 1890, following a suggestion by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]].

The first such interferometer built was at the [[Mount Wilson observatory]], making use of its 100-inch (~250&amp;nbsp;centimeters) mirror.  It was used to make the first-ever measurement of a stellar diameter, by Michelson and [[Francis G. Pease]], when the diameter of [[Betelgeuse]] was measured in December 1920. The diameter was found to be 240&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;miles (~380&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;kilometers), about the size of the [[orbit]] of [[Mars]], or about 300 times larger than the [[Sun]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2637">'''Moment-resisting frame''' is a rectilinear assemblage of beams and columns, with the beams rigidly connected to the columns.

Resistance to lateral forces is provided primarily by [[rigid frame]] action – that is, by the development of [[bending moment]] and [[shear force]] in the frame members and joints.  By virtue of the rigid beam–column connections, a moment frame cannot displace laterally without bending the beams or columns depending on the geometry of the connection.  The bending rigidity and strength of the frame members is therefore the primary source of lateral stiffness and strength for the entire frame.&lt;ref&gt;Bruneau, Michel. et al., (2011). ''Ductile Design of Steel Structures''. McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-07-162395-7}}.page 347&lt;/ref&gt;

These connections between beams and columns, are formed through the use of rigid moment connections. A Moment Connection is a joint that allows the transfer of bending moment forces between a column and beam (or any other two members).&lt;ref&gt;[https://skyciv.com/structural-software/connection-design/moment-connections/ Moment Connections]&lt;/ref&gt; This is different to shear or pinned connections that prevent a moment-resisting frame to occur. An examples of this is pinned truss structures.

The [[1994 Northridge earthquake]] revealed a common flaw in steel-frame construction — poorly welded moment connections — and building codes were revised to strengthen them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usgs.gov/news/20-years-after-northridge-quake-buildings-remain-vulnerable "20 Years After Northridge Quake, Buildings Remain Vulnerable."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

Steel moment-resisting frames have been in use for more than one hundred years, dating to the earliest use of structural steel in building construction.  Steel building construction with the frame carrying the vertical loads initiated with the [[Home Insurance Building]] in Chicago, a 10-story structure constructed in 1884 with a height of 138&amp;nbsp;ft, often credited with being the first skyscraper.  This and other tall buildings in Chicago spawned an entire generation of tall buildings, constructed with load bearing steel frames supporting concrete floors and non-load bearing, unreinforced masonry [[infill wall]]s at their perimeters. Framing in these early structures typically utilized "H" shapes built up from plates, and "L" and "Z" sections.&lt;ref&gt;Hamburger, Ron. et al., (2009). ''Seismic Design of Steel Structures''. National Institute of Standards and Technology . NIST GCR 09-917-3.page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multiprotocol Encapsulation''', or MPE for short, is a [[Data link layer]] protocol defined
by [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] which has been published as part of [[ETSI]] [[EN 301 192]]. It
provides means to carry packet oriented protocols (like for instance
[[Internet Protocol|IP]]) on top of [[MPEG transport stream]] (TS).

Another encapsulation method is [[Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation]] (ULE) which was developed and standardized within the [[IETF]] as RFC 4326.
== Protocol Outline ==
MPE uses [[MPEG-2 Private Table]] sections to carry the user
datagrams. The section header is used to convey:

* the frame's destination MAC address
* optional [[ISO/IEC 8802-2]] [[Logical Link Control]] (LLC) and [[ISO/IEC 8802-1]] [[Sub-Network Attachment Point]] ([[Subnetwork_Access_Protocol|SNAP]]) information
* a payload scrambling indication
* a MAC address scrambling indication

MAC addresses from 1 to 6 bytes length may be used. The format of
[[MPEG-2]] [[DSM-CC]] sections happens to be compatible with DVB MPE.

== MPE-based IP Service Offerings ==
===Service Architecture===
A complete IP service offering over MPEG-2 TS can be established by
organizing MPE streams into one or more [[IP Platform]]s carried on a
broadcast network by means of the [[IP/MAC Notification Table]]
mechanism which is also defined in [[ETSI]] [[EN 301 192]].

===Commercial Offerings===

Both major European satellite operators ([[SES S.A.|SES]] and
[[Eutelsat]]) are offering commercial IP services using MPE (such as [[ASTRA2Connect]]) to both businesses and consumers.

NeuroMat has been involved in the development of what has been called the [[Galves-Löcherbach model]], a model with intrinsic stochasticity for biological neural nets, in which the probability of a future spike depends on the evolution of the complete system since the last spike.[1] This model of spiking neurons was developed by mathematicians Antonio Galves and Eva Löcherbach. In the first article on the model, in 2013, they called it a model of a "system with interacting stochastic chains with memory of variable length.

'''Nicolas Appert''' is a [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] study association for [[Food Technology]] students at [[Wageningen University]]. The association is named after the [[France|French]] inventor [[Nicolas Appert]], who can be seen as the first food technologist. The chef Nicolas Appert was researching ways to preserve food for a longer period of time and discovered that heating food products in a closed glass jar would greatly increase its shelflife. A process, nowadays called appertisation.

On September 6, 1962, during a foreign study trip, the study association Nicolas Appert was founded. Nowadays the association is still very active, having good relations with food companies and organising a lot of activities for its members.

Examples of these activities are lectures and excursions from and to food companies, but also social activities such as a sporting or drinks with the departments of Food Processing, Food Chemistry, Food Microbiology, Food Physics and Product Design and Quality Management. All these activities are made possible by the participation of a large group of active, enthusiastic students in committees and the board.

A '''peripheral nerve interface''' is the bridge between the [[peripheral nervous system]] and a [[computer interface]] which serves as a bi‐directional information [[transducer]] recording and sending signals between the human body and a [[machine processing|machine processor]]. Interfaces to the nervous system usually take the form of electrodes for stimulation and recording, though chemical stimulation and sensing are possible.&lt;ref name= "Warren"&gt;Grill, W. M., Norman, S. E., &amp; Bellamkonda, R. V. (2009). Implanted neural interfaces: biochallenges and engineered solutions. Annual review of biomedical engineering, 11, 1–24. doi:10.1146/annurev-bioeng-061008-124927&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area is focused on developing peripheral nerve interfaces for the restoration of function following disease or injury to minimize associated losses. Peripheral nerve interfaces also enable electrical stimulation and recording of the peripheral nervous system to study the form and function of the peripheral nervous system. Many researchers also focus in the area of [[neuroprosthesis]], linking the human nervous system to [[Bionic hand#In medicine|bionics]] in order to mimic natural [[sensorimotor coupling|sensorimotor control]] and function.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;Donaldson PEK (1983). The Cooper cable: An Implantable Multiconductor cable for neurological prostheses. Med Biol Eng Comput 21:371-374&lt;/ref&gt; Successful implantation of peripheral nerve interfaces depend on a number of factors which include appropriate [[indication (medicine)|indication]], [[Perioperative| perioperative testing]], [[Differentiated instruction|differentiated planning]], and functional training.&lt;ref name="NavarroReview"&gt;Navarro, X., Krueger, T. B., Lago, N., Micera, S., Stieglitz, T., &amp; Dario, P. (2005). A critical review of interfaces with the peripheral nervous system for the control of neuroprostheses and hybrid bionic systems. Journal of the peripheral nervous system : JPNS, 10(3), 229–58. doi:10.1111/j.1085-9489.2005.10303.x&lt;/ref&gt; Typically [[microelectrode]] devices are implanted adjacent to, around or within the nerve trunk to establish contact with the peripheral nervous system. Different approaches may be used depending on the type of signal desired and attainable.

==Function==
The primary purpose of a [[neural interface]] is to enable two-way exchange of information with the nervous system for a sustained period of time to enable effective and high density stimulation and recording. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is responsible for relaying information from the brain and spinal cord to the extremities of the body and back. The function of a peripheral nerve interface is to assist the nervous system when peripheral nerve function is compromised. To supplement the roles of the nervous system, interfaces need to augment motor function as well as discern sensory information. The feasibility of peripheral nerve stimulation to achieve a desired motor output has been demonstrated and is one of the major driving forces for this area of research.&lt;ref name="Bhadra"&gt;Bhadra N, Peckham PH. 1997. Peripheral nerve stimulation for restoration of motor function. J. Clin. Neurophysiol. 14:378–93&lt;/ref&gt;  Information throughout the nervous system is exchanged primarily through [[action potential]]s. These signals occur at varying numbers and intervals dependent on both the [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomical]] and [[neurochemical]] make up of the individual and localized region. Information may be either introduced or read out by inducing or recovering action potentials from the body. Successful development and implementation of a peripheral nerve interface would allow for both the introduction of information to the nervous system, and extraction of information from the nervous system.

==Problems and limitations==
Problems and limitations in peripheral nerve interfacing are both biophysical and biological in nature. These challenges&lt;ref name= "Warren" /&gt; include:
*Fidelity of the interface in terms of functional resolution
*Relatively weak, noise-ridden electrical signals causing a challenging interface design constraint
*Interface implantation-associated injury to nerve fibers of interest
*Stability of the interface over time due to inflammation
*Managing inadvertent consequences such as pain or false sensory/motor stimulation due to physical movement or inflammation-associated triggering of neural activity

==Application==

Res. 22:299–304 3.&lt;/ref&gt; restoration of motor function following [[spinal cord injury]] or [[stroke]],&lt;ref name= "Stein"&gt;Stein RB, Peckham PH, Popovic DB, eds. 1992.

==Types==
A wide variety of electrode designs have been researched, tested, and manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6552092&amp;isnumber=6551989|title=M.

Varga, M. Luniak and K. J. Wolter, "Technology for bipolar polycarbonate electrodes applied for intraoperative neuromonitoring," Electronics Packaging Technology Conference (EPTC 2013), 2013 IEEE 15th, Singapore, 2013, pp. 103-107.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These electrodes lie on a spectrum varying in degrees of invasiveness. Research in this area seeks to address issues centered around peripheral nerve/tissue damage, access to efferent and afferent signals, and selective recording/stimulation of nerve tissue. Ideally peripheral nerve interfaces are optimally designed to interface with biological constraints of [[nerve fiber|peripheral nerve fibers]], match the [[list of materials properties#Mechanical properties|mechanical]] and [[list of materials properties#Electrical properties|electrical properties]] of the surrounding tissue, [[biocompatibility|biocompatible]] with minimal immune response, high [[sensor resolution#Resolution|sensor resolution]], are minimally [[Invasiveness|invasive]], and chronically stable with low [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s. Strongest signals are recorded from [[Node of Ranvier|nodes of ranvier]]. Peripheral nerve interfaces may be divided into extraneural and intrafascular categories.

===Epineurial electrode interface===
Epineurial electrodes are fabricated as longitudinal strips holding two or more contact sites to interface with peripheral nerves. These electrodes are placed on the nerve and secured by suturing to the epineurium. The suturing process requires delicate surgery and can be torn from the nerve if excessive motion creates tension. Since the electrode is sutured to the epineurium it is unlikely to damage the nerve trunk.

===Helicoidal electrode interface===
Helicoidal electrodes are placed cirumjacent to the nerve and are made of flexible platinum ribbon in a helical design. This design allows the electrode to conform to the size and shape of the nerve in attempts to minimize mechanical trauma. The structural design causes low selectivity. Helicoidal electrodes are currently used for FES stimulation of the [[vagus nerve]] to control intractable [[epilepsy]], [[sleep apnea]], and to treat depressive syndromes.

===Book electrode interface===
The book electrode consists of a silicone rubber block with slots. Each slot contains three platinum foils which function as electrodes, anode electrodes and one cathode. The spinal roots of the nerve are placed into these slots and the slots are then covered with a flap made of silicone and fixed with silicone glue. This electrode is mostly used to interrupt reflex circuits of the dorsal sacral roots and to control bladder function. Book electrodes are still considered very bulky.

Positive [[charge (physics)|charges]] in [[ions]] are achieved by stripping away [[electrons]] orbiting the atomic nuclei, where the total number of electrons removed is related to either increasing temperature or the local density of other ionised matter.

==History==

The word ''plasma'' comes {{ety|grc|''πλάσμα''&amp;#8203;|moldable substance}}&lt;ref name="πλάσμα"/&gt; or 'jelly',&lt;ref name=Itpp1995&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldston |first1=R.J. |last2=Rutherford |first2=P.H. |date=1995 |title=Introduction to Plasma Physics |page=1−2 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-7503-0183-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7kM7yEFUGnAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chen+%22introduction+to+plasma+physics%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes the behaviour of the Ionised atomic nuclei and the electrons within the surrounding region of the plasma. Very simply, each of these nuclei are suspended in a movable sea of electrons. Plasma was first identified in a [[Crookes tube]], and so described by [[Sir William Crookes]] in 1879 (he called it "radiant matter").&lt;ref&gt;Crookes presented a [[lecture]] to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], in Sheffield, on Friday, 22 August 1879 {{cite web |url=http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/5dcb9349d366f8ec.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709162459/http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/5dcb9349d366f8ec.html |archivedate=9 July 2006 |df=dmy-all }} {{cite web |url=http://www.tfcbooks.com/mall/more/315rm.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613212651/http://tfcbooks.com/mall/more/315rm.htm |archivedate=13 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of this "[[cathode ray]]" matter was subsequently identified by British physicist [[J. J. Thomson|Sir J.J. Thomson]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Announced in his evening lecture to the [[Royal Institution]] on Friday, 30 April 1897, and published in {{cite journal|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]|volume=44|issue=269|pages=293–316|title=J.

Langmuir described the plasma he observed as follows:
:"''Except near the electrodes, where there are ''sheaths'' containing very few electrons, the ionised gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small. We shall use the name ''plasma'' to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons.''"&lt;ref name="langmuir1928" /&gt;

===Definition===

Plasma is a [[state of matter]] in which an ionised gaseous substance becomes highly [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrically conductive]] to the point that long-range [[electromagnetism|electric and magnetic fields]] dominate the behaviour of the matter.&lt;ref name="Chen, Francis F. 2016 2–3"&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Plasma Physics and controlled fusion | author=Chen, Francis F. | year=1984 | publisher=Springer International Publishing | url=https://books.google.com/?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages=2–3 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115215631/https://books.google.com/books?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimuOfm_pXXAhVrzFQKHTrOCaUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | archivedate=15 January 2018 | df=dmy-all | isbn=9781475755954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freidberg, Jeffrey P. 2008 121"&gt;{{cite book | title=Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy | author=Freidberg, Jeffrey P. | year=2008 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vyoe88GEVz4C | page=121 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224204205/https://books.google.com/books?id=Vyoe88GEVz4C | archivedate=24 December 2016 | df=dmy-all | isbn=9781139462150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plasma state can be contrasted with the [[State of matter#The four fundamental states|other states]]: [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gas]].

Plasma is an electrically neutral medium of unbound positive and negative particles (i.e. the overall charge of a plasma is roughly zero). Although these particles are unbound, they are not "free" in the sense of not experiencing forces. Moving charged particles generate an electric current within a magnetic field, and any movement of a charged plasma particle affects and is affected by the fields created by the other charges. In turn this governs collective behaviour with many degrees of variation.&lt;ref name="Sturrock"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics: An Introduction to the Theory of Astrophysical, Geophysical &amp; Laboratory Plasmas |last=Sturrock |first=Peter A. |date=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44810-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Framework of Plasma Physics |author=Hazeltine, R.D. |author2=Waelbroeck, F.L. |date=2004 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0-7382-0047-7}}

===Temperature===
Plasma temperature is commonly measured in [[kelvins]] or [[electronvolt]]s and is, informally, a measure of the thermal kinetic energy per particle. High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionisation, which is a defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionisation is determined by the [[electron temperature]] relative to the [[ionization energy]] (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the [[Saha equation]]. At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states—atoms&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Plasma Theory |last=Nicholson |first= Dwight R. |date=1983 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-09045-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and the plasma will eventually become a gas.

In most cases the electrons are close enough to [[thermal equilibrium]] that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even when there is a significant deviation from a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] energy [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]], for example, due to [[UV radiation]], energetic particles, or strong [[electric fields]]. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the [[ambient temperature]].

====Fully vs. partially (weakly) ionized gases====
{{main|Degree of ionization}}
{{see also|Spitzer resistivity}}
For plasma to exist, [[ionization|ionisation]] is necessary. The term "plasma density" by itself usually refers to the "electron density", that is, the number of free electrons per unit volume. The [[degree of ionization|degree of ionisation]] of a plasma is the proportion of atoms that have lost or gained electrons, and is controlled by the electron and ion temperatures and electron-ion vs electron-neutral collision frequencies. The degree of ionisation, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{n_i}{n_i + n_n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of ions and &lt;math&gt;n_n&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of neutral atoms. The ''electron density'' is related to this by the average charge state{{Explain|date=August 2018}} &lt;math&gt;\langle Z\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of the ions through &lt;math&gt;n_e = \langle Z\rangle n_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of electrons.

In a plasma, the electron-ion collision frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei}&lt;/math&gt; is much greater than the electron-neutral collision frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, with a weak degree of ionization &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the electron-ion collision frequency can equal the electron-neutral collision frequency: &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei} = \nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt; is the limit separating a plasma from being partially or fully ionized.

* The term ''fully ionized gas'' introduced by [[Lyman Spitzer]] does not mean the degree of ionization is unity, but only that the plasma is in a ''Coulomb-collision dominated regime'', i.e. when &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei} &gt; \nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt;, which can correspond to a degree of ionization as low as 0.01%.&lt;ref name="Chapman 1980"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Brian |date=25 September 1980 |title=Glow Discharge Processes: Sputtering and Plasma Etching |url=https://fr.scribd.com/document/150525600/Brian-Chapman-Glow-Discharge-Processes |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=49 |chapter=Chapter 3: Plasmas |isbn=978-0471078289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A ''partially'' or ''weakly ionized gas'' means the plasma is not dominated by [[Coulomb collision]]s, i.e. when &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei} &lt; \nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt;.

Most of "technological" (engineered) plasmas are weakly ionized gases.

====Thermal vs. nonthermal (cold) plasmas====
{{main|Nonthermal plasma}}
{{see also|Anisothermal plasma}}
Based on the relative temperatures of the electrons, ions and neutrals, plasmas are classified as "thermal" or "non-thermal" (also referred to as "cold plasmas"). 

* ''Thermal plasmas'' have electrons and the heavy particles at the same temperature, i.e. they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. 

* ''Nonthermal plasmas'' on the other hand are non-equilibrium ionized gases, with two temperatures: ions and neutrals stay at a low temperature (sometimes [[room temperature]]), whereas electrons are much hotter. (&lt;math&gt;T_e \gg T_n&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;von Engel, A. and Cozens, J.R. (1976) "Flame Plasma" in ''Advances in electronics and electron physics'', L. L. Marton (ed.), Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-0-12-014520-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mndi2cCMuUC&amp;lpg=PA99 p. 99] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202013244/https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mndi2cCMuUC&amp;lpg=PA99 |date=2 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A kind of common nonthermal plasma is the [[Mercury-vapor lamp|mercury-vapor gas]] within a [[fluorescent lamp]], where the "electrons gas" reaches a temperature of 10,000 kelvins while the rest of the gas stays barely above room temperature, so the [[Electric light|bulb]] can even be touched with hands while operating.

A particular and unusual case of "inverse" nonthermal plasma is the very high temperature plasma produced by the [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z machine]], where ions are much hotter than electrons.&lt;ref name="haines_a"&gt;{{cite journal

===Plasma potential===
[[File:Bliksem in Assen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Lightning]] as an example of plasma present at Earth's surface:
Typically, lightning discharges 30 kiloamperes at up to 100 megavolts, and emits radio waves, light, X- and even gamma rays.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html Flashes in the Sky: Earth's Gamma-Ray Bursts Triggered by Lightning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707164546/http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html |date=7 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma temperatures can approach 30000 K and electron densities may exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
Since plasmas are very good [[electrical conductor]]s, electric potentials play an important role.{{clarify|what role?|date=October 2017}} The average potential in the space between charged particles, independent of how it can be measured, is called the "plasma potential", or the "space potential". If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a [[Debye sheath]]. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of "quasineutrality", which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (&lt;math&gt;n_e = \langle Z\rangle n_i&lt;/math&gt;), but on the scale of the [[Debye length]] there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that ''[[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]]'' are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net [[charge density]]. A common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the [[Boltzmann relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;n_e \propto e^{e\Phi/k_BT_e}.&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = (k_BT_e/e)(\nabla n_e/n_e).&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small, otherwise, it will be dissipated by the repulsive [[electrostatic force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42854229|title=Plasma science : from fundamental research to technological applications|last=|first=|date=1995|publisher=National Academy Press|others=National Research Council (U.S.). Panel on Opportunities in Plasma Science and Technology.|year=|isbn=9780309052313|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=51|oclc=42854229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astrophysical]] plasmas, [[electric field screening|Debye screening]] prevents [[electric field]]s from directly affecting the plasma over large distances, i.e., greater than the [[Debye length]]. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, [[magnetic field]]s. This can and does cause extremely complex behaviour, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of [[Debye length]]s. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated [[magnetic field]]s are studied in the [[academic discipline]] of [[magnetohydrodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dorch |first=Søren |date=2007-04-13 |title=Magnetohydrodynamics |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Magnetohydrodynamics |journal=Scholarpedia |language=en |volume=2 |issue=4|pages=2295 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.2295 |issn=1941-6016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402043642/http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Magnetohydrodynamics |archivedate=2 April 2008 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=2007SchpJ...2.2295D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetization===
Plasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the charged particles is said to be magnetized. A common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the magnetic field before making a collision, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\mathrm{ce}} / v_{\mathrm{coll}} &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\mathrm{ce}}&lt;/math&gt; is the "electron gyrofrequency" and &lt;math&gt;v_{\mathrm{coll}}&lt;/math&gt; is the "electron collision rate". It is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not. Magnetized plasmas are ''[[anisotropic]]'', meaning that their properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendicular to it. While electric fields in plasmas are usually small due to the high conductivity, the electric field associated with a plasma moving in a magnetic field is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = -v\times\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the electric field, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic field), and is not affected by [[Debye shielding]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Fitzpatrick, ''Introduction to Plasma Physics'', [http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html Magnetized plasmas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301073703/http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html |date=1 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
! Independently acting species
| '''One''': All gas particles behave in a similar way, influenced by [[gravity]] and by [[collision]]s with one another.
| '''Two or three''': [[Electron]]s, [[ion]]s, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s can be distinguished by the sign and value of their [[electric charge|charge]] so that they behave independently in many circumstances, with different bulk velocities and temperatures, allowing phenomena such as new types of [[waves in plasma|waves]] and [[Instability|instabilities]].
|-
! Velocity distribution
| '''[[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]''': Collisions usually lead to a Maxwellian velocity distribution of all gas particles, with very few relatively fast particles.
| '''Often non-Maxwellian''': Collisional interactions are often weak in hot plasmas and external forcing can drive the plasma far from local equilibrium and lead to a significant population of unusually fast particles.
|-
! Interactions
| '''Binary''': Two-particle collisions are the rule, three-body collisions extremely rare.
| '''Collective''': Waves, or organized motion of plasma, are very important because the particles can interact at long ranges through the electric and magnetic forces.

==Complex plasma phenomena==

Although the underlying equations governing plasmas are relatively simple, plasma behaviour is extraordinarily varied and subtle: the emergence of unexpected behaviour from a simple model is a typical feature of a [[complex system]]. Such systems lie in some sense on the boundary between ordered and disordered behaviour and cannot typically be described either by simple, smooth, mathematical functions, or by pure randomness. The spontaneous formation of interesting spatial features on a wide range of length scales is one manifestation of plasma complexity. The features are interesting, for example, because they are very sharp, spatially intermittent (the distance between features is much larger than the features themselves), or have a [[fractal]] form. Many of these features were first studied in the laboratory, and have subsequently been recognized throughout the universe. Examples of complexity and complex structures in plasmas include:

===Filamentation===

Filamentation also refers to the self-focusing of a high power laser pulse. At high powers, the nonlinear part of the index of refraction becomes important and causes a higher index of refraction in the center of the laser beam, where the laser is brighter than at the edges, causing a feedback that focuses the laser even more. The tighter focused laser has a higher peak brightness (irradiance) that forms a plasma. The plasma has an index of refraction lower than one, and causes a defocusing of the laser beam. The interplay of the focusing index of refraction, and the defocusing plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be [[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]] to kilometers in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Chin, S.

===Non-neutral plasma===
The strength and range of the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities of positive and negative charges in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a [[Non-neutral plasmas|non-neutral plasma]]. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged [[particle beam]]s, an electron cloud in a [[Penning trap]] and positron plasmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Greaves | first1 = R. G. | last2 = Tinkle | first2 = M.

===Dusty plasma/grain plasma===
A [[dusty plasma]] contains tiny charged particles of dust (typically found in space). The dust particles acquire high charges and interact with each other. A plasma that contains larger particles is called grain plasma. Under laboratory conditions, dusty plasmas are also called ''complex plasmas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morfill |first=G. E. |title= Complex plasmas: An interdisciplinary research field |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=81 |date=2009 |pages=1353–1404 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.81.1353|bibcode = 2009RvMP...81.1353M |first2=Alexei V. |last2=Ivlev |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impermeable plasma===
Impermeable plasma is a type of thermal plasma which acts like an impermeable solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by [[Hannes Alfvén]] in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] plasma from the reactor walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alfvén |first1=H. |last2=Smårs |first2=E.|title= Gas-Insulation of a Hot Plasma |journal=Nature |volume=188 |date=1960 |pages=801–802 |doi=10.1038/188801a0|bibcode = 1960Natur.188..801A |issue=4753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later it was found that the external [[magnetic fields]] in this configuration could induce [[Kink instability|kink instabilities]] in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Braams |first1=C.M. |title= Stability of Plasma Confined by a Cold-Gas Blanket |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=17 |issue=9 |date=1966 |pages=470–471 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.17.470|bibcode = 1966PhRvL..17..470B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, a group of materials scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no [[magnetic confinement]] using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data on the characteristics of plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of different [[nanostructures]] clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of [[ions]] at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yaghoubi |first1=A. |last2=Mélinon |first2=P.|title= Tunable synthesis and in situ growth of silicon-carbon mesostructures using impermeable plasma |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=3 |pages=1083 |date=2013 |doi=10.1038/srep01083|bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1083Y |pmid=23330064 |pmc=3547321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Plasma modeling}}
To completely describe the state of a plasma, all of the
particle locations and velocities that describe the electromagnetic field in the plasma region would need to be written down.
However, it is generally not practical or necessary to keep track of all the particles in a plasma.
Therefore, plasma physicists commonly use less detailed descriptions, of which
there are two main types:

===Fluid model===
Fluid models describe plasmas in terms of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see [[Plasma parameters]]). One simple fluid model, [[magnetohydrodynamics]], treats the plasma as a single fluid governed by a combination of [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. A more general description is the [[two-fluid plasma]] picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. Because fluid models usually describe the plasma in terms of a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]]s, nor resolve wave-particle effects.

===Kinetic model===
Kinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function at each point in the plasma and therefore do not need to assume a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the [[particle-in-cell]] (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories of a large number of individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The [[Vlasov equation]] may be used to describe the dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.
In magnetized plasmas, a [[gyrokinetics|gyrokinetic]] approach can substantially reduce the computational expense of a fully kinetic simulation.

==Artificial plasmas==
Most artificial plasmas are generated by the application of electric and/or magnetic fields through a gas. Plasma generated in a laboratory setting and for industrial use can be generally categorized by:
*The type of power source used to generate the plasma—DC, AC (typically with [[radio frequency]] ([[RF]])) and microwave
*The pressure they operate at—vacuum pressure (&lt; 10&amp;nbsp;mTorr or 1 Pa), moderate pressure (≈1&amp;nbsp;Torr or 100 Pa), atmospheric pressure (760&amp;nbsp;Torr or 100 kPa)
*The degree of ionisation within the plasma—fully, partially, or weakly ionised
*The temperature relationships within the plasma—thermal plasma (&lt;math&gt;T_e = T_i = T_{gas}&lt;/math&gt;), non-thermal or "cold" plasma (&lt;math&gt;T_e \gg T_i = T_{gas}&lt;/math&gt;)
*The electrode configuration used to generate the plasma
*The magnetization of the particles within the plasma—magnetized (both ion and electrons are trapped in [[Gyroradius|Larmor orbits]] by the magnetic field), partially magnetized (the electrons but not the ions are trapped by the magnetic field), non-magnetized (the magnetic field is too weak to trap the particles in orbits but may generate [[Lorentz force]]s){{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Generation of artificial plasma===
[[File:Simple representation of a discharge tube - plasma.png|thumb]]
[[File:Plasma jacobs ladder.jpg|thumb|alt=Artificial plasma produced in air by a Jacob's Ladder|Artificial plasma produced in air by a [[Spark gap#Visual entertainment|Jacob's Ladder]]]]
Just like the many uses of plasma, there are several means for its generation, however, one principle is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it.&lt;ref name="Hippler" /&gt; For this case, plasma is generated when an [[electric current]] is applied across a [[dielectric gas]] or fluid (an electrically [[Electrical conductor|non-conducting]] material) as can be seen in the adjacent image, which shows a [[discharge tube]] as a simple example ([[direct current|DC]] used for simplicity).

The [[potential difference]] and subsequent [[electric field]] pull the bound electrons (negative) toward the [[anode]] (positive electrode) while the [[cathode]] (negative electrode) pulls the nucleus.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion |last=Chen |first=Francis F. |date=1984 |publisher=Plenum Press |isbn=978-0-306-41332-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115215631/https://books.google.com/books?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimuOfm_pXXAhVrzFQKHTrOCaUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=15 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[voltage]] increases, the current stresses the material (by [[electric polarization]]) beyond its [[dielectric strength|dielectric limit]] (termed strength) into a stage of [[electrical breakdown]], marked by an [[electric spark]], where the material transforms from being an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] into a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] (as it becomes increasingly [[ionized|ionised]]). The underlying process is the [[Townsend avalanche]], where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons (as can be seen in the figure on the right). The first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electrons. Therefore, the number of charged particles increases rapidly (in the millions) only "after about 20 successive sets of collisions",&lt;ref name="Leal-Quiros" /&gt; mainly due to a small mean free path (average distance travelled between collisions).

====Electric arc====

[[File:Townsend Discharge.svg|thumbnail|300px|Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionisation event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionising electron and the liberated electron.]]
With ample current density and ionisation, this forms a luminous [[electric arc]] (a continuous electric discharge similar to [[lightning]]) between the electrodes.{{#tag:ref|The material undergoes various "regimes" or stages (e.g. saturation, breakdown, glow, transition and thermal arc) as the voltage is increased under the voltage-current relationship.

Nevertheless, it is enough to say that at 2,000°C the gas molecules become atomized, and ionised at 3,000 °C and "in this state, [the] gas has a liquid like viscosity at atmospheric pressure and the free electric charges confer relatively high electrical conductivities that can approach those of metals."&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt;|group="Note"}} A thermal plasma is in [[thermal equilibrium]], which is to say that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, [[electrical energy]] is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by [[elastic collision]] (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Note that non-thermal, or non-equilibrium plasmas are not as ionised and have lower energy densities, and thus the temperature is not dispersed evenly among the particles, where some heavy ones remain "cold".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of industrial/commercial plasma===
Because of their sizable temperature and density ranges, plasmas find applications in many fields of research, technology and industry.

====Low-pressure discharges====
*''[[Glow discharge]] plasmas'': non-thermal plasmas generated by the application of DC or low frequency RF (&lt;100&amp;nbsp;kHz) electric field to the gap between two metal electrodes. Probably the most common plasma; this is the type of plasma generated within [[fluorescent light]] tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wfluor.html |title=The Fluorescent Lamp: A plasma you can use |author=Stern, David P. |accessdate=2010-05-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530165958/http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wfluor.html |archivedate=30 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Capacitively coupled plasma]] (CCP)'': similar to glow discharge plasmas, but generated with high frequency RF electric fields, typically [[ISM band|13.56&amp;nbsp;MHz]]. These differ from glow discharges in that the sheaths are much less intense. These are widely used in the microfabrication and integrated circuit manufacturing industries for plasma etching and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sobolewski |first1=M.A. |last2=Langan &amp; Felker |first2=J.G. &amp; B.S. |date=1997 |title=Electrical optimization of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition chamber cleaning plasmas |journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=173–182 |url=http://physics.nist.gov/MajResProj/rfcell/Publications/MAS_JVSTB16_1.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118212957/http://www.physics.nist.gov/MajResProj/rfcell/Publications/MAS_JVSTB16_1.pdf | archivedate=18 January 2009 |doi=10.1116/1.589774|bibcode = 1998JVSTB..16..173S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Cascaded Arc Plasma Source]]'': a device to produce low temperature (≈1eV) high density plasmas (HDP).

====Atmospheric pressure====
*''[[Arc discharge]]:'' this is a high power thermal discharge of very high temperature (≈10,000 K). It can be generated using various power supplies. It is commonly used in [[Metallurgy|metallurgical]] processes. For example, it is used to smelt minerals containing Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to produce [[aluminium]].
*''[[Corona discharge]]:'' this is a non-thermal discharge generated by the application of high voltage to sharp electrode tips. It is commonly used in [[ozone]] generators and particle precipitators.
*''[[Dielectric barrier discharge]] (DBD):'' this is a non-thermal discharge generated by the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the plasma discharge into an arc. It is often mislabeled 'Corona' discharge in industry and has similar application to corona discharges. It is also widely used in the web treatment of fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Leroux | first1 = F. | last2 = Perwuelz | first2 = A. | last3 = Campagne | first3 = C. | last4 = Behary | first4 = N. | title = Atmospheric air-plasma treatments of polyester textile structures | doi = 10.1163/156856106777657788 | journal = Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 939–957 | year = 2006 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the discharge to synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for paints, glues and similar materials to adhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The dielectric barrier discharge configuration was also used in the design of low temperature plasma jets. These plasma jets are produced by fast propagating guided ionisation waves known as plasma bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2014.02.006|title=Guided ionization waves: Theory and experiments|journal=Physics Reports|volume=540|issue=3|pages=123|year=2014|last1=Lu|first1=X.|last2=Naidis|first2=G.V.|last3=Laroussi|first3=M.|last4=Ostrikov|first4=K.|bibcode=2014PhR...540..123L}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Capacitive discharge]]:'' this is a [[nonthermal plasma]] generated by the application of RF power (e.g., [[ISM band|13.56&amp;nbsp;MHz]]) to one powered electrode, with a grounded electrode held at a small separation distance on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;cm. Such discharges are commonly stabilized using a noble gas such as helium or argon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Park | first1 = J. | last2 = Henins | first2 = I. | last3 = Herrmann | first3 = H.

*"[[Piezoelectric direct discharge plasma]]:" is a [[nonthermal plasma]] generated at the high-side of a piezoelectric transformer (PT). This generation variant is particularly suited for high efficient and compact devices where a separate high voltage power supply is not desired.

===MHD converters===
{{main|magnetohydrodynamic converter|magnetohydrodynamic generator|magnetohydrodynamic drive}}
{{see also|Electrothermal instability}}
A world effort was triggered in the 1960s to study [[magnetohydrodynamic converter]]s in order to bring [[magnetohydrodynamic generator|MHD power conversion]] to market with commercial power plants of a new kind, converting the [[kinetic energy]] of a high velocity plasma into [[electricity]] with no [[moving parts]] at a high [[efficiency]]. Research was also conducted in the field of supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics to study plasma interaction with magnetic fields to eventually achieve passive and even active [[Flow control (fluid)|flow control]] around vehicles or projectiles, in order to soften and mitigate [[shock wave]]s, lower thermal transfer and reduce [[Drag (physics)|drag]].

Such ionized gases used in "plasma technology" ("technological" or "engineered" plasmas) are usually ''weakly ionized gases'' in the sense that only a tiny fraction of the gas molecules are ionized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/690642377|title=Plasma scattering of electromagnetic radiation : theory and measurement techniques|last=|first=|date=2011|publisher=Academic Press/Elsevier|others=Froula, Dustin H.|year=|isbn=978-0080952031|edition=1st ed., 2nd|location=Burlington, MA|pages=273|oclc=690642377}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of weakly ionized gases are also nonthermal "cold" plasmas. In the presence of magnetics fields, the study of such magnetized nonthermal weakly ionized gases involves [[Magnetohydrodynamics#Ideal_and_resistive_MHD|resistive magnetohydrodynamics]] with low [[magnetic Reynolds number]], a challenging field of plasma physics where calculations require [[dyadic tensor]]s in a [[n-dimensional space|7-dimensional]] [[phase space]]. When used in combination with a high [[Hall effect|Hall parameter]], a critical value triggers the problematic [[electrothermal instability]] which limited these technological developments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1138">'''Plasmogamy''' is a stage in the [[sexual reproduction]] of [[fungi]], in which the [[cytoplasm]] of two parent cells (usually from the [[mycelia]]) fuses together without the fusion of [[Nucleus (cell)|nuclei]], effectively bringing two [[haploid]] nuclei close together in the same cell. This state is followed by [[karyogamy]], where the two nuclei fuse together and then undergo [[meiosis]] to produce spores.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = fungus (biology) :: Sexual reproduction | encyclopedia = Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/222357/fungus/57957/Sexual-reproduction |accessdate = 20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abedon|first=Stephen|title=Plasmogamy|url=http://www.biologyaspoetry.com/terms/plasmogamy.html|work=Biology as Poetry|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The dikaryotic state that comes after plasmogamy will often persist for many generations before the fungi undergoes karyogamy. In lower fungi however, plasmogamy is usually immediately followed by karyogamy.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

==Definitions and measurements==

Political polarization refers to the cases in which an individual's stance on a given issue, policy, or person is more likely to be strictly defined by their identification with a particular political party (e.g., [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) or [[political ideology|ideology]] (e.g., [[liberalism|liberal]] or [[conservatism|conservative]]).&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Alan I.|author2=Saunders, Kyle L.|title=Is Polarization a Myth?|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=27 March 2008|volume=70|issue=2|page=542|doi=10.1017/S0022381608080493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bafumi-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bafumi|first=Joseph|author2=Shapiro, Robert Y.|title=A New Partisan Voter|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=27 January 2009|volume=71|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.1017/S0022381608090014|url=http://ftp.columbia.edu/cu/alliance/documents/EDF/Monday/Shapiro_Bafumi_reading.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to DiMaggio et al. (1996), "Polarization is both a state and a process. Polarization as a state refers to the extent to which opinions on an issue are opposed in relation to some theoretical maximum. Polarization as a process refers to the increase in such opposition over time."&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt; Some political scientists argue that polarization requires divergence on a broad range of issues based on a consistent set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt; Others argue polarization occurs when there are stark partisan or ideological divides, even if the opinion is polarized only on a few issues.&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=bafumi-09/&gt;

Political scientists typically distinguish between two types of political polarization: elite polarization and popular polarization. "Elite polarization" refers to the polarization of political elites, like [[party organizer]]s and [[elected officials]], while "popular polarization" (or mass polarization) refers to the polarization in the electorate and general public. In either context, opinions and policy positions are characterized by strict adherence to [[party line (politics)|party lines]]. Elite polarization and popular polarization can occur at the same time or independent of each other. A central issue in the study of political polarization is investigating the relationship between elite polarization and popular polarization, particularly any causal relationships between the two.&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Marc J.|title=Review Article: Putting Polarization in Perspective|journal=British Journal of Political Science|date=17 February 2009|volume=39|issue=2|page=413|doi=10.1017/S0007123408000501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06&gt;{{cite journal|last=Layman|first=Geoffrey C.|author2=Carsey, Thomas M. |author3=Horowitz, Juliana Menasce |title=Party Polarization in American Politics: Characteristics, Causes, and Consequences|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=1 June 2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=83–110|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.070204.105138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carmines|first=E.

===Elite polarization===

[[File:NOMINATE polarization.jpg|thumb|Political polarization in the United States House of Representatives (DW-Nominate scores)]]
Elite polarization refers to polarization in the party-in-government and party-as-organization.&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt; It occurs when party members (both elected government officials and activists within the party organization itself) grow more internally homogenous on policy positions and more divergent relative to members of other parties. Polarized political parties are internally cohesive, unified, programmatic, and ideologically distinct; they are typically found in a [[parliamentary system]] of democratic governance.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt; 

In a [[two-party system]] like the U.S., a polarized [[legislature]] has two important characteristics: first, there is little-to-no ideological overlap between members of the two parties; and second, almost all conflict over legislation and policies is split across the broad liberal/conservative ideological divide. This leads to the conflation of political parties and ideologies (i.e., Democrat and Republican become nearly perfect synonyms for liberal and conservative) and the collapse of the ideological center.&lt;ref name="mann-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="carmines-12" /&gt;

The vast majority of studies on elite polarization focus on legislative and deliberative bodies. For many years, political scientists measured polarization by examining the ratings of party members published by interest groups, but now, most analyze [[recorded vote|roll-call voting]] patterns to determine trends in party-line voting and party unity.&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty-06" /&gt; Many political scientists studying American politics rely on Poole and Rosenthal's [[NOMINATE (scaling method)|DW-NOMINATE scores]], which assign a single liberal-conservative score to each congressperson, enabling comparisons of members from different Congresses. There is much more research on polarization in Congress than on polarization in the other branches of government or in state governments.&lt;ref name="McCarty-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hetherington-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt; Azzimonti's political polarization index is more comprehensive instead because it is based on media coverage of newspaper articles reporting political disagreement about policy in all branches of government.&lt;ref&gt;Azzimonti, Marina "[http://marina-azzimonti.com/papers/Polariz2.pdf The political polarization index]"&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work by Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy has used the text of the Congressional Record to document differences in speech patterns between Republicans and Democrats as a measure of polarization. They find that polarization has increased dramatically since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Gentzkow, Matthew, and Shapiro, Jesse, and Taddy, Matt [http://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/politext.pdf Measuring Polarization in High-Dimensional Data: Method and Application to Congressional Speech]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular polarization===

Popular polarization, or mass polarization, occurs when the electorate's attitudes towards political issues, policies, and people are starkly divided along partisan lines. Members of the electorate and general public typically become less moderate in cases of popular polarization.&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=claassen-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Claassen|first=R.L.|author2=Highton, B.|title=Policy Polarization among Party Elites and the Significance of Political Awareness in the Mass Public|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=9 September 2008|volume=62|issue=3|pages=538–551|doi=10.1177/1065912908322415}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., media accounts typically simplify popular polarization to a divide between [[red states and blue states]] or a "[[Culture war#United States of America|culture war]]" between values-voters and progressives. Political scientists, though, generally agree that such accounts are too simplistic and ignore the complex factors that can account for polarization.&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fiorina |first=Morris P. |author2=Samuel A. Abrams |author3=Jeremy C. Pope |title=Culture War? The Myth of a Polarized America | publisher=[[Pearson Longman]] | year=2006 | isbn=978-0321276407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many political scientists consider political polarization a top-down process, in which elite polarization leads to – or at least precedes – popular polarization. However, polarization among elites does not necessarily produce polarization within the electorate, and polarized electoral choices can often reflect elite polarization rather than voters' preferences.&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=claassen-08/&gt;

Political scientists studying popular polarization typically rely on data from [[opinion polls]] and election surveys. They look for trends in respondents' opinions on a given issue, their voting history, and their political ideology (conservative, liberal, moderate, etc.), and they try to relate those trends to respondents' party identification and other potentially polarizing factors (like geographic location or income bracket).&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09/&gt; Political scientists typically limit their inquiry to issues and questions that have been constant over time, in order to compare the present day to what the political climate has historically been.&lt;ref name=claassen-08/&gt; Oft-cited public opinion polls in the U.S. include those run by the [[Pew Research Center]] and [[Gallup, Inc.]], while political scientists also rely on more academic surveys, like the [[General Social Survey]] and the election surveys and "feeling thermometer" polls conducted by [[National Election Studies]].&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=claassen-08/&gt;

==Causes==
There are various causes of political polarization and these include political parties, [[redistricting]], the public's [[political ideologies|political ideology]], and the mass media.

===Party polarization===
Some scholars argue that diverging parties has been one of the major driving forces of polarization as policy platforms have become more distant. This theory is based on recent trends in the [[United States Congress]], where the [[majority party]] prioritizes the positions that are most aligned with its [[party platform]] and political ideology.&lt;ref name=ura-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ura|first=Joseph Daniel|author2=Ellis, Christopher R.|title=Partisan Moods: Polarization and the Dynamics of Mass Party Preferences|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=10 February 2012|volume=74|issue=1|pages=277–291|doi=10.1017/S0022381611001587}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of more ideologically distinct positions by political parties can cause polarization among both elites and the electorate. For example, after the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]], the number of conservative Democrats in Congress decreased, while the number of conservative Republicans increased. Within the electorate during the 1970s, [[Southern Democrats]] shifted toward the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], showing polarization among both the elites and the electorate of both main parties.&lt;ref name=mann-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-98&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Alan I.|author2=Saunders, Kyle L.|title=Ideological Realignment in the U.S. Electorate|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=August 1998|volume=60|issue=3|page=634|doi=10.2307/2647642|jstor=10.2307/2647642}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=galston-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galston|first=William A.|title=Political Polarization and the U.S. Judiciary|journal=UKMC Law Review|year=2009|volume=77|issue=207|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/umkc77&amp;div=15&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists have shown politicians have an incentive to advance and support polarized positions.&lt;ref name=beniers-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beniers|first=Klaas J.|author2=Dur, Robert|title=Politicians’ motivation, political culture, and electoral competition|journal=International Tax and Public Finance|date=1 February 2007|volume=14|issue=1|pages=29–54|doi=10.1007/s10797-006-8878-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; These argue that during the early 1990s, the Republican Party used polarizing tactics to become the majority party in the [[United States House of Representatives]]—which political scientists [[Thomas E. Mann]] and [[Norman Ornstein]] refer to as [[Newt Gingrich]]'s "guerrilla war."&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt; What political scientists have found is that moderates are less likely to run than are candidates who are in line with party doctrine, otherwise known as "party fit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomsen|first1=Danielle M.|title=Ideological Moderates Won't Run: How Party Fit Matters for Partisan Polarization in Congress|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=2014|volume=76|issue=3|pages=786–797|doi=10.1017/s0022381614000243|jstor=0022381614000243}}&lt;/ref&gt;Other theories state politicians who cater to more extreme groups within their party tend to be more successful, helping them stay in office while simultaneously pulling their constituency toward a polar extreme.&lt;ref name=hirano-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirano|first=Shigeo, Jr. |author2=James M.

With regards to [[multiparty systems]], [[Giovanni Sartori]] (1966, 1976) claims the splitting of ideologies in the public constituency causes further divides within the political parties of the countries. He theorizes that the extremism of public ideological movement is the basis for the creation of highly polarized multiparty systems. Sartori named this polarizing phenomenon [[polarized pluralism]] and claimed it would lead to further polarization in many opposing directions (as opposed to in simply two directions, as in a polarized two-party system) over policy issues.&lt;ref name=sartori-66&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sartori|first=Giovanni|title=European political parties: the case of polarized pluralism|journal=Political Parties and Political Development|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sartori-76&gt;{{cite book|last=Sartori|first=Giovanni|title=Parties and party systems : a framework for analysis|year=1976|publisher=ECPR|location=Colchester|isbn=978-0954796617|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywr0CcGDNHwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=[Nouvelle édition]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnston-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Richard|title=Polarized Pluralism in the Canadian Party System: Presidential Address to the Canadian Political Science Association, June 5, 2008|journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science|date=17 December 2008|volume=41|issue=4|page=815|doi=10.1017/S0008423908081110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polarization in multiparty systems can also be defined along two ideological extremes, like in the case of [[India]] in the 1970s. Ideological splits within a number of India's major parties resulted in two polarized coalitions on the right and left, each consisting of multiple political parties.&lt;ref name=davey-72&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davey|first=Hampton|title=Polarization and Consensus in Indian Party Politics|journal=Asian Survey|date=1 August 1972|volume=12|issue=8|pages=701–716|doi=10.2307/2643110|jstor=10.2307/2643110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political fund-raisers and donors can also exert significant influence and control over legislators. Party leaders are expected to be productive fund-raisers, in order to support the party's campaigns. After ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'', special interests in the U.S. were able to greatly impact elections through increased undisclosed spending, notably through [[Super PACs|Super political action committees]]. Some, such as ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' opinion writer [[Robert G. Kaiser|Robert Kaiser]], argued this allowed wealthy people, corporations, unions, and other groups to push the parties' policy platforms toward ideological extremes, resulting in a state of greater polarization.&lt;ref name=mann-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser-10&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Robert G.|title=So damn much money : the triumph of lobbying and the corrosion of American government|year=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0307385888|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJxU1MzQZVoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1st Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as Raymond J. La Raja and David L. Wiltse, note that this does not necessarily hold true for mass donors to political campaigns.

===The public===
In democracies and other [[Representative democracy|representative governments]], citizens vote for the political actors who will represent them.

They argue that there is a link between public differences in ideology and the polarization of representatives, but that an increase in preference differences is usually temporary and ultimately results in compromise.&lt;ref name=dixit-07&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixit|first1=Avinash K. | last2 = Weibull |first2= Jörgen W. |title=Political polarization|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|date=1 May 2007|volume=104|issue=18 |pages=7351–7356 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0702071104 | jstor = 25427490 | publisher = [[National Academy of Sciences]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0702071104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morris P. Fiorina]] (2006, 2008) posits the hypothesis that polarization is a phenomenon which does not hold for the public, and instead is formulated by commentators to draw further division in government.&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=fiorina-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=born-94&gt;{{cite journal|last=Born|first=Richard|title=[Split-ticket voters, divided government, and Fiorina's policy-balancing model]: rejoinder|journal=[[Legislative Studies Quarterly]]|date=February 1994|volume=19 |issue=1 | publisher = [[American Political Science Association]] |jstor=439804}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies indicate that cultural differences focusing on ideological movements and geographical polarization within the United States constituency is correlated with rises in overall political polarization between 1972 and 2004.&lt;ref name=abramowitz-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-05&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~govt/docs/Abramowitz.pdf | last1 = Abramowitz | first1 = Alan | last2 = Saunders | first2 = Kyle L. | title = Why can't we all just get along?

Religious, ethnic, and other cultural divides within the public have often influenced the emergence of polarization. According to Layman et al. (2005), the ideological split between U.S. Republicans and Democrats also crosses into the religious cultural divide. They claim that Democrats have generally become more [[moderate]] in religious views whereas Republicans have become more traditionalist. For example, political scientists have shown that in the United States, voters who identify as Republican are more likely to vote for a strongly [[evangelical]] candidate than Democratic voters.&lt;ref name=campbell-11&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=David E.|last2 = Green | first2 = John C. | last3 = Layman | first3 = Geoffrey C. |title=The party faithful: partisan images, candidate religion, and the electoral impact of party identification|journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]]|date= January 2011|volume=55|issue=1|pages=42–58 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00474.x | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00474.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This correlates with the rise in polarization in the United States.&lt;ref name=layman-05&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Layman |first1= Geoffrey C. | last2 =Green | first2 = John C. |title=Wars and rumours of wars: the contexts of cultural conflict in American political behaviour|journal=[[British Journal of Political Science]]|date=January 2006|volume=36|issue=1 |pages=61–89 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi=10.1017/S0007123406000044 | jstor = 4092316 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007123406000044  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory contends that religion does not contribute to full-group polarization, but rather, [[coalition]] and party activist polarization causes party shifts toward a political extreme.&lt;ref name=brooks-04&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sociology.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/A_Great_Divide.pdf|last=Brooks|first=Clem|author2=Manza, Jeff|title=A great divide?

[[Economic inequality]] can also motivate the polarization of the public. For example, in post-[[World War I]] [[Germany]], the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany|Communist Workers Party]], and the [[Nazism|National Socialists]], a [[fascism|fascist]] party, emerged as the dominant political ideologies and proposed to address Germany's economic problems in drastically different ways.&lt;ref name=sartori-66/&gt;&lt;ref name=sartori-76/&gt; In [[Venezuela]] in the late 20th century, the entrance of the oil industry into the local economy caused economic disparities that led to sharp ideological divides. As a result, the disenfranchised working class aligned with extreme [[socialism|socialist]] leader [[Hugo Chávez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lombardi |first=John V. |contribution=Prologue: Venezuela's Permanent Dilemma |editor1-last=Ellner |editor1-first=Steve |editor2-last=Hellinger |editor2-first=Daniel |date=2004 |title=Venezuelan politics in the Chávez era: class, polarization, and conflict |publisher=Rienner |location=Boulder, Colorado |isbn=978-1588262974 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Venezuelan_Politics_in_the_Ch%C3%A1vez_Era.html?id=uYd4Q1vQluAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redistricting===
[[Gerrymandering]] or the manipulation of the electoral borders to favor a political party or the electoral outcome affect the redistricting process in the U.S. It has been linked to the rise in polarization by some political scientists.&lt;ref name=yoshinaka-11&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yoshinaka|first=Antoine &amp; Chad Murphy|title=The Paradox of Redistricting: How Partisan Mapmakers Foster Competition but Disrupt Representation|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=June 2011|volume=64|issue=2|pages=435–447|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/873115158/|doi=10.1177/1065912909355716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that the practice of redistricting creates political polarization by making more homogeneous, ideologically distinct districts. This results in elected representatives who represent more polarized beliefs.&lt;ref name=thompson-04&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Dennis F.|title=Election Time: Normative Implications of Temporal Properties of the Electoral Process in the United States|journal=American Political Science Review|date=February 2004|volume=98|issue=1|pages=51–64|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPSR%2FPSR98_01%2FS0003055404000991a.pdf&amp;code=2dc646d4d430ae4fef0a6e06d5ccf9fa|doi=10.1017/s0003055404000991}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carson et al. (2007), this makes it easier for more extreme candidates to win elections (and re-election) as the makeup of the voting block shifts in the direction of a polar extreme. This effect is more modest when analyzed over multiple election cycles and in the United States as a whole.&lt;ref name=carson-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carson|first=J.L.|author2=Crespin, M.H. |author3=Finocchiaro, C.J. |author4= Rohde, D.W. |title=Redistricting and Party Polarization in the U.S. House of Representatives|journal=American Politics Research|date=28 September 2007|volume=35|issue=6|pages=878–904|doi=10.1177/1532673X07304263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically motivated redistricting has been associated with the rise in partisanship in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1992 and 1994.&lt;ref name=mckee-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKee|first=SEth C.|title=The Effects of Redistricting on Voting Behavior in Incumbent U.S. House Elections, 1992–1994|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=March 2008|volume=61|issue=1|pages=122–133|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/215329960?accountid=10141|doi=10.1177/1065912907306473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kousser-96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kousser|first=J|title=Estimating the Partisan Consequences of Redistricting Plans – Simply|journal=Legislative Studies Quarterly|date=November 1996|volume=21|issue=4|pages=521–541|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/60821189?accountid=10141|doi=10.2307/440460|jstor=440460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many political scientists however, argue that redistricting practices have not played a major role in causing political polarization.

===The media===
The mass media has grown as an institution over the past half-century. Political scientists argue that this has particularly affected the voting public in the last three decades, as previously less partisan viewers are given more polarized news media choices. The mass media's current, fragmented, high-choice environment has induced a movement of the audience from more even-toned political programming to more antagonistic and one-sided broadcasts and articles. These programs tend to appeal to partisan viewers who watch the polarized programming as a self-confirming source for their ideologies.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=hollander-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=B.A.|title=Tuning Out or Tuning Elsewhere?

(2010). ''Program or be programmed: Ten commands for a digital age.'' Berkeley, CA: Soft Skull Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This method of personalizing web content results in ''[[filter bubble]]s'', a term coined by digital activist [[Eli Pariser]] that refers to the polarized ideological bubbles that are created by computer algorithms filtering out unrelated information and opposing views.&lt;ref&gt;Pariser, E. (2011). ''The filter bubble: What the internet is hiding from you''. New York, NY: The Penguin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study found ideological segregation of online news consumption is lower than the segregation of most offline news consumption and lower than the segregation of face-to-face interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gentzkow|first=Matthew|last2=Shapiro|first2=Jesse M.|date=2011-11-01|title=Ideological Segregation Online and Offline *|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/126/4/1799/1924154/Ideological-Segregation-Online-and-Offline?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=126|issue=4|pages=1799–1839|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr044|issn=0033-5533}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the filter bubbles effects of online media consumption are exaggerated. Other research also shows that online media does not contribute to the increased polarization of opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hohenberg|first=Clemm von|last2=Bernhard|last3=Maes|first3=Michael|last4=Pradelski|first4=Bary S.R.|date=2017-05-25|title=Micro influence and macro dynamics of opinions|ssrn=2974413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that providing people with impartial, objective information has the potential to reduce political polarization, but the effect of information on polarization is highly sensitive to contextual factors. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duhaime|first=Erik|last2=Apfelbaum|first2=Evan|date=2017|title=Can Information Decrease Political Polarization? Evidence From the U.S. Taxpayer Receipt |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550616687126|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume=8|issue=7|page=736|language=en|doi=10.1177/1948550616687126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, polarization over government spending was reduced when people were provided with a "Taxpayer Receipt," but not when they were also asked how they wanted the money to be spent.  This suggests that subtle factors like the mood and tone of partisan news sources may have a large effect on how the same information is interpreted.

==Effects==

Some scholars claim that political polarization is not so pervasive or destructive in influence, contending that partisan agreement is the historical trend in Congress and still frequent in the modern era, including on bills of political importance.&lt;ref name="wilkerson-13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Congress and the politics of problem solving|last=Wilkerson|first=John D.|author2=E.

===The public===

Opinions on polarization's effects on the public are mixed. Some argue that the growing polarization in government has directly contributed to political polarization in the electorate,&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt; but this is not unanimous.&lt;ref name=wilkerson-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=hibbing-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hibbing|first=John R.|author2=Christopher W.

Some scholars argue that polarization lowers public interest in politics, [[party identification]] and [[voter turnout]].&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt; It encourages confrontational dynamics between parties that can lower overall public trust and approval in government.&lt;ref name="hetherington-08"&gt;{{cite book|title=Red and blue nation? Volume Two: Consequences and Correction of America's Polarized Politics|last=Hetherington|first=Marc J.|publisher=Brookings|year=2008|isbn=978-0815760801|editor=Pietro S. Nivola &amp; David W. Brady|location=Washington, DC|chapter=Turned Off or Turned On? How Polarization Affects Political Engagement}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and causes the public to perceive the general political debate as less civil,&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=brady-06/&gt; which can alienate voters. More polarized candidates, especially when voters aren't aware of the increase, also tend to be less representative of the public's wishes.&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hetherington-08" /&gt;

On the other hand, others assert that elite polarization has galvanized the public's political participation in the United States, citing greater voting and nonvoting participation, engagement and investment in campaigns, and increased positive attitude toward government responsiveness.&lt;ref name=hetherington-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=dodson-10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodson|first=Kyle|title=The Return of the American Voter? Party Polarization and Voting Behavior, 1988 to 2004|journal=Sociological Perspectives|date=1 September 2010|volume=53|issue=3|pages=443–449|doi=10.1525/sop.2010.53.3.443|url=http://faculty1.ucmerced.edu/kdodson2/docs/Publications/Dodson_Return%20of%20the%20American%20Voter.pdf}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polarized parties become more ideologically unified, furthering voter knowledge about their positions and increasing their standard to similarly-aligned voters.&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dodson-10" /&gt;

===The media===

As Mann and Ornstein argue, political polarization and the proliferation of media sources have "reinforce[d] tribal divisions, while enhancing a climate where facts are no longer driving the debate and deliberation, nor are they shared by the larger public."&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;  As other scholars have argued, the media often support and provoke the stall and closed rules tactics that disrupt regular policy procedure.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=mutz-06&gt;{{cite book|last=Mutz|first=Diana C.|title=Red and blue nation?

While the media are not immune to general public opinion and reduced polarization allows them to appeal to a larger audience,&lt;ref name=rosenstiel-06&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenstiel|first=Thomas|title=Red and blue nation? Volume One: characteristics and causes of America's polarized politics|year=2006|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0815760832|chapter=Two Alternative Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; polarized environments make it easier for the media and [[advocacy group|interest groups]] to hold elected officials more accountable for their policy promises and positions,&lt;ref name="epstein-07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mutz-06" /&gt; generally healthy for democracy.&lt;ref name="epstein-07" /&gt;

===Judicial systems===

[[Judicial system]]s can also be affected by the implications of political polarization. For the United States, in particular, polarization lowers confirmation rates of judges;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; In 2012, the confirmation rate of presidential circuit court appointments was approximately 50% as opposed to the above 90% rate in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt; More polarized parties have more aggressively block nominees and used tactics to hinder executive agendas.&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;&lt;ref name=dionne-10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dionne|first=E.J., Jr.|author2=William A. Galston|title=A Half-Empty Government Can't Govern: Why Everyone Wants to Fix the Appointments Process, Why It Never Happens, and How We Can Get It Done|journal=Brookings|date=14 December 2010|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2010/12/14-appointments-galston-dionne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Sarah Binder (2000) argues that "senatorial intolerance for the opposing party’s nominees is itself a function of polarization."&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; Negative consequences of this include higher vacancy rates on appellate courts, longer case-processing times and increased caseloads for judges.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=galston-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;

Political scientists argue that in highly polarized periods, nominees become less reflective of the moderate voter as "polarization impacts the appointment and ideological tenor of new federal judges."&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; It also influences the politics of senatorial [[advice and consent]], giving partisan presidents the power to appoint judges far to the left or right of center on the federal bench, obstructing the legitimacy of the judicial branch.&lt;ref name=galston-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;

Ultimately, the increasing presence of ideology in a judicial system impacts the judiciary's credibility.&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;  Polarization can generate strong partisan critiques of federal judges, which can damage the public perception of the justice system and the legitimacy of the courts as nonpartisan legal arbiters.&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;&lt;ref name="wittes-08"&gt;{{cite book|title=Red and blue nation? Volume Two: Consequences and Correction of America's Polarized Politics|last=Wittes|first=Benjamin|publisher=Brookings|year=2008|isbn=978-0815760801|editor=Pietro S. Nivola &amp; David W. Brady|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|location=Washington, DC|chapter=Comments on Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Foreign policy===

Political polarization can undercut unified agreement on [[foreign policy]] and harm a nation's international standing;&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccormick-90&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=James M.|author2=Eugene R. Wittkopf|title=Bipartisanship, Partisanship, and Ideology in Congressional-Executive Foreign Policy Relations, 1947–1988|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=November 1990|volume=52|issue=4|pages=1077–1100|url=http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~lorenzo/McCormick%20Wittkopf%20Bipartisanship.pdf|doi=10.2307/2131683}}&lt;/ref&gt; divisiveness on foreign affairs  strengthens enemies, discourages allies and destabilize a nation's determination.&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;

Political scientists point to two primary implications of polarization with regards to the [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy of the United States"]]. First, when the United States conducts relations abroad and appears divided, allies are less likely to trust its promises, enemies are more likely to predict its weaknesses, and uncertainty as to the country's position in world affairs rises.&lt;ref name="mccormick-90" /&gt;&lt;ref name=wilson-08&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=James Q.|title=Red and blue nation?

== Global Perspective ==
Outside of the U.S., there are plenty of modern day examples of polarization in politics. A bulk of the research into global polarization comes from Europe. One example includes [[Pasokification]] in Greece. This is the trend from a shift from the center-left to a more far-left stance. Pasokification was caused by the Greek populous growing dissatisfied with the country's centrist, left wing party and how they handled the [[Great Recession]] and the austerity measures the European Union put in place during recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackwater|first=Bill|date=Summer 2016|title=Morality and left-wing politics: a case study of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party|url=|journal=Renewal|volume=24|pages=|via=Gale Literature Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the shift further to the left was a massive benefits to the liberal population in Greece, the results in Greece (as well as other nations like Germany, Sweden and Italy) have not been able to sustain themselves. Parties who have made the shift left have recently shown a decline in the voting booths, evidence their supporters are uneasy of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eaton|first=George|date=2018|title=Corbynism 2.0|url=|journal=New Statesman|volume=147|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The shift in Greece to the far-left is similar to the shift in countries like Poland, France and the U.K. to more far-right conservative positions. In those countries, there is heavy anti-Islam sentiment and the rise of [[Populism|populist]] commentary. The general population of the right in these countries tends to hold onto these more aggressive stances and pulls the parties further to the right. These stances include populist messages with Islamophobic, isolationist, and anti-LGBTQ language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarkov|first=Dubravka|date=2017-06-16|title=Populism, polarization and social justice activism|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=197–201|doi=10.1177/1350506817713439|issn=1350-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palonen|first=Emilia|date=2009|title=Political Polarisation and Populism in Contemporary Hungary|url=|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=62|pages=318-334|via=Electronic Journal Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the polarization in these nations leads to either a more socialist left wing party, or more nationalist right wing party. These more polarized parties grow from the discontent of more moderate parties inability to provide progressive changes in either direction.   

== Critiques ==
There have long been numerous scholarly debates that argue over the concept of political polarization, both in whether it is valid, and how it can accurately be measured. There are four primary arguments against the validity of political polarization: 1) Limitations of the Two-Party System, 2) Issue Partisanship, 3) Cultural Differences, and 4) Westernized Focuses.

=== Limitations of the two-party system ===
By solely acknowledging voting patterns, one cannot make an accurate conclusion as to the presence or absence of political polarization, because in the United States, there is a limited number of presidential candidates in the two-party system. To assume that the majority of voters are mostly or completely in agreement with the plethora of political issues within their party is a false assumption.&lt;ref name="Baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-06" /&gt; Despite contrary beliefs, there are many liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats in the U.S. who have differing political beliefs within their parties. However, these voters most often align with their party because of the limited choice of candidates, and to do otherwise (i.e. vote for a third-party candidate) is perceived as a waste of time.&lt;ref name="Baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;

=== Issue partisanship ===
Despite various claims that argue American society is more polarized today than leading up to the U.S. Civil War,&lt;ref name="abramowitz-08" /&gt; numerous scholars explain that much evidence shows there is a relatively stable public opinion on the majority of sociopolitical issues.&lt;ref name="baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Religion, politics, and support for same-sex marriage in the United States, 1988–2008|last = Sherkat|first = Darren|date = 2011|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the most polarization exists, rather, is in the "hot topic" or "sensitive" issues (e.g. abortion, gay marriage, U.S. involvement in war).&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Polarization, secularization, or differences as usual? The denominational cleavage in U.S. social attitudes since the 1970s.|last = Bolzendahl|first = |date = 2005|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-reliance on focusing on opinions regarding social issues to draw conclusion about political polarization is not a valid measurement to fully represent the concept.&lt;ref name="fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06" /&gt;

In regard to views on public policies, Fiorina and Abrams (2008) found virtually no evidence of an increase in widespread political polarization over the past thirty years. Nonetheless, many scholars explain that it is not an increase in ideological coherence among individuals which separates them; it is the partisan extremism (i.e. Democrat v. Republican) which eventually separates voters into one party or the other.&lt;ref name="baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Political polarization projection: Social projection of partisan attitude extremity and attitudinal processes.|last = Van Boven|first = |date = 2012|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Religious convictions and political choice|last = Greenawalt|first = Kent|publisher = |year = 1988|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural differences ===
Proponents of the cultural differences argument are critical of political polarization because of numerous factors, influences, and demographics.&lt;ref name="abramowitz-05" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Purple America|last = Ansolabehere|first = |date = 2006|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The future of red, blue and purple America.|last = Teixeira|first = |publisher = |year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among voter demographic features, there is much evidence of race, sex, age, and educational attainment as being some of the main influences in voting behaviors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130123073800/http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|dead-url =yes|archive-date =2013-01-23|title =U.S. elections: How groups voted in 2012|date =2012|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these factors, the geographic region often plays a major role in voting behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, one's socioeconomic status is a reliable predictor of voting behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:8392|title = Voting behavior based on socioeconomic status|last = Brown|first = |date = 2009|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of these factors and influences compel researchers to reconsider the causes of political polarization.

=== Westernized focus ===
Much like many academic studies, political polarization scholars often are too narrowly focused within one nation and, thus, make broad generalizations regarding the concept from a national study. To have a better picture of the presence or absence of political polarization, scholars must consider widening the scope of their studies to the international contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Globalization's cultural consequences|last = Holton|first = |date = 2000|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization and culture: Global mélange.|last = Pieterse|first = |publisher = |year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''problem of the creator of God''' is the controversy regarding the hypothetical [[Causality|cause]] responsible for the [[existence of God]], presuming God exists. A common challenge to [[theism|theistic]] propositions of a [[creator deity]] as a necessary [[first cause|first-cause]] explanation for the [[universe]] is the question: "Who created God?".&lt;ref&gt;''The God Book'', [[Michael Arnheim]], 2015, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; It contests the proposition that the universe cannot exist without a creator by asserting that the creator of the universe must have the same restrictions. This, in turn, may lead to a problem of [[infinite regress]] wherein each newly presumed creator of a creator is itself presumed to have its own creator.

Some faith traditions have such an element as part of their doctrine. [[Jainism and non-creationism|Jainism]] posits that the universe is eternal and has always existed. In [[Mormonism]] it is believed that the God of this Earth was once a mortal human, who had a father of his own. [[Ismailism]] rejects the idea of God as the ''first cause'', due to the doctrine of God's incomparability and source of any existence including [[Abstract and concrete|abstract objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Arzina R. Lalani Degrees of Excellence: A Fatimid Treatise on Leadership in Islam I.B.Tauris 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-857-71202-8}} page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==
[[Rajneesh|Osho]] writes:
{{quote|No, don't ask that. That's what all the religions say — don't ask who created God. But this is strange — why not? If the question is valid about existence, why does it become invalid when it is applied to God? And once you ask who created God, you are falling into a regress absurdum.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Conspiracy: The Path from Superstition to Super Consciousness'', [[Rajneesh|Osho]], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Humphreys writes:
{{quote|... if someone were able to provide the explanation, we would be forced to embark upon what philosophers call an infinite regress. Having established who created God, we would then have to answer the question of who created God's creator.&lt;ref&gt;''In God We Doubt'', John Humphrys, 2008. {{isbn|978-0340976739}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''The God Book'', Deist [[Michael Arnheim]] writes:
{{quote|The atheist objection is that if God created the universe, who created God? Judging by the number of times that [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]] repeats this same point in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', one must assume that he sees this as a killer argument against the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Book'', [[Michael Arnheim]], 2015, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alan Lurie writes:
{{quote|If God created the Universe, who created God? That is a dilemma that religious folks desperately try to avoid.” The question, “Who created God?”, has been pondered by theologians for millennia, and the answer is both surprisingly obvious and philosophically subtle...

...whatever one thinks about the beginnings of the Universe, there is “something” at the very origin that was not created. This is an inescapable given a cosmic truth.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Lurie, ''The Rabbi Who Believes in Zeus: Popular Myths About Religion, Faith, and God'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Responses==
Defenders of religion have countered that the question is improper:

{{quote|We ask, “If all things have a creator, then who created God?” Actually, only created things have a creator, so it's improper to lump God with his creation. God has revealed himself to us in the Bible as having always existed.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Husting, ''Doubt Busters'', 2017, p. 20. {{isbn|1387312820}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is also argued that the question becomes irrelevant if the Universe is presumed to have circular time instead of linear time.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gabler, ''Slices of a Life'', 2015, Ch. 30 {{isbn|1504960645}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4235">'''Rata Die''' ('''R.D.''') is a system for assigning numbers to calendar days (optionally with time of day), independent of any calendar, for the purposes of [[calendrical calculation]]s. It was named (after the [[Latin]] [[Ablative#Latin|ablative]] feminine singular for "from a [[wikt:rata#Latin|fixed]] [[wikt:dies#Latin|date]]") by Howard Jacobson.&lt;ref name="the_book" /&gt; The same system (including the same epoch) was used earlier, e.g., the [[REXX]] programming language since about 1980:&lt;ref&gt;[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r3/topic/books/sc415729.pdf REXX/400 Reference manual] page 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote cite="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r3/topic/books/sc415729.pdf"&gt;
The base date of 1 January 0001 is determined by extending the current Gregorian calendar backward (365 days each year, with an extra day every year that is divisible by 4 except century years that are not divisible by 400).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rata Die is somewhat similar to [[Julian Date]]s (JD), in that the values are plain [[real number]]s that increase by 1 each day.
The systems differ principally in that JD takes on a particular value at a particular absolute time, and is the same in all contexts, whereas R.D. values may be relative to [[timezone]], depending on the implementation.  This makes R.D. more suitable for work on calendar dates, whereas JD is more suitable for work on time per se. The systems also differ trivially by having different epochs: R.D. is 1 at midnight (00:00) local time on January 1, AD 1 in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]], JD is 0 at noon (12:00) [[Universal Time]] on January 1, 4713 BC in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]], and the [[REXX]] count of days begins with 0 at midnight (00:00) local time on January 1, AD 1 in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

==Forms==
===Dershowitz and Reingold===
There are three distinct forms of R.D.  In this section they will each be defined in terms of Julian Dates.

The first form of R.D. is a continuously-increasing fractional number, taking integer values at midnight local time.  It may be defined in terms of the Julian Date as
:RD = JD &amp;minus; 1&amp;#x202F;721&amp;#x202F;424.5

In the second form, R.D. is an integer that labels an entire day, from midnight to midnight local time.  This is the result of rounding the first form of R.D. downwards (towards negative infinity).  It is the same as the relation between Julian Date and Julian Day Number (JDN).  Thus:
:RD = floor( JD &amp;minus; 1&amp;#x202F;721&amp;#x202F;424.5 )

In the third form, the R.D. is an integer labelling noon time, and incapable of labelling any other time of day. This is defined as
:RD = JD &amp;minus; 1&amp;#x202F;721&amp;#x202F;425
where the R.D. value must be an integer, thus constraining the choice of JD. This form of R.D. is used in the book for conversion of calendar dates between calendars that separate days on different boundaries.

The book does not explicitly distinguish between these three forms, using the abbreviation "R.D." for all of them.&lt;ref name="the_book"&gt;{{cite book

|at=chapter 1.2
|isbn=0-521-70238-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book does not say that the RD is based on Greenwich time, but page&amp;nbsp;10 states that an R.D. with a decimal fraction is called a moment, and the function '''moment-from-jd''' takes a floating point number as an argument and returns the argument minus 1721424.5&amp;#x202F;; there is no requirement or opportunity to supply a time zone offset as an argument.

===REXX===
The DATE function of the REXX computer language can return the number of complete days (that is, not including the current day) since and including the base date, 1 January AD 1 Gregorian, if the "Base" option is specified. This function uses local, not Greenwich, time. REXX does not use the name "Rata Die".

'''The Recurse Center''' (formerly known as '''Hacker School'''; also called '''RC''') is an independent educational institution, combining a retreat for computer programmers with a [[Recruitment|recruiting]] agency. The retreat is an [[intentional community]], a self-directed academic environment for programmers of all levels to improve their skills in, without charge. There is no curriculum and no particular programming languages or paradigms are institutionally favored; instead, participants work on [[Open-source software|open-source projects]] of their own choice, alone or collaboratively, as they see best. The Center has been an active advocate for [[Women in computing|women in programming]].

== History ==

The Center was initially founded in the Summer of 2010 as '''Hackruiter''', an engineering [[recruitment|recruiting]] company, using seed money from [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]]. The idea quickly arose of trying to transform recruiting for start-ups by running a retreat as part of the process, with the goal of helping clients become better programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It officially opened its doors as “Hacker School” in New York in July, 2011, obliquely anticipating the [[Coding Bootcamp|coding bootcamp]] movement that arose in the mid-2010s. Hacker School came to wide public attention in mid-2012, when it partnered with the e-commerce company [[Etsy]] to offer “Hacker Grants” in support of female developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2015 Hacker School was renamed the Recurse Center.

== Business model ==

The programming retreat is free of charge for admitted applicants to attend. The organization itself is for-profit and supports itself through recruitment, by placing some participants in programming jobs.&lt;ref name='jobs'&gt;{{cite web

	|work= Manual
	|accessdate= November 26, 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the retreat reached the "tipping point" of self-sufficiency purely from recruiting income.&lt;ref name='blog-83'&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal costs to the company have been reported at "nearly $12,000" for each participant.&lt;ref name='jobs' /&gt;

The Center does not publish statistics on its admission rate, although there is no published rule against reapplication.

== Educational philosophy and name ==

There is no curriculum; each participant imposes their own structure for self-directed learning on their stay at the Recurse Center, with guidance as requested. Despite its original name ”Hacker School“, the Recurse Center is not a school — its model of self-directed learning was inspired by the [[Unschooling]] philosophy of [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] (1923–1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Nor does it have any connection to the popular notion of a hacker as someone who breaks into computer systems — rather, “hacker” here was intended to suggest a programmer who is technically resourceful but also supportive of other programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

	|accessdate= May 1, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the organization changed its name to the Recurse Center to avoid confusion over these matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Social environment and influence ==

The Center did not initially publish a code of conduct, but eventually formalized its expectations of participant behavior in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  
	|url= https://www.recurse.com/code-of-conduct
	|title= Code of Conduct
	|publisher= Recurse Center  
        |date= June 9, 2017
	|accessdate= June 9, 2017
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, to promote a study environment in which people feel comfortable asking each other for guidance and criticism, the Center has long used a set of “lightweight social rules” to guide interactions between participants. In contrast to traditional “[[Code of conduct|codes of conduct]]”, many of which have a legalistic tone, the social rules are intended to shepherd community behavior unobtrusively, “to remove as many distractions as possible so everyone can focus on programming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

	|title= Social rules
	|work= Manual
	|publisher= Recurse Center  
	|accessdate= November 25, 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These social rules are one of the retreat's most influential features and have been adopted by a number of other programming communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a large community of alumni that have remained active past the end of their ”batch“, interacting with each other and with new participants in person or via virtual tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specializations of participants ==

The level of participants' skill and experience is diverse, in common with retreats in other creative fields and unlike many engineering organizations. Participants range from long-experienced software developers on [[Career break|sabbatical]], to people who have been coding for only a few months, to retirees, to college students on vacation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

	|accessdate= November 27, 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some participants hold doctoral degrees; others have left school before completing secondary or even primary education. Many participants are engineers, but others have strong non-engineering backgrounds, in the Humanities, journalism, pure mathematics, the performing arts, among many others.

'''Reflective writing''' is an [[analysis|analytical]] practice in which the writer describes a real or imaginary scene, event, interaction, passing thought, memory, form, adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the item or incident, thought, feeling, emotion, or situation in his or her life. Many reflective writers keep in mind questions, such as "What did I notice?", "How has this changed me?" or "What might I have done differently?".

Thus, the focus is on writing that is not merely descriptive. The writer revisits the scene to note details and emotions, reflect on meaning, examine what went well or revealed a need for additional learning, and relate what transpired to the rest of life.

Reflective writing is also analyzing the event or idea (thinking in depth and from different [[Point of view (literature)|perspectives]], and trying to explain, often with reference to a model or theory from the subject.)

The '''SRM Engine Suite''' is an engineering software tool used for simulating [[fuel]]s, [[combustion]] and [[exhaust gas]] emissions in [[internal combustion engine]] (IC engine) applications. It is used worldwide by leading IC engine development organisations and fuel companies. The software is developed, maintained and supported by CMCL Innovations,&lt;ref name="cmcl innovations" /&gt; Cambridge, U.K..

== Applications ==

The software has been applied to simulate almost all engine applications and all transportation fuel combinations with many examples&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmclinnovations.com/user-stories/|title=User Stories {{!}} CMCL Innovations|website=www.cmclinnovations.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in numerous leading peer-reviewed journals, a brief summary of these articles is presented here.&lt;ref name="Coble"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Coble| year = 2011 | title = Implementing Detailed Chemistry and In-Cylinder Stratification into 0/1-D IC Engine Cycle Simulation Tools  | journal = SAE Technical Paper  | volume = 1 | id = SAE 2011-01-0849 | doi= 10.4271/2011-01-0849| url = http://papers.sae.org/2011-01-0849 |display-authors=etal| series = SAE Technical Paper Series }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SRM is particular useful in the context of engine modelling &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraft|first1=M|last2=Maigaard|first2=P|last3=Mauss|first3=F|last4=Christensen|first4=M|last5=Johansson|first5=B|title=Investigation of combustion emissions in a homogeneous charge compression injection engine: Measurements and a new computational model|journal=Proceedings of the Combustion Institute|date=2000|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1195–1201|doi=10.1016/S0082-0784(00)80330-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
as the dynamics of the particle ensemble includes detailed [[chemical kinetics]]  whilst accounting for inhomogeneity in composition and [[temperature]] space arising from on-going [[fuel injection]], [[heat transfer]] and [[turbulence]] mixing events.  Through this coupling, heat release profiles and in particular the associated [[exhaust gas]] emissions ([[Particulates]], [[NOx]], [[Carbon monoxide]], [[uHCs|Unburned hydrocarbon]] ''etc''.) can be predicted more accurately than if using the more conventional approaches of standard homogenous and multi-zone reactor methods.&lt;ref name="Coble" /&gt;

==Coupling with third party software tools ==

The software can be coupled as a plug-in into 1D engine cycle software tools,&lt;ref name="Coble" /&gt; are capable of simulating the combustion and emissions during closed volume period of the cycle ([[combustion]], TDC and negative valve overlap).

An advanced [[Application programming interface]] enables for the model to be coupled with a user-defined codes such as 3D-CFD &lt;ref name="Char"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Cao| year = 2009 | title = Influence of Injection Timing and Piston Bowl Geometry on PCCI Combustion and Emissions | journal = SAE Technical Paper  | volume = 2 | pages = 1019–1033 | id = SAE 2009-01-1102 | doi= 10.4271/2009-01-1102| url = http://papers.sae.org/2009-01-1102/|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or control &lt;ref name="h2" /&gt; software.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7056">[[Image:Hyphae.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mycelial cord]] made up of a collection of hyphae; an essential part in the process of saprotrophic nutrition, it is used for the intake of organic matter through its cell wall. The network of hyphae is referred to as a [[mycelium]], which is fundamental to fungal nutrition.]]
'''Saprotrophic nutrition''' {{IPAc-en|s|æ|p|r|ə|ˈ|t|r|ɒ|f|ɪ|k|,_|-|p|r|oʊ|-}}{{refn|{{cite web |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/saprotroph |title=saprotroph - definition of saprotroph in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |access-date=2016-01-20 }}}} or '''lysotrophic nutrition''' is a process of [[Chemotroph#Chemoheterotroph|chemoheterotrophic]] [[extracellular digestion]] involved in the processing of decayed (dead or waste) [[organic matter]]. It occurs in '''saprotrophs''' and [[heterotroph]]s, and is most often associated with [[fungus|fungi]] (for example ''[[Mucor]]'') and soil [[bacteria]]. Saprotrophic microscopic fungi are sometimes called '''saprobes'''; saprotrophic plants or [[microbiome#Bacterial flora|bacterial flora]] are called '''saprophytes''' ([[wikt:sapro-|sapro-]] + [[wikt:-phyte|-phyte]], "rotten material" + "plant"), though it is now believed that all plants previously thought to be saprotrophic are in fact [[myco-heterotrophy|parasites of microscopic fungi]] or [[Parasitic_plant|other plants]]. The process is most often facilitated through the [[active transport]] of such materials through [[endocytosis]] within the internal mycelium and its constituent [[hypha]]e.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1"&gt;{{harvtxt|Clegg|Mackean|2006|p=296}} states the purpose of saprotrophs and their internal nutrition, as well as the main two types of fungi that are most often referred to, as well as describes, visually, the process of saprotrophic nutrition through a diagram of hyphae, referring to the Rhizobium on damp, stale whole-meal bread or rotting fruit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various word roots relating to decayed matter (''detritus'', ''[[wikt:sapro|sapro-]]''), eating and nutrition (''-vore'', ''-phage''), and plants or life forms (''[[wikt:-phyte|-phyte]]'', ''-obe'') produce various terms, such as [[detritivore]], detritophage, saprotroph, saprophyte, saprophage, and saprobe; their meanings overlap, although technical distinctions (based on physiologic mechanisms) narrow the [[word sense|senses]]. For example, [[usage]] distinctions can be made based on macroscopic swallowing of detritus (as an earthworm does) versus microscopic [[lysis]] of detritus (as a mushroom does).

A '''facultative saprophyte''' appears on stressed or dying plants and may combine with the live pathogens.{{cn|date=March 2016}}.

== Process ==
&lt;!-- We need there to be a picture of the process. I'll endeavour to create one, but as ever.. I'm not an expert on such matters. [[User:JCraw|Jordan Craw]] --&gt;
As matter decomposes within a medium  in which a saprotroph is residing, the saprotroph breaks such matter down into its composites.

* [[Protein]]s are broken down into their [[amino acid]] composites through the breaking of peptide bonds by [[protease]]s.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.16"&gt;{{harvtxt|Clegg|Mackean|2006|p=296}}, fig 14.16—Diagram detailing the re-absorption of substrates within the hypha.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lipid]]s are broken down into [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]] by [[lipase]]s.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.16" /&gt;
* [[Starch]] is broken down into pieces of simple disaccharides by [[amylase]]s.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.16" /&gt;

These products are re-absorbed into the hypha through the cell wall via [[endocytosis]] and passed on throughout the mycelium complex. This facilitates the passage of such materials throughout the organism and allows for growth and, if necessary, repair.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1" /&gt;

=== Conditions ===
In order for a saprotrophic organism to facilitate optimal growth and repair, favourable conditions and nutrients must be present.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17"&gt;{{harvtxt|Clegg|Mackean|2006|p=296}}, fig 14.17—A diagram explaining the optimal conditions needed for successful growth and repair.&lt;/ref&gt; Optimal conditions refers to several conditions which optimise the growth of saprotrophic organisms, such as;

# '''Presence of water''': 80–90% of the fungi is composed of water by mass, and requires excess water for absorption due to the evaporation of internally retent water.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17" /&gt;
# '''Presence of oxygen''': Very few saprotrophic organisms can endure anaerobic conditions as evidenced by their growth above media such as water or soil.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17" /&gt;
# '''Neutral-acidic pH''': The condition of neutral or mildly acidic conditions under [[pH]] 7 are required. &lt;!-- I know why, but i need to reference it :-/ --&gt;&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17" /&gt;
# '''Low-medium temperature''': The majority of saprotrophic organisms require temperatures between 1&amp;nbsp;°C and 35&amp;nbsp;°C, with optimum growth occurring at 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_fig14.17" /&gt;

The majority of nutrients taken in by such organisms must be able to provide carbon, proteins, vitamins and in some cases, [[ion]]s. Due to the carbon composition of the majority of organisms, dead and organic matter provide rich sources of disaccharides and polysaccharides such as  [[maltose]] and [[starch]], and of the monosaccharide [[glucose]].&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1" /&gt;

In terms of nitrogen-rich sources, saprotrophs require combined protein for the creation of proteins, which is facilitated by the absorption of amino acids, and usually taken from rich soil. Although both ions and vitamins are rare, thiamine or ions such as potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium aid the growth of the mycelium.&lt;ref name="advanced_biology_principles_1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5645">In a '''school garden''', [[Elementary school|school]] children are set to work cultivating flower and vegetable gardens. The school garden is an outgrowth of regular [[school work]]. It is an effort to get children out of doors and away from books. It is a healthy realism putting more vigor and intensity into school work.

==Curriculum role==
The school-garden has an important relation to several school studies. First of these is nature study. There is no better way of bringing children into contact with plant life than by raising flowers and vegetables in the garden. The boys and girls get out of doors, prepare the soil, plant the seed, observe the growth of plants, cultivate them through the season, and finally observe the growth and ripening of the fruit. This whole cycle of growth and change is the most fundamental thing in plant study.

In the second place the garden has a very important place in the study of geography. In the home geography in the early grades classes of children are required to visit the gardens and study the processes of cultivation and marketing the products. These are fundamental lessons in geography. In this way gardening leads on to agriculture, scientific farming, and fruit raising. The garden naturally suggests farming, the raising of corn and other grains, the feeding of cattle, dairying and butter-making, fruit-culture, as of berries, stone-fruits, apples and pears. Scientific agriculture and fruit-raising are based on principles of careful selection of seed and of wise cultivation, of fertilizing and preserving soils, of grafting, pruning and caring for fruit trees and dealing with insect pests.

The school garden has an important relation to esthetics. [[Floriculture]], landscape gardening, tree-planting and fruit-culture appeal to the sense of beauty. The whole yard and garden together need to be planted and laid out on principles of taste and attractiveness.

Perhaps the most important relation of the school garden is that to the home. Where boys and girls become properly interested in the school garden, they naturally desire to raise a garden at home in their own backyard and perhaps flowerbeds and trees in the front yard. This answers in many ways to the necessities and comforts of the home. The whole town may take on a new appearance, in its yards and gardens, on account of this interest developed in the school garden. Beauty and utility are combined; the home-table is supplied with vegetables and beautified by the flowers which the children themselves raise.

The educative effect upon the boy or girl of carrying out through the whole season plans for cultivating a garden is one of the best products of good training. The cultivation of plants requires constant attention, forethought, intelligence, self-reliance and a kind of originality; difficulties are to be met and overcome. Insects infest the plants and must be gotten rid of; chickens scratch up and spoil the garden and a fence is needed for protection; a dry spell calls for some plan of watering; weeds quickly take possession of a garden; and the child must be intelligent and thoughtful in meeting such difficulties. This is the best kind of training. To say the least, it is far better than letting the boy run wild on the streets and getting into all sorts of mischief.

Most of our progressive normal schools in all parts of the country are taking up the problem of school-gardens, not for the children simply but for the teachers. Young teachers are set to work to learn the whole problem, so that they may later guide the children in garden work. It is clear that the school-garden is to occupy an important place in the future education of boys and girls.

==History==
The value of school gardens in education has long been recognized in [[Europe]]. They were started as early as 1819 in [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. In 1869 they were prescribed by law in [[Austria]] and [[Sweden]], in [[Belgium]] since 1873 and in [[France]] since 1880. In the early 20th century, there were 20,000 schools in Austria having gardens, 45,000 in France, 8,000 in [[Russia]] and 2,500 in Sweden. The number in the latter country once was double the present number, but has decreased since the introduction of [[manual training]]. School gardening was practically obligatory for the children of the common schools of Belgium, Netherlands, British West Indies and Ceylon. Many of the foreign governments subsidized the school gardens, offered prizes, and made training in agriculture obligatory for [[normal school]] graduates.

School gardens have been advocated as an important aspect of manual training and of the whole subject of industrial education. It is a phase of manual training to teach children to use the tools and implements of the garden, to prepare the soil and carefully cultivate plants. It is an outdoor physical training combined with intelligent mental effort quite equal in its effects to shop work.

Some universities in the United States, like Cornell, Illinois, Ohio and Louisiana, have taken up the problem of school agriculture, country life and scientific farming in earnest. Pamphlets are published by experts of agriculture dealing with important phases of school agriculture and school gardens, in particular Jewell's ''Agricultural Education'' (Bulletin 368, U. S. Bureau of Education).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5974">{{About|the exercise phenomenon|other uses|Second Wind (disambiguation)}}
'''Second wind''' is a phenomenon in distance running, such as [[marathon]]s or [[road running]] (as well as other sports), whereby an athlete who is out of breath and too tired to continue suddenly finds the strength to press on at top performance with less exertion. The feeling may be similar to that of a "[[runner's high]]", the most obvious difference being that the runner's high occurs after the race is over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Runner Glossary|publisher=Road Runner Sports|url=http://www.roadrunnersports.com/rrs/content/content.jsp?contentId=500063#r}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists believe the second wind to be a result of the body finding the proper balance of [[oxygen]] to counteract the buildup of [[lactic acid]] in the muscles.&lt;ref name=Gontang/&gt; Others claim second winds are due to [[endorphin]] production.  

Heavy breathing during exercise is also to provide cooling for the body.   After some time the veins and capillaries dilate and cooling takes place more through the skin, so less heavy breathing is needed.   The increase in the temperature of the skin can be felt at the same time as the "second wind" takes place.

Documented experiences of the second wind go back at least 100 years, when it was taken to be a commonly held fact of exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Energies of Men|author=William James|year=1907|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/energies.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon has come to be used as a metaphor for continuing on with renewed energy past the point thought to be one's prime, whether in other sports, careers, or life in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Second Wind|publisher=Time|date=March 29, 1971|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944328,00.html?promoid=googlep}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Capriati Barely Outlasts Hingis in a Well-Heated Match|author=Christopher Clarey|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=January 28, 2002|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2002/01/28/open_ed3__2.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charles Gibson Enjoys a Second Wind on ABC|author=Jacques Steinberg|date=May 17, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/17/arts/television/17abc.html?ex=1337054400&amp;en=113d1e659553d21c&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second wind phenomenon is also seen in some medical conditions, such as [[glycogen storage disease type V]].

==Hypotheses==
===Metabolic switching===
When non-aerobic glycogen metabolism is insufficient to meet energy demands, physiologic mechanisms utilize alternative sources of energy such as fatty acids and proteins via aerobic respiration. Second-wind phenomena in metabolic disorders such as [[McArdle's disease]] are attributed to this metabolic switch and the same or a similar phenomenon may occur in healthy individuals (see [[Glycogen storage disease type V#Signs and symptoms|symptoms of McArdle's disease]]).

===Lactic acid===
Muscular exercise as well as other cellular functions requires oxygen to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and properly function. This normal function is called [[aerobic metabolism]] and does not produce lactic acid if enough oxygen is present. During heavy exercise such as long distance running or any demanding exercise, the body's need for oxygen to produce energy is higher than the oxygen supplied in the blood from respiration. [[Anaerobic metabolism]] to some degree then takes place in the muscle and this less ideal energy production produces [[lactic acid]] as a waste metabolite. If the oxygen supply is not soon restored, this may lead to accumulation of lactic acid.

This is the case even without exercise in people with [[respiratory disease]], challenged circulation of blood to parts of the body or any other situation when oxygen cannot be supplied to the tissues involved.

Some people's bodies may take more time than others to be able to balance the amount of oxygen they need to counteract the lactic acid. This theory of the second wind posits that, by pushing past the point of pain and exhaustion, runners may give their systems enough time to warm up and begin to use the oxygen to its fullest potential. For this reason, well-conditioned Olympic-level runners do not generally experience a second wind (or they experience it much sooner) because their bodies are trained to perform properly from the start of the race.

The idea of "properly trained" athlete delves into the theory of how an amateur athlete can train his or her body to increase the aerobic capacity or aerobic metabolism. A big push{{clarify|date=August 2016}} in Ironman Triathlon ten years ago introduced the idea of heart rate training and "tricking" one's body into staying in an aerobic metobolic state for longer periods of time.  This idea is widely accepted and incorporated into many Ironman Triathlon training programs.&lt;ref name=Gontang&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Newsweek|date=July 27, 1992|first=Ozzie|last=Gontang|title=Second Wind|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/sports/running/26-Second-Wind.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Endorphins===
[[Endorphins]] are credited as the cause of the feeling of euphoria and wellbeing found in many forms of exercise, so proponents of this theory believe that the second wind is caused by their early release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Be Active For Your Mental Health|url=http://www.mhca.org.au/AboutMentalHealth/ExerciseForYourMentalHealth.html|publisher=Mental Health Council of Australia|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these proponents feel that the second wind is very closely related to&amp;mdash;or even interchangeable with&amp;mdash;the runner's high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hal Higdon's Smart Running|pages=27|publisher=Rodale Books|year=1998|author=[[Hal Higdon]]|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0875965350/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5920">'''Software diagnosis''' (also: ''software diagnostics'') refers to concepts, techniques, and tools that allow for obtaining findings, conclusions, and evaluations about [[software system]]s and their implementation, composition, behavior, and evolution. It serves as means to monitor, steer, observe and optimize software development, software maintenance, and software re-engineering in the sense of a [[business intelligence]] approach specific to software systems. It is generally based on the automatic extraction, analysis, and visualization of corresponding information sources of the software system. It can also be manually done and not automatic.

== Applications ==
Software diagnosis supports all branches of [[software engineering]], in particular project management, quality management, risk management as well as implementation and test. Its main strength is to support all stakeholders of software projects (in particular during [[software maintenance]] and for software re-engineering tasks&lt;ref&gt;Martin Beck, Jonas Trümper, Jürgen Döllner: "A Visual Analysis and Design Tool for Planning Software Reengineerings". Proceedings of the 6th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 54-61, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) and to provide effective communication means for [[software development]] projects. For example, software diagnosis facilitates "bridging an essential information gap between management and development, improve awareness, and serve as early risk detection instrument".&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bohnet, Jürgen Döllner: "Monitoring Code Quality and Development Activity by Software Maps". Proceedings of the IEEE ACM ICSE Workshop on Managing Technical Debt, pp. 9-16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Software diagnosis includes assessment methods for "perfective maintenance" that, for example, apply "visual analysis techniques to combine multiple indicators for low maintainability, including code complexity and entanglement with other parts of the system, and recent changes applied to the code".&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Trümper et al.: "A Visual Analysis Approach to Support Perfective Software Maintenance". Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 308-315, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
In contrast to manifold approaches and techniques in [[software engineering]], software diagnosis does not depend on programming languages, modeling techniques, software development processes or the specific techniques used in the various stages of the software development process. Instead, software diagnosis aims at analyzing and evaluating the software system in its as-is state and based on system-generated information to bybass any subjective or potentially outdated information sources (e.g., initial software models). For it, software diagnosis combines and relates sources of information that are typically not directly linked. Examples: 
* Source-code metrics are related with software developer activity to gain insight into developer-specific effects on software code quality.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Limberger et al.: "Interactive Software Maps for Web-Based Source Code Analysis". Proceedings of the International Web3D Conference, ACM, pp. 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* System structure and run-time execution traces are correlated to facilitate program comprehension through dynamic analysis in software maintenance tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Trümper et al.: "ViewFusion: Correlating Structure and Activity Views for Execution Traces". Proceedings of the 10th Theory and Practice of Computer Graphics Conference, European Association for Computer Graphics, pp. 45-52, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
The core principle of software diagnosis is to automatically extract information from all available information sources of a given software projects such as source code base, project repository, code metrics, execution traces,&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bohnet: "Visualization of Execution Traces and its Application to Software Maintenance". PhD thesis, Hasso-Plattner-Institut, University of Potsdam, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; test results, etc. To combine information, software-specific data mining, analysis, and visualization techniques are applied. Its strength results, among various reasons, from integrating decoupled information spaces in the scope of a typical software project, for example development and developer activities (recorded by the repository) and code and quality metrics (derived by analyzing source code) or key performance indicators (KPIs).

== Examples ==
Examples of software diagnosis tools include [[software map]]s and [[software metrics]].

== Critics ==
Software diagnosis—in contrast to many approaches in software engineering—does not assume that developer capabilities, development methods, programming or modeling languages are right or wrong (or better or worse compared to each other): Software diagnosis aims at giving insight into a given software system and its status ''regardless of the methods, languages, or models'' used to create and maintain the system.

==Location==
SCCWRP is located in [[Costa Mesa, California]].  SCCWRP's original location (in 1969) was Westwood, California, with subsequent offices in El Segundo, Long Beach and Westminster before moving to the present location in 2007.

==Research==
SCCWRP’s research foci include collaborative regional environmental monitoring, development of assessment tools to characterize environmental conditions, and modeling and analysis to answer relevant environmental management questions. Significant research topics include regional monitoring of the [[Southern California Bight]], beach [[water quality]], [[hydromodification]], [[wetlands]], [[eutrophication]], [[marine debris]], and [[contaminants]] of emerging concern.&lt;ref&gt;Panel on Southern California Bight of the Committee on a Systems Assessment of Marine Environmental Monitoring (1990).

==History==
SCCWRP was formed in 1969, at about the time when California’s Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act was passed, to prepare an integrative report about the effects of wastewater and other discharges on the Southern California coastal marine environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Mearns|first1=Alan J |first2=M James |last2=Allen|first3=Michael D |last3=Moore|year=2001|title=The Southern California Coastal Water Research Project - 30 years of environmental research in the Southern California Bight|url=ftp://ftp.sccwrp.org/pub/download/DOCUMENTS/AnnualReports/1999AnnualReport/01_ar01.pdf|format=PDF|pages=2-26 |editor1=S.B.

==Member Agencies==
SCCWRP's original member agencies in 1969 included the five largest southern California metropolitan sanitation agencies ([[City of San Diego]], [[Los Angeles|City of Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]] Sanitation District, [[Orange County Sanitation District]], and [[Ventura County]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kennish, Michael J (1998). ''Pollution Impacts on Marine Biotic Communities.'' Boca Raton, FL: [[CRC Press]]. p. 151-152. {{ISBN|0-8493-8428-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, additional member agencies were added to the JPA. 

These include water quality regulatory agencies added in 1990 ([[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], Region IX; [[California State Water Resources Control Board]]; Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board; Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board; and San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board) and the largest southern California stormwater management agencies added in 2003 (Ventura County Watershed Protection District, Los Angeles County Flood Control District, Orange County Public Works, and [[County of San Diego]]). The most recent addition was the California Ocean Protection Council, which was added in 2007 to enhance interactions with the [[California Resources Agency]].

The '''symbol grounding problem''' is related to the problem of how [[word]]s  ([[symbol]]s) get their [[Meaning (psychology)|meanings]], and hence to the problem of what meaning itself really is. The problem of meaning is in turn related to the problem of [[consciousness]], or how it is that [[mental state]]s are meaningful.

==Background==

===Referents===
[[Gottlob Frege]] distinguished a referent (the thing that a word refers to) and the word's meaning. This is most clearly illustrated using the proper names of concrete individuals, but it is also true of names of kinds of things and of abstract properties: (1) "Tony Blair", (2) "the prime minister of the UK during the year 2004", and (3) "Cherie Blair's husband" all have the same referent, but not the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Although this article draws in places upon Frege's view of semantics,  it is very anti-Fregean in stance. Frege was a fierce critic of psychological accounts that attempt to explain meaning in terms of mental states.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the meaning of a (referring) word is the rule or features that one must use in order to successfully pick out its referent. In that respect, (2) and (3) come closer to wearing their meanings on their sleeves, because they are explicitly stating a rule for picking out their referents: "Find whoever was prime minister of the UK during the year 2004", or "find whoever is Cherie's current husband". But that does not settle the matter, because there's still the problem of the meaning of the components of that rule ("UK," "during", "current", "PM", "Cherie", "husband"), and how to pick ''them'' out.

The phrase "Tony Blair" (or better still, just "Tony") does not have this recursive component problem, because it points straight to its referent, but how? If the meaning is the rule for picking out the referent, what is that rule, when we come down to non-decomposable components like proper names of individuals (or names of ''kinds'', as in "an unmarried man" is a "bachelor")?

===Referential process===

Humans are able to pick out the intended referents of words{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, such as "Tony Blair" or "bachelor," but this process need not be explicit.  It is probably an unreasonable expectation to know the explicit [[Philosophical Investigations#Rules|rule]] for picking out the intended referents{{why|date=October 2016}}.

So if we take a word's meaning to be the means of picking out its referent, then meanings are in our brains. That is meaning in the ''narrow'' sense. If we use "meaning" in a ''wider'' sense, then we may want to say that meanings include both the referents themselves and the means of picking them out. So if a word (say, "Tony-Blair") is located inside an entity (e.g., oneself) that can use the word and pick out its referent, then the word's wide meaning consists of both the means that that entity uses to pick out its referent, and the referent itself: a wide causal nexus between (1) a head, (2) a word inside it, (3) an object outside it, and (4) whatever "processing" is required in order to successfully connect the inner word to the outer object.

But what if the "entity" in which a word is located is not a head but a piece of paper (or a computer screen)? What is its meaning then? Surely all the (referring) words on this screen, for example, have meanings, just as they have referents.

In the 19th century, the semiotician [[Charles Saunders Peirce]] suggested what some think is a similar model: according to his triadic sign model, meaning requires (1) an interpreter, (2) a sign or representamen, (3) an object, and is (4) the virtual product of an endless regress and progress called [[Semiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Charles S. The philosophy of Peirce: selected writings. New York: AMS Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have interpreted Peirce as addressing the problem of grounding, feelings, and intentionality for the understanding of semiotic processes.&lt;ref&gt;Semeiosis and Intentionality T. L. Short Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Vol. 17, No. 3 (Summer, 1981), pp. 197-223&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Peirce's theory of signs has been rediscovered by an increasing number of artificial intelligence researchers in the context of symbol grounding problem.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Peirce and artificial intelligence: historical heritage and (new) theoretical stakes; Pierre Steiner; SAPERE - Special Issue on Philosophy and Theory of AI 5:265-276 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grounding process ===

{{expand section|date=October 2016}}

There would be no connection at all between written symbols and any intended referents if there were no minds mediating those intentions, via their own internal means of picking out those intended referents.

So the meaning of a word on a page is "ungrounded."&lt;ref&gt;Or, "imputed" as read below the dotted baseline of the [[triangle of reference]] since 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor would looking it up in a dictionary help: If one tried to look up the meaning of a word one did not understand in a [[dictionary]] of a language one did not already understand, one would just cycle endlessly from one meaningless definition to another. One's search for meaning would be ungrounded.

In contrast, the meaning of the words in one's head—those words one ''does'' understand—are "grounded"{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. That mental grounding of the meanings of words mediates between the words on any external page one reads (and understands) and the external objects to which those words refer.&lt;ref&gt;This is the [[causal theory of reference|causal]], [[contextual theory of reference]] that [[C. K. Ogden|Ogden]] &amp; [[I. A. Richards|Richards]] packed in ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' (1923).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[semantic externalism]] as claimed in "The Meaning of 'Meaning'" of ''Mind, Language and Reality'' (1975) by [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] who argues: "Meanings just ain't in the head." Now he and [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]] seem to favor [[anti-realism]] in favor of [[intuitionism]], [[psychologism]], [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] and [[contextualism]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requirements for symbol grounding===

Another symbol system is [[natural language]] (Fodor 1975). On paper or in a computer, language, too, is just a formal symbol system, manipulable by rules based on the arbitrary shapes of words. But in the brain, meaningless strings of squiggles become meaningful thoughts. Harnad has suggested two properties that might be required to make this difference:

*capacity to pick referents
*consciousness

====Capacity to pick out referents====
One property that static paper or, usually, even a dynamic computer lack that the brain possesses is the capacity to pick out symbols' referents. This is what we were discussing earlier, and it is what the hitherto undefined term "grounding" refers to. A symbol system alone, whether static or dynamic, cannot have this capacity (any more than a book can), because picking out referents is not just a computational (implementation-independent) property; it is a dynamical (implementation-dependent) property.

To be grounded, the symbol system would have to be augmented with nonsymbolic, sensorimotor capacities—the capacity to interact autonomously with that world of objects, events, actions, properties and states that its symbols are systematically interpretable (by us) as referring to. It would have to be able to pick out the referents of its symbols, and its sensorimotor interactions with the world would have to fit coherently with the symbols' interpretations.

The symbols, in other words, need to be connected directly to (i.e., grounded in) their referents; the connection must not be dependent only on the connections made by the brains of external interpreters like us. Just the symbol system alone, without this capacity for direct grounding, is not a viable candidate for being whatever it is that is really going on in our brains when we think meaningful thoughts (Cangelosi &amp; Harnad 2001).

Meaning as the ability to recognize instances (of objects) or perform actions is specifically treated in the paradigm called "Procedural Semantics", described in a number of papers including "Procedural Semantics" by Philip N.  Johnson-Laird &lt;ref&gt;Philip N.  Johnson-Laird  "Procedural Semantics" (Cognition, 5  (1977) 189; see http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/courses/mindsandmachines/Papers/procedural.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded by William A. Woods in "Meaning and Links".&lt;ref&gt;William A. Woods. "Meaning and Links" (AI Magazine Volume 28 Number 4 (2007); see http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2069/2056)&lt;/ref&gt;  A brief summary in Woods' paper reads: "The idea of procedural semantics is that the semantics of natural language sentences can be characterized in a formalism whose meanings are defined by abstract procedures that a computer (or a person) can either execute or reason about. In this theory the meaning of a noun is a procedure for recognizing or generating instances, the meaning of a proposition is a procedure for determining if it is true or false, and the meaning of an action is the ability to do the action or to tell if it has been done."

====Consciousness====
The necessity of groundedness, in other words, takes us from the level of the pen-pal [[Turing test]], which is purely symbolic (computational), to the robotic Turing test, which is hybrid symbolic/sensorimotor (Harnad 2000, 2007). Meaning is grounded in the robotic capacity to detect, categorize, identify, and act upon the things that words and sentences refer to (see entries for [[Affordance]] and for [[Categorical perception]]). On the other hand, if the symbols (words and sentences) refer to the very bits of '0' and '1', directly connected to their electronic implementations, which a (any?) computer system can readily manipulate (thus detect, categorize, identify and act upon), then even non-robotic computer systems could be said to be "sensorimotor" and hence able to "ground" symbols in this narrow domain. 

To categorize is to do the right thing with the right ''kind'' of thing. The categorizer must be able to detect the sensorimotor features of the members of the category that reliably distinguish them from the nonmembers. These feature-detectors must either be inborn or learned. The learning can be based on trial and error induction, guided by feedback from the consequences of correct and incorrect categorization; or, in our own linguistic species, the learning can also be based on verbal descriptions or definitions. The description or definition of a new category, however, can only convey the category and ground its name if the words in the definition are themselves already grounded category names (Blondin-Massé et al. 2008). So ultimately grounding has to be sensorimotor, to avoid infinite regress (Harnad 2005).

But if groundedness is a necessary condition for meaning, is it a sufficient one? Not necessarily, for it is possible that even a robot that could pass the Turing test, "living" amongst the rest of us indistinguishably for a lifetime, would fail to have in its head what Searle has in his: It could be a [[Philosophical zombie|zombie]], with no one home, feeling feelings, meaning meanings (Harnad 1995). However, it is possible that different interpreters (including different intelligent species of animals) would have different mechanisms for producing meaning in their systems, thus one cannot require that a system different from a human "experiences" meaning in the same way that a human does, and vice-versa. 

Harnad thus points at consciousness as a second property. The problem of discovering the causal mechanism for successfully picking out the referent of a category name can in principle be solved by cognitive science. But the problem of explaining how consciousness could play an "independent" role in doing so is probably insoluble, except on pain of [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. Perhaps symbol grounding (i.e., robotic TT capacity) is enough to ensure that conscious meaning is present, but then again, perhaps not. In either case, there is no way we can hope to be any the wiser—and that is Turing's methodological point (Harnad 2001b, 2003, 2006).

==Formulation==
To answer this question we have to formulate the symbol grounding problem itself [http://cogprints.org/3106/ (Harnad 1990)]:

{{expand section|date=October 2016}}

==Functionalism==

There is a school of thought according to which the computer is more like the brain—or rather, the brain is more like the computer: According to this view (called "[[Computational theory of mind|computationalism]]", a variety of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]), the future theory explaining how the brain picks out its referents (the theory that cognitive neuroscience may eventually arrive at) will be a purely computational one (Pylyshyn 1984). A computational theory is a theory at the software level. It is essentially a computer algorithm: a set of rules for manipulating symbols. And the algorithm is "implementation-independent." That means that whatever it is that an algorithm is doing, it will do the same thing no matter what hardware it is executed on. The physical details of the [[dynamical system]] implementing the computation are irrelevant to the computation itself, which is purely formal; any hardware that can run the computation will do, and all physical implementations of that particular computer algorithm are equivalent, computationally.

A computer can execute any computation. Hence once computationalism finds a proper computer algorithm, one that our brain could be running when there is meaning transpiring in our heads, meaning will be transpiring in that computer too, when it implements that algorithm.

How would we know that we have a proper computer algorithm? It would have to be able to pass the [[Turing test]]. That means it would have to be capable of corresponding with any human being as a pen-pal, for a lifetime, without ever being in any way distinguishable from a real human pen-pal.

==Searle's Chinese room argument==
{{main|Chinese room}}
[[John Searle]] formulated the "[[Chinese room]] argument" in order to disprove computationalism{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. The Chinese room argument is based on a thought experiment: in it, Searle stated that if the Turing test were conducted in Chinese, then he himself, Searle (who does not understand Chinese), could execute a program that implements the same algorithm that the computer was using without knowing what any of the words he was manipulating meant. 

At first glance, it would seem that if there's no meaning going on inside Searle's head when he is implementing that program, then there's no meaning going on inside the computer when it is the one implementing the algorithm either, computation being implementation-independent. But on a closer look, for a person to execute the same program that a computer would, at very least it would  have to have access to a similar bank of memory that the computer has (most likely externally stored). This means that the new computational system that executes the same algorithm is no longer just Searle's original head, but that plus the memory bank (and possibly other devices). 
In particular, this additional memory could store a digital representation of the intended referent of different words (like images, sounds, even video sequences), that the algorithm would use as a model of, and to derive features assotiated with, the intended referent. The "meaning" then is not to be searched in just Searle's original brain, but in the overall system needed to process the algorithm. (Just like when Searle is reading English words, the meaning is not to be located in isolated logical processing areas of the brain, but probably in the overall brain, likely including specific long-term memory areas). 
Thus, Searle's not perceiving any meaning in his head alone when simulating the work of a computer, does not imply lack of meaning in the overall system, and thus in the actual computer system passing an advanced Turing test.

=== Implications ===
How does Searle know that there is no meaning going on in his head when he is executing such a Turing-test-passing program? Exactly the same way he knows whether there is or is not meaning going on inside his head under any other conditions: He ''understands'' the words of English, whereas the Chinese symbols that he is manipulating according to the algorithm's rules mean nothing whatsoever to him (and there is no one else in his head for them to mean anything to). However, the complete system that is manipulating those Chinese symbols - which is not just Searle's brain, as explained in the previous section - may have the ability to extract meaning from those symbols, in the sense of being able to use  internal (memory) models of the intended referents, pick out the intended referents of those symbols, and generally identifying and using their features appropriately.

Note that in pointing out that the Chinese words would be meaningless to him under those conditions, Searle has appealed to consciousness. Otherwise one could argue that there ''would'' be meaning going on in Searle's  head under those conditions, but that Searle himself would simply not be conscious of it. That is called the [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/#4.1 "Systems Reply"] to Searle's Chinese Room Argument, and Searle [http://cogprints.org/4023/ rejects] the Systems Reply as being merely a reiteration, in the face of negative evidence, of the very thesis (computationalism) that is on trial in his thought-experiment: "Are words in a running computation like the ungrounded words on a page, meaningless without the mediation of brains, or are they like the grounded words in brains?"

In this either/or question, the (still undefined) word "ungrounded" has implicitly relied on the difference between inert words on a page and consciously meaningful words in our heads. And Searle is asserting that under these conditions (the Chinese Turing test), the words in his head would not be consciously meaningful, hence they would still be as ungrounded as the inert words on a page.

So if Searle is right, that (1) both the words on a page and those in any running computer program (including a Turing-test-passing computer program) are meaningless in and of themselves, and hence that (2) whatever it is that the brain is doing to generate meaning can't be just implementation-independent computation, then what ''is'' the brain doing to generate meaning [http://cogprints.org/4023/ (Harnad 2001a)]?

==Brentano's notion of intentionality==
"[[Intentionality]]" has been called the "mark of the mental" because of some observations by the philosopher [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] to the effect that mental states always have an inherent, intended (mental) object or content toward which they are "directed": One sees something, wants something, believes something, desires something, understands something, means something etc., and that object is always something that one has ''in mind''. Having a mental object is part of having anything in mind. Hence it is the mark of the mental. There are no "free-floating" mental states that do not also have a mental object. Even hallucinations and imaginings have an object, and even feeling depressed feels like something. Nor is the object the "external" physical object, when there is one. One may see a real chair, but the "intentional" object of one's "intentional state" is the mental chair one has in mind. (Yet another term for intentionality has been "aboutness" or "representationality": thoughts are always ''about'' something; they are (mental) "representations" ''of''  something; but that something is what it is that the thinker has in mind, not whatever external object may or may not correspond to it.)

If this all sounds like skating over the surface of a problem rather than a real break-through, then the foregoing description has had its intended effect: No, the problem of intentionality is not the symbol grounding problem; nor is grounding symbols the solution to the problem of intentionality. The symbols inside an autonomous dynamical symbol system that is able to pass the robotic Turing test are grounded, in that, unlike in the case of an ungrounded symbol system, they do not depend on the mediation of the mind of an external interpreter to connect them to the external objects that they are interpretable (by the interpreter) as being "about"; the connection is autonomous, direct, and unmediated. But ''grounding is not meaning''. Grounding is an input/output performance function. Grounding connects the sensory inputs from external objects to internal symbols and states occurring within an autonomous sensorimotor system, guiding the system's resulting processing and output.

Meaning, in contrast, is something mental. But to try to put a halt to the name-game of proliferating nonexplanatory synonyms for the mind/body problem without solving it (or, worse, implying that there is more than one mind/body problem), let us cite just one more thing that requires no further explication: ''feeling''. The only thing that distinguishes an internal state that merely has grounding from one that has meaning is that it ''feels like something'' to be in the meaning state, whereas it does not feel like anything to be in the merely grounded functional state. Grounding is a functional matter; feeling is a felt matter. And that is the real source of Brentano's vexed peekaboo relation between "intentionality" and its internal "intentional object":  All mental states, in addition to being the functional states of an autonomous dynamical system, are also feeling states: Feelings are not merely "functed," as all other physical states are; feelings are also felt.

Hence feeling ([[sentience]]) is the real mark of the mental. But the symbol grounding problem is not the same as the mind/body problem, let alone a solution to it. The mind/body problem is actually the feeling/function problem: Symbol-grounding touches only its functional component.  This does not detract from the importance of the symbol grounding problem, but just reflects that it is a keystone piece to the bigger puzzle called the mind.

The neuroscientist [[Antonio Damasio]] investigates this marking function of feelings and emotions in his [[Somatic marker hypothesis]]. Damasio adds the notion of biologic [[homeostasis]] to this discussion, presenting it as an automated bodily regulation process providing intentionality to a mind via emotions. Homeostasis is the mechanism that keeps all bodily processes in healthy balance. All of our actions and perceptions will be automatically "evaluated" by our body hardware according to their contribution to homeostasis. This gives us an implicit orientation on how to survive. Such bodily or somatic evaluations can come to our mind in the form of conscious and non-conscious feelings ("gut feelings") and lead our decision-making process. The meaning of a word can be roughly conceptualized as the sum of its associations and their expected contribution to homeostasis, where associations are reconstructions of sensomotor perceptions that appeared in contiguity with the word. Yet, the Somatic marker hypothesis is still hotly debated and critics claim that it has failed to clearly demonstrate how these processes interact at a psychological and evolutionary level. The recurrent question that the Somatic marker hypothesis does not address remains: how and why does homeostasis (as in any [[servomechanism]] such as a thermostat and furnace) become ''felt'' homeostasis?

'''Systems biomedicine''', also called '''systems biomedical science''',&lt;ref&gt;Systems approaches to biomedical science doctoral training programme at the University of Oxford in the UK. Their website: http://www.sabscdt.ox.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; is the application of [[systems biology]] to the understanding and modulation of developmental and pathological processes in humans, and in animal and cellular models. Whereas systems biology aims at modeling exhaustive networks of interactions&lt;ref&gt;Uri Alon, An Introduction to Systems Biology - Design Principles of Biological Circuits, CRC Press, 3rd printing (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; (with the long-term goal of, for example, creating a comprehensive [[computational model]] of the cell), mainly at intra-cellular level, systems biomedicine emphasizes the multilevel, hierarchical nature of the models ([[molecule]], [[organelle]], [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], individual/[[genotype]], [[environmental factor]], [[population]], [[ecosystem]]) by discovering and selecting the key factors at each level and integrating them into models that reveal the global, [[emergence|emergent behavior]] of the biological process under consideration.

Such an approach will be favorable when the execution of all the experiments necessary to establish exhaustive models is limited by time and expense (e.g., in animal models) or basic ethics (e.g., human experimentation).

In the year of 1992, a paper on system biomedicine by Kamada T. was published (Nov.-Dec.), and an article on systems medicine and pharmacology by Zeng B.J. was also published (April) in the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng (B.) J., On the holographic model of human body, 1st National Conference of Comparative
Studies Traditional Chinese Medicine and West Medicine, Medicine and Philosophy, April, 1992 ( termed "systems medicine and pharmacology").&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, the first collective book on systems biomedicine was edited by Edison T. Liu and Douglas A. Lauffenburger.&lt;ref&gt;Edison T. Liu and Douglas A. Lauffenburger, Systems Biomedicine: Concepts and Perspectives, Academic Press (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, one of the first research groups uniquely devoted to systems biomedicine was established at the [[European Institute of Oncology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifom-ieo-campus.it/research/donofrio.php IFOM-IEO Campus::Research program::Alberto d'Onofrio::Systems Biomedicine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first research centers specialized on systems biomedicine was founded by [[Rudi Balling]]. The [http://wwwde.uni.lu/lcsb Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine] is an interdisciplinary center of the [http://wwwen.uni.lu/ University of Luxembourg]. The first centre devoted to spatial issues in systems biomedicine has been recently established&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/biomedical-engineering/spatial-systems-biomedicine/about.cfm Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine -About&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Oregon Health and Science University]].

The first peer-reviewed journal on this topic, [http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/systemsbiomedicine/ Systems Biomedicine], was recently established by [[Landes Bioscience]].

==Manufacturing==
In the Kraft Process, high [[alkalinity]] and [[temperature]] converts the esters and carboxylic acids in [[rosin]] into soluble sodium [[soap]]s of [[lignin]], rosin, and [[fatty acid]]s. The spent cooking liquor is called weak [[black liquor]] and is about 15% dry content. The black liquor is concentrated in a [[Evaporator#Multiple-effect evaporators|multiple effect evaporator]] and after the first stage the black liquor is about 20–30%. At this stage it is called intermediate liquor. Normally the soaps start to [[Flotation process|float]] in the storage tank for the weak or intermediate liquors and are [[Skimmer (machine)|skimmed]] off and collected. A good soap skimming operation reduces the soap content of the black liquor down to 0.2–0.4% w/w of the dry residue. The collected soap is called ''raw rosin soap'' or ''rosinate''. The raw rosin soap is then allowed to [[Settling|settle]] or is [[centrifuge]]d to release as much as possible of the entrained black liquor. The soap goes then to the ''acidulator'' where it is heated and [[acidified]] with [[sulfuric acid]] to produce ''crude tall oil'' (CTO).

The soap skimming and acidulator operation can be improved by addition of [[flocculant]]s. A flocculant will shorten the separation time and give a cleaner soap with lower viscosity. This makes the acidulator run smoother as well.

Most pines give a soap yield of 5–25&amp;nbsp;kg/ton pulp, while [[Scots pine]] gives 20–50&amp;nbsp;kg/ton. Scots pine grown in northern Scandinavia give a yield of even more than 50&amp;nbsp;kg/ton. Globally about 2 mill ton/year of CTO are refined.&lt;ref name="gull"/&gt;

==Composition==
{{see also|Resin acid}}
The composition of crude tall oil varies a great deal, depending on the type of wood used. A common quality measure for tall oil is [[acid number]]. With pure [[pine]]s it is possible to have acid numbers in the range 160–165, while mills using a mix of [[softwood]]s and [[hardwood]]s might give acid numbers in the range of 125–135.&lt;ref name="gull" /&gt;

Normally crude tall oil contains [[rosin]]s (which contains [[resin acid]]s (mainly [[abietic acid]] and its [[isomer]]s), [[fatty acid]]s (mainly [[palmitic acid]], [[oleic acid]] and [[linoleic acid]]) and [[fatty alcohol]]s, [[unsaponifiable]] [[sterol]]s (5–10%), some [[sterol]]s, and other [[alkyl]] [[hydrocarbon]] derivates.&lt;ref name="bier" /&gt;

By [[fractional distillation]] ''tall oil rosin'' is obtained, with rosin content reduced to 10–35%. By further reduction of the rosin content to 1–10%, ''tall oil fatty acid'' (''TOFA'') can be obtained, which is cheap, consists mostly of [[oleic acid]], and is a source of volatile fatty acids.

==Applications==
The tall oil rosin finds use as a component of [[adhesive]]s, [[rubber]]s, and [[ink]]s, and as an [[emulsifier]]. The [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] is used as a [[binder (material)|binder]] in cement, an adhesive, and an [[emulsifier]] for [[asphalt]].

TOFA is a low-cost and [[vegetarian]] lifestyle-friendly alternative to [[tallow]] fatty acids for production of [[soap]]s and [[lubricant]]s. When esterified with [[pentaerythritol]], it is used as a compound of [[adhesive]]s and oil-based [[varnish]]es. When reacted with amines, polyamidoamines are produced which may be used as [[epoxy resin]] curing agents &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hexion.com/en-us/chemistry/epoxy-resins-curing-agents-modifiers/curing-agents/polyamides|title=Hexion Amidoamine epoxy curing agents|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Tall oil is also used in oil drilling as a component of [[drilling fluid]]s.

'''The Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies''' (UAJS) is a non-profit academic and professional non-governmental organization that brings together Ukrainian scholars and students who work in the field of  [[Jewish studies]]. The UAJS was established in 2015. 

The mission of the UAJS is to coordinate efforts of the scholars resident in Ukraine and abroad, aimed at the development of research on history, languages, art and other aspects of Jewish life in Ukraine and worldwide. There are two membership categories, Full membership and Student membership. The UAJS’ Articles of Association allows membership for foreign academicians &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uajs.org.ua/en/node/3|title=Membership - Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies|website=uajs.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Current UAJS President is [[Vitaly Chernoivanenko]], PhD, Associate Professor in the History Department at the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]] (NaUKMA), the Vice President is [[Oleksiy Khamray]], Dr. hab. in Philology, Director of the Near and Middle East Department at the [[Ahatanhel Krymskyi Institute of Oriental Studies of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]. Secretary of the UAJS is [[Serhiy Hirik]], PhD in History, Senior Research Fellow at the [[State Research Institution "Encyclopedia Press"]].

Practical activity of the UAJS includes the organization of the academic conferences, roundtables, workshops, public talks, and mini courses on Jewish Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uajs.org.ua/en/node/5|title=Projects - Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies|website=uajs.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The UAJS publishes an annual academic journal [[Judaica Ukrainica]], established in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaicaukrainica.ukma.edu.ua/content/volumes|title=Volumes - Judaica Ukrainica|website=judaicaukrainica.ukma.edu.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The UAJS also is a publisher of “Library of ''Judaica Ukrainica'' journal”.

The Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies co-administers the MA in Jewish Studies Program at the National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy (founded in 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uajs.org.ua/en/node/8|title=Master in Jewish Studies Program at NaUKMA - Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies|website=uajs.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hromadskeradio.org/programs/zustrichi/shcho-take-yudayika-abo-yak-vidkryti-universytety-poyednuyut-istoriyu-movy-ta-religiyu|title=Що таке юдаїка, або Як «відкриті університети» поєднують історію, мови та релігію?|date=21 January 2018|website=Громадське радіо}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The organization cooperates with a number of academic and educational institutions and non-governmental organizations from Ukraine and abroad: [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]], [[Ukrainian Catholic University]], Institute of Jewish Studies of the [[Jagiellonian University]], [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], [[Université de Montréal]], [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], [[Ukrainian Jewish Encounter]] Initiative, [[Nadav Foundation]], [[:uk:Асоціація єврейських громадських організацій та общин України|Vaad of Ukraine]], [[European Association for Jewish Studies]], [[:he:האיגוד העולמי למדעי היהדות|World Union of Jewish Studies]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uajs.org.ua/en/node/6|title=Partners - Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies|website=uajs.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cooperation with its partner institutions the UAJS acts as a co-organizer of academic events in educational and research institutions of Ukraine.

In 2015–2016 academic year, in partnership with the [[Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy]] (Canada–USA), the UAJS organized at the NaUKMA the series of public lectures and discussions "Contemporary Antisemitism in Ukraine and Worldwide" by well known researchers, public figures and journalist from Ukraine and abroad: [[Yaroslav Hrytsak]], [[Yosyf Zisels]], [[Vakhtang Kipiani]], [[Taras Voznyak]], [[Vitaly Portnikov]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isgap.org/seminar-series/national-university-ukraine/|title=National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy » ISGAP|website=isgap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies and the NaUKMA’s Master Program in Jewish Studies with the support of the [[European Association for Jewish Studies]] organized the International conference “Ukrainian Jews: Revolution and Post-Revolutionary Modernization. Policy, Culture, and Society”, dedicated to the destiny of Ukrainian Jews during 1917–1920s.

Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, (2) 2011. Accessed 12.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Dutch sociologist and Professor of business administration at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], known for his seminal work in the field of [[sociotechnical system]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Arnold, Philip Miedema, Diederik van der Steege (2004) ''Organisaties in verandering''. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caluwé, Léon de, and H.

(2008). ''Enterprise Architecture.'' Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography == 
Born in [[Jönköping]], Sweden, Ulbo de Sitter was named after his father [[Ulbo de Sitter]] (1902–1980), a geologist working at the [[Leiden University]]. He studied sociology at the [[University of Amsterdam]], and obtained his PhD in 1970 at the [[University of Leiden]] with the thesis, entitled "Leiderschapsvorming en leiderschapsgedrag in een organisatie" (Leadership formation and leadership behavior in an organization).

De Sitter had started working as engineer in the [[merchant navy]] for four years before he started his studies in Amsterdam. After graduation in Amsterdam he worked as sociologist at the head office of the Koninklijke PTT Nederland, nowadays [[KPN]]. Sequentially he was research assistant at the Sociografische Werkgemeenschap (Socio Graphic Work Association) of the University of Amsterdam. In 1971 he was appointed professor at [[Eindhoven University of Technology]]. From 1986 to 1988 he was also director of the Koers consulting group in 's-Hertogenbosch. In 1990 he was appointed Professor of Sociotechnical System at the University of Nijmegen, where he retired  March 31, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Frans van Eijnatten (1995) (red.) ''Als het maar stroomt! : Ulbo de Sitter, laveren tussen simpel en complex''. Bundel aangeboden aan Prof.dr. L.U. de Sitter ter gelegenheid van zijn afscheid als hoogleraar in de moderne sociotechniek aan de Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen op 31 maart 1995. Assen : Van Gorcum, 1995. {{ISBN|90-232-3013-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work == 
De Sitter is best known for introducing the sociotechnical system approach in the Netherlands. This approach involves redesign of organization and change management theory, which was initially developed at the British [[Tavistock Institute]] in the late 1950s. De Sitter combined in his work the systems theory fundamentals of the Delft Systems Approach, developed by [[Jan in 't Veld]] and [[Pierre Malotaux]]. With scientists as [[Björn Gustavsen]], [[Fred Emery]], [[Eric Trist]], De Sitter is considered among the foremost social systems scientists in their field.&lt;ref name="FvE 2011"/&gt;

=== Modern socio-technology (MST) ===
Benders et al. (2010) recalled the development of socio-technical systems design since its initiation at the British coal mines in the late 1940s, and the development of Modern Socio-technology (MST) by De Sitter and others:

:''In 1951, Trist and Bamforth published a founding article on STSD while the London-based Tavistock Institute played a key role in further developing socio-technical design into practical applications. During the 1950s and 1960s these notions were picked up in many countries, with Norwegian and Swedish researchers playing key roles. In the Netherlands a strand of socio-technical scholars and practitioners developed a widely accepted research based organizational design methodology (De Sitter, Den Hertog, &amp; Dankbaar, 1997; De Sitter, 1998). This Dutch variant, called Modern Socio-technology (MST), builds on the classic STSD. In the 1970s Ulbo de Sitter played a key role in developing this socio-technical systems theory (with some roots in German sociology). During the 1980s this design theory was enriched with a proper design methodology based on action research...''&lt;ref name = "Ben et al. 2010"&gt;Benders, J. G. J. M., et al. "[http://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/661125/roelschoutetenarticle_1.pdf A modern socio-technical view on ERP-systems]." Social computing: Concepts, methodologies, tools, and applications (2010): 693-704.&lt;/ref&gt;
And furthermore specifically about Modern Socio-technology (MST):

:''Modern Socio-technology (MST) mainly differs from STSD by its integral approach. Whereas classic STSD provides a set of static and partial design principles, MST offers detailed structural principles in terms of design content, while at the same time specifying a theory of change by means of worker participation and training (Van Eijnatten, 1993). To emphasize the integral character of this approach, Van Eijnatten and Van der Zwaan (1998) labeled it Integral Organizational Renewal (IOR)."&lt;ref name = "Ben et al. 2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3611">[[File:Goemnigk field2.JPG|thumb|Woodland edge in [[Brandenburg]]]]
A '''woodland edge''' or '''forest edge''' is the transition zone ([[ecotone]]) from an area of woodland or forest to fields or other open spaces. Certain species of plants and animals are adapted to the forest edge, and these species are often more familiar to humans than species only found deeper within forests. A classic example of a forest edge species is the [[white-tailed deer]] in North America.

== The woodland edge on maps ==
On [[topographic map]]s woods and forests are generally depicted in a soft green colour. Their edges are - like other features - usually determined from [[aerial photograph]]s, but sometimes also by [[land|terrestrial]] [[survey (geography)|survey]]. However, they only represent a snapshot in time because almost all woods have a tendency to spread or to gradually fill [[clearing (wood)|clearing]]s. In addition, working out the exact edge of the wood or forest may be difficult where it transitions into [[scrubland|scrub]] or [[shrub|bush]]es or the trees thin out slowly. Differences of opinion here often involved several tens of metres. In addition, many [[cartographer]]s prefer to show even small islands of trees, while others – depending on the [[scale (map)|scale]] of the map – prefer [[cartographic generalization|more general]], continuous lines to demarcate the forest or woodland edges.

For specialised work, aerial photographs or [[satellite imagery]] are frequently utilised without having to revise the maps. [[Cadastral map]]s cannot show the current situation because for reasons of cost they can only be updated at fairly long intervals and [[cultural boundary|cultural boundaries]] are not legally binding.

== Woodland edges and biology ==
[[File:Waldrandentwicklung.JPG|thumb|Natural woodland edge development through [[succession (biology)|succession]] of an abandoned meadow]]
On the woodland edge – however it is defined – not only does the [[flora]] change, but also the [[fauna]] and the [[soil type]]. These [[edge effects]] mean that many species of animal prefer woodland edges to the heart of the forest, because they have both protection and light - for example [[tree pipit]]s and [[dunnock]]s. At the woodland edge trees are often different from those inside the wood, as well as [[hedge]] vegetation, [[bramble]]s and low-growing plants.
The more gradual the transition from open country to woodland (for example through intermediate young trees or bushes), the less risk there is that, in stormy weather, wind will blow under the canopy and uproot the outer rows of trees. The structure of the woodland edge and its maintenance is viewed as important in [[forest management]] especially during [[reforestation]].

[[Hunter]]s also use the forest edge for the observation and hunting of [[wildlife]], for example, by using [[tree stand]]s or [[hunting blind|hides]].
