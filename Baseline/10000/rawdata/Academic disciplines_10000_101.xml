The presumed '''[[grandmother cell]]''' responds to a seemingly impossible large number of stimuli. If the stimulus is a photo of your grandmother looking straight into the camera, the cell fires. If the stimulus is a painting of your grandmother in profile, the same cell fires. If the stimulus is a sketch of your grandmother walking away, drawn by a street artist, the same cell fires.

This neuron activates when a person identifies a specific entity, such as his or her grandmother. These neurons would activate not only when presented with a family member, but also when presented with celebrities such as [[Halle Berry]]. The term was coined by [[Jerry Lettvin]] around 1969.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12374433 | volume=8 | issue=5 | title=Genealogy of the &amp;quot;grandmother cell&amp;quot; | date=October 2002 | journal=Neuroscientist | pages=512–8 | last1 = Gross | first1 = CG | doi=10.1177/107385802237175}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept had been proposed a few years earlier by Jerzy Konorski who called such cells gnostic units. Since  grandmother cells are highly controversial it was very surprising when Kreiman announced in 2001 that he had discovered one. Since then, several explanations of such findings have been proposed which do not involve grandmother cells. One explanation is based on sparse coding and another on neural nets.

== Biological implausibility ==

A neuron normally fires when excited by one very specific feature of a stimulus.&lt;ref name=z&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Logothetis | first1 = N. K. | last2 = Pauls | first2 = J. | year = 1995 | title = Psychophysical and Physiological Evidence for Viewer-Centered Object Representation in the Primate | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 270–288 | doi=10.1093/cercor/5.3.270}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study performed by Logothetis and Pauls, this is seen with the spiking of a single macaque monkey neuron when presented with a paper clip bent in a certain way at a variety of angles. At a specific angle, the neuron fires rapidly. At different angles or shapes, it does not. A grandmother cell, by contrast, would seem to fire at many different shapes and angles. And it is very difficult to imagine what kind of mechanism "will bind ... information from disparate sensory sources" in a cell, which makes a grandmother cell "a tremendous connectivity puzzle".&lt;ref name=b&gt;Llinás, R. (2002).  I of the Vortex: From Neurons to Self. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

In 2001, Kreiman announced that he had found a grandmother cell.  This "neuron in the human amygdala, for example, fires to a  caricature, a portrait, and a group photo of [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]], but not to 47 other pictures of famous men, presidents, and a variety of objects".&lt;ref name=c&gt;Kreiman, G. (2001). On the Neuronal Activity in the  Human Brain During Visual Recognition, Imagery and Binocular Rivalry, Ph.D. thesis: California Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kreiman | first1 = G. | last2 = Fried | first2 = I. | last3 = Koch | first3 = C. | year = 2002 | title = Single-Neuron Correlates of Subjective Vision in the Human Medial Temporal Lobe | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 99 | issue = 12| pages = 8378–8383 | doi=10.1073/pnas.072194099 | pmid=12034865 | pmc=123075}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Koch affirmed "such cells do exist".&lt;ref name=e /&gt; In 2005, Quiroga and coworkers obtained similar results.&lt;ref name=e&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Quiroga | first1 = R. Q. | last2 = Reddy | first2 = L. | last3 = Kreiman | first3 = G. | last4 = Koch | first4 = C. | last5 = Fried | first5 = I. | year = 2005 | title = Invariant Visual Representation by Single Neurons in the Human Brain | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7045| pages = 1102–1107 | doi=10.1038/nature03687}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2007, Quiroga, Kreiman, Koch and Fried rescinded their initial views, trying to explain their results with sparse coding.&lt;ref name=f&gt;Quiroga, R., Kreiman, G., Koch, C., and Fried, I. (2007). "Sparse but not 'Grandmother cell' coding in the medial temporal lobe." Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative explanations ==

=== Sparse coding ===

[[Neural coding#Sparse coding|Sparse coding]] starts with the activation of moderately small sets of neurons in a small region of the brain. In each region of the brain, related stimuli have a different subset of available neurons to process them together. This reduces the overlap of the representation of two items. Each item is individually represented by a different neuron or a small set of neurons. This helps represent data more efficiently.

In a recent article Quiroga, Kreiman, Koch and Fried admitted they had in fact not found grandmother cells, rather they had found sparse coding.&lt;ref name=f /&gt; The main question was how information was represented in the upper stages of the hierarchy, and still made accessible to perceptual, cognitive and mnemonic processes. This is why sparse coding became an alternative to grandmother cells. The idea of sparse coding is that very small numbers of neurons respond to specific features, objects or concepts in an obvious manner.

Being able to find one cell would be a difficult task. It seems implausible that grandmother cells have any extraordinary binding properties.&lt;ref name=b /&gt; They are the properties of sparse coding instead. It should also be noted that it is difficult to detect sparse firing neurons. Single electrode recordings with moveable probes are used to detect firing, but it is common to miss firing cells.&lt;ref name=f /&gt;

Waydo and Koch conducted a study where a two layered network was exposed to 40 different face images of ten individuals. Each output unit was constrained to fire to the smallest possible number of inputs. Also, the smallest number of units represented each  image. They found that most of the units responded to a single individual. This suggests that a sparse neuronal representation could emerge in the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) while using unsupervised learning.&lt;ref name=g&gt;Waydo, S. and Koch, C (2008). Unsupervised Learning of Individuals and Categories from Images. Neural Comput. 20, 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sparse coding often takes place in the [[hippocampus]]. The [[medial temporal lobe]] is critical for [[long term memory]], particularly episodic memories. Both the hippocampus and the cortex may interact to produce sparse coding. This helps with numerous tasks, including word, object and facial identification.&lt;ref name=h&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowers | first1 = J. S. | year = 2009 | title = On the biological plausibility of grandmother cells. Implications  for neural network theories in psychology and neuroscience | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 116 | issue = 1| pages = 220–251 | doi=10.1037/a0014462 | pmid=19159155}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Sparse representations are also associated with [[Connectionism|parallel distributed processing]] which proves to have great success with rapid learning. It does not have success with generalization, though. Compared to grandmother cells, an individual neuron in sparse coding is involved in coding two things, and two neurons code for a specific stimulus.&lt;ref name=h /&gt;

Overall, visual information goes through the ventral pathway. Evidence that was obtained from recordings of single-neuron activity in humans suggests that a subset of MTL neurons presents an invariant representation of perceived objects. This means that the neurons respond to abstract concepts rather than more basic metric details. This information favors sparse coding over grandmother cells, because the neurons fire only to very few stimuli, and are mostly silent with the exception of their preferred stimuli.&lt;ref name=f /&gt;

=== Neural nets and distributive explanation ===

Grandmother cells can be explained in a much simpler way. As Munevar proposes, grandmother cells are in fact the output cells of neural nets rather than cells acting independently. The existence of grandmother cells clashes with the model of the brain as a distributive system and is improbable because such neurons would have powers of representation across visuals angles and contexts.&lt;ref name=j&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Munevar | first1 = G | year = 2008 | title = A Distributive Explanation of "Grandmother" Cells | url = | journal = Proceedings of the XXII World Congress of Philosophy | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 25–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distributive explanation argues that the grandmother cell is nothing but the single-neuron output stage of a neural network trained to recognize a person. The hypothetical grandmother cell does not have any extraordinary binding properties. They are properties of the neural network instead.

Although Kreiman's and Quiroga's results may seem to challenge the distributive model of the brain, the distributive theory offers a simple explanation of these phenomena.&lt;ref name=c /&gt;&lt;ref name=e /&gt; Such cells serve as the output neurons for neural networks trained to recognize the famous persons in question.

Paul Churchland's accessible account of a network that distinguishes between sonar echoes of explosive underwater mines vs. those of rocks provides us with a better understanding of this idea.&lt;ref name=k&gt;Churchland, P. M. (1996).  The Engine of Reason, the Seat of the Soul.  MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Churchland's work is based on the work of Gorman and Sejnowski.&lt;ref name=l&gt;Gorman, R. P., and Sejnowski, T. J. (1988). "Analysis of Hidden Units in a Layered Network Trained to Classify Sonar Targets."  Neural Networks, Vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The network becomes trained as feedback is delivered to its hidden units. The feedback includes the error of the network in deciding whether every echo in the training set belongs to a mine or a rock.

The important factor here is that the recognition is done not by the output cell ("mine") but by the middle (hidden) layer. When that middle layer recognizes a mine echo, the single-cell output layer "lights up", which is exactly the sort of thing we find in those networks that recognize Clinton, Aniston or Berry.&lt;ref name=k /&gt;

This account extends beyond the discrimination between two alternatives (mines and rocks) to that between different faces. Therefore, the distributive brain may have a single-cell output layer fire whenever a specific person, e.g. your grandmother, is presented to the eye; although many famous people, such as [[Jennifer Aniston]] or Halle Berry, may be of greater interest. Neural networks, then, explain very plausibly the otherwise paradoxical results of the recent grandmother cell experiments.&lt;ref name=k /&gt; Neural nets are a form of parallel distributed processing.

=== Parallel distributed processing ===

In 1950 [[Frank Rosenblatt]] looked into a new approach in neural net technology. He used a circuit consisting of an array of input units. These units are connected through a set of intermediate neurons. In Rosenblatt's trials, he used binary words in both input and output, and he called his invention Perception. Perception was the most basic and revolutionary type of neural net. In 1969, the limitations of Perception were explained by Minsky and Papert.&lt;ref name=m&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harth | first1 = E | year = 1997 | title = From Brains to Neural Nets to Brains | doi = 10.1016/s0893-6080(97)00048-8 | journal = Neural Networks | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 1241–1255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neural nets have been expanded by a variety of neuroscientists and psychologists. Churchland discusses neural nets in the context of facial coding. The example consisted of a bank teller who could not remember the face of a bank robber to provide a description. However, Churchland says the teller would likely recognize and discriminate the robber's face when she sees him again. This example contains not only the idea of neural nets, but also of vector coding.&lt;ref name=k/&gt;

Cottrell, in research at the University of California at San Diego, developed the artificial neural network which had a 64 X 64 pixel grid with 256 activation levels. The network consisted of recognizable representations of real faces.&lt;ref name=y&gt;Cottrell, G., and Metcalfe, J. (1991). "EMPATH: Face, Emotion and Gender Recognition Using Holons," in Lippman, R., Moody, J., and Touretzky, D, eds., Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, Vol. 3. Morgan Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each input cell had a radiating set of axonal end branches to every cell in the middle layer. The middle layer is hidden and projects the coding from 80 cells to the eight output cells. These eight output cells could discriminate faces from non-faces just like grandmother cells are thought to do. Cottrell had no idea how synaptic connections should be configured in the artificial neural network. Cottrell overcame this issue by using a biologically realistic adjustment.

The [[Artificial Neural Network]] (ANN) was initially trained with 64 images, but was eventually pushed outside the training boundary. In a training session the facial recognition was performing at 100%. When the ANN performed facial recognition testing outside of training, the network was still performing at 100%. Even when one-fifth of the face was covered with a black strip the face was still 100% effective as long as the strip did not cover the forehead. The ANN proves another way in which a small number of cells can seem to do a big number of tasks. Previously, grandmother cells supposedly have a unique ability to complete these tasks. The input layer is variously activated by 80 holistic features which vector codes for the second layer. This vector code is an activation which allows the third layer to identify a known individual correctly.&lt;ref name=k/&gt; This is also the case in parallel distributed processing (PDP). PDP highlights the parallels between connectionist models and neural coding in the brain, while also dismissing localism.&lt;ref name=h /&gt;

Churchland explains that neural nets contain three basic levels. The levels are the input layer, hidden layer and output layer. Munevar, following the PDP theory, believes that output cells can explain the presumed grandmother cells. PDP involves the performance of hundreds of millions of individual computation simultaneously, instead of in a lengthy sequence.&lt;ref name=k /&gt; It takes 10 milliseconds for a visual impulse to go across a sign layer to layer transformation, and reaches the 3rd layer where buried information has been made explicit.

In PDP, grandmother cells are a thing to ridicule. Finkel called them infamous grandmother cells, and Connor said no one wants to be accused of believing in grandmother cells.&lt;ref name=h /&gt; 50 years of studies involving PDP and grandmother cells have not really found any grandmother cells, but rather that the brain codes information with a form of distributed coding. Localist models ignore the neuroscience data taken to support distributed coding schemes, specifically single cell electrophysiological recording studies. Localist models are instead often supported by neuropsychological data. Biologically, the PDP model is superior and can be supported using the many different methods and studies. This includes studies of PDP in the brain, as discussed by Bowers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9972">'''Auditory arrhythmia''' is the inability to rhythmically perform music, to [[Meter (music)|keep time]], and to replicate musical or rhythmic patterns. It has been caused by damage to the [[cerebrum]] or rewiring of the brain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Modelling rhythmic function in a musician post-stroke|last = Wilson|first = Sarah J|date = 2002|journal = Neuropsychologia|doi = 10.1016/S0028-3932(01)00198-1|pmid = 11931954|last2 = Pressing|first2 = Jeffrey L|last3 = Wales|first3 = Roger J|volume=40|pages=1494–505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
An individual with this condition has an especially difficult time maintaining a steady beat, and even has difficulty following along to a steady rhythm. Before it was a known disorder, it was thought that these individuals were just severely uncoordinated, and therefore were unable to follow along with the music. It has been discovered recently that problems with rhythm in [[Schizophrenia]], [[Parkinson's]], and [[Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder]] are also found to have a correlation to rhythm deficiencies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Arrhythmic Song Exposure Increases ZENK Expression in Auditory Cortical Areas and Nucleus Taeniae of the Adult Zebra Finch|date = September 26, 2014|journal = US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0108841|pmid = 25259620|editor-last = Cooper|editor-first = Brenton G.|pmc=4178233|volume=9|pages=e108841 | last1 = Lampen | first1 = J | last2 = Jones | first2 = K | last3 = McAuley | first3 = JD | last4 = Chang | first4 = SE | last5 = Wade | first5 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurological bases of music ==
The [[cerebellum]] houses the center for fine motor skills. These are needed in order to play the instrument.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[temporal lobe]] and the [[frontal lobe]] are necessary for listening and recalling different musical aspects from lyrics, reading the music, and performing.

Memory centers are primarily located in the [[hippocampus]], and the process of listening to music originates there.

[[Neuroplasticity]] allows the brain to grow and change, especially in the [[Auditory cortex|auditory]] and [[motor cortex]]. Listening and playing music helps both of these areas of the brain to develop more, which was found to be correlated to having an improves auditory imagery in many performers in a study conducted at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://brainworldmagazine.com/music-rhythm-and-the-brain-2/|title = Music, Rhythm and the Brain|date = March 7, 2011|accessdate = February 18, 2015|website = Brain World|publisher = Brain World|last = Jun, M.D.|first = Passion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar diagnoses ==
Auditory arrhythmia can also be confused with something called [[beat deafness]]. Beat deafness is a form of congenital [[amusia]], which is a person's inability to move in time to the music, or feel a musical rhythm. It is believed by researchers that beat deafness stems from a connection problem between the brain's auditory cortex and inferior frontal lobe. A postdoctoral researcher with the International Laboratory for Brain, Music, and Sound Research at the University of Montreal studied a case where a man could not feel a rhythm in any sense. Not only did he have difficulty dancing, but he was unable to tap his foot or snap his fingers along with the beat of the music.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The major difference between beat deafness and auditory arrhythmia, however, is that beat deafness is most likely something you are born with, whereas the arrhythmia most likely comes from damage, which was the case in the research done on "Mathieu," the first known case of beat-deafness.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bodyodd.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/03/15/6247114-cant-feel-the-rhythm-you-may-be-beat-deaf?lite|title = Can't feel the rhythm? You may be 'beat-deaf'|date = Mar 15, 2011|accessdate = February 19, 2015|website = The Body Odd|publisher = NBC News|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another case, a former musician known as H.J. suffered damage from a [[Temporoparietal junction|temporoparietal infarct]], which is an area of dead tissue due to lack of adequate blood supply. The infarct was believed to have been caused by a problem during a coronary angiography, which is a test to show the insides of an individual's coronary arteries. H.J. suffered difficulties with creating a steady beat, an inability to distinguish between different sets of rhythms, and also experienced difficulties when playing his instruments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Rhythmic problems in animals other than humans ==
Research was conducted on birds such as the Zebra Finch because this species has parallels to humans' vocal learning patterns and neurological structures. Adult zebra finches were placed in similar conditions, all exposed to nine rhythmic and nine arrhythmic songs for 30 second increments. After the stimulus was presented, the brains were studied for areas of high ZENK concentration, ZENK being an [[immunohistochemical]] used to detect neural activation. It was found in the finches that those exposed to the arrhythmic music had much higher levels of the ZENK gene, and it has been discovered that there is a correlation with humans having higher brain activity in these locations with arrhythmic functioning. Gaining an understanding of how to change the deficiencies in these animals can help lead to changes in the future for humans with auditory arrhythmia and other serious psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Auditory processing in those with autism ==
Those diagnosed with [[autism]] tend to have many difficulties processing auditory stimuli. For example, they most often endure language and speech delays, [[hyperacusis]], have difficulties communicating in large social groups, and may experience difficulties hearing certain voices in a noisy environment. These qualities make quality of life difficult, by inhibiting their ability to fully participate in social and educational circumstances in various parts of their lives. As shown in research published in the International Journal of Psychophysiology, [[efferent pathways]] throughout the brain help to control various functions throughout the body. For example, in those with autism, pathways running through to the [[middle ear]] muscles make it difficult for the person to focus on a single voice when there is a lot of background noise. Raising eyelids was also found to hinder the [[stapedius]] muscle by tensing it, which in turn makes it difficult for these individuals to hear other talking when there is background noise present. The laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles located in the throat make [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] difficult to understand for people with autism. During research, tasks and tests were conducted to see if there is a correlation between [[cardiac rhythm]]s, [[respiratory sinus arrhythmias]], and [[auditory processing]], or auditory arrhythmia. Because these symptoms tend to go hand in hand, researchers were looking to see if there was a possibility of improving auditory processing.

The term "autonomous" as applied to stained glass refers to works which are designed independent of architecture. Autonomous works are not designed to glaze windows. The term "stained glass" commonly precedes "window" and is thus linked to architecture both linguistically and conceptually. The autonomous work is more like a painting than a stained glass window, and is a non-traditional use of the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sowers|first=Robert|title=Stained Glass: An Architectural Art|year=1965|publisher=Universe Books, Inc.|location=New York|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; One critic somewhat pejoratively calls non-architectural stained glass "uncommissioned panels."&lt;ref name=Sowers&gt;{{cite book|last=Sowers|first=Robert|title=The Language of Stained Glass|year=1981|publisher=Timber Press|location=Forest Grove, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another traditionalist claims: "Stained glass can never be really satisfactory when considered as a bibelot to be hung up in the window or when sold in galleries like paintings for room decoration."&lt;ref&gt;John Baker in Trevor Dannatt, ed., ''Architects’ Yearbook 6'', Elek Books, Ltd., London, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Renaissance ([[Uccello]], [[Ghiberti]], [[Ghirlandaio]]), through the 18th and 19th centuries ([[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], [[Delacroix]]), into the 20th century ([[Rouault]], [[Chagall]]), artists have made windows in the style of their paintings. These windows look like paintings but they are ''windows'' that respond, to a greater or lesser degree, to the form, purpose, and mood of a building. Over time there have been scattered examples of works painted on small sheets of glass, sometimes assembled with lead, which were not designed to fill window openings.&lt;ref name=Sowers /&gt; In Germany during the second half of the 20th century, studios began fabricating small panels for display in galleries and museums that were either similar in style to, or details of larger windows. Such panels are generally extensions of an architecturally accommodative aesthetic quite different from the "personal and introspective" approach of much contemporary painting and autonomous stained glass.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kehlmann, "Glass as a Free Art Form," Neues Glas, January, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Theo van Doesburg]], [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Josef Albers]] and a handful of other early 20th-century artists did on occasion make autonomous stained glass works. Not until the early 1970s in the United States, however, did a group of stained glass artists devote themselves, in some instances exclusively, to such work.&lt;ref name=Sowers /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;6.	Casey Lewis, "Robert Kehlmann: Richmond Art Center, Richmond California," ''Glass Art'', Vol.4, No. 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Like painters, they used the medium in expressive, personal ways, designing and executing their own work rather than having them made by outside studios as is common with architectural stained glass windows. The first generation of American artists working autonomously with stained glass was documented in the landmark 1978 exhibition "New Stained Glass" at New York’s [[Museum of Contemporary Crafts]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Stained Glass," Museum of Contemporary Crafts, New York, 1978 (catalog)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently others, worldwide, have devoted themselves to making autonomous stained glass.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kehlmann, "Stained Glass as a Non-Architectural Art," ''Glass Art Magazine'', December, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the book ''Twentieth Century Stained Glass: A New Definition'', art critic [[Robert Kehlmann]] points out that making a stained glass panel and designing a window are two different disciplines. Autonomous glass artists generally fabricate their own work, very often experimenting with materials, technique, and the uses of light. They freely "address a wide range of ideas and feelings without concern for the form and mood of a building." The size, shape and imagery of an autonomous stained glass work is "dictated solely by the nature of materials and personal aesthetics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kehlmann|first=Robert|title=Twentieth Century Stained Glass: A New Definition|year=1992|publisher=Kyoto Shoin Ltd.|location=Japan|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Rail Research Division''' came into being in 1964 directly under the control of the [[British Railways Board]], moving into purpose-built premises at the [[Railway Technical Centre]] in [[Derby]]. The intention was to improve railway reliability and efficiency, while reducing costs and improving revenue. In so doing it became recognised as a centre of excellence and, in time, was providing consultancy to other railways around the world. While it became famous for the [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT), its activities extended into every area of railway operation. The theoretical rigor of its approach to railway engineering superseded the ad hoc methods that had prevailed previously.
[[File:Apt-front.jpg|right|thumb|200px|APT-E at [[Shildon Locomotion Museum|''Locomotion'']], [[Shildon]], [[County Durham]] ]]

==Work==
The Research Division brought together personnel and expertise from all over the country, including the [[LMS Scientific Research Laboratory]]. Their remit was not simply the improvement of existing equipment, or the solution of existing problems, but fundamental research from first principles, into railway operation. The results of its work would go on to inform development by engineers, manufacturers and railways all over the world. For instance, once the initial APT-E experimental project was complete, it passed to the mechanical engineering department to build the APT-P prototype. In time, engineers would be seconded to other countries for varying periods under the trade name "Transmark".

One of the first major projects was the development of profiled/pre-worn wheels which helped counter the tendency of new wheels to [[Hunting oscillation|hunt]]. This led to research into vehicle suspensions, and the creation of the four-wheel [[High Speed Freight Vehicle]] (HSFV1) which proved stable at up to 140mph when tested on the roller rig.

Other work involved looking at the tamping of ballast, properties of subsoils, and rail prestressing. A large part of the network had been converted to continuous welded rail which, during a hot summer, caused many problems with rail buckling. Although there were no injuries, there were a number of derailments. Attention focused on the costs and benefits of tamping the ballast over the sleeper ends.

There were extended studies into [[fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]], and pioneering work in ultrasound crack detection at a time when it was being investigated elsewhere for medical diagnostics. The Research Division was involved in new [[Railway signalling|signalling]] systems, such as [[Solid State Interlocking]] (SSI) and the [[Integrated Electronic Control Centre]] (IECC), and in the design of the overhead lines for the [[West Coast Main Line]].
[[File:LEV1 at Weybourne Station.jpg|thumb|right|The prototype railbus LEV1]]

The Research Division developed two test tracks. The first was on the old [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|GNR]] line between Egginton Junction and Derby Friargate (later used only as far as Mickleover) and was used by the Train Control Group. When the Advanced Passenger Train was being developed, a second test track was created on the line between Melton Junction and Edwalton (known as the [[Old Dalby Test Track]]), which was acquired specifically to test this revolutionary train. The Mickleover test track was closed and lifted in the early 1990s but Old Dalby is still in use today and has a bright future.

==End of the line==
In 1986 finance for the division was moved from the board to the operating divisions. Thus emphasis shifted from pure research to problem solving. In 1989, BR Research became a self-contained unit working under contract to British Rail and other customers, and the way was open for privatisation.
   
When British Rail was sold into private ownership, the Research Division (which had become "BR Research Limited") was bought by [[AEA Technology|AEA Technology plc]] in 1996. The resulting business, "AEA Technology Rail", was subsequently sold in 2006 to a venture capital company and became [[DeltaRail Group|DeltaRail Group Limited]]. Transmark, the consultancy arm, was sold to [[Halcrow Group|Halcrow]] to become Halcrow Transmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Network Rail launches international arm|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/2012/07/09-network-rail-launches-international-arm.html|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=Railnews|date=9 July 2012|quote=Transmark, which was the consultancy arm of the BR Research Division, was sold to Halcrow when the railways were privatised in the 1990s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A somewhat dated display of material relating to the work of the Division was maintained in the [[Derby Industrial Museum]].

==Legacy==
The Research Division had an uneasy relationship with other parts of BR, and like most of the products of [[Harold Wilson]]'s "[[white heat of technology]]" speech, were killed off in the early 1980s. The basis of the unease was the traditional approach of most of BR compared with theoretical and aerospace approaches adopted by the Research Division. The hiring of graduates rather than training people up internally also caused tensions.

It could be somewhat tactless, or perhaps naive, at times. The APT-E was provided with a single driver position central in the cab, at a time when the unions were resisting the loss of the "second man" (the fireman in steam days). After its first run out to [[Duffield, Derbyshire|Duffield]] the APT-E was "blacked" by the unions for a year. 

Nevertheless, its empirical research into vehicle dynamics has produced today's high speed trains, both freight and passenger, including the [[High Speed Train]], [[British Rail Class 91|Class 91]] and worldwide. The concept of a tilting system for the APT became part of the  [[Pendolino]]{{fact|date=December 2017}}, while the products of its signalling and operations control research are used over a significant amount of the British railway system.

King-Okumu studies methods for the sustainable integrated management of water and land in dryland ecosystems, and economic and environmental assessment techniques for calculating the costs of groundwater degradation. She encourages initiatives for decision-making in the context of longer-term considerations of increasing variability and climate change.  She works to develop in-country partnerships engaging government, research institutions, civic groups and the private sector, to support sustainable practices and community-based adaptation and to increase climate change resilience.&lt;ref name="IIED"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caroline King-Okumu|url=http://www.iied.org/users/caroline-king-okumu|website=International Institute for Environment and Development|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanner"/&gt;

The '''Center for Research in Security Prices''' ('''CRSP''') is a provider of [[historical]] [[stock market]] data. The Center is a part of the [[Booth School of Business]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. CRSP maintains some of the largest and most comprehensive [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] historical [[database]]s in stock market research. Academic researchers and investment professionals rely on CRSP for accurate, [[survivor bias]]-free information which provides a foundation for their research and analyses. As of 2006, CRSP claims almost 500 clients. The name is usually pronounced "crisp".

CRSP was founded in 1960 by [[James H. Lorie]] (professor of finance and director of research) and [[Lawrence Fisher]] (assistant professor of finance) of the University of Chicago, with a grant from [[Merrill Lynch|Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith]]. Its goal was to provide a source of accurate and comprehensive data that could be used to answer basic questions about the behavior of stock markets. The first effort of the Center was the production of a database consisting of monthly stock prices on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] for all [[common stock]]s from 1926 to 1962. [[Dividend]]s, [[shares outstanding]], capital changes, and delisting information was also included. Taken together, this data made possible the first comprehensive study of the rates of return on common stocks.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher &amp; Lorie, "Rates of Return on Investments in Common Stocks"&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the database has been kept up to date to the present day, daily data has been expanded back to 1926, and other exchanges and financial instruments have been added.
 
CRSP's flagship databases include:
* Common stocks on the [[NYSE]] from 1926, [[American Stock Exchange|AMEX]] from 1962, and [[NASDAQ]] from 1972
* CRSP Indices
* NASDAQ and [[S&amp;P 500]] Composite Indices
* NASDAQ and AMEX Industry Indices
* US [[Treasury bonds]]
* Survivor bias-free [[mutual funds]]
* [[Market capitalization]] reports;
* Proxy graphs for [[Form 10-K|10-K]] [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] filings
* Other custom datasets
In partnership with [[Compustat]], CRSP provides the CRSP/Compustat Merged Database, and in partnership with the Ziman School of Real Estate at UCLA's Anderson School of Business, the CRSP/Ziman [[REIT]] Data Series.

'''Certificate in Management Studies''' (CMS) also referred as Certificate in Management, Graduate Certificate in Management, Masters Entry Certificate in Management, is a UK undergraduate qualification normally comprising 3-4 modules of study in the area of [[Management]]. It forms the first half of [[Diploma]] in [[Management Studies]] (DMS).

==Pathway==
The CMS &amp; DMS form the pathway for many students going onto complete MBA's. Most of the institutions offering the CMS/DMS offer the [[MBA]] as the final stage or the credit for achieving the DMS can be transferred to another institution. The exams and coursework undertaken at this level serves as a foundation for similar assessment at the MBA level where there is a strong focus on research and written reports.

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*[[Oedipus|Oedipus's]] downfall is directly linked to arrogance: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''
*Macbeth suffers from [[hubris]], leading to the murder of [[Duncan I of Scotland]]; he later becomes [[paranoia|paranoid]], leading him to order the deaths of [[Banquo]] and the family of [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]: ''[[Macbeth]]''
*[[Hamlet]] is indecisive and self-doubting, which thwarts him in avenging his father's murder.
*[[Victor Frankenstein]] suffers from excessive curiosity and irresponsibility, leading to the creation of the [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] that destroys his life: ''[[Frankenstein]]''
*[[Sigurd]] has a vulnerable spot on his back, where a linden leaf fell as he was bathing in dragon's blood: ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' 
*[[Agamemnon]] acts in greed when he takes [[Briseis]] away from [[Achilles]], losing the warrior's support in the [[Trojan War]]: ''[[The Iliad]]''. Achilles's own flaw was his own arrogance.
*[[Odysseus|Odysseus's]] flaw was an extreme [[Hubris (Ancient Greece)|hubris]] which led him to dishonor the god [[Poseidon]]. (''[[The Odyssey]]'')
*[[Cyrano De Bergerac]], despite his many accomplishments, suffers from self-doubt because of his huge nose which keeps him from pursuing the woman he loves.
*[[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] suffers from extreme depression, as well as extreme boredom due to his huge yet mostly inactive mind: ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*[[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] extreme [[thanatophobia]] eventually transformed him into the vile Lord Voldemort in his pursuit for [[immortality]]. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Harry Potter]]'s worst flaws, as stated by Rowling, are "anger and occasional arrogance." However, within the text, it is implied his flaw might be his heroic desire to save people. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.
*In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the detective played by [[James Stewart]] is afraid of heights and has to climb a tower.
*[[Captain Hook]] is obsessed with ''[[Peter Pan]]''
*[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], as a replicant, is powerful, but has a very short lifespan: ''[[Blade Runner]]''
*[[Oskar Schindler]] in the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' must overcome his greedy nature and find compassion to sacrifice in order to save his workers

===Television===
*[[B. A. Baracus]] is afraid of flying: ''[[The A-Team]]''
*[[Homer Simpson]] is an alcoholic, not too bright and prone to reckless choices: ''[[The Simpsons]]''
*[[Philip J. Fry]] (usually) has a severe lack of intelligence: ''[[Futurama]]''
*[[Londo Mollari]] yearns to return to the "glory days" of the [[Centauri Republic]]: ''[[Babylon 5]]''
*[[Mr. Spock]] relies heavily on logic and suppresses his more human emotions: ''[[Star Trek]]''
*[[Drake Mallard|Darkwing Duck/Drake Mallard]] has a big ego. ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''
*[[Peter Griffin]] is extremely impulsive and causes many problems for his family and friends: ''[[Family Guy]]''
*[[Zuko]] makes misguided decisions in an effort to gain his cruel father's acceptance: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Aang]] is too carefree and initially attempts to run from his responsibilities rather than face them: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Dean Winchester]] relies on family and is devastated when he loses them or they betray his trust: ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''
*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult. Her overcoming this flaw is a major story arc on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')

===Gaming===
* In [[Warhammer 40,000]], the Primarch Lorgar Aurelian is extremely devout and reveres his "father", the Emperor of Mankind, as a god. The Emperor envisages a human civilization free of the shackles of religion and dogma and chastises Lorgar and his legion for worshipping him. Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

In [[linguistics]], a '''collective noun''' refers to a collection of things taken as a whole. Most collective nouns in everyday speech are mundane and ''not'' specific to just one kind, such as the word "group", which is applied to "people" in the phrase "a group of people", but is also applied to "dogs" in the phrase "a group of dogs". Other collective nouns ''are specific'' to one kind, especially [[#Terms of venery|terms of venery]], which identify specific groups of animals. For example, "pride" as a term of [[game (hunting)|venery]] always refers to [[lion]]s, never to [[dog]]s or [[cow]]s. Similarly, a group of owls is called a "parliament".{{citation needed| date= November 2018|reason= Not the word used in the main article linked to in the 'Terms of venery' section below}}

Different forms of English handle verb [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with collective [[count noun]]s differently; in particular, users of [[British English]] generally accept that collective nouns take either singular or plural verb forms depending on context and the [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift that it implies.

== Derivation ==
[[Morphological derivation]] accounts for many collective words and various languages have common [[affix]]es for denoting collective nouns. Because derivation is a slower and less productive [[word formation]] process than the more overtly [[syntax|syntactical]] morphological methods, there are fewer collectives formed this way. As with all derived words, derivational collectives often differ [[Semantics|semantically]] from the original words, acquiring new [[connotation]]s and even new [[denotation]]s.

== Affixes ==

=== Proto-Indo-European===
Early Proto-Indo-European used the suffix *eh2 to form collective nouns. From there we have, for example, the Latin neuter plural ending -a. Late Proto-Indo-European used the ending *t. From there we have the English ending -th, as in "youth".

=== English ===
The English endings ''-age'' and ''-ade'' often signify a collective. Sometimes, the relationship is easily recognizable: ''baggage, drainage, blockade.'' Though the [[etymology]] is plain to see, the derived words take on a distinct meaning. This is a [[Productive (linguistics)|productive]] ending, as evidenced in the recent [[Coined word|coin]], "[[signage]]".

=== German ===
[[German language|German]] uses the [[prefix]] ''[[wikt:ge-#German|ge]]-'' to create collectives. The root word often undergoes [[I-mutation|umlaut]] and [[suffix]]ation as well as receiving the ''ge-'' prefix. Nearly all nouns created in that way are of [[neuter gender]]:
* ''{{lang|de|das Gebirge}}'', "group of hills, mountain range" {{abbr|&lt;|from}} ''{{lang|de|der Berg}}'', "mountain" or "hill"
* ''{{lang|de|das Gepäck}}'', "luggage, baggage" &lt; ''{{lang|de|der Pack}}'', "pack, bundle, pile"
* ''{{lang|de|das Geflügel}}'', "poultry, fowl (birds)" &lt; late [[Middle High German|MHG]] ''{{lang|gmh|gevlügel(e)}}'', under the influence of ''{{lang|de|der Flügel}}'', "wing" &lt; MHG ''{{lang|gmh|gevügel}}'' &lt; [[Old High German|OHG]] ''{{lang|goh|gifugili}}'' = collective formation of ''{{lang|goh|fogal}}'', "bird"
* ''{{lang|de|das Gefieder}}'', "plumage" &lt; ''{{lang|de|die Feder}}'', "feather"
* ''{{lang|de|das Geschwisterkind}}'', "sibling" &lt; ''{{lang|de|die Schwester}}'', "sister"
* ''{{lang|de|die Geschwister}}'', "siblings" &lt; ''{{lang|de|die Schwester}}'', "sister"
* "Der Gebirgszug" and "die Bergkette" also mean "mountain range", drawing on the words "der Zug" = train, and "die Kette" = chain.
There are also several endings that can be used to create collectives, such as "welt" and "masse".

=== Dutch ===
[[Dutch language|Dutch]] has a similar pattern but sometimes uses the (unproductive) [[circumfix]] ''{{linktext|ge- -te}}'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Morphology of Dutch|last=Booij|first=Geert|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{lang|nl|berg}}'' 'mountain' &gt; ''{{lang|nl|gebergte}}'' 'mountain range'
* ''{{lang|nl|been}}'' 'bone' &gt; ''{{lang|nl|gebeente}}'' 'skeleton'
* ''{{lang|nl|vogel}}'' 'bird' &gt; ''{{lang|nl|gevogelte}}'' 'poultry'
* ''{{lang|nl|blad}}'' 'leaf' &gt; ''{{lang|nl|gebladerte}}'' 'foliage'

=== Swedish ===
The following [[Swedish language|Swedish]] example has different words in the collective form and in the individual form:
* An individual mosquito is a ''{{lang|sv|[[wikt:mygga|mygga]]}}'' (plural: ''{{lang|sv|[[wikt:myggor|myggor]]}}''), but mosquitos as a collective is ''{{lang|sv|[[wikt:mygg|mygg]]}}''.

=== Esperanto ===
[[Esperanto]] uses the collective suffix -''[[wikt:-ar#Esperanto|ar]]'' to produce a large number of derived words:
* ''monto'' 'mountain' &gt; ''montaro'' 'mountain range'
* ''birdo'' 'bird' &gt; ''birdaro'' 'flock'
* ''arbo'' 'tree' &gt; ''arbaro'' 'forest'
* ''ŝipo'' 'ship' &gt; ''ŝiparo'' 'fleet'
* ''manĝilo'' 'eating utensil' &gt; ''manĝilaro'' 'silverware', 'cutlery'

== Metonymic merging of grammatical number ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}{{Main|Synesis|Plurale tantum}}Two good examples of collective nouns are "team" and "government", which are both words referring to groups of (usually) people. Both "team" and "government" are [[count noun]]s (consider: "one team", "two teams", "most teams"; "one government", "two governments", "many governments").

=== Agreement in different forms of English ===
{{Main|American and British English grammatical differences#Subject-verb_agreement}}

Confusion often stems from the way that different forms of English handle [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with collective nouns—specifically, whether or not to use the '''collective singular''': the singular verb form with a collective noun. The [[plural verb]] forms are often used in [[British English]] with the singular forms of these [[count noun]]s (e.g., "The team ''have'' finished the project."). Conversely, in the English language as a whole, singular verb forms can often be used with nouns ending in "-s" that were once considered plural (e.g., "Physics ''is'' my favorite academic subject"). This apparent "number mismatch" is a natural and logical feature of human language, and its mechanism is a subtle [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift in the concepts underlying the words.

In British English, it is generally accepted that collective nouns can take either singular or plural verb forms depending on the context and the [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift that it implies. For example, "the team ''is'' in the dressing room" (''[[formal agreement]]'') refers to ''the team'' as an ensemble, while "the team ''are'' fighting among themselves" (''[[notional agreement]]'') refers to ''the team'' as individuals. That is also the British English practice with names of countries and cities in sports contexts (e.g., "[[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] ''have'' won the competition.").

In [[American English]], collective nouns almost always take singular verb forms (formal agreement). In cases that a metonymic shift would be revealed nearby, the whole sentence should be recast to avoid the metonymy. (For example, "The team are fighting among themselves" may become "the team ''members'' are fighting among themselves" or simply "The team is infighting.") Collective [[proper noun]]s are usually taken as singular ("[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] is expected to release a new phone this year"), unless the plural is explicit in the proper noun itself, in which case it is taken as plural ("The [[Green Bay Packers]] are scheduled to play the [[Minnesota Vikings]] this weekend").
More explicit examples of collective proper nouns include "[[General Motors]] is once again the world's largest producer of vehicles," and "[[Texas Instruments]] is a large producer of [[electronics]] here," and "[[British Airways]] is an airline company in Europe." Furthermore, "[[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]]" is a [[telecommunications]] company in North America." Such phrases might look plural, but they are not.

=== Examples of metonymic shift ===
A good example of such a metonymic shift in the singular-to-plural direction (which, generally, occurs only in British English) is the following sentence: "The team have finished the project." In that sentence, the underlying thought is of the individual members of the team working together to finish the project. Their accomplishment is collective, and the emphasis is not on their individual identities, but they are still discrete individuals; the word choice "team have" manages to convey both their collective and discrete identities simultaneously. A good example of such a metonymic shift in the plural-to-singular direction is the following sentence: "Mathematics is my favorite academic subject." The word "mathematics" may have originally been plural in concept, referring to mathematic endeavors, but metonymic shift (the shift in concept from "the endeavors" to "the whole set of endeavors") produced the usage of "mathematics" as a singular entity taking singular verb forms. (A true [[mass noun|mass-noun]] sense of "mathematics" followed naturally.)

Nominally singular pronouns can be collective nouns taking plural verbs, according to the same rules that apply to other collective nouns. For example, it is correct usage in both British English and American English usage to say: "None are so fallible as those who are sure they're right." In that case, the plural verb is used because the context for "none" suggests more than one thing or person.&lt;ref&gt;Strunk &amp; White, The Elements of Style (4th ed., 2000), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include:
*"[[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] ''was'' founded in [[El Cerrito, California]]".
*"[[Nintendo]] ''is'' a [[video game]] company headquartered in Japan".

This does not, however, affect the tense later in the sentence:
*"Cream ''is'' a [[psychedelic rock]] band who ''were'' primarily popular in the 1960s.

Exceptions to the rule{{which|date=March 2013}} include singular group names preceded by an article:
* "The Who ''are'' a rock band from Great Britain."

This exception does not apply to artists whose name is preceded by an article, but ends in a singular:
* "The Band ''is'' a band primarily performing roots rock."

Abbreviations provide other "exceptions" in American usage concerning plurals:
* "Runs Batted In" becomes "RBIs". "Smith had 10 RBIs in the last three games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan|title=Garner's Modern American Usage|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford; New York|isbn=978-0-19-538275-4|page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Revised Statutes Annotated" or RSAs.  "The RSAs contain our laws."

When only the name is plural but not the object, place, or person:
* "[[Decompression sickness|The bends]] ''is'' a deadly disease mostly affecting SCUBA divers."
* "''[[Hot Rocks]]'' ''is'' a greatest hits compilation by [[The Rolling Stones]]"

== Terms of venery ==
{{further|List of English terms of venery, by animal}}
The tradition of using "terms of [[game (hunting)|venery]]" or "nouns of assembly", collective nouns that are specific to certain kinds of animals, stems from an [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[medieval hunting|hunting tradition]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The fashion of a consciously developed hunting language came to England from [[medieval France|France]]. It was marked by an extensive proliferation of specialist vocabulary, applying different names to the same feature in different animals. The elements can be shown to have already been part of French and English hunting terminology by the beginning of the 14th century. In the course of the 14th century, it became a courtly fashion to extend the vocabulary, and by the 15th century, the tendency had reached exaggerated proportions.

''[[The Treatise (Walter of Bibbesworth)|The Treatise]]'', written by [[Walter of Bibbesworth]] in the mid-1200s, is the earliest source for collective nouns of animals in any European vernacular (and also the earliest source for animal noises).&lt;ref&gt;William Sayers, "Animal vocalization and human polyglossia in Walter of Bibbesworth's 13th-century domestic treatise in Anglo-Norman French" in Sign System Studies (Tartu, 2009) pp. 173–187&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Venerie'' of Twiti (early 14th century) distinguished three types of [[droppings]] of animals, and three different terms for [[herd]]s of animals. [[Gaston Phoebus]] (14th century) had five terms for droppings of animals, which were extended to seven in the ''Master of the Game'' (early 15th century). The focus on collective terms for groups of animals emerged in the later 15th century. Thus, a list of collective nouns in Egerton MS 1995, dated to c. 1452 under the heading of "termis of venery &amp;c.''"'', extends to 70 items,&lt;ref&gt;David Dalby, ''Lexicon of the Mediaeval German Hunt: A Lexicon of Middle High German Terms (1050–1500), Associated with the Chase, Hunting with Bows, Falconry, Trapping and Fowling'', Walter de Gruyter, 1965, {{ISBN|978-3-11-081860-4}}, p. xli.&lt;/ref&gt; and the list in the ''[[Book of Saint Albans]]'' (1486) runs to 165 items, many of which, even though introduced by "the compaynys of beestys and fowlys", relate not to venery but to human groups and professions and are clearly humorous, such as "a Doctryne of doctoris"'', "''a Sentence of Juges"'', "''a Fightyng of beggers"'', "''an uncredibilite of Cocoldis"'', "''a Melody of harpers"'', "''a Gagle of women"'', "''a Disworship of Scottis", etc.&lt;ref&gt;1901 facsimile reprint, E. Stock, London ([https://archive.org/stream/bokeofsaintalban00bernuoft#page/114/mode/2up pp. 115-117).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transactions of the Philological Society
Volume 26, Issue 3, pages 79–175, August 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Book of Saint Albans'' became very popular during the 16th century and was reprinted frequently. [[Gervase Markham]] edited and commented on the list in his ''The Gentleman's Academic'', in 1595. The book's popularity had the effect of perpetuating many of these terms as part of the [[Standard English]] lexicon even if they have long ceased to have any practical application.&lt;ref name="Todd&amp;Hancock"&gt;{{cite book | last = Todd | first = Loreto |author2=Hancock, Ian | year = 1986 | title = International English Usage | publisher = Psychology Press | pages = 133–134 | isbn = 0-415-05102-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iccd5KAUnYQC&amp;pg=PA133 | accessdate = 2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in their original context of medieval venery, the terms were of the nature of [[kenning]]s, intended as a mark of erudition of the gentlemen able to use them correctly rather than for practical communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Exaltation of Larks|last=Lipton|first=James|publisher=Penguin|year=1993|isbn=978-0140170962|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the terms in the modern period has resulted in the addition of numerous lighthearted, humorous or facetious&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Literacy Dictionary|last=Harris|first=Theodore L.|author2=Hodges, Richard E.|publisher=International Reading Association|year=1995|isbn=0-87207-138-3|page=271}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-04--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; collective nouns.

The '''Corps Altsachsen''' is a fraternity (''[[Studentenverbindung]]'') in [[Dresden]], Germany. It was  founded on October 31, 1861 and is one of 162 ''[[German Student Corps]]'' in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Latvia and Hungary today. The Corps is a member of the [[Weinheimer Senioren-Convent]] (WSC), the second oldest federation of classical [[Corporation (university)|Fraternities]] in Europe with roots dating back to the 15th century.&lt;ref name="DieCorps"&gt;Die Corps. "Was sind die Corps? - Who are the Corps?" http://www.die-corps.de/interessenten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klimczuk"&gt;Klimczuk, Stephen &amp; [[Gerald Warner|Warner, Gerald]]. "[[Secret Places, Hidden Sanctuaries|Secret Places, Hidden Sanctuaries: Uncovering Mysterious Sites, Symbols, and Societies]]".

Four presidents ("[[Rector (academia)|Rektor]]") of [[Dresden University of Technology]], Dresden's largest university with approximately 30.000 students, are among the list of members of the fraternity, underlining the deep connection between the Corps and the local alma mater.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt; The connections with the university and the city of Dresden go far back to the fraternity's early beginnings in the late 19th century, with members aspiring to drive developments for the university over the course of history. Two major accomplishments were (1) ensuring the university's recognition by developing the former Technical Institute into the Royal Saxon Technical College of Dresden in the late 1800s and (2) founding of today's [[Studentenwerk]] Dresden in the early 1900s as the university's student council.&lt;ref name="AS1911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt; Outside of the university's circles, many of the fraternity's members  drove developments in the architectural style and design of several of Dresden's buildings such as the "Dresden's Neuer Bahnhof".&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"&gt;Corps Altsachsen: Hundert Jahre Corps Altsachsen. 1. Auflage. Köln 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership in the fraternity is open to [[Honour|honorable]] men&lt;ref name="duel" /&gt; studying at one of Dresden's [[University|universities]] and is based exclusively on personality, good moral standing, and strength of character.&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;Die Corps. "Prinzipien der Corps" An article explaining the principles of being a Corps Student: http://www.die-corps.de/prinzipien.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Corps Altsachsen value and engage in the tradition of academic fencing&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt; as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure. Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s, Altsachsen's members wear the traditional [[couleur]], colored stripes, in grey-green-gold. The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, who are stemming from very diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name="lit_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt;

== Fundamentals and principles ==
Like all ''German Student Corps'', Altsachsen expects tolerance from its members in [[German Student Corps#Politics|political]], [[German Student Corps#Sciences|scientific]] and [[List of members of German student corps|religious]] affairs.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt; Members are encouraged to have their own point of view about the world and be able to argue it, but Altsachsen as an entity always remains neutral. This ''[[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]]'' is a fundamental pillar of all Corps and differentiates them from fraternities who require a certain political or religious affinity.&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; The fraternity encourages freshly admitted (pledging "fox") members with diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds to prove themselves as valuable Corps brothers, purely on the basis of personal [[ethos|character]] and [[recognition (sociology)|merit]], before becoming eligible to be fully incorporated (''Rezeption'').&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt; The fraternity has about 200 members of all ages (including alumni) coming from or currently residing in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa. Every full member is a member for life.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;

[[File:Mühlberg - Säbelmensur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Academic fencing|Academic "Mensur" fencing]] in 1900. Steel goggles were added to protect the eyes and nose nowadays.]]
Members of the Corps Altsachsen value and practice the tradition of engagements in ''[[academic fencing]]'', or ''"Mensur"'' in German, with members of other old-school fraternities. Academic fencing, originating in the [[German school of fencing]], is understood as a way to exercise good judgement and prove character,&lt;ref name="duel" /&gt; allowing participants to show determination by standing their ground under pressure, while enhancing the bonds between the Corps brothers at the same time.&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fechten"&gt;Die Corps. "Hoch bitte – Los!" An article explaining the role of academic fencing at Corps: http://www.die-corps.de/fechten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] described one of these fencing duels/challenges in his day and age; his description is remarkably similar to current practices.&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2c" /&gt; Altsachsen's members identify themselves wearing the traditional ''couleur'', colored stripes, as well as caps and/or other specific garments at official occasions. This tradition, known as "wearing colors" (German: ''Farben tragen''), provides means to recognize members of other fraternities and, likewise, identification for the Corps brothers with each other and their traditions.&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;

[[File:Knight academy lecture (Rosenborg Palace).jpg|thumb|''[[Rhetoric]] evenings'' in the fraternity's old-school bar are similar in style to a knight academy lecture as depicted.]]
Altsachsen's members value the art of ''[[rhetoric]]''. The tradition is kept alive by both impromptu or "stand-up and talk" speeches (''Stegreifrede'' in German) as well as elaborate platform presentations typical of industry and academia. All members must present a significant number of such talks and are graded on their presentation skills. In order to become a full member, pledge members must pass a curriculum of predetermined talks in front of their peers and guests.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;

''Activity'' and ''responsibility'' are two fundamental expectations for fraternity members. With the goal to achieve members who are prepared to become active leaders in society, every Corps brother is expected to hold a leadership position at least once for a term ("Semester") while a student. Members are further encouraged to organize internal and open fraternity events that draw attention from other fraternities and guests from industry, academia, politics and other active societies.&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; Allocating the necessary resources appropriately and living up to set expectations teaches responsibility.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt; All members must show active participation in the regular fraternity Convents, providing the foundation for the fraternity's members to meet and discuss past, present and future developments. Decisions are cast in a democratic manner, sometimes after intense debates. Participation at such Convents teaches a better understanding of proper argumentation, group dynamics and critical analysis of other members' views, plans and arguments, thereby preparing its participants to become active members of society.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt; Similarly, every member must finish his higher educational degree with good academic standing in order to advance to the status of ''Alter Herr'' (alumnus).&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;

Long-term guidance is expected from and provided by said ''Alte Herren'', who often remain very engaged and well connected with the fraternity. Every year at the end of May, student and alumni members of all German Student Corps meet in one of two cities ([[Weinheim]] and [[Bad Kösen]]) for three days to refresh their bonds with their fraternity and friends from the entire Corps network ([[Weinheimer Senioren-Convent|WSC]]/[[Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband|KSCV]]).&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; In addition to these international meetings once a year, alumni join the student members for multiple local meetings, lasting an evening or a weekend. These regular meetings result in strong bonds spanning the generations within the fraternity.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;

{{Quote|The '''object and purpose of the Corps''' was and still is solely the education of students to become a strong, free and cosmopolitan personality who is not held back by religious, racist, national, scientific or philosophical limitations of the mind. Three primary institutions within the fraternity aid with achieving this aim; including the '''Corpsconvent''' [regular council meetings of the Corps Brothers], the '''Kneipe'''  [celebratory get-together of Corps Brothers with speeches, beer and songs], and today's '''Bestimmungsmensur'''  [the event of academic fencing with sharp blades for the first or one of the first times], where the ones to fence are chosen on the basis of placing two equal opponents in front of each other. [...] This experience, and the intertwined need to overcome one's own fear, dedicated to the union of his Corps, and the connected strengthening of the sense of community aids the personal growth just as does taking a hit without losing one's stand and accepting the assessment of the '''Mensur'''  by the own Corps Brothers.|[[:de:Hermann Rink]]&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Rink: ''Die Mensur, ein wesentliches Merkmal des Verbandes.'' In: Rolf-Joachim Baum (Hg.), ''„Wir wollen Männer, wir wollen Taten!“ Deutsche Corpsstudenten 1848 bis heute''. Siedler Verlag, Berlin 1998, ISBN 3-88680-653-7, S. 383 f.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
{{Further information|German Student Corps|List of members of German student corps|Weinheimer Senioren-Convent}}

=== Foundation as Rhetoric Society in 19th century Dresden ===
[[File:Dresden photochrom2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brühl's Terrace]] in 1890.]]

The fraternity was founded on October 31, 1861, at the [[Brühl's Terrace]] in Dresden's city center as the Rhetoric Society by students of Dresden's former [[Institute of Technology]], now the Dresden University of Technology. The name chosen for the new fraternity was originally ''[[Polyhymnia]]'', after the muse of sacred poetry, rhetoric and [[eloquence]]. The founders strongly believed that a rhetoric education and discourse should be part of a complete humanistic higher education. The colors ''grey-green-gold'' were chosen to represent the fraternity's principles focusing on academia (grey), being full of fresh energy and hope for its principles (green), and valuing friendship among fraternity brothers (gold).&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt; The strong connection to the fraternity's founding location is often revived with a rhetoric get-together at Brühl's Terrace and spontaneous afternoon pub gatherings near the river [[Elbe]] as well as lavish [[Ball (dance)|balls]] throughout the year.

[[File:SchlägerOvBMuseumFriedrichsruh.jpg|thumb|[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s student sword and helmet, comparable to those used by Altsachsen's members then and now.]]
By 1868, the fraternity had adopted the tradition of academic fencing or ''"Mensur"'' challenges (back then "duels"&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;) with members of other proper fraternities&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt; and had changed its official name to ''Akademische Verbindung Polyhymnia'' (Academic Fraternity Polyhymnia). The motto "Litteris et amicitiae" (Science and Friendship) was adopted on June 25, 1880.&lt;ref name="AS1911"&gt;Festschrift zur Feier des fünfzigjährigen Bestehens der freischlagenden Verbindung "Polyhymnia" an der Technischen Hochschule zu Dresden. Technische Hochschule Dresden, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The fraternity's [[Coat of arms of Germany|coat of arms]] was chosen in the same year, depicting the one-headed black eagle of the time of the German Empire (1871-1918) instead of the two-headed eagle at the time of the fraternity's foundation.&lt;ref name="AS1961_full"/&gt;
{{Further information|Holistic education|Trivium (education)}}

=== Influencing the development of the Technical Institute of Dresden ===
Dresden's main university, today's Technical University (short: TU) Dresden was founded in 1828 as one of the first [[Institute of technology|technical institutes]] of the world, then called "Technical School of Saxony". After Saxony joined the newly formed German Empire in 1871, the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon Polytechnic Institute (Königlich-Sächsisches Polytechnikum). At this point in time, topics not connected with technology, such as history and languages, were introduced to the school curriculum. Several of Altsachsen's fraternity members were in high-ranking institute and government positions and had an influential role by lobbying Saxony's state government to recognize the technical institute as a higher education provider with polytechnical merits, which resulted in yet another name change to ''Königlich-Sächsischen Technischen Hochschule Dresden'' (Royal-Saxon Technical College of Dresden) in 1890.&lt;ref name="AS1961"&gt;Corps Altsachsen: Hundert Jahre Corps Altsachsen. 1. Auflage. Köln 1961, S. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; 
To honor the recognition of the educational institution, the fraternity established the ''academic principle'' (''akademische Prinzip''). This meant that every member could only become an alumnus after graduating with a higher academic degree and in good academic standing, an initiative by fraternity member and Honorary Senator Fritz Zeuner, son of the former president of the Poly-technical Institute Gustav Zeuner. They and others in the fraternity significantly influenced the college's course, eventually leading to the college's privilege to graduate students with doctoral degrees in 1900. Aside from traditional doctoral graduations, the university was also allowed to honor exceptional scientists and businessmen as honorary doctors; the first such honor was granted to Friedrich August Siemens.&lt;ref name="AS1961"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift Der Technischen Universität Dresden, Volume 18, Issue 5, Technischen Universität Dresden, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TU-Dresden-Georg-Schumann-Bau 2.jpg|thumb|The typical, early 1900s style of campus architecture is exemplified in today's nearby Schumann-Building at the [[Dresden University of Technology|TU Dresden]].]]

=== Foundation of Franconia ===
During the late 1800s, fraternities began forming fraternity circles and umbrella organizations. Differences in opinion about tolerance and general politics led to the end of ''honorable greeting and fencing'' with certain types of fraternities, such as the Cheruscia Dresden in 1899. This led to problems trying to maintain a high level of fencing engagements among similar fraternities, which is why five of Polyhymnia's fraternity brothers founded the "fencing fraternity Franconia Dresden" ("Freischlagende Verbindung Franconia", later "Corps Franconia Dresden") in Juli of 1899. Monetary stimulus for the new fraternity was provided by Polyhymnia's alumni-organisation. Both "fencing fraternities", not yet Corps at that point, formed the Dresden Fraternity Cartel ("Dresdner Verbindungs-Cartell" D.V.C.) to rival and engage in regular social and fencing events.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Schüler: Weinheimer S.C.-Chronik, Darmstadt 1927, S. 434-454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;Michael Doeberl, Alfred Bienengräber: Das akademische Deutschland, Volume 2, C.A. Weller, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joining the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent ===
To guarantee her members reliable means to fence with other fraternities of like principles, Polyhymnia joint the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent (WSC) in 1927 and was renamed Corps Altsachsen.&lt;ref name="PG81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karlheinz Blaschke, Holger Starke, Uwe John: Geschichte der Stadt Dresden, Volume 3, Theiss Verlag, 2006, S. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The name change from ''Polyhymnia'' to ''Corps Altsachsen'' happened in compliance with WSC rules for fraternity names at that time.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt; Likewise, most of the local fraternities merged to form similar umbrella organizations in the following years. From that point on, most of the social activity, such as eloquent balls as well as fencing engagements became limited to like-minded fraternities, the German Student Corps.&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt;

=== Suspension during times of the national socialist rule ===
Similar to other fraternities who encouraged their members to have their own free thought and will, members of the Corps Altsachsen felt the increasing pressure of national socialist surveillance as well as political pressure in the early 1930s. A similar-minded fraternity, ''Corps Makaria Dresden'', fused with the Corps Altsachsen in 1934, which strengthened bonds and numbers within the fraternity. Still, as political pressures in Nazi Germany had increased to dangerous levels for fraternities during the next years, Corps Altsachsen officially suspended activities in 1936.&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt;  During the 1930s, eventually all corps abiding by a free democratic order did the same as their view of the world was in stark contrast to the so-called [[Führerprinzip]] (Führer-principle), where one person governs essentially as dictator instead of relying on a democratic, consensus-based majority in a convent.&lt;ref name=AS1961/&gt;

[[File:Corps Altsachsen Winternacht.png|thumb|House of the fraternity in a snowy Christmas winter night in Dresden.]]

=== Post-war reconstitution and return to Dresden ===
After the war, the fraternity was reconstituted at the [[University of Cologne]] in 1950&lt;ref name="Asta1972"&gt;Universitätsführer. Universität zu Köln, Allgemeiner Studentenausschuss, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and soon fused with the smaller ''Corps Gothia Dresden'' in 1953. Originally located in Köln-Lindenthal, Altsachsen soon moved to Köln-Marienburg, where it stayed until the [[Iron Curtain]] collapsed.&lt;ref name=AS1961/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asta1972"/&gt; During the Soviet dictatorship in East Germany, fraternities abiding by free will and common consensus were again not allowed to exist as they could not be controlled by the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Party]]. Following [[Germany's reunification]] in 1989, the fraternity returned to Dresden in 1994 with the aid of the ''[[Blaues Kartell]]'', a circle of four like-minded fraternities that Altsachsen had joined in 1993. The ''Blaues Kartell'' today includes the [[Corps Saxo-Thuringia München]] in [[Munich]], Corps Hannoverania in [[Hanover]] and [[Corps Berlin]] in [[Berlin]]. In 1997, the Corps Altsachsen transitioned its headquarters to its newly remodeled fraternity house on Weissbachstreet 1, right in the middle of the [[Campus]] of the Dresden University of Technology, thereby reconnecting with its traditional roots.&lt;ref name="PG07"/&gt;

[[File:Dresden Weiße Flotte Terrassenufer.jpg|thumb|[[:de:Dresden (Schiff, 1926)|Steamboat]] at [[Brühl's Terrace]]]]

=== Today ===
The fraternity is known for its strong commitment to the university and its rhetoric traditions as well as lavish social events. Among these are regular boat parties on Dresden's [[Paddle steamer|steam boats]] as well as traditional balls allowing the Corps brothers to enjoy [[Waltz dance|waltz]], [[latin dance|Latin]] or many other forms of [[ballroom dance]].&lt;ref name="AShp"&gt;Webpage of the Corps Altsachsen - "Aktuelles" showing current events http://www.altsachsen.de Retrieved on Oct. 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these events are not limited to the region of Dresden, as there are several trips per year to other cities.

David Fallows's work has been called "pioneering" on the lives of composers and of the ensembles that performed music,&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt; and having covered "just about every aspect of fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century music."&lt;ref&gt;Noel O'Regan, review of the Festschrift in ''Music and Letters,'' 93.3 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Among Fallows's first publications was, "Ciconia padre e figlio" (Ciconia: father and son; 1976), which theorized that the current biography of [[Johannes Ciconia]] was primarily that of his father, and that the composer himself was born about thirty-five years later.&lt;ref&gt;Giuliano Di Bacco and John Nádas, "Ciconia, Johannes: 1. Life" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 2nd Edition (London: Macmillan, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has become the accepted biography of the composer. Also during his doctoral studies he reconstructed the origins of the important fourteenth-century polyphonic manuscripts in [[Cambrai]] ("L'origine du MS. 1328 de Cambrai"). His 1978 dissertation, "[[Robert Morton (composer)|Robert Morton]]'s Songs" was among Fallows's first works on English Renaissance music and fifteenth-century song, repertories that have concerned him throughout his life (including in his 2014 [[Musica Britannica]] volume on English song, 1380–1480). These studies formed the basis for his comprehensive ''A Catalogue of Polyphonic Songs, 1415–1480'' (Oxford 1999). A major article on the life of [[Johannes Regis]] (1989) also had a transformative impact on the understanding of the composer. His 2009 study of the life and works of [[Josquin des Prez]] (Brepols) has been praised for understanding the conflicting information recently unearthed about the composer as well as presenting new hypotheses and understanding of the composer's music in light of new discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D. Fallows, ''Josquin''|url=http://www.brepols.net/Pages/ShowProduct.aspx?prod_id=IS-9782503530659-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallows's 1982 monograph ''Dufay'' is the principal reference work on the life and works of the composer [[Guillaume Dufay]]. He has edited and introduced facsimile publications of the Songbook of [[Henry VIII]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item101064.html|title=Songs written by Henry VIII|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the manuscript [[Bodleian Library|Oxford]], Canon. Misc 213, the [[Chansonnier Cordiforme]], and others. As senior consulting editor for [[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]], Fallows contributed many major articles along with many small articles on musical diacritics (tempo and expression marks) and miscellany such as "Spoof Articles."&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows, "{{GroveMusic|id=53081|label=Spoof articles|linkonly=t}}," in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 2nd Edition (London: Macmillan, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10778">The '''defensible space theory''' of architect and city planner '''Oscar Newman''' encompasses ideas about crime prevention and neighborhood safety.  The theory developed in the early 1970s, and he wrote his first book on the topic, ''Defensible Space'' in 1972.  The book contains a study from New York that pointed out that higher crime rate existed in high-rise apartment buildings than in lower [[Public housing|housing projects]].  This, he concluded, was because residents felt no control or personal responsibility for an area occupied by so many people.  Throughout his study, Newman focused on explaining his ideas on [[social control]], [[crime prevention]], and public health in relation to community design.

== Theory ==
As defined in Newman's book ''Design Guidelines for Creating Defensible Space'', defensible space is "a residential environment whose physical characteristics—building layout and site plan—function to allow inhabitants themselves to become key agents in ensuring their security."&lt;ref name="Ph.D2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sridevi Rao, Ph.D|title=A Measure of Community: Public Open Space and Sustainable Development Goal 11.7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCKeDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT176|date=4 July 2016|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=978-1-945497-88-9|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to explain that a [[Subdivision (land)|housing development]] is only defensible if residents intend to adopt this role, which is defined by good design: "Defensible space therefore is a sociophysical phenomenon," says Newman.&lt;ref name="Palidda2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Palidda|title=Governance of Security and Ignored Insecurities in Contemporary Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz77CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=14 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-12589-1|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both society and physical elements are parts of a successful defensible space.&lt;ref name="Palidda2016" /&gt;

The theory argues that an area is safer when people feel a sense of ownership and responsibility for that piece of a community.  Newman asserts that "the criminal is isolated because his turf is removed" when each space in an area is owned and cared for by a responsible party.&lt;ref name="Newman1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Newman|title=Creating Defensible Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80w0GEh4ffEC&amp;pg=PA2|year=1966|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0-7881-4528-5|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an intruder can sense a watchful community, he feels less secure committing his crime.  The idea is that crime and delinquency can be controlled and mitigated through [[environmental design]].&lt;ref name="Ross2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Ian Ross|title=Encyclopedia of Street Crime in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6GVECQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131|date=1 March 2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-5063-2028-1|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassidy2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Cassidy|title=Environmental Psychology: Behaviour and Experience In Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0b3eAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA201|date=31 October 2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-135-47209-2|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five factors that make a defensible space:&lt;ref name="Marshall2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Molly Marshall|title=OCR Psychology Student Guide 3: Component 3 Applied psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TjEDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT48|date=22 August 2016|publisher=Hodder Education|isbn=978-1-4718-5948-9|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Territoriality – the idea that one's home is sacred
#Natural surveillance – the link between an area's physical characteristics and the residents' ability to see what is happening
#Image – the capacity of the physical design to impart a sense of security
#Milieu – other features that may affect security, such as proximity to a police substation or busy commercial area
#Safe Adjoining Areas - for better security, residents obtain higher ability of surveillance of adjoining area through designing the adjoining area 

The concept of defensible space is controversial. A [[United States Department of Justice]] experiment in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] closed streets and assigned police teams to certain neighborhoods. New public housing projects were designed around ideas of limited access to the city, but Hartford did not show any dramatic drop in crime.&lt;ref name="Benson1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce L. Benson|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nyATCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|date=August 1998|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the [[private place]]s of St. Louis do have much lower crime than public streets. The reason appears to be that in St. Louis, people had the capacity and incentives to defend their defensible spaces. Residents had the right to ask an unwelcome individual (i.e. not a resident or guest) to leave their street, because they jointly owned it. On public streets, one cannot legally act against someone until they have committed a crime.

== Intention ==

The intention of physical features is to create a sense of [[Land ownership|territorialism]] in community members which will ensure a safe living environment for those that care for it.  Defensible space works with a hierarchy of living and community spaces.  According to the theory, housing developments that evoke territorialism are “the strongest deterrents to criminal and vandal activity.”  Housing should be grouped in such a way that members feel a mutual benefit.  Also to deter crime, areas should be defined for function, paths should be defined for movement, outdoor areas should be juxtaposed with homes, and indoor spaces should visually provide for close watch of outside areas.  

Newman holds that through good design, people should not only feel comfortable questioning what is happening in their surroundings, but they should feel obligated to do so.  Any intruder should be able to sense the existence of a watchful community and avoid the situation altogether.  Criminals fear the likelihood that a resident, upon viewing the intrusion, would then question their actions.  This is highly effective in neighborhoods that cannot afford a professional [[Neighborhood watch|crime watch]]. 

The defensible space theory is applicable to any type of planned space.  From low density housing to high rises, the key is the development of a communal area in which residents can “extend the realm of their homes and the zone of felt responsibility.”  Circulation paths and common entry are important aspects of defensible design as well.  Residents must also feel a need to extend their protective attitudes to locations where property and urban streets and surroundings connect.  The interfacing between private property and community space should be protected similarly.
    
Newman’s intent in creating the principles of defensible space is to give the residents of a community control of [[public space]]s that they formerly felt were out of reach.  In effect, residents care enough for their area to protect it from crime as they would protect their own private property.

=== Principles ===

Oscar Newman’s basic five principles of designing defensible space as quoted in Design Guidelines for Creating Defensible Space are as follows:

#The assignment to different resident groups the specific environments they are best able to utilize and control, as determined by their ages, life-styles, socializing proclivities, backgrounds, incomes, and family structures.
#The territorial definition of space in residential developments to reflect the zone of influence of specific inhabitants.  Residential environments should be subdivided into zones toward which adjacent residents can easily adopt proprietary attitudes.
#The juxtaposition of dwelling interiors with exterior spaces and the placement of windows to allow residents to naturally survey the exterior and interior public areas of their living environments and the areas assigned for their use.
#The juxtaposition of dwellings—their entries and amenities—with city streets so as to incorporate the streets within the sphere of influence of the residential environment.
#The adoption of building forms and idioms that avoids the stigma of peculiarity that allows others to perceive the vulnerability and isolation of a particular group of inhabitants.

To create a defensible space community, residential areas should be subdivided into smaller entities of similar families because control is enhanced.  Responsibility for the area is more easily assumed in a smaller group of families as opposed to a larger [[community]].  Smaller groups more frequently use an area geared toward them.  The number of activities in the space is increased; thus, a feeling of ownership and a need to protect the property follows.  On the other hand, when larger groups use a community space, no one has control over the area, and an agreement over its acceptable uses is often in dispute.

== Today ==
The defensible space theory was largely popular in city design from its emergence until the 1980s.{{cn|date=September 2015}} Some of his basic ideas are still taken into consideration presently, and all contemporary approaches and discussions of the relationship between crime and house design use Newman's theory as a critical point of reference.&lt;ref name="Reynald et al"&gt;Reynald, D.M. and Elffers, H., 2009. The future of Newman's Defensible Space Theory: Linking Defensible Space and the routine activities of place. ''European Journal of Criminology, 6''(1), pp.25-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Although modifications were made to the original theory in the 1980s,&lt;ref name="Reynald et al" /&gt; Newman's basic principles still exist in design, and have been used by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] as "both a criminological concept and a proven strategy for enhancing our Nation's quality of life".&lt;ref name="Newman1966" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==

In the [[HBO]] miniseries [[Show Me a Hero]], Newman, a recurring character, articulates his theory of defensible space to Judge Sand as they are trying to plan where to place two hundred new units of desegregated public housing in the city of [[Yonkers, New York]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13071">The '''economics of science''' aims to understand the impact of [[science]] on the advance of 
[[technology]], to explain the behavior of scientists, and to understand the efficiency or 
inefficiency of scientific institutions and markets.

The importance of the [[economics]] as science is substantially due to the importance of science as a driver of technology and technology as a driver of productivity and growth.  Believing that science matters, economists have attempted to understand the behavior of scientists and the 
operation of scientific institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Diamond, Jr. (2008). "science, economics of," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, Basingstoke and New York: [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. Pre-publication [https://archive.is/20120927155248/http://cba.unomaha.edu/faculty/adiamond/web/diamondpdfs/palgraveeconsci07.pdf cached ccpy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science as a Public Good==
Economists consider “science” as the search and production of knowledge using known starting conditions.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audretsch|first1=David|last2=Bozeman|first2=Barry|last3=Combs|first3=Kathryn|last4=Feldman|first4=Maryann|last5=Link|first5=Albert|last6=Siegel|first6=Donald|last7=Stephan|first7=Paula|last8=Tassey|first8=Gregory|last9=Wessner|first9=Charles|title=The Economics of Science and Technology|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|date=April 2002|volume=27|issue=2|pages=155–203|doi=10.1023/A:1014382532639|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1014382532639|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge can be considered a [[public good]], due to the fact that its utility to society is not diminished with additional consumption (non-[[rivalry (economics)|rivalry]]), and once the knowledge is shared with the public it becomes very hard to restrict access to it or use of it (non-[[excludable]]). Traditional public economic theory asserts that competitive markets provide poor incentives for production of a public good because the producers cannot reap the benefits of use of their product, and thus costs will be higher than benefits. Economists have identified several possible reasons as to why producers of science might determine that the private costs they incur in the production process are larger than the benefits that they intend to reap, even though the benefits to society are greater than these costs.&lt;ref name="Callon, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callon|first1=Michel|title=Is Science a Public Good?|journal=Science, Technology, and Human Values|date=October 1, 1994|volume=19|issue=4|pages=395–424|doi=10.1177/016224399401900401|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/016224399401900401|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the technological barriers to production are extremely high, which makes the market very risky. Technological barriers refer to the cost of [[research and development]] of new scientific knowledge, which becomes increasingly expensive as technology continues to play a more prominent role in this type of development.&lt;ref name="von Zedtwitz et al. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Von Zedtwitz|first1=Maximilian|last2=Gassmann|first2=Oliver|title=Market versus Technology Drive in R&amp;D Internationalization: Four different patterns of managing research and development|journal=Research Policy|date=2002|volume=31|issue=4|pages=569–588|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(01)00125-1|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0048733301001251/1-s2.0-S0048733301001251-main.pdf?_tid=3d0f6865-63dc-4427-96c7-296d591248cc&amp;acdnat=1520395953_6c5dc57bf27dfd45501ef8493ca719f7|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, due to the non-excludable nature of scientific knowledge, producers worry that they will be unable to enforce property rights on their produced goods. This will result in others being able to benefit from the scientific knowledge without having to bear the cost of the research and development, which would in turn make the potential return on investment too small to incentivize participation in the market.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; Therefore, science can be understood as the production of a public good, and can be studied within the framework of [[public economics]].&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt;

However, certain economists argue that a non-market mechanism has developed to correct the problem of indefinable property rights, such that scientists are incentivized to produce knowledge in a socially responsible way. Economist Paula Stephen refers to this mechanism as a reward system based primarily on a concept that she calls “priority of discovery.”&lt;ref name="Stephens et al. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephens|first1=Paula|title=The Economics of Science|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|date=September 1996|volume=34|issue=3|pages=1199–1235|jstor=2729500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Merton argues that to goal of scientists is to establish “priority of discovery” by being the first to report a new discovery, which then results in the reward of recognition. The scientific community only bestows this reward on the person who discovers the new piece of knowledge first, and thus this sets up a winner-takes-all type of system that incentivizes producers to participate in the market of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Merton 1957"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merton|first1=Robert|title=Priorities in Scientific Discover: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science|journal=American Sociological Review|date=December 1957|volume=22|issue=6|pages=635–659|doi=10.2307/2089193|jstor=2089193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen particularly notes that “Compensation in science is generally composed of two parts: one portion is paid regardless of the individual's success in races, the other is priority-based and reflects the value of the winner's contribution to science.”&lt;ref name="Stephens et al. 1996" /&gt; The first part that Stephens identifies corresponds to the salary that a professor in academia would expect to make over the course of his or her career; these salaries are notoriously flat, with one study noting that a full professor can expect to make only 70% more than a newly hired assistant professor.&lt;ref name="Ehrenberg 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehrenberg|first1=Ronald|title=Academic Labor Supply|journal=Economic Challenges in Higher Education|date=1991|pages=141–258|url=https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1650&amp;context=articles|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stephen argues that the second part of compensation, that which is reaped when a scientist establishes priority of discovery, then the earnings profile becomes much less flat as the scientist gains prestige, journalistic citations, paid speaking invitations, and other such rewards. However, she notes that this theory had yet to be empirically tested at the time of writing.&lt;ref name="Stephens et al. 1996" /&gt; Furthermore, her analysis only applies to the world of academia, whereas industry is also a major source of scientific knowledge production.

==Government Interventions==

The field of [[public economics]] posits that should [[market failures]] occur, the government might be able to intervene to correct these market failures. When speaking about the production of scientific knowledge, the government has several options for intervening in the market to attempt to correct the failure. In the United States, two of the most historically popular and most extensively studied options are the [[patent]] system and [[tax incentives]].&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt;

===The Patent System===
[[File:Patent System - Economics of Science.png|thumb|Graphical representation of the effect of patents on production of scientific knowledge]]In the United States, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|Patent and Trademark Office]] issues patents that give the holder of the patent exclusive, defined property rights to their product for 20 years. From an economic perspective, the value of the patent is that it increases the marginal benefit of the firm that is producing the scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; To graphically display this concept, the accompanying figure depicts the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves of a firm in the market for science. The vertical axis displays the [[marginal cost]] and [[marginal benefit]] of each additional dollar spent on research and development. The horizontal access displays the amount of money spent on research and development in total. Research and development is assumed to have [[diminishing returns]]. For simplicity’s sake, all curves are assumed to be linear, and the marginal cost curve is assumed to be constant. A firm will maximize their profits by producing where marginal cost intersects marginal benefit. In the absence of any [[government intervention]], the firm will produce where at RD&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where private marginal benefit (MB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) intersects MC. However, if scientific knowledge is assumed to be a public good, then RD&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is too low a quantity to satisfy the social need. The optimal amount of R&amp;D is at RD&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The value of the introduction of the patent system is that it allows the marginal benefit curve for the firm to shift upward to MB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; so that the private benefit to the firm now produces the socially optimal quantity. The additional revenue is collected from society, as society now pays higher prices for the knowledge given the monopoly power of the producing firm.

In practice, patent law has been correlated with increased R&amp;D expenditure, indicating that this form of government intervention is in fact incentivizing production.&lt;ref name="Acs et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acs|first1=Zoltan|last2=Audretsch|first2=David|title=Patents as a Measure of Innovative Activity|journal=Kyklos|date=August 1989|volume=42|issue=2|pages=171–180|doi=10.1111/j.1467-435.1989.tb00186.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6435.1989.tb00186.x/abstract|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this type of government intervention does not allow particularly precise targeting of the optimal level of R&amp;D production, and several economists argue that the benefit of 20 years of monopoly power is too high.&lt;ref name="Acs et al" /&gt; This argument has particular relevance to current debates regarding the production of life-saving pharmaceuticals.

===Tax Incentives===
[[File:Tax Incentive - Economics of Science.png|thumb|Graphical representation of the effect of tax incentives on production of scientific knowledge]]In 1954, the Internal Revenue Service incorporated an exemption for research costs such that firms could have research costs deducted from their yearly taxes.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; From an economic perspective, the value of the tax incentive is that it decreases the marginal cost of the firm that is producing the scientific knowledge. To graphically display this concept, the accompanying figure depicts the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves of a firm in the market for science. The vertical axis displays the marginal cost and benefit of each additional dollar spent on research and development. The horizontal access displays the amount of money spent on research and development in total. Research and development is assumed to have diminishing rate of return. For simplicity’s sake, all curves are assumed to be linear, and the marginal cost curve is assumed to be constant. A firm will maximize their profits by producing where marginal cost intersects marginal benefit. In the absence of any government intervention, the firm will produce where at RD0, where private marginal benefit (PMB0) intersects MC. However, if scientific knowledge is assumed to be a public good, then RD0 is too low a quantity to satisfy the social need. The optimal amount of R&amp;D is at RD1, which is where the marginal cost curve intersects the social marginal benefit (not depicted on this graph). The value of the tax incentive is that it allows the marginal cost curve for the firm to shift downward so that the private cost to the firm now produces the socially optimal quantity. The rest of the cost is now borne by society, in the form of the lost tax revenue.

Tax incentives allow slightly more precise targeting than the patent system. However, the concern still remains that tax incentives exacerbate inequality by producing financial windfalls for firms that might already be very prosperous.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; Furthermore, empirical studies have been limited, although a 1996 report from the Congressional Office of Technological Assessment found that for every dollar lost in tax revenue, there was a dollar increasing in private R&amp;D spending.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2401">'''Eisenhower College''' was a small college named after U.S. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], located on [[Cayuga Lake]] in [[Seneca Falls (town), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]]. It was founded on September 21, 1965 as a [[liberal arts college]]. Private funds and two federal grants totaling $14.5 million helped established the college, which opened its doors to its first class in 1968.

A portion of the proceeds from the sale of each [[Eisenhower Dollar]] coin went to the college.  This amounted to some $9 million between the coin's initial production in 1971 and 1978, when production ceased.

Eisenhower curricula were centered on a core set of courses collectively known as "World Studies."   These mandatory courses examined the history of civilization from the ascent of Man through modern times in music, art, history, science, philosophy and literature. Foreign language and physical education courses were also mandatory.

Until 1979, the campus housed the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].

==History==

In March 1979, the liberal arts college, which had a total enrollment of only 460 students and was experiencing financial difficulties, was acquired by [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT).  On July 22, 1982, RIT announced the immediate closing of Eisenhower College due to "major operating deficits."  Current students and faculty were given the opportunity to transfer to RIT's main campus for the 1982/83 school year.

In 1989, the property was sold to the [[New York Chiropractic College]] which continues to operate the campus. An archive of Eisenhower College material, donated by former professors and alumni, was stored at the campus library as of 2006.

[[Feminist theory]] as it relates to [[architecture]] has forged the way for the rediscovery of such [[women in architecture|female architects]] as [[Eileen Gray]]. These women imagined an architecture that challenged the way the traditional family would live. They practiced architecture with what they considered feminist theories or approaches. The rediscovery of architecture through feminist theory is not limited to female architects. Architects like [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Adolf Loos]] have also had their architecture reexamined through feminist theory.

==The architecture==
In [[Dolores Hayden]]'s book ''The Grand Domestic Revolution'' she explains the ways in which "a lost feminine tradition" led to a "redefining of house work and the housing needs of women and their families, push[ing] architects and urban planners to reconsider the effects of design on family life".&lt;ref&gt;Dolores Hayden, ''The Grand Domestic Revolution: A History of Feminist Designs for American Homes, Neighborhoods, and Cities,'' MIT Press, 1981. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of the changing needs of the family can be seen in the houses of Truus Schröder, Eileen Gray and LeCorbusier's [[Villa Stein]] de-Monzie. The [[Rietveld Schröder House]] is an excellent example of the way that the "modern" lives of the family demanded a new architecture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Schröder House was not only a creative work of artistic design but offered its users a new environment in which to redefine family life, women's rights and the responsibilities of individuals and to each other"&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., "Family Matters: The Schroder House, by Gerrit Rietveld and Truus Schröder," [[Yale University Press]], 2006. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The movable walls and partitions give a sense of consciousness and an overall feeling that the architecture was built with a greater purpose. The fact that Truus Schröder's beliefs in the family and as the house playing a part in the family; the house almost as a member.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} Truus Schröder is closely related to Dutch and European [[feminism]] of the twentieth century, based on her goals for her house.

Eileen Gray's [[E-1027]] is another example of feminist theory being applied to architecture.

Much like Schröder, Gray designed an architecture that would address the needs of the occupants and the new family unit. Gray worked within the model of modern architecture, LeCorbusier's "5 points of new architecture" for example as well as addressing the issues of the building or home as an experience.&lt;ref&gt;Constant, Caroline. "E1027: The Nonheroic Modernism of Eileen Gray," ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians,'' vol.53, September 1994. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Like E1027 and The Schroder House, Villa Stein de Monzie was rediscovered through feminist theory. More well known is the way in which this house called gender relations and the way in which the relationship between men and women was negotiated in a new way.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., ''Women and the Making of the Modern House: A Social and Architectural History.'' Yale University Press, 2006, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

This house is of particular importance in feminist theory because it called into question the typical domestic group and gender relations. This domestic group that included a married couple and a woman with her child called domestic space into question.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4652">The '''Francqui Prize''' is a prestigious Belgian scholarly and [[Science|scientific]] [[prize]] named after [[Émile Francqui]]. Normally annually since 1933, the [[Francqui Foundation]] awards it in recognition of the achievements of a scholar or [[scientist]], who at the start of the year still had to be under 50. It currently represents a sum of 250,000  [[Euro]]s and is awarded in the following three-year rotation of subjects: [[exact sciences]], [[social sciences]] or [[humanities]], and [[Biology|biological]] or [[medicine|medical]] sciences.

Proposed candidates must be associated with a Belgian academic institution, in the case of a foreigner for at least ten years. The recipient is selected by a jury of eight to 14 members, none of whom may be associated with a Belgian institution. The members of the international jury vote by secret letter, and the laureate they recommend must be supported by two thirds of the assembled directors of the foundation (with a quorum of 12) or no prize would be awarded that year.

The prize is meant to encourage the further work of the young laureate, rather than crown the latter's career. He or she is also asked to organise an international [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquium]] in the appropriate discipline the same year that he is awarded the prize, which usually leads to an international publication which enables the quality of Belgian [[university]] [[research]] to be more widely appreciated.

'''Geography of media and communication''' (also known as [[communication geography]], [[media geography]] and [[geographies of media]]) is an interdisciplinary research area bringing together [[human geography]] with [[media studies]] and [[communication theory]]. Research addressing the geography of media and communication seeks to understand how acts of communication and the systems they depend on both shape and are shaped by geographical patterns and processes.

== Overview ==
Geography of media and communication is an area of research, which considers various facets of communication. One interest is the layout and organization of communication systems at scales from cities to the planet. Closely related to this are the varying levels of access to communication systems from place to place. Attention to how places differ in regard to communication access leads to an interest in the changes that occur in places when new media diffuse into those places. A complementary interest is in how places are represented in various media—for example pictures of idyllic beaches in tourism advertisements or written descriptions of war zones in newspaper stories. Communications also allow people to interact with distant places, so a final area of investigation is how, by interacting with others through various kinds of communication systems, people inhabit various kinds of "virtual" spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |last1=Adams |first1=Paul C. |last2=Jansson |first2=André |year=2012 |title=Communication Geography: A Bridge between Disciplines |journal=Communication Theory |volume=22 |pages=299-317.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crang |first1=Mike |last2=Crang |first2=Phil |last3=May |first3=Jon |title=Virtual Geographies: Bodies, Space and Relations |place=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular interest to media/communication theorists are questions regarding the social and cultural formations associated with media, which in turn point to how media are involved in the transformation of belonging and citizenship, which relate to geographical territories. Social and cultural formations also depend on distinctions between public and private life, which have traditionally depended on spatial boundaries between public and private places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Couldry |first=Nick |title=Media, society, world: Social theory and digital media practice |publisher=Polity|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgiou |first=Myria |title=Media and the city: Cosmopolitanism and Difference |publisher=Polity |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last1=Sheller |first1=Mimi |last2=Urry |first2=John |title=Mobile transformations of ‘public’ and ‘private’ life |journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society |year=2003 |number=3 |page=107-125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics of particular interest to geographers are place representations in visual media including photography, film and graffiti, in auditory media including radio and music recordings, and even in embodied communications such as dance and video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Media Geography|last1=Adams|first1=Paul C. |last2=Craine |first2=Jim |last3=Dittmer |first3=Jason |publisher=Ashgate |location=Burlington, VT Press |year=2014 |isbn= 978-1409444015 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Austroneske jazyky.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the culture region corresponding to the Austronesian language family]]
Geographical interest in the systematic study of communication can be traced to the writings of [[Richard Hartshorne]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hartshorne |first=Richard |title=The nature of geography: A critical survey of current thought in the light of the past |publisher=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |year=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartshorne considered language to be a key element forming culture regions, meaning that the dominant language is similar within a particular culture region and it changes when one leaves a culture region. A very different aspect of communication became the focus during the 1950s and 1960s as geographers began to measure and model the interactions between locations. In this case, geographers involved in the [[quantitative revolution]] explained the accelerating flow of information between [[location (geography)|locations]] in terms of "time-space convergence" and "human extensibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |last=Janelle |first=Donald G. |year=1968 |title= Central Place Development in a Time‐Space Framework |journal=Professional Geographer |volume=20 |pages=5-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Janelle |first=Donald G. |year=1973 |title= Measuring human extensibility in a shrinking world |journal=Journal of Geography |volume=72 |number=2 |pages=8-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 1970s that geographers began to focus on communications in terms of content, considering questions of symbolism, [[Representation theory (linguistics)|representation]], [[metaphor]], [[iconography]] and [[discourse]]. This interest first took form in geographical research that drew on [[humanism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuan |first=Yi-Fu |title=Space and Place: The Perspective of Experience |place=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, this approach shifted towards a more critical sensibility unpacking the various meanings of [[landscape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burgess |first1=Jacquelin |last2=Gold |first2=John R. |title=Geography, the Media and Popular Culture |publisher=Croom Helm |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duncan |first1=James S. |last2=Ley |first2=David |title=Place/Culture/Representation |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnes |first1=Trevor J. |last2=Duncan |first2=James S. |title=Writing Worlds: Discourse, Text and Metaphor in the Representation of Landscape |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographers researching communication over the past two decades have extended these research areas while carrying forward early insights regarding the importance of communication to the formation of regions, the rate of information flow as a measure of spatial interaction, and the association between landscape and representation. New approaches to communication have been advanced under the frameworks of [[non-representational theory]], [[actor-network theory]], and [[assemblage theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thrift |first=Nigel |title=Non-representational Theory: Space, Politics, Affect |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Murdoch |first=Jonathan |year=1998 |title=The spaces of actor-network theory  |journal=Geoforum |volume=29 |number=4 |pages=357-374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally important is the effort to think through digital code and its relationship with space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kitchin |first1=Rob |last2=Dodge |first2=Martin |title=Code/Space: Software and Everyday Life |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of study ==
[[File:September 11 Photo Montage.jpg|thumb|right|World Trade Center Photo Montage; a place represented in media images; an example of place-in-media]]
According to one taxonomy, the geography of media and communication involves four complementary aspects: places-in-media, media-in-places, media-in-spaces and spaces-in-media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |last1=Adams |first1=Paul C. |last2=Jansson |first2=André |year=2012 |title=Communication Geography: A Bridge between Disciplines |journal=Communication Theory |volume=22 |pages=299-317.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Adams |first=Paul C. |title=A taxonomy for communication geography |journal=Progress in Human Geography |volume=35 |issue=1 |year=2011 |pages=37-57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Places-in-media are representations of place circulating in all sorts of media for all sorts of reasons, for example landscape paintings signifying the owner's status, and news images of urban spaces linking crime and chaos to minority populations and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burgess |first1=Jacquelin |last2=Gold |first2=John R. |title=Geography, the Media and Popular Culture |publisher=Croom Helm |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media-in-places are ways in which particular places such as the home, classroom, workplace, or city street are altered functionally and experientially by transformations in how people use media in those places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morley |first=David |title=Family Television: Cultural Power and Domestic Leisure |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media-in-spaces are communication infrastructures, whether historical, like telegraph cables, or contemporary like [[optical fiber cable]] when mapped and analyzed in terms of their physical layout. Spaces-in-media are the topologies that symbols, images, information and ideas move through as they spread or diffuse from person to person and from group to group.

The term '''global village''' represents the [[approximation|simplifying]] of the whole world into one village through the use of [[electronic media]]. ''Global village'' is also a term to express the constituting relationship between [[socioeconomics|economics and other social sciences]] throughout the world. The term was coined by Canadian [[media theorist]], [[Marshall McLuhan]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''America and Cosmic Man'' (1948) and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' are sometimes credited as the source of the phrase, but neither used the words "Global Village" as it is. According to M. McLuhan's son [[Eric McLuhan]], his father, a Joyce scholar and a close friend of Lewis, likely discussed the concept with Lewis during their association, but there is no evidence that he got the idea or the phrasing from either; McLuhan is generally credited as having coined the term.

==Overview ==

Marshall McLuhan, who was a Canadian philosopher, invented the word in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Golovine |first1=Mila |title=Global Village: Where Cultures Connect |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mila-golovine/global-village-where-cult_b_5035779.html |website=Huffingtonpost.com |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan based his concept on the idea that cultures would focus on communicating and move towards personal interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hendricks |first1=Beth |title=Marshall McLuhan &amp; the Global Village Concept |url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/marshall-mcluhan-the-global-village-concept.html |website=study.com |publisher=study.com |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;The term global village means different parts of the world that form one community that’s linked by the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of 'global village' |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/global-village |website=Collins dictionary |publisher=Collins dictionary |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of communication such as Skype allow us to communicate and connect with others, especially others in other countries, easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yew |first1=Lee |title=The World Is Truly A Global Village |url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2012/0326/current-events-singapore-world-truly-global-village-lee-kuan-yew.html#1b4fc3187fc4 |website=forbes.com |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


The new reality of the [[digital age]] has implications for forming new socially meaningful structures within the context of [[culture]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essential McLuhan|last=Mcluhan|first=Eric|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1995|isbn=0-465-01995-1|location=Concord, Ont. : Anansi|pages=7–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interchanging messages, stories, opinions, posts, and videos through channels on telecommunication pathways can cause miscommunication-- especially through different cultures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720608000153|title=Cultural diversity and information and communication technology impacts on global virtual teams|last=Shachaf|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.im.2007.12.003|volume=45|journal=Information &amp; Management|pages=131–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary analysts question the causes of changes in community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Often they speculate about whether or not the consequences of these changes could lead to some new sociological structure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Most of them have pointed out that the increased velocity of transactions has fostered international density, making [[social network]]s a catalyst for [[social change]].

Across the global village people have reached out and transcended their neighborhoods. They are involved in a complex community of networks stretching across cities, nations, oceans, and governments. Yet at the same time the increasing communications with friends on [[social media]] may also increase the density of interconnections within already existing social clusters. The global village's implications on sociological structures are yet to be fully realized.&lt;ref&gt;''The Network Community: An Introduction to Networks and Global Village'', By: Barry Wellman&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does multimedia have the ability to impact individuals differently for cultural reasons, but messages also affect people due to their religion, politics, beliefs, business, money etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The time in which messages are received also affects how a message is understood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Marshall McLuhan’s time, the global village was already apparent. It was already a comprehensive and seminal way to grasp what was happening to the world at large at any time (and correspondingly, what should be done with this in mind): "The global village absolutely ensures maximal disagreement on all points" (McLuhan: Hot &amp; Cool. New York: The New American Library, p.&amp;nbsp;272).

During the primitive years, people primarily stayed in tune with the simultaneous mode of their perception and thinking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Today human society struggles neurologically, with the simultaneous mode taking the upper hand once again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
Our brains are constantly adapting and morphing to the modifications of [[technological advancement]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through technology, the creation of social media allows people to constantly comment on each other's posts as well as creating them to share with the multi-media global world. 55% of teens possess a social media account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medialit.org/|title=Center for Media Literacy|website=www.medialit.org|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media has connected people with jobs that they couldn’t have received before because of their geographic location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediacritiques.net|title=Journal of Media Critiques [JMC]|website=www.mediacritiques.net|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; New social medias have connected the world so that users can learn more about cultures different from their own through interactions on social media as well as maintaining relationships from opposing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rebecca|first=Sawyer,|date=2011-01-01|title=The Impact of New Social Media on Intercultural Adaptation|url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/srhonorsprog/242/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global village and media ==
People use technology to fit into a [[digital community]] to which they aren't physically connected, but mentally connected. Each [[social media platform]] acts as a digital home for individuals, allowing people to express themselves through the global village.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A Review of General Semantics argues that media ecology and new media have expanded who has the ability to create and view media texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valcanis|first=Tom|date=|year=2011|title=An iPhone in Every Hand: Media Ecology, Communication Structures, and the Global Village|url=|journal=ETC: A Review of General Semantics|volume=68|pages=33–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since mass media began, it has called for the westernization of the world, hence the global village.  Without the mass media in effect countries like India or Turkey wouldn’t be living [[American way|American lifestyle]] because they wouldn’t have the knowledge of what the acquisitions of the American nation constitute. Since most of the developing countries acquired the news and entertainment from developed nations like the U.S, the information received is biased in favor of developed nations which connects the world in similarities within the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M|first=Kraidy, Marwan|date=2002-01-01|title=Globalization of Culture Through the Media|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/325/|journal=Encyclopedia of Communication and Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Internet, physical distance is even less of a hindrance to the real-time communicative activities of people. Social Spheres are greatly expanded by the openness of the web and the ease at which people can search for online communities and interact with others who share the same interests and concerns. According to McLuhan, the enhanced "electric speed in bringing all social and political functions together in a sudden implosion has heightened human awareness of responsibility to an intense degree." &lt;ref name="UnderstandingMedia"&gt;''Understanding Media'', McGraw Hill, 1964, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Increased speed of communication and the ability for people to read about, spread, and react to global news quickly, forces us to become more involved with others from various social groups and countries around the world and to be more aware of our global responsibilities.&lt;ref name="UnderstandingMedia" /&gt; Similarly, web-connected computers enable people to link their web sites together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Global theater==
No chapter in ''Understanding Media'', later books, contains the idea that the global village and the electronic media create unified communities. In an interview with Gerald Stearn,&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, Gerald Emmanuel. ''McLuhan: Hot &amp; Cool'' (1968), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan says that it never occurred to him that uniformity and tranquility were the properties of the global village. McLuhan argued that the global village ensures maximal disagreement on all points because it creates more discontinuity and division and [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] under the increase of the village conditions. The global village is far more diverse.
 
After the publication of ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan starts using the term ''global theater'' to emphasize the changeover from consumer to producer, from acquisition to involvement, from job holding to role playing, stressing that there is no more community to clothe the naked specialist.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall and Nevitt, Barrington. ''From Take Today: The Executive as Dropout'' (Harcourt Brace, 1972) p 265 and back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historical geography''' is the branch of [[geography]] that studies the ways in which geographic phenomena have changed over time. It is a synthesizing discipline which shares both topical and methodological similarities with [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[ecology]], [[geology]], [[environmental studies]], [[literary studies]], and other fields. Although the majority of work in historical geography is considered [[human geography]], the field also encompasses studies of geographic change which are not primarily [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]]. Historical geography is often a major component of school and university curricula in geography and [[social studies]]. Current research in historical geography is being performed by scholars in more than forty countries.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Richard, and Robert M Wilson. [https://ejournals.unm.edu/index.php/historicalgeography/article/view/3481/xhtml “What Futures for the Pillar of Geography? a Report on the 16th International Conference of Historical Geographers, London.”] ''Historical Geography'' 43 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Themes==
Historical geography seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved by understanding their interaction with their local environment and surroundings.

==Development of the discipline==
In its early days, historical geography was difficult to define as a subject. A textbook  from the 1950s cites a previous definition as an 'unsound attempt by geographers to explain history'.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell,J.B. Historical Geography (Hodder and Stoughton educational, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; Its author, J. B. Mitchell, came down firmly on the side of geography: 'the historical geographer is a geographer first last and all the time'. By 1975 the first number of the ''Journal of Historical Geography'' &lt;ref&gt;Journal of Historical Geography Volome 1, Number 1,1975&lt;/ref&gt; had widened the discipline to a broader church: 'the writings of scholars of any disciplinary provenance who have something to say about matters of geographical interest relating to past time'.

For some{{who?|date=March 2016}} in the United States of America, the term ''historical geography'' has a more specialized meaning: the name given by [[Carl O. Sauer|Carl Ortwin Sauer]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] to his program of reorganizing cultural geography (some say all geography) along regional lines, beginning in the first decades of the 20th century. To Sauer, a landscape and the cultures in it could only be understood if all of its influences through history were taken into account: physical, cultural, economic, political, environmental. Sauer stressed regional specialization as the only means of gaining sufficient expertise on regions of the world. Sauer's philosophy was the principal shaper of American geographic thought in the mid-20th century. Regional specialists remain in academic geography departments to this day. Despite this, some geographers feel that it harmed the discipline; that too much effort was spent on data collection and classification, and too little on analysis and explanation. Studies became more and more area-specific as later geographers struggled to find places to make names for themselves. These factors may have led in turn to the [[Quantitative revolution#The 1950s Crisis in Geography|1950s crisis in geography]], which raised serious questions about geography as an academic discipline in the USA.

This sub-branch of [[human geography]] is closely related to [[history]], [[environmental history]], and [[historical ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Balée, William (2006): The Research Program of Historical Ecology. In Annual Review of Anthropology 35 (1), pp. 75–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Home economics''', '''domestic science''' or '''home science''' is a field of study&lt;ref&gt;[[International Federation for Home Economics]] (IFHE): Position Statement in: ''International Journal of Home Economics''; Volume 1, Issue 1, available [http://www.ifhe.org here]&lt;/ref&gt; that deals with the relationship between individuals, families, communities, and the environment in which they live.

==Name==
Family and consumer science was previously known in the United States as home economics, often abbreviated "home ec" or "HE". In 1994, various organizations, including the [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences]], adopted the new term "family and consumer science" to reflect the fact that the field covers aspects outside of home life and wellness.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aafcs.org/AboutUs/FAQ.asp#10|publisher=American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences|title=FAQ|accessdate=2015-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111213950/http://www.aafcs.org/AboutUs/FAQ.asp#10|archive-date=2015-01-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is also known by other names, including human sciences, home science, and domestic economy. In addition, home economics has a strong historic relationship to the field of [[human ecology]], and since the 1960s a number of university-level home economics programs have been renamed "[[human ecology]]" programs, including [[Cornell University College of Human Ecology|Cornell University's program]].&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the Change to Human Ecology?|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/homeEc/cases/namechange.html|publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Catharine Beecher.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Catharine Beecher, American educator]]
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Ellen Richards, photograph ca. 1864]]

One of the first to champion the economics of running a home was [[Catherine Beecher]], sister to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].  Catherine and Harriet both were leaders in mid-19th century North America in talking about domestic science.  They came from a very religious family that valued education especially for women.

The [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 propelled domestic science further ahead as land grant colleges sought to educate farm wives in running their households as their husbands were being educated in agricultural methods and processes. [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[Illinois]], [[Minnesota]] and [[Michigan]] were early leaders offering programs for women.  There were women graduates of these institutions several years before the [[Lake Placid Conferences]] which gave birth to the home economics movement.

The home economics movement started with [[Ellen Swallow Richards]], who was the first woman to attend [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and later became the first female instructor.  Through her [[chemistry]] research, she became an expert in water quality and later began to focus on applying scientific principles to domestic situations.  At the [[1893 Chicago World's Fair|Chicago World’s Fair]] in 1893, she designed the Rumford Kitchen, which was a tiny kitchen that served nutritious meals to thousands of fair goers, along with a healthy dose of nutrition education.  She shunned an invitation to participate in the Women’s Building as she said none of her research was just women’s work, but rather information for all.

[[Image:Home Economics 1911.jpg|thumb|250px|A home economics class in 1911 in [[Toronto]]]]
Late in the 19th century, Richards convened a group of contemporaries to discuss the essence of domestic science and how the elements of this discipline would ultimately improve the quality of life for many individuals and families. They met at pristine Lake Placid, New York at the invitation of [[Melvil Dewey]].  Over the course of the next 10 years, these educators worked tirelessly to elevate the discipline, which was to become home economics, to a legitimate profession.  Richards wanted to call this [[oekology]] or the science of right living. [[Euthenics]], the science of controllable environment, was also a name of her choice, but "home economics" was ultimately chosen as the official term in 1899.&lt;ref name=aafcs&gt;{{cite web|title=AAFCS Brand Story|url=http://www.aafcs.org/res/branding/AAFCS_Brand_Story.pdf|publisher=American Association of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences|accessdate=20 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908184750/http://www.aafcs.org/res/branding/AAFCS_Brand_Story.pdf|archive-date=8 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards then founded the American Home Economics Association (now called the [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences]]) in 1909.&lt;ref name=aafcs/&gt;

In the 1910s the AHEA won passage of two crucial pieces of legislation that allowed home economists to establish formal niches for research and teaching within institutions of higher education.  The [[Smith-Lever Act]] of 1914 and the [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 provided funding to expand demonstration work in rural communities and to develop and teach a home economics curriculum on the campuses of most state land-grant colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 36.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation contributed to the creation of the Office of Home Economics, which grew into the [[Bureau of Home Economics]], at the [[US Department of Agriculture]] during the early 20th century.

Home economics emerged at the turn of the twentieth century as a movement to train women to be more efficient household managers.  At the same moment, American families began to consume many more goods and services than they produced.  To guide women in this transition, professional home economics had two major goals:  to teach women to assume their new roles as modern consumers and to communicate homemakers’ needs to manufacturers and political leaders.  The development of the profession progressed from its origins as an educational movement to its identity as a source of consumer expertise in the interwar period to its virtual disappearance by the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Dust jacket.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional goal of the field was to “rationalize housework”, or lend the social status of a profession to it, based on a theory that housework could be intellectually fulfilling to women engaged in it, along with any emotional or relational benefits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elias|first=Megan|date=January 2006|title="Model Mamas": The Domestic Partnership of Home Economics Pioneers Flora Rose and Martha Van Rensselaer|jstor=4617244|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=15 |issue=1|pages=65–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, home economics classes were intended to ready young women for their duties in the home in healthy environments. Classes were first offered in the United States, Canada, Germany and Great Britain, followed by Latin America, Asia, and Africa. International organizations such as those associated with the [[United Nations]] have been involved in starting home economics programs around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Robert, Editor-in-Chief, et al. 1971. ''Funk  &amp; Wagnall’s New Encyclopedia''. New York: Funk &amp; Wagnall’s, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 1940s [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]] (later University) was the only program granting a master of science in household equipment. However, this program was centered on the ideals that women should acquire practical skills but also a scientifically based understanding of how technology in the household works. For example, women were required to disassemble and then reassemble kitchen machinery so they could understand basic operations as well as repair the equipment. In doing so, Iowa State effectively created culturally acceptable forms of physics and engineering for women in an era when these pursuits were not generally accessible to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bix|first1=Amy Sue|title=Gendered Technical Training and Consumerism in Home Economics, 1920-1980|journal=Technology and Culture|date=October 2002|volume=43|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Home Economics class receiving instructions on cooking. Ottawa, Ontario, 1959.jpg|thumb|A Home Economics class receiving instruction in cooking, Ottawa, Ontario, 1959.]]

Home economists … found a receptive audience among many of its young female members who expressed interest in learning about how to improve their homes, spend their leisure time, and make decisions about what to buy, what to make at home, and even what books to read.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 13.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Though men’s participation in Home Economics programs was encouraged it was not actively recruited, and in future courses at universities such as Cornell, men’s roles became entrenched in such courses as hotel management in the hospitality industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A Standards Committee’s proposal in 1924 changed the AHEA constitution allowing for a special voting membership section clearing the way for HEIB (Home Economists in Business) section.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 150.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest group of HEIB members worked for food companies such as Washburn Crosby (later General Mills), Kellogg’s, ..or trade associations charged with promoting particular foods such as the Institute of American Meat Packers and the National Dairy Council.  [Some] worked as journalists for women’s magazines such as.. the Ladies’ Home Journal.  [Others] worked for utility companies.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 149.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The function that home economists have been performing for more than a century remains key to our experiences as consumers, but the professional identity has disappeared.  Indeed, efforts to reposition the discipline ultimately led to its renaming in the late twentieth century.  In 1994, “home economics” was replaced by “family and consumer science.”…This renaming signaled a formal break from the field’s association with domesticity, highlighting instead issues of “family” and “consumption.”&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.  Page 295.  Creating Consumers:  Home Economists in Twentieth-Century America.  Chapel Hill:  The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new actor that rose to prominence in the 1980s was the charismatic celebrity unaligned with home economists or any other professional group. [[Martha Stewart]] and her fellow “domestic celebrities,” in television programs, books, magazines, and websites, attest to the continued importance of independent experts and commercial mass-media organizations in facilitating technological and cultural change in consumer products and services industries.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.

To a great degree, Americans today tap into values once enshrined in a home economics curriculum to express a national identity and assert a standard of living that is distinct not only from Developing Nations but also from the cultures of other Industrialized Nations....  Even as luxury consumption exerts a cultural pull for many, middle-class culture still celebrates consumers who make sensible, controlled choices in the marketplace, resisting pure pleasure, impulse purchases, and cheap or shoddy goods.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Carolyn M., 2012.

===Practice homes in American colleges===
Practice homes were added to American universities in the early 1900’s in order to model a living situation, although the all-women ‘team’ model used for students was different from prevailing expectations of housewives. For example, women were graded on collaboration, while households at the time assumed that women would be working independently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nevertheless, the practice homes were valued. These practicum courses took place in a variety of environments including single-family homes, apartments, and student dorm-style blocks. For a duration of a number of weeks, students lived together while taking on different roles and responsibilities, such as cooking, cleaning, interior decoration, hosting, and budgeting. Some classes also involved caring for young infants, temporarily adopted from orphanages. Childcare practicums were often included at the same time as other classwork, requiring students to configure their intellectual and home lives as compatible with one another. According to Megan Elias, “in the ideal, domestic work was as important as work done outside the home and it was performed by teams of equals who rotated roles. Each member of the team was able to live a life outside the home as well as inside the home, ideally, one that both informed her domestic work and was informed by it. This balance between home and the wider world was basic to the movement”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===American university departments===
Departments were set up in a number of American universities.  For example [[Brigham Young University]] had a department from 1920-1950.&lt;ref&gt;https://byuorg.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Brigham_Young_University._Dept._of_Home_Economics_(1930-1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

FCS is taught worldwide, as an elective or a required course in [[secondary education]], and in many tertiary and [[continuing education]] institutions. Sometimes it is also taught in [[primary education]].  International cooperation in the field is coordinated by the [[International Federation for Home Economics]], established in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifhe.org/34.html|title=About IFHE|accessdate=2015-01-11|publisher=International Federation for Home Economics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207025618/http://www.ifhe.org/34.html|archive-date=2014-12-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1880 and 1900, the [[Reifenstein schools]] concept was initiated by Ida von Kortzfleisch, a Prussian noble woman and early German feminist. Reifenstein refers to Reifenstein im Eichsfeld, a municipality in Thuringia and site of the first permanent school. Reifensteiner Verband comprised from 1897 till 1990 about 15 own schools and cooperated with further operators. About 40 wirtschaftliche Frauenschulen, rural economist women schools were connected to the Reifensteiner concept and movement and allowed higher education for women already in the German Kaiserreich.&lt;ref&gt;Ortrud Wörner-Heil: Adelige Frauen als Pionierinnen der Berufsbildung: die ländliche Hauswirtschaft und der Reifensteiner Verband kassel university press GmbH, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1913 doctorate of Johannes Kramer compared different concepts of home economic education worldwide and praised the system e.g. in Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kramer: Das ländlich-hauswirtschaftliche Bildungswesen in Deutschland, University of Erlangen doctorate, Fulda 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In South Korea, the field is most commonly known as "family studies" or "family science" (가정과학, gajeong-gwahak). The field began in schools taught by Western missionaries in the late 19th century.  The first college-level department of family science was established at [[Ewha Womans University]] in [[Seoul]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1EizWo6iIn4C&amp;pg=PA5|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|title=가정과학대학 70년사 (Gajeonggwahakdaehak 70-nyeonsa / 70 Years of the College of Family Science)|year=1999|isbn=9788973003839|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 2012 there were only 3.5 million students enrolled in FCS secondary programs, a decrease of 38 percent over a decade.

===Home science in India===
Many Education boards in [[India]] such as [[National Institute of Open Schooling|NIOS]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nios.ac.in/currisylhs-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]], [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|ICSE]],&lt;ref&gt;http://cbse.nic.in/examin~1/scheme06ex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[CISCE]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisce.org/data/.../27.%20Home%20Science.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and various state boards offer home science as a subject in their courses.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[UK]], Home Economics was once a [[GCSE]] qualification offered to secondary school pupils, but has since been replaced with a course entitled Food and Nutrition which focuses more on the nutritional side of food to economics.

In [[Scotland]], Home Economics was replaced by Hospitality: Practical Cooking at National 3,4 and 5 level and Health and Food Technology at National 3, 4, 5, Higher and Advanced Higher. The awarding body is the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority|SQA]].

Situated in the human sciences, home economics draws from a range of disciplines to achieve optimal and sustainable living for individuals, families, and [[communities]]. Historically, home economics has been in the context of the [[home]] and [[household]], but this has extended in the 21st century to include the wider living environments as we better understand that the capacities, choices, and priorities of individuals and families impact at all levels, ranging from the household to the local and the global community. Home economists are concerned with promoting and protecting the well-being of individuals, families, and communities; they facilitate the development of attributes for lifelong learning for paid, unpaid, and [[Volunteering|voluntary]] work. Home economics professionals are advocates for individuals, families, and communities.

The content of home economics comes from the synthesis of multiple disciplines. This [[interdisciplinary]] knowledge is essential because the phenomena and challenges of everyday life are not typically one-dimensional. The content of home economics courses vary, but may include: [[food]], [[nutrition]], and [[health]]; personal finance; family resource management and planning; [[textile]]s and [[clothing]]; [[wikt:shelter|shelter]] and housing; [[consumerism]] and [[consumer science]]; household management; design and technology; food science and [[hospitality]]; [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and family studies; communication and extension [[education]] and [[community services]], among others. The capacity to draw from such disciplinary diversity is a strength of the profession, allowing for the development of specific interpretations of the field, as relevant to the context.

===Cleaning===
Home cleaning tasks can be separated into four categories: litter removal, storage of belongings, dusting, and washing of surfaces. Washing of surfaces is the most dangerous and complicated part because of the cleaning solutions. For example, hard water deposits are cleaned with acid solutions and grease is cleaned with alkaline solutions; they can both harm the skin and are reactive toward each other, potentially producing unwanted by-products. Mixing together chlorine bleach and strong acids (e.g. limescale remover containing HCl) forms chlorine gas, which is toxic. Solvents such as [[paint thinner]] and [[rubbing alcohol]] are toxic and flammable. Some disinfectants are toxic. Even dish water can require rubber gloves.

==Professional associations==
The [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences|AAFCS (American Association of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences)]] represents teachers, educators, cooperatives, business, designers and nutritionists.The American Association of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences (AAFCS) is the only national forum where K-12 teachers, university educators, and corporate executives collaborate to improve the quality of individual and family life.

The [[Association for Career and Technical Education]] (ACTE) is the largest American national education association dedicated to the advancement of education that prepared youth and adults for successful careers.  ACTE's core purpose is to provide leadership in developing an educated, prepared, and competitive workforce.  The ACTE division of Family and Consumer Sciences Education includes three sections (1) NATFACS - National Association Teachers of Family and Consumer Sciences (2) NATEFACS - National Association Teacher Educators of Family andy Consumer Sciences, andy (3) NASAFACS - National Association State Administrators of Family and Consumer Sciences.

The [[National Council on Family Relations]], (NCFR) founded in 1938, is the oldest multidisciplinary, nonpartisan professional organization focused solely on family research, practice and education. They claim to be the premier professional association for the multidisciplinary understanding of families. The members’ interests—as diverse as their careers and backgrounds—are focused on topics and efforts that yield a common benefit: …understanding and strengthening families. NCFR members are professionals dedicated to understanding and strengthening families. The 3,400-plus members come from more than 35 countries and all 50 U.S. states, and include: researchers, demographers, marriage and family therapists, parent/family educators, university faculty, students, social workers, public health workers, extension specialists and faculty, ECFE teachers, clergy, counselors, K-12 teachers, and more.

'''''Hypotheses non fingo''''' ([[Latin]] for "I feign no hypotheses", "I frame no [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]", or "I contrive no hypotheses") is a famous phrase used by [[Isaac Newton]] in an essay, "[[General Scholium]]", which was appended to the second (1713) edition of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''.

Here is a modern translation (published 1999) of the passage containing this famous remark:
{{quote|I have not as yet been able to discover the reason for these properties of gravity from phenomena, and I do not feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton]] (1726). ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', General Scholium. Third edition, page 943 of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] and Anne Whitman's 1999 translation, [[University of California Press]]  {{ISBN|0-520-08817-4}}, 974 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The nineteenth century philosopher of science, [[William Whewell]], qualified this statement, as, he said, "it was by such a use of hypotheses, that both Newton himself and [[Kepler]], on whose discoveries those of Newton were based, made their discoveries". Whewell stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;What is requisite is, that the hypotheses should be close to the facts, and not connected with them by other arbitrary and untried facts; and that the philosopher should be ready to resign it as soon as the facts refuse to confirm it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences|first=William|last=Whewell|date=1840|publisher=London|page=438|url=https://archive.org/stream/philosophyinduc00whewgoog#page/n450/mode/2up}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18649">'''Information manipulation theory''' ('''IMT''') (McCornack 1992) &amp; (McCornack et al. 1992) is a way of looking at interpersonal communication. It deals with the way a  sender might assemble information packages (in the form of messages) to a receiver in order to give an impression that is false from the perspective of the sender. The sender chooses certain facts in the message from an available amount of information—but omits, alters, or falsifies others. The act of trying to get someone to believe something untrue is ''deceit''. The type of communication created by such deceitful intent is called a deceptive message. The senders management of given information to provide a receiver with a false perception of that same information is called ''information manipulation''. Departing from the focus on the communication mode found in [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] (IDT), IMT is more concerned with the content of the deceptive messages, the situational contexts that bring them about, the degree to which the detection of such a message affects perception of deception and the relational consequences associated with deceptive messages.

==History and central themes==

Information manipulation theory (IMT) was formulated by Steven A. McCornack while an assistant professor and a Lilly Endowment Teaching Fellow at Michigan State University. In 1992, McCornack published two articles that are recognized as the seminal works in information manipulation theory.  In his first article, McCornack lays out the basic foundation of this theoretical option for examining the phenomenon of creating and relaying deceptive messages. As stated, IMT “suggests that deceptive messages function deceptively because they violate the principles that govern conversational exchanges” (McCornack 1992). The second article (McCornack et al. 1992) provided an empirical test of the theory.

Timothy Levine (PhD, Michigan State University, 1992) was present for the first empirical test for information manipulation theory, has been a significant contributor to the development of IMT, and is a leader in developing new paradigms for [[deception]] detection research. IMT provided impetus to the development of a message-based theory of deception detection that calls into question psychophysical and emotion-based theories of deception detection as well as the interaction-based IDT.

==Operational context==

Information manipulation theory, not unlike [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] (IDT) is a subset and functional manifestation of interpersonal communication. According to David Buller and Judee Burgoon, “Deception is conceptualized as a form of information management, something that is fundamental to human communication (Buller &amp; Burgoon 1998).”  IMT is concerned with the way that relational goals and situational pressures influence the interpersonal communication process, and ultimately leads to the formation and implementation of deceptive verbal messages.

==Conceptual foundation==

Prior to the introduction of information manipulation theory as a potential way to observe the phenomenon of verbally controlling information there was literature on the subject of information control and deception in general. McCornack cites Turner, Edgley and Olmstead (1975) and how they “noted several forms of information control in their study of conversations (e.g. “lies,” “exaggerations,” “half-truths,” “secrets,” and diversionary responses) (McCornack et al. 1992).”  Buller and Burgoon again draw upon Turner et al. when referring to deception as “a very common form of information management in human interaction (Buller and Burgoon 1998).” With the notion of deception already being established in circles of communication studies and behavioral science as a topic of discussion and analysis by the 1980s, we have the development of conceptual constructs regarding the topic. In 1984, Hopper and Bell introduce a typology of deceptive types using English terms. The types noted in McCornack’s work are listed as follows: unlies, playings, fiction, masks, lies, and crimes (McCornack et al. 1992). In another oft-cited work from the 1980s, we are given another typology. In 1986, Metts and Chronis proposed another four types and in 1989 Metts asserted that regardless of the differences in semantics, all the “taxonomies” to date reflected a similarity in the formulation of deceptive messages. Metts states “the observable variation in deceptive message design reflects “a continuum of covert to overt misrepresentation of information.” (McCornack et al., 1992) Finally, you have [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] (IDT) introduced in 1988 by David Buller and Judee Burgoon, which proposes that deception is a distinct communicative process that relies on interaction between the sender and receiver. IDT focuses on emotion both as a motivator and message in the process as well as the mechanical aspects of how that communication takes place (Buller and Burgoon 1998).

==Theoretical perspective==

Information manipulation theory departs from [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] in the substance of the focus of its studies.  Whereas Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT) spends more time studying the physiological challenges and channels of communication involved in the detection of deceptive messages, information manipulation theory is more involved with the content of the messages and why they are employed. This is a distinction that can be examined in terms of how these theories approach the divergence from communication norms. IDT is more involved with the physical and biological deviation of normal behavior exhibited in communication. IMT is more fixed on the departure from conversational standards. Both theories aimed at discovering more about the relational effect of discovering that an act of deception has taken place.

==Previous research==

Before the advent of information manipulation theory, researchers were not interested in the formulation or design of the deceptive message. Previous studies on deception were more concerned with the mode of communication because deception was thought to occur in typical human interactions in unnatural polarized ways. Additionally, use of recollection as a method generating “normal” cognitive examples of deception scenarios further led to this dichotomous perspective. Truth in communication was thought to be clear or unclear. Bavelas et al. (1990) speak to this issue (McCornack 1992). Deception was also viewed to have manifested as either one of two of things: a type or a strategy. McCornack sought to depart from that and present another argument for how deceptive messages might be analyzed. IMT recognizes deception as a unique mode of communication that departs from more traditional, rational communicative behavior. IMT is more directed at answering the question of how a sender might go about engaging in the development and dispensation of a deceptive message and what about that process makes it more or less deceptive (McCornack 1992).

==Theoretical framework==

Information manipulation theory proposes that in any given conversation there exists a set of basic, reasonable assumptions about how transmission of information occurs. This premise is based on the work of [[Paul Grice]]. Taken from his speeches in 1967 to writings in 1975 and 1989, Grice promoted notions regarding language usage that has come to be known as his theory of “conversational implicature” (CI) (McCornack 1992).
*''Conversational implicature''

Jacobs, Dawson and Brashers (1996) recount Grice stating “communication is made possible by communicators’ mutually orienting toward general principles of cooperation and rationality.” The vehicles that deliver CI are what Grice refers to as conversational maxims (CM).  CM can be used as dimensions to determine the degree of deceptiveness.

*''Conversational maxims''

These maxims are as follows:
# Quantity &amp;mdash; relates to expectations regarding the reasonable amount of information that should be provided in a given message
# Quality &amp;mdash; relates to expectations regarding the veracity (truthfulness) of information that is presented in a given message
# Relation &amp;mdash; relates to relevancy expectations regarding the constraints of the conversation established by earlier remarks
# Manner &amp;mdash; relates to expectations regarding the way something is said
(McCornack 1992)

*''Cooperative principle''

Grice posits that the resulting ‘norm’ that arises from adherence to CM is by virtue of what is called the Cooperative Principle (CP).

These maxims are only totally adhered to in what is called ‘a philosopher’s paradise’ but generally these maxims can be adhered to within a conversational context. Grice calls the obvious real world violation of a CM as “flouts”; when one CM opposes another, this is referred to as a “clash” (Jacobs et al. 1996).  In the case of the former this violation can happen “quietly.”
 
It is a major tenet of IMT that the subtle and covert nature of these violations of conversational norm assumptions is precisely what makes a message deceptive. A message can be identified in terms of its deceptiveness dependent on where it is measured according to the dimensions of the conversational maxims (McCornack 1992).

==Major experimental findings==

* The initial experiments regarding information manipulation theory confirmed that the degree to which a message can be determined to be deceptive can be coded and measured along the dimensions of its violations of CM. The deception by the receiver is experienced when the CP understood to occur is not adhered to by the sender. This experiment also questioned the relative social ‘competence’ of full disclosure of available information compared to social goal or consequences (McCornack et al. 1992).
* The second set of experiments measure the effect of the dimensions compared to each other. It was discovered some violations were considered “more deceptive” than others. Another discovery was that the nature of the relationship has an effect on the relative social ‘competence’ of full disclosure. In regard to romantic relationships, full disclosure is more ‘competent’ because relational honesty was considered paramount (McCornack 1992).
* Another significant experiment was performed to see if the results of McCornack’s theory could be generalized outside of Western cultures. This was examined through the lens of the individualist vs. collectivist debate. These two cultural poles are regarded as the most overarching themes of cultural identity and perspective. With the U.S. regarded as being representative of the Individualist perspective, Hong Kong was chosen to represent the Collectivist perspective. The dimensions of quality and relevance were regarded as deceptive, but not the other dimensions.  This experiment concluded that what is seen as '''truthful'', what violations are acceptable, the motivation for those violations and what is understood to be a conversational maxim is dependent on cultural identity (Yeung, Levine, &amp; Nishiyama 1999).
* Another experiment performed by L. Zhou and S. Lutterbie followed the work of the aforementioned tests of IMT. This experiment concluded that the best way to apply the principles of IMT across cultures is to take a multi-directional, multi-prong approach. This subject of normative actions in conversation should be approached with a top-down and bottom-up approach (Zhou &amp; Lutterbie 2005).

==Influential factors==

*''Cultural concept''

IMT as it is applied in cultural contexts varies. When evaluating Western culture it was discovered that all methods of manipulation were viewed as deceptive with manipulation of quality rated as most deceptive.  Conversely, IMT participants in Hong Kong only rated statements involved with quality and/or relevance as more manipulative and deceptive (Zhou &amp; Lutterbie 2005).  Both researchers agree that the Bottom-Up approach is an effective method for examining general patterns of deception across cultures while the Top-Down approach can account for situational variations to explain deceptive behavior patterns in order to create an applicable cross-cultural IMT model.

*''Moral judgment''

Research suggests young children's view of how information is perceived as deceptive varies as children grow older.  This variation in moral judgment suggests that moral development is critical in perceptions of right or wrong.  As individuals experience a series of (moral) developmental stages such as avoiding punishment, gaining rewards, identifying individual duty role in society to meet expectations of others (Zhou &amp; Lutterbie 2005), different behavior modeling criteria is established through communication situations that cognitively stimulates and challenges moral judgment. These stages, frequency and types of development models are theorized to be more or less universal across cultures.  However, moral judgment in IMT should be reserved for other communication theory that more distinctly addresses broad, generic cultural criteria patterns and specific requirements of societies to establish what does or does not covertly violate global conversational maxims.
 
*''Consequence resulting from the deceptive message''

IMT supports the idea that deception may or may not be detectable. When participants are asked to rate message features like how much information was false, omitted, equivocal and/or irrelevant, researchers can reasonably measure and describe such multidimensional deceptive messages.  However, the measurability results and conceptual meaning of degrees of deception and its impact is unclear (Levine, Asada &amp; Lindsey 2003).  Information that is manipulated on a continuum from trivial deception to important deception can range from socially acceptable to morally reprehensible.  The more severe lies are rated, the more deceptive the lies than inconsequential ones. Deceiving others about important information is more likely to result in adverse moral judgment and/or moral condemnation.

==Criticism of IMT==

The most significant criticism of information manipulation theory has come in the form of the following two arguments:

* IMT does not correctly interpret the  writings of [[Paul Grice]]'s notion of Conversational Implicature, Conversational Maxims or Cooperation Principle.  This issue was addressed in a critical rejoinder by McCornack et al. (1996).  IMT provides an explanation for the multiple ways deception can occur. However, it does not predict what conversational maxims a person may violate—only that the violation will occur within the certain realm of possibilities or scenarios provided.  IMT predicts and analyzes the methods of deception a person uses by determining what information is eliminated.
* IMT testing predictions can be made more accurate by use of a different set of information dimensions.  This issue was also addressed in the critical rejoinder by McCornack et al. (1996).  IMT is a value conscious communication theory.  The researcher must judge and develop criteria for what may be considered deceptiveness.  While violations of the maxim of quality and quantity are more or less objectively derived, violations of relation and manner are largely subjectively assessed. For this reason the researcher must be aware of his/her own bias, value and belief systems and incorporate these predispositions when making these judgments.  Researchers must also construct sound, qualitative/quantitative evaluative criteria to optimize and legitimize the integrity and credibility of their work.

The '''Kinetic PreProcessor''' (KPP) is an [[open-source software]] tool used in [[atmospheric chemistry]]. Taking a set of chemical reactions and their rate coefficients as input, KPP generates [[Fortran#Fortran 90|Fortran 90]], [[Fortran#FORTRAN 77|FORTRAN 77]], [[C (programming language)|C]], or [[Matlab]] code 
of the resulting [[Numerical ordinary differential equations|ordinary differential equations (ODEs)]]. Solving the ODEs allows the temporal integration of the kinetic system. Efficiency is obtained by exploiting the sparsity structures of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] and of the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]]. A comprehensive suite of stiff numerical integrators is also provided. Moreover, KPP can be used to generate the tangent linear model, as well as the continuous and discrete adjoint models of the chemical system.

{{Anthropology of kinship|terms}}
{{Anthropology}}

'''Kinship terminology''' is the system used in [[language]]s to refer to the persons to whom an individual is related through [[kinship]]. Different societies classify kinship relations differently and therefore use different systems of kinship terminology; for example, some languages distinguish between [[consanguine]] and [[Affinal kin|affinal]] uncles (i.e. the brothers of one's parents and the husbands of the sisters of one's parents, respectively), whereas others have only one word to refer to both a father and his brothers. Kinship terminologies include the terms of address used in different languages or communities for different relatives and the terms of reference used to identify the relationship of these relatives to ego or to each other.

==Historical view==
[[Anthropologist]] [[Lewis H. Morgan|Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881) performed the first survey of kinship terminologies in use around the world. Though much of his work is now considered dated, he argued that [[kinship]] terminologies reflect different sets of distinctions. For example, most kinship terminologies distinguish between sexes (the difference between a brother and a sister) and between generations (the difference between a child and a parent). Moreover, he argued, kinship terminologies distinguish between relatives by blood and [[marriage]] (although recently some anthropologists have argued that many societies define kinship in terms other than blood).

However, Morgan also observed that different languages (and, by extension, societies) organize these distinctions differently. He proposed to describe kinship terms and terminologies as either descriptive or [[Classificatory kinship|classificatory]]. When a descriptive term is used, it can only represent one type of relationship between two people, while a classificatory term represents one of many different types of relationships. For example, the word ''[[brother]]'' in English-speaking societies indicates a son of the same parent; thus, English-speaking societies use the word ''brother'' as a descriptive term.  A person's male first cousin could be the mother's brother's son, mother's sister's son, father's brother's son, father's sister's son, and so on; English-speaking societies therefore use the word ''cousin'' as a classificatory term.

Morgan discovered that a descriptive term in one society can become a classificatory term in another society.  For example, in some societies, one would refer to many different people as "mother" (the woman who gave birth to oneself, as well as her sister and husband's sister, and also one's father's sister). Moreover, some societies do not group together relatives which the English-speaking societies classify together. For example, some languages have no one-word equivalent to ''cousin'', because different terms refer to one's mother's sister's children and to one's father's sister's children.

Armed with these different terms, Morgan identified six basic patterns of kinship terminologies:

*[[Hawaiian kinship]]: the most classificatory; only distinguishes between sex and generation.  Thus, siblings and cousins are not distinguished (the same terms are used for both types of relatives).
*[[Sudanese kinship]]: the most descriptive; no two types of relatives share the same term.  Siblings are distinguished from cousins, and different terms are used for each type of cousin (i.e. father's brother's children, father's sister's children, mother's sister's children and mother's brother's children).
*[[Eskimo kinship]]: has both classificatory and descriptive terms; in addition to sex and generation, it also distinguishes between lineal relatives (those related directly by a line of descent) and collateral relatives (those related by blood, but not directly in the line of descent). Lineal relatives have highly descriptive terms; collateral relatives have highly classificatory terms.  Thus, siblings are distinguished from cousins, while all types of cousins are grouped together.  The system of English-language kinship terms falls into the Eskimo type.
*[[Iroquois kinship]]: has both classificatory and descriptive terms; in addition to sex and generation, it also distinguishes between siblings of opposite sexes in the parental generation. A genealogical relationship traced through a pair of siblings of the same sex is classed as a blood relationship, but one traced though a pair of siblings of the opposite sex can be considered an in-law relationship. In other words, siblings are grouped together with [[parallel cousin]]s, while separate terms are used for [[cross-cousin]]s.  Also, one calls one's mother's sister "mother" and one's father's brother "father".  However, one refers to one's mother's brother and one's father's sister by separate terms (often the terms for ''father-in-law'' and ''mother-in-law'', since cross-cousins can be preferential marriage partners).
*[[Crow kinship]]: like Iroquois, but further distinguishes between one's mother's side and one's father's side. Relatives on the mother's side of the family have more descriptive terms, and relatives on the father's side have more classificatory terms.  Thus, Crow kinship is like Iroquois kinship, with the addition that a number of relatives belonging to one's father's matrilineage are grouped together, ignoring generational differences, so that the same term is used for both one's father's sister and one's father's sister's daughter, etc.
*[[Omaha kinship]]: like Iroquois, but further distinguishes between one's mother's side and one's father's side. Relatives on the mother's side of the family have more classificatory terms, and relatives on the father's side have more descriptive terms.  Thus, Omaha kinship is like Iroquois, with the addition that a number of relatives belonging to one's mother's patrilineage are grouped together, ignoring generational differences, so that the same term is used for both one's mother's brother and one's mother's brother's son, etc.

The basic principles of Crow and Omaha terminologies are symmetrical and opposite, with Crow systems having a matrilineal emphasis and Omaha systems a patrilineal emphasis.

==Relative age==
Some languages, such as [[Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (see [[Chinese kinship]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], Cambodian, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Nepali language|Nepalese,]] and [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] add another dimension to some relations: relative age. Rather than one term for "brother", there exist, for example, different words for "older brother" and "younger brother". In Tamil, an older male sibling is referred to as ''Annan'' and a younger male sibling as ''Thambi'', whereas older and younger female siblings are called ''Akka'' and ''Thangai'' respectively.

==Identification of alternating generations==
Other languages, such as [[Chiricahua language|Chiricahua]], use the same terms of address for alternating generations. So a Chiricahua child (male or female) calls their paternal grandmother ''-ch’iné'', and likewise this grandmother will call her son's child ''-ch’iné''. Similar features are seen also in [[Huichol language|Huichol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Myerhoff|first=Barbara G.|year=1974|title=Peyote Hunt: The Sacred Journey of the Huichol Indians|location=Ithaca|publisher=Cornell, University Press|page=66|isbn=&lt;!--0-8014-9137-1--&gt;|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Stacy and Peter T.

Terms that recognize alternating generations and the prohibition of marriage within one's own set of alternate generation relatives (0, ±2, ±4, etc.) are common in [[Australian Aboriginal kinship]].

The relative age and alternating-generations systems are combined in some languages.  For instance,
[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] borrows the relative age system of the [[Chinese kinship]] and follows the generation system of kinship. [[Philippine Kinship|Philippine kinship]] distinguishes between generation, age and in some cases, gender.

Floyd Lounsbury described&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = 351–393 | editors = Ward H.

The basic idea is that of applying an even/odd distinction to relatives that takes into account the gender of every linking relative for ego’s kin relation to any given person. A MFBD(C), for example, is a mother’s father’s brother’s daughter’s child. If each female link (M,D) is assigned a 0 and each male (F,B) a 1, the number of 1s is either even or odd; in this case, even. However, variant criteria exist.&lt;!-- which, ideally, would be detailed here. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In a Dravidian or Tamil system with a patrilineal [[modular arithmetic|modulo]]-2 counting system, marriage is prohibited with this relative, and a marriageable relative must be modulo-2 odd. There exists also a version of this logic with a matrilineal bias. Discoveries of systems that use modulo-2 logic, as in South Asia, Australia, and many other parts of the world, marked a major advance in the understanding of kinship terminologies that differ from kin relations and terminologies employed by Europeans.

The Dravidian or Tamil kinship system involves selective cousinhood. One's father's brother's children and one's mother's sister's children are ''not'' cousins but brothers and sisters one step removed. They are considered ''consanguineous'' (''pangali'' in Tamil), and marriage with them is strictly forbidden as incestuous. However, one's father's sister's children and one's mother's brother's children are considered cousins and potential mates (''muraicherugu'' in Tamil). Marriages between such cousins are allowed and encouraged. There is a clear distinction between [[cross cousin|cross cousins,]] who are one's true cousins and [[parallel cousin|parallel cousins,]] who are, in fact, siblings. Like Iroquois people, Dravidians use the same words to refer to their father's sister and mother-in-law (''atthai'' in Tamil &amp; ''atthe'' in Kannada) and their mother's brother and father-in-law ( Maamaa in Tamil &amp;''maava'' in Kannada). In Kannada, ''sodara'' is added before ''atthe'' and ''maava'' to specifically refer to father's sister and mother's brother respectively, although it is not used in direct address where as in Tamil only mother''s brother is captioned with "Thaai" before "maamaa" to specify it as mother''s brother (he is respected with high regards in their customs).

==Abbreviations for genealogical relationships==
The genealogical terminology used in many genealogical charts describes relatives of the subject in question. Using the abbreviations below, genealogical relationships may be distinguished by single or compound relationships, such as BC for a brother's children, MBD for a mother's brother's daughter, and so forth.

*B = Brother 
*C = Child(ren) 
*D = Daughter 
*F = Father 
*GC = Grandchild(ren) 
*GP = Grandparent(s) 
*H = Husband 
*LA = In-law 
*M = Mother 
*P = Parent 
*S = Son 
*SI = Siblings
*SP = Spouse 
*W = Wife 
*Z = Sister 
*(m.s.) = male speaking 
*(f.s.) = female speaking

'''Learning to read''' is the acquisition and practice of the skills necessary to understand the meaning behind printed words. For a fairly good reader, the skill of reading often feels simple, effortless, and automatic;&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rayner|first=Keith|year=2001|title=How psychological science informs the teaching of reading|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/pspi/pdf/pspi22.pdf|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|series=2|volume=2|pages=31–74|doi=10.1111/1529-1006.00004|author2=Barbara Foorman|author3=Charles A. Perfetti|author4=David Pesetsky|author5=Mark S. Seidenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the process of learning to read is complex and builds on cognitive, linguistic, and social skills developed from a very early age.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;

==Writing systems==
{{Main|Writing system}}

Usually, in order to understand a text, it is necessary to understand the spoken language associated with that text. In this way, writing systems are distinguished from many other symbolic communication systems.&lt;ref name="Daniels"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The World's Writing Systems]] |year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 0-19-507993-0|editor=Daniels, Peter T. |editor2=William Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, writing systems on the whole change more slowly than their spoken counterparts, and often preserve features and expressions which are no longer current in the spoken language. The great benefit of writing systems is their ability to maintain a persistent record of information expressed in a language, which can be retrieved independently of the initial act of formulation.&lt;ref name="Daniels"/&gt;

==Acquiring reading==
A child's ability to learn to read, known as [[reading readiness]], begins in infancy, as the child begins attending to the speech signals in their environment and begins producing spoken language.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=81–83 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children make some use of all the material that they are presented with, including every [[perception]], [[concept]] and [[word]] that they come in contact with; thus the environment in which a child develops affects the child's ability to learn to read.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; The amount of time that a child spends together with [[parents]] or other important caregivers while listening to them read is a good predictor of the level of reading that the child will attain later in life.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fields|first=Tiffany|title=Touch Therapy|year=2000|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=New York|isbn=0-443-05791-5|pages=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child sits with a caregiver, looking at pictures and listening to stories, they will slowly learn that all the different lines on each page make different symbols and then that together these symbols refer to words.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt;  Taking time to read to children is the most important precursor to a child's [[Training and development|development]] of reading.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; Preschool-aged children with limited exposure to books and reading in their home, including limited experience of being read to, are at risk of reading difficulties.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; For example, these children tend to have less exposure to literary phrases, such as "Once upon a time",&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; and have smaller vocabularies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Biemiller|first=Andrew|title=Canadian Language and Literacy Research Network|url=http://www.literacyencyclopedia.ca/pdfs/topic.php?topId=19|accessdate=20 November 2011|pages=10|format=pdf|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyersBotting2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myers|first1=L. |last2=Botting|first2=N. |title=Literacy in the mainstream inner-city school: Its relationship to spoken language|journal=Child Language Teaching and Therapy|volume=24 |issue=1|year=2008 |pages=95–114|issn=0265-6590 |doi=10.1177/0265659007084570}}&lt;/ref&gt; both factors that affect the ability to read by limiting comprehension of text. The environment in which a child lives may also impact their ability to acquire reading skills. Children who are regularly exposed to chronic environmental noise pollution, such as highway traffic noise, have been known to show decreased ability to discriminate between [[phonemes]] as well as lower reading scores on standardized tests.&lt;ref name="CohenGlass1973"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Sheldon|last2=Glass|first2=David C.|last3=Singer|first3=Jerome E.|title=Apartment noise, auditory discrimination, and reading ability in children|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=9 |issue=5|year=1973 |pages=407–422 |issn=0022-1031 |doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(73)80005-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the ideal process of what is called emergent or early literacy&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; begins in the relationship between hearing spoken language, seeing [[written language]] and feeling loved. The positive feeling that arises from spending time with books in a loving context provides a strong foundation and intrinsic [[motivation]] for the long and cognitively challenging process of learning to read.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; However, reading to children and ensuring exposure to many [[books]] is not enough to prepare them for reading.&lt;ref name="Wolf90"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=90 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another critical skill is the ability to name letters or characters.&lt;ref name="Wolf90"/&gt;

===Age to introduce literacy learning===
Some scholars favor a developmentally appropriate approach in which formal instruction on reading begins when children are about six or seven years old, while others favor limited amounts of literacy instruction at the age of four and five, in addition to non-academic, intellectually stimulating activities.&lt;ref name="vanKleeck2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Kleeck | first1 = A. | last2 = Schuele | first2 = C.

Some parents teach their children to read as babies. Babies learn to read differently and more easily than children who learn to read in school from formal instruction. The most important aspect of early (baby) reading is interaction with loving parents and bonding.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrased quote from Dr. Richard Gentry (Ph.D Reading Education). Online link: http://forum.brillkids.com/teaching-your-child-to-read/please-welcome-dr-richard-gentry-to-brillkids!-(interview-re-early-reading)/&lt;/ref&gt;

In a discussion on academic kindergartens, professor of child development [[David Elkind]] has argued that, since "there is no solid research demonstrating that early academic training is superior to (or worse than) the more traditional, hands-on model of early education", educators should defer to developmental approaches that provide young children with ample time and opportunity to explore the natural world on their own terms.&lt;ref name="Elkind"&gt;{{cite journal|first=David |last=Elkind |title=Much Too Early| journal= Education Next|year= 2001 |url=http://educationnext.org/much-too-early/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elkind emphasized the principle that "early education must start with the child, not with the subject matter to be taught."&lt;ref name="Elkind" /&gt;

The [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA 2007]] OECD data from 54 countries demonstrates "no association between school entry age ... and reading achievement at age 15".&lt;ref name="Suggate"&gt;Sebastian Suggate, "Watering the garden before a rainstorm: the case of early reading instruction" in ''Contemporary Debates in Childhood Education and Development'', ed. Sebastian Suggate, Elaine Reese. pp. 181–190.&lt;/ref&gt; A German study of 50 kindergartens compared children who, at age 5, had spent a year either "academically focused", or "play-arts focused" and found that in time the two groups became inseparable in reading skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Suggate | first1 = S. P. | last2 = Schaughency | first2 = E. A. | last3 = Reese | first3 = E. | title = Children learning to read later catch up to children reading earlier | doi = 10.1016/j.ecresq.2012.04.004 | journal = Early Childhood Research Quarterly | volume = 28 | pages = 33–48 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggate concludes that the effects of early reading are like "watering a garden before a rainstorm; the earlier watering is rendered undetectable by the rainstorm, the watering wastes precious water, and the watering detracts the gardener from other important preparatory groundwork."&lt;ref name=Suggate/&gt;

==Reading development==
{{tone|date=July 2012}}
There are five stages of reading development.  They are the emerging pre-reader, novice reader, decoding reader, fluent comprehending reader, and the expert reader. It is normal that children will move through these different stages at different rates.

===Emerging pre-reader===
The emerging pre-reader stage, also known as [[reading readiness]], happens when a young child sits and listens to someone read to them. Emerging reading takes many years of language experience, along with the increase of both conceptual and social development.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;  Showing that this process starts early in a child's life is the fact that children typically produce their first few words before their first birthday.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;  This emerging pre-reader stage usually lasts for the first five years of a child's life.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=115–139 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the emerging pre-reader stage children will often "read" books and stories. They will tell the story as they have memorized it and turn the pages appropriately. They call what they are doing "reading" since they typically don't yet understand that their parents or caregivers are decoding written words. To them, they are doing what they think their parents or caregivers are doing when reciting the story.

One group of researchers in the United States found in the late 1990s and 2000s that the traditional way of reading to children made little difference in their later ability to read, and hypothesized this was because children spend relatively little time actually looking at the text.  They found that simple exercises during reading which directed children to pay attention to and think about letters and words made a significant difference in early reading progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/05/29/153927743/small-change-in-reading-to-preschoolers-can-help-disadvantaged-kids-catch-up | title=Small Change In Reading To Preschoolers Can Help Disadvantaged Kids Catch Up|agency=NPR|author=Alix Spegel|date=2012-05-29|accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novice reader===
[[File:School in Laos - Reading time.jpg|thumb|Reading time at a primary school in rural Laos. Learning to read poses different challenges in Laos compared to English-speaking countries. The written language follows clear phonetic rules, so the mechanics of reading are easier than with English. However, children learn from a teacher with a blackboard, and get little or no opportunity to improve their reading skills by reading for pleasure. Most schools have no library and no books except textbooks; even fourth-grade students often cannot read a full sentence. The daily reading period shown here uses books provided by Big Brother Mouse, which promotes reading in Lao schools and villages.]]The next step in the learning to read process is the novice reading stage&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;  also known as selective association.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;  This begins with the child learning to decode print and understanding the meaning of what has been decoded.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; To do this, the child must first figure out the [[Alphabetic principle]] and master it in only a few years.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; Most children know that the words on a page in a [[book]] mean something, but do not readily understand how the letters code the meaning.  They know that these [[words]] are made of the sounds of their particular [[language]], and that letters convey these sounds.  Novice readers learn to hear and manipulate the smaller sounds into syllables and words.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; If a child is able to master this skill, called [[phonological awareness]], it is one of the best predictors of a child's success in learning to read.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; One way that you can teach children to become more aware of sounds within words is through such things as [[nursery rhymes]] that enhance the child's ability to hear and divide the structure of words.  Another way to teach a child to read is through little "games" in which the sounds in word are either clapped, written or danced to a beat.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; A novice reader will also memorize the most common letter patterns in their own language and most of the frequent words that will not necessarily follow the phonological rules such as in English the words "have" and "who".&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; It is in this stage that children will develop a vocabulary of words that is between 2,500 and 5,000 words.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; Children's vocabularies continue to grow as they enter elementary school, since they will continue to learn new words at a rate of about seven words per day.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; This shows that at this stage in reading the best piece of advice is to just practice, practice, practice or read, read more, and read again.

===Decoding reader===
The transition from the novice reader stage to the decoding stage is marked by the absence of painful [[pronunciation]]s and in its place the sounds of a smoother, more confident reader.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; In this phase of learning to read, the reader adds at least 3,000 words to what they can decode. For example, in the English language, that readers need to now learn the variations of the vowel-based [[rhyme]]s and [[vowel]] pairs. It is essential during this stage, if a reader is going to become fluent, the reader needs to acquire a sufficient repertoire of the letter-patterns and vowel-pairs that help to make up words that go beyond the basic level.The faster a child can see that the word "together" is "to-ge-ther", the faster the reader will become a more fluent reader.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;
As children move forward with their reading skills, they learn a great deal about what is really inside a [[word]]; the stem, roots, [[prefixes]] and [[suffixes]] that make up [[morphemes]] of the [[language]].&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;  By this stage, children already know about the common bound morphemes such as "s" and "ed" because these are attached to many words.  Decoding readers become exposed to many types of morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes, and it is when they learn to read these as "sight chunks" that their reading and their understanding will speed up dramatically. Being able to read at a fluent level is not only about how fast a child can read, but it is a matter of being able to utilize all the special knowledge that they have about a word—its letters, letter patterns, meanings, grammatical functions, roots, and endings—fast enough that they have time to think and comprehend what they are seeing.  The point of becoming a proficient reader is to fluently read and comprehend what had just been read. Decoding readers are just beginning to understand and learn how to use their expanding knowledge of language and their growing powers of inference to figure out what they are really reading.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;

In the beginning of the decoding stage a child will often be devoting so much mental capacity to the process of decoding that they will have no comprehension of the meaning of the words being read. This is most likely if the text being read is at or above their skill level. It is nevertheless an important stage. Such decoding practice allows the child to improve their decoding skills with the ultimate goal of becoming automatic as it is for most skilled readers with most text they encounter. Like every skill, the more you do it the better you get. Though comprehension may be poor at this stage, it is nevertheless an important step towards comprehension. As the skill of decoding improves and the more automatic it becomes the more the child has mental capacity to devote to comprehension. Therefore, understanding of what is being read increases.

It is also in the decoding phase that the child will learn to go beyond what is said in writing in the story to get the underlying meaning of what the story is really about. In the decoding stage a child also learns that if a sentence or paragraph is not understood, re-reading it a second or third time may be necessary in order to fully understand the passage.  Knowing when a text needs to be re-read is a very important skill and can improve comprehension greatly.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;

===Fluent, comprehending reader===
The next stage in reading development is the fluent, comprehending reader stage, in which children shift from learning to read, to reading to learn.  In this stage the reader builds up a substantial background of knowledge of spelling.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; It is during this time in a reader's development that teachers and parents can be tricked by fluent-sounding reading into thinking that a [[child]] understands everything that they are reading. As the content of what they are able to read  becomes more demanding, good readers will develop knowledge of [[figurative language]] and [[irony]] which helps them to discover new meanings in the text. This will assist them to understand the meaning of what they are reading beyond what is written on the page.  While learning to read, one of the most powerful moments is when fluent comprehending readers learn to enter into the lives of imagined heroes and heroines.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; Examples of books where these imagined heroes and heroines could be found in include [[Harry Potter]], [[Lord of the Rings]], [[Huckleberry Finn]].  The comprehension process grows while reading books like these, where children learn how to connect prior knowledge, predict good or bad consequences, draw inferences from every danger-filled corner, monitor gaps in their understanding, and interpret how each new clue, revelation, or added piece of knowledge changes what they know. In learning these new skills, they learn to unpeel the layers of meaning in a [[word]], a [[phrase]] or a [[thought]].&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;

There are two ways in which increasing fluency can be supported.  They include explicit instruction in comprehension by a child's teacher and the child's own desire to read. Engaging in conversation about what they are reading allows the beginning reader to ask critical [[questions]], facilitating a better understanding of the central meaning.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;

At the end of this stage, before the reader becomes an expert reader, many processes are starting to become automatic. This increasing automaticity frees up cognitive resources so that the reader can reflect on meaning.  With the decoding process almost automatic by this point, the brain learns to integrate more [[metaphorical]], inferential, [[analogical]], background and [[experiential knowledge]] with every newly won millisecond.  This stage in learning to read often will last until early adulthood.&lt;ref name="Wolf143"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=143 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expert reader===
The final stage in learning to read, is the expert stage.  When a reader is at this stage of reading, it will usually only take them one half second to read almost any word.&lt;ref name="Wolf145"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=145 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The degree to which expert reading will change over the course of an [[adult]]'s life depends on what a person reads and how much they read.&lt;ref name="Wolf156"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=156 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a person matures, life experiences as well as the cognitive process of reading text shapes reading comprehension.  It is this interpretive response that adds depth to reading and will often take the reader in a new direction from where the [[author]] intended.&lt;ref name="Wolf156"/&gt;

==Methods of teaching reading==

===Alphabetic languages===
Educators have argued for years about which method is best to teach reading to children. For the English language, there are two major methods, [[Phonics]] and [[Whole language|Whole Language]], within which there are subtypes [[Synthetic phonics|Synthetic Phonics]] and [[Sight word]] respectively. Each method is employed at differing rates depending on the country and the specific school division. Some educators are beginning to use the two methods in conjunction to maximize the benefits of both methods.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;
[[Phonics]] is a teaching method that stresses character-sound correspondences,&lt;ref name='Neural Representations'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borowsky R, Esopenko C, Cummine J, Sarty GE |title=Neural representations of visual words and objects: a functional MRI study on the modularity of reading and object processing |journal= Brain Topogr |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=89–96 |year=2007 |pmid=17929158 |doi=10.1007/s10548-007-0034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borowsky R, Cummine J, Owen WJ, Friesen CK, Shih F, Sarty GE |title=FMRI of ventral and dorsal processing streams in basic reading processes: insular sensitivity to phonology |journal=Brain Topogr |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=233–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16845597 |doi=10.1007/s10548-006-0001-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chan ST, Tang SW, Tang KW, Lee WK, Lo SS, Kwong KK |title=Hierarchical coding of characters in the ventral and dorsal visual streams of Chinese language processing |journal=NeuroImage |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=423–35 |date = November 2009|pmid=19591947 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.078}}&lt;/ref&gt; specific rules and their use in reading and spelling.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sanabria Díaz G, Torres Mdel R, Iglesias J, etal |title=Changes in reading strategies in school-age children |journal=Span J Psychol |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=441–53 |date = November 2009|pmid=19899646 |doi=10.1017/S1138741600001827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This helps beginning readers understand how characters are linked to sounds ([[phonemes]]), patterns of letter-sound correspondences and spelling in English, and how to apply this knowledge when they read to sound out words. Phonics teachers present the spellings for different sounds in a specific order, introducing the simplest (or most useful) patterns early on; these patterns are then practiced.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; A disadvantage to phonics is that in some languages like English, complex letter-sound correspondences can cause confusion for beginning readers.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rayner|first=Keith|author2=Barbara Foorman |author3=Charles Perfetti |author4=David Pesetsky |author5=Mark Seidenberg |title=How Should Reading be Taught?|journal=Scientific American|date=March 2002|pages=84–91 |format=pdf |url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/pspi/reading.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional phonics instruction has marked benefits. Early reading often involves significant expansion of a child's mental lexicon, which includes all the words the child has been exposed to and their meanings. By focusing on the principle of linking specific sounds and characters, the child has the ability to recognize new words and derive meaning from them. Being able to adapt what they know about language to new words they experience is crucial to expanding their mental lexicon; this allows for productive reading that is the ability to read new words.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2002"/&gt; It also produces higher achievement for beginning readers and the difference is the greatest for those at risk of failing to learn to read. While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, some need explicit instructions on phonics rules. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics are better at reading, spelling and comprehension.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;

Traditional phonics instruction can also have the unintended consequence of promoting dysfluency. The difficulty lies in the [[Coarticulation|coarticulated]] nature of speech; speech sounds are overlapping,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carello C, LeVasseur VM, Schmidt RC |title=Movement sequencing and phonological fluency in (putatively) nonimpaired readers |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=375–9 |date = July 2002|pmid=12137142 |doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2002.00467.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; while print is discrete and sequential. This can be appreciated if one shapes the mouth in position to begin to produce the word ''cat'' compared to the word ''cot''. The initial hard ''c'' is colored by the subsequent vowel even before speech begins, i.e., the smiling position as one prepares to say ''cat'', and the more limp position as one prepares to say ''cot''. As early readers work from left to right, beginning with the onset consonant, they typically do not yet know the vowel with which it must be coarticulated. The vowel sound itself cannot be known until the remaining rime (the portion of the syllable beginning with the vowel and extending to its end: e.g. ''ight'' in ''right'') is fully encountered. For these reasons, teaching reading through orientation to rime first and then adding the onset (ought-bought) can be helpful in promoting fluency through supporting the phonological problems of coarticulation. Emphasis on the rime also supports the development of an intuitive, and therefore more fluent, awareness of orthographic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Cherkes-Julkowski, M. (2005). find the "vawel", Read the Rime, Learn to Read. Apache Junction, AZ: Surviving Education Guides.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Synthetic phonics|Synthetic Phonics]] is a method that is endorsed by the governments of the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Review of the Primary Curriculum: Final Report|url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/Primary_curriculum_Report.pdf|publisher=DCSF Publications|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teaching Reading: Report and Recommendations|url=http://www.dest.gov.au/nitl/documents/report_recommendations.pdf|publisher=Commonwealth Copyright|accessdate=14 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024503/http://www.dest.gov.au/nitl/documents/report_recommendations.pdf|archivedate=12 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Rhona|title=A Seven Year Study of the Effects of Synthetic Phonics Teaching on Reading and Spelling Attainment|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20682/52383|accessdate=14 November 2011|author2=Joyce E Watson |date=11 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has considerable support in the U.S.A.&lt;ref name="NICHD, 2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |title=Findings and Determinations of the National Reading Panel by Topic Areas |format= |work=NICHD Publications and Materials |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194256/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Reading Strategy: The Report of the Expert Panel on Early Reading in Ontario|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/reports/reading/reading.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Education|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Synthetic Phonics, the student first learns to say the sounds ([[phonemes]]) that are associated with the character([[graphemes]]) in isolation before the sounds are "synthesized" or blended together to make a word. (e.g. /a/, /k/, /t/.) Then, when reading a word, he learns to say each sound in the word (e.g. /k/ - /a/ - /t/); and to "blend" these sounds into a pronunciation of the word (e.g. "cat").

Synthetic phonics does not teach whole words as shapes; and does not involve guessing at words from context, picture and initial letter clues.

There are other types of phonics, such as [[Analytical phonics]], that differ in their approach based on how a "chunk" within the word is defined (i.e. individual phonemes, syllables, or non-blended units).

[[Whole language|Whole Language]] is widely used in the U.S.A. and Canada. It is a reading and learning method that trains students to focus on words, sentences and paragraphs as a whole rather than letters. This method aims to make reading fun and keep children motivated, which is beneficial because learning to read depends heavily on what the student does and not the teacher.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; While the child is typically very engaged in this method, many children struggle to infer the specific rules of the language on their own, which causes the child's decoding and spelling to suffer during development.&lt;ref name="National Reading Panel, 2000, Summary" /&gt;

One subtype is [[Sight word]], which is sometimes called the "look-say" method. A sight vocabulary of 50-100 words is first memorized&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2002"/&gt;  and subsequent words are learned as wholes, often by seeing them used repeatedly in the context of a story.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; It tells children to find meaning by guessing, by recognizing whole words they have memorized, by looking at the pictures, and by creating a context based on surrounding words. It encourages students to "construct their own meaning" (with guidance from peers and facilitator of consensus process).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weatherly|first=Cynthia|title=GLOSSARY of Education Terms|url=http://www.crossroad.to/glossary/education.html#whole|work=Brave New Schools|accessdate=14 November 2011|author2=Sarah Leslie |author3=Charlotte Iserbyt |author4=Marla Quenzer |author5=Betty Lewis |author6=Elizabeth Stoner }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It relies heavily on the child's experience with language as a whole.
The following are some features of the whole language philosophy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the whole language philosophy?|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/ReferenceMaterials/glossaryofliteracyterms/WhatIsTheWholeLanguagePhilosop.htm|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Children are expected to learn to read and write as they learned to talk, that is gradually, without a great deal of direct instruction.
*Learning is emphasized more than teaching; it is assumed that the children will learn to read and write, and the teacher facilitates that growth.
*Children read and write every day in a variety of situations.
*Reading, writing, and spoken language are not considered separate components of the curriculum or merely ends in themselves; rather they permeate everything the children are doing.
*There is no division between first ''learning to read'' and later ''reading to learn''. (adapted from Weaver, C. 1990)
&lt;br /&gt;
Which style use in teaching reading has divided educators for years. It is now known that using the two approaches together is more powerful than either program alone.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; The technical skills learned through phonics are important for many children when learning to read, spell, and general language comprehension and engagement of children in the whole-language approach is also important to keep the children motivated and excited to learn. Many teachers and schools acknowledge this and say that they use multiple methods to teach children to read.

=== Logographic languages ===

Languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] are normally written in [[logograms]] ([[hanzi]] and [[kanji]], respectively), which represent a whole word or [[morpheme]] with a single character.  There are a large number of characters, and the sound that each makes must be learned directly or from other characters which contain "hints" in them, such as, in Japanese, 民's [[On reading#On.27yomi .28Chinese reading.29|on-reading]] being min and 眠 which shares the same on-reading as  民, that being min. In the same way whereas the right part contains the characters pronunciation, 員's on-reading is in and 韻 has exactly the same on, however this is not true for all characters. Kun readings, on the other hand, have to be learned and memorised as there is no way to tell from each character.

[[Ruby character]]s are used in textbooks to help children learn the sounds that each logogram makes.  These are written in a smaller size, using an alphabetic or [[Syllabary|syllabic]] script.  For example, [[hiragana]] is typically used in Japanese, and the [[pinyin]] [[romanization]] into Latin alphabet characters is used in Chinese.

The examples above spell the word ''kanji'', which is made up of two kanji characters: 漢 (''kan'', written in hiragana as かん), and 字 (''ji'', written in hiragana as じ).

Textbooks are sometimes edited as a cohesive set across grades so that children will not encounter logograms they are not yet expected to have learned.

==Skills required for proficient reading==
{{Globalize|section|date=July 2010}}
According to the report by the US [[National Reading Panel]] (NRP) in 2000,
&lt;ref name="National Reading Panel, 2000, Summary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreadingpanel.org/publications/summary.htm |title=National Reading Panel (NRP) -  Summary Report (2000) |work=National Reading Panel (NRP) Publications and Materials |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610211113/http://www.nationalreadingpanel.org/publications/summary.htm |archivedate=2010-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Reading Panel, 2000, Subgroups"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreadingpanel.org/publications/subgroups.htm |title=National Reading Panel (NRP) - Reports of the Subgroups |work=National Reading Panel, 2000 (NRP) - Publications and Materials |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611011153/http://www.nationalreadingpanel.org/publications/subgroups.htm |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the skills required for proficient reading are [[phonemic awareness]], [[fluency]],&lt;ref name="Rasinski, T"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prel.org/products/re_/assessing-fluency.htm |title=Assessing Reading Fluency |author=Rasinski, T. |publisher=Pacific Resources for Education and Learning |accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[vocabulary]],&lt;ref name="Justice 2002 87–106"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Justice|first1=Laura M. |title=Word Exposure Conditions and Preschoolers' Novel Word Learning During Shared Storybook Reading|journal=Reading Psychology|volume=23|issue=2|year=2002|pages=87–106|issn=0270-2711|doi=10.1080/027027102760351016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[reading comprehension|text comprehension]].&lt;ref name="NICHD, 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fien 2010 631–653"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fien|first=Hank|author2=Yonghan Park |author3=Scott Baker |author4=Jean Mercier Smith |author5=Mike Stoolmiller |author6=Edward Kame'enui |title=An Examination of the Relation of Nonsense Word Fluency Initial Status and Gains to Reading Outcomes for Beginning Readers|journal=School Psychology Review|year=2010|volume=39|issue=4|pages=631–653 |format=pdf |url=http://www.nasponline.org/publications/spr/39-4/spr394fien.pdf›}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, proficient reading does not necessarily require [[phonemic awareness]], as in Latin Alphabets, but an awareness of the individual parts of speech, which may also include the whole word (as in Chinese characters) or syllables (as in Japanese) as well as others depending on the writing system being employed. Other important skills are: [[rapid automatized naming]] (RAN),&lt;ref name="Lervåg"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lervåg A, Hulme C | year = 2009 | title = Rapid automatized naming (RAN) taps a mechanism that places constraints on the development of early reading fluency | url = | journal = Psychol.

*'''[[Speech perception|Speech Awareness]]''': The awareness of individual parts of speech as they apply to individual written characters is crucial for understanding reading (as defined by translating written characters into spoken language). [[Phonological awareness]], which includes the manipulation of [[rhymes]], [[syllable]]s, and [[syllable onset|onsets]] and [[syllable rime|rimes]], is most prevalent in Alphabetic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehri|first=Linnea|author2=Simone Nunes |author3=Dale Willows |author4=Barbara Valeska Schuster |author5=Zohreh Yaghoub-Zadeh |author6=Timothy Shanahan |title=Phonemic awareness instruction helps children learn to read: Evidence from the National Reading Panel's meta-analysis|journal=Reading Research Quarterly|date=July–September 2001|volume=36|issue=3|pages=250–287 |jstor=748111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The important part of speech depends on the [[Writing system]] employed.
* '''[[Fluency]]''': The ability to read orally with speed, accuracy, and [[vocal]] expression. The ability to read fluently is one of several critical factors necessary for reading comprehension. If a reader is not fluent, it may be difficult to remember what has been read and to relate the ideas expressed in the text to their background knowledge. This accuracy and automaticity of reading serves as a bridge between decoding and comprehension.&lt;ref name="Rasinski, T"/&gt;
* '''[[Vocabulary]]''': A critical aspect of reading comprehension is vocabulary development.&lt;ref name="Justice 2002 87–106"/&gt; When a reader encounters an unfamiliar word in print and decodes it to derive its spoken pronunciation, the reader understands the word if it is in the reader's spoken vocabulary. Otherwise, the reader must derive the meaning of the word using another strategy, such as context. If the development of the child's vocabulary is impeded by things such as ear infections, that inhibit the child from hearing new words consistently, then the development of reading will also be impaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=104–105 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Reading comprehension]]''': The NRP describes comprehension as a complex [[cognitive]] process in which a reader intentionally and interactively engages with the text. Reading comprehension is heavily dependent on skilled word recognition and decoding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kendeou P, Savage R, van den Broek P |title=Revisiting the simple view of reading |journal=Br J Educ Psychol |volume=79 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=353–70 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19091164 |doi=10.1348/978185408X369020 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; oral reading fluency, a well-developed vocabulary and active engagement with the text.&lt;ref name="Fien 2010 631–653"/&gt;
*'''[[Rapid automatized naming]]''': The ability to say quickly the names of letters, objects and colors predicts an individual's ability to read. This might be linked to the importance of quick retrieval of [[phonological]] representations from [[long-term memory]] in reading and the importance of object-naming circuits in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]] that are recruited to underpin a child's word-recognition abilities.&lt;ref name="Lervåg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denckla MB 1974"/&gt;
*'''[[Orthography]]''' describes or defines the set of symbols used in a language, and the rules about how to write these symbols.  Orthographic Development proceeds in increasing complexity as a child learns to read. Some of the first things to be learnt are the orthographic conventions such as the direction of reading and that there are differing typefaces and capitalization for each symbol.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; In general, this means that to read proficiently, the reader has to understand elements of the written language including [[hyphen]]ation, [[capitalization]], [[word|word breaks]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], and [[punctuation]].&lt;ref name="Coulmas, Florian 1996. p. 379"/&gt;
* '''Practice''': repeated exposure to print improves many aspects of learning to read and most importantly the knowledge of individual words. It increases the speed at which high frequency words are recognized which allows for increased [[Fluency]] in reading. It also supports orthographic development,&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; [[Reading comprehension]] and [[Vocabulary]] development.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;

==Reading difficulties==
Difficulties in reading typically involve difficulty with one or more of the following: decoding, reading rate, reading fluency, or reading comprehension.

===Decoding===
{{Main|Dyslexia}}
Difficulty with decoding is marked by having not acquired the [[phoneme]]-[[grapheme]] mapping concept. One specific disability characterized by poor decoding is [[dyslexia]], defined as brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read.&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite web|title=NINDS Dyslexia Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm|publisher=[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]]|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These individuals typically read at levels significantly lower than expected despite having normal intelligence. It can also be inherited in some families, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia. Although the symptoms vary from person to person, common characteristics among people with dyslexia are difficulty with spelling, phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), and/or rapid visual-verbal responding.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;  Adults, can have either developmental dyslexia&lt;ref name='Heim'&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Heim S, Tschierse J, Amunts K |title=Cognitive subtypes of dyslexia |journal=Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=73–82 |year=2008 |pmid=18389017 |url=http://www.ane.pl/linkout.php?pii=6809 |issn=0065-1400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Facoetti A |title=Auditory and visual automatic attention deficits in developmental dyslexia |journal=Brain Res Cogn Brain Res |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=185–91 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12668226 |doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00270-7 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Lorusso ML |author3=Paganoni P |display-authors=3 |last4=Cattaneo |first4=Carmen |last5=Galli |first5=Raffaella |last6=Umiltà |first6=Carlo |last7=Mascetti |first7=Gian Gastone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anchoring&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Ahissar M |title=Dyslexia and the anchoring-deficit hypothesis |journal=Trends Cogn.

===Reading rate===
Individuals with reading rate difficulties tend to have accurate word recognition and normal comprehension abilities, but the reading speed is below grade level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Catts, Hugh William |author2=Kamhi, Alan G. |title=The connections between language and reading disabilities |publisher=L.

===Reading fluency===
Individuals with reading fluency difficulties fail to maintain a fluid, smooth pace when reading. Strategies used for overcoming reading rate difficulties are also useful in addressing reading fluency issues.&lt;ref name="National Reading Panel, 2000, Subgroups"/&gt;

===Reading comprehension===
Individuals with reading comprehension difficulties are commonly described as poor comprehenders. They have normal decoding skills as well as a fluid rate of reading, but have difficulty comprehending text when read. Increasing vocabulary knowledge, listening skills and teaching basic comprehension techniques may help facilitate better [[reading comprehension]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11735">In [[abstract algebra]], a branch of pure [[mathematics]], an '''MV-algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] with a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;, a [[unary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;, and the constant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying certain axioms. MV-algebras are the [[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] of [[Łukasiewicz logic]]; the letters MV refer to the [[Many-valued logic|''many-valued'' logic]] of Łukasiewicz. MV-algebras coincide with the class of bounded commutative [[BCK algebra]]s.

* a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt;
* a [[unary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; and
* a constant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; denoting a fixed [[element (mathematics)|element]] of &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt;
which satisfies the following [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]:
* &lt;math&gt; (x \oplus y) \oplus z = x \oplus (y \oplus z),&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x \oplus 0 = x,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x \oplus y = y \oplus x,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \lnot \lnot x = x,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x \oplus \lnot 0 = \lnot 0,&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt; \lnot ( \lnot x \oplus y)\oplus y = \lnot ( \lnot y \oplus x) \oplus x.&lt;/math&gt;

By virtue of the first three axioms, &lt;math&gt;\langle A, \oplus, 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative [[monoid]]. Being defined by identities, MV-algebras form a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of algebras. The variety of MV-algebras is a subvariety of the variety of [[BL (logic)|BL]]-algebras and contains all [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.

An MV-algebra can equivalently be defined (Hájek 1998) as a prelinear commutative bounded integral [[residuated lattice]] &lt;math&gt;\langle L, \wedge, \vee, \otimes, \rightarrow, 0, 1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; satisfying the additional identity &lt;math&gt;x \vee y = (x \rightarrow y) \rightarrow y.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples of MV-algebras==
A simple numerical example is &lt;math&gt;A=[0,1],&lt;/math&gt; with operations &lt;math&gt;x \oplus y = \min(x+y,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot x=1-x.&lt;/math&gt; In mathematical fuzzy logic, this MV-algebra is called the ''standard MV-algebra'', as it forms the standard real-valued semantics of [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

The ''trivial'' MV-algebra has the only element 0 and the operations defined in the only possible way, &lt;math&gt;0\oplus0=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot0=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''two-element'' MV-algebra is actually the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\},&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; coinciding with Boolean disjunction and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; with Boolean negation. In fact adding the axiom &lt;math&gt;x \oplus x = x&lt;/math&gt; to the axioms defining an MV-algebra results in an axiomatization of Boolean algebras.

If instead the axiom added is &lt;math&gt;x \oplus x \oplus x = x \oplus x&lt;/math&gt;, then the axioms define the MV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; algebra corresponding to the three-valued Łukasiewicz logic Ł&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Axiomatizations of Ln need Grigolia's axioms|date=February 2013}}. Other finite linearly ordered MV-algebras are obtained by restricting the universe and operations of the standard MV-algebra to the set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; equidistant real numbers between 0 and 1 (both included), that is, the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1/(n-1),2/(n-1),\dots,1\},&lt;/math&gt; which is closed under the operations &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; of the standard MV-algebra; these algebras are usually denoted MV&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

Another important example is ''Chang's MV-algebra'', consisting just of infinitesimals (with the [[order type]] &amp;omega;) and their co-infinitesimals.

Chang also constructed an MV-algebra from an arbitrary [[Linearly ordered group|totally ordered abelian group]] ''G'' by fixing a positive element ''u'' and defining the segment [0, ''u''] as { ''x'' ∈ ''G'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''u'' }, which becomes an MV-algebra with ''x'' ⊕ ''y'' = min(''u'', ''x''+''y'') and ¬''x'' = ''u''−''x''. Furthermore, Chang showed that every linearly ordered MV-algebra is isomorphic to an MV-algebra constructed from a group in this way.

D. Mundici extended the above construction to abelian [[lattice-ordered group]]s. If ''G'' is such a group with strong (order) unit ''u'', then the "unit interval" { ''x'' ∈ ''G'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''u'' } can be equipped with ¬''x'' = ''u''−''x'', ''x'' ⊕ ''y'' = ''u''∧&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; (x+y), ''x'' ⊗ ''y'' = 0∨&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''+''y''−''u''). This construction establishes a [[categorical equivalence]] between lattice-ordered abelian groups with strong unit and MV-algebras.

==Relation to Łukasiewicz logic==
[[C. C. Chang]] devised MV-algebras to study [[many-valued logic]]s, introduced by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] in 1920. In particular, MV-algebras form the [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] of [[Łukasiewicz logic]], as described below.

Given an MV-algebra ''A'', an ''A''-[[Valuation (logic)|valuation]] is a [[homomorphism]] from the algebra of [[propositional formula]]s (in the language consisting of &lt;math&gt;\oplus,\lnot,&lt;/math&gt; and 0) into ''A''. Formulas mapped to 1 (or &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;0) for all ''A''-valuations are called ''A''-[[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]. If the standard MV-algebra over [0,1] is employed, the set of all [0,1]-tautologies determines so-called infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

Chang's (1958, 1959) completeness theorem states that any MV-algebra equation holding in the standard MV-algebra over the interval [0,1] will hold in every MV-algebra. Algebraically, this means that the standard MV-algebra generates the variety of all MV-algebras. Equivalently, Chang's completeness theorem says that MV-algebras characterize infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]], defined as the set of [0,1]-tautologies.

The way the [0,1] MV-algebra characterizes all possible MV-algebras parallels the well-known fact that identities holding in the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] hold in all possible Boolean algebras. Moreover, MV-algebras characterize infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]] in a manner analogous to the way that [[Boolean algebras]] characterize classical [[two-element Boolean algebra|bivalent logic]] (see [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]]).

In 1984, Font, Rodriguez and Torrens introduced the [[Wajsberg algebra]] as an alternative model for the infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic. Wajsberg algebras and MV-algebras are isomorphic.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://journal.univagora.ro/download/pdf/28.pdf citing J. M. Font, A. J. Rodriguez, A. Torrens, "Wajsberg Algebras", ''Stochastica'', VIII, 1, 5-31, 1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras ===
{{expand section|the extra axioms|date=August 2014}}
In the 1940s [[Grigore Moisil]] introduced his [[Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra]]s (LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras) in the hope of giving [[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] for the (finitely) ''n''-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]]. However, in 1956 Alan Rose discovered that for ''n'' ≥ 5, the Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra does not [[model (mathematical logic)|model]] the Łukasiewicz ''n''-valued logic. Although C. C. Chang published his MV-algebra in 1958, it is faithful model only for the ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued (infinitely-many-valued) [[Łukasiewicz–Tarski logic]]. For the axiomatically more complicated (finitely) ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logics, suitable algebras were published in 1977 by [[Revaz Grigolia]] and called MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras.&lt;ref name="Ciungu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavinia Corina Ciungu|title=Non-commutative Multiple-Valued Logic Algebras|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-01589-7|pages=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are a subclass of LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras; the inclusion is strict for ''n'' ≥ 5.&lt;ref&gt;Iorgulescu, A.: Connections between MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras and ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebras—I. Discrete Math. 181, 155–177 (1998) {{doi|10.1016/S0012-365X(97)00052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are MV-algebras which satisfy some additional axioms, just like the ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logics have additional axioms added to the ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued logic.

In 1982 [[Roberto Cignoli]] published some additional constraints that added to LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are proper models for ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logic; Cignoli called his discovery ''proper ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz algebras''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Cignoli, Proper n-Valued Łukasiewicz Algebras as S-Algebras of Łukasiewicz ''n''-Valued Propositional Calculi, Studia Logica, 41, 1982, 3-16, {{doi|10.1007/BF00373490}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras that are also MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are precisely Cignoli’s proper n-valued Łukasiewicz algebras.&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.univagora.ro/download/pdf/28.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to functional analysis==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
MV-algebras were related by [[Daniele Mundici]] to [[approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebra]]s by establishing a bijective correspondence between all isomorphism classes of AF C*-algebras with lattice-ordered dimension group and all isomorphism classes of countable MV algebras. Some instances of this correspondence include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Countable MV algebra !! AF C*-algebra
|-
| {0, 1} || ℂ
|-
| {0, 1/''n'', ..., 1 } || M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(ℂ), i.e. ''n''×''n'' complex matrices
|-
| finite || finite-dimensional
|-
| boolean || commutative
|}

==In software==

There are multiple frameworks implementing fuzzy logic (type II), and most of them implement what has been called a '''multi-adjoint logic'''. This is no more than the implementation of a MV-algebra.

[[Image:MakeTradeFair.svg|thumb|right|The ''Make Trade Fair'' logo.]]

'''Make Trade Fair''' is a campaign organized by [[Oxfam|Oxfam International]] to promote [[trade justice]] and [[fair trade]] among governments, institutions, and multinational corporations.

==Objectives==
The campaign has focused on the elimination of several trade practices:

* [[Dumping (pricing policy)|Dumping]], which occurs when highly subsidized, surplus commodities from developed countries such as rice, cotton, corn, and sugar are sold at low prices and farmers from poor countries have difficulty competing.   It is believed that this creates an uneven playing field where farmers in developing countries are unable to compete in the market with cheaper foreign produce and crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_dumping.htm#|title=Rigged Rules - Dumping |accessdate=January 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tariffs]], where nations enforce high taxes on imported goods, restricting the sales of products from other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_marketaccess.htm|title=Rigged Rules - Market Access|accessdate=January 29, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221040624/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_marketaccess.htm|archivedate=February 21, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unbalanced [[labour rights]] for women, who often perceive that they earn lower wages than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_labour.htm|title=Rigged Rules - Labour Rights|accessdate=January 29, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224162419/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_labour.htm|archivedate=December 24, 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stringent [[patent]] issues, that prevent the prices of medication, software, and textbooks (e.g. [[Gene patent]]s, [[Chemical patent]]s, and [[Software patent]]s) from being lowered.  Thus, such essential goods are often inaccessible to developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_patents.htm|title=Rigged Rules - Patents|accessdate=January 29, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322075359/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_patents.htm|archivedate=March 22, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key events==

===The Big Noise===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MakeTradeFairStipe.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Michael Stipe]] of [[R.E.M. (band)|REM]] is "dumped" with milk to highlight dumping practices as part of the Big Noise petition]] --&gt;
Launched in April 2002, the Big Noise is a worldwide petition that calls for governments to help end unfair trade practices. By the end of 2005, some 17.8 million signatures have been received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org/en/programs/campaigns/maketradefair/index.htm|title=Oxfam International  - Make Trade Fair |accessdate=January 29, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060104033924/http://www.oxfam.org/en/programs/campaigns/maketradefair/index.htm |archivedate = January 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Desmond Tutu]] was the honorary 1 millionth signee to the petition in 2003.  Other celebrities who have lent their names to the petition include the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]], and musicians [[Bono]] and [[Coldplay]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.ca/news/MakeTradeFair/ArchbishopTutu.htm |title=Make Trade Fair - Oxfam Global Petition Hits One Million Mark |accessdate=January 29, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103065246/http://www.oxfam.ca/news/MakeTradeFair/ArchbishopTutu.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically [[Chris Martin]] who would, before performing on stage, draw an [[equal sign]] (mistaken by many to be a tattoo) on his hand. However, this could also be a reference to the [[Human Rights Campaign]].

The petition was also coupled with a popular photo campaign, where celebrities were "dumped" with various crops and foodstuffs to highlight the practice of [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]], which some perceive to be unfair. [[Colin Firth]], [[Thom Yorke]], [[Jamelia]], and [[Haile Gebrselassie]] were a few of the celebrities to take part in this venture.

===Make Trade Fair concerts===
In 2002 and 2004, special benefit concerts were held in [[London]] to promote the Make Trade Fair campaign.  Proceeds from the shows went to aid Oxfam's promotional campaigns. Produced by [[Emily Eavis]], [[Marianne Troup]], and [[Lily Sobhani]], performers from the 2002 "Fairplay" gig include [[Chris Martin]] and [[Jonny Buckland]] from [[Coldplay]], [[Noel Gallagher]], and [[Ms. Dynamite]], while the 2004 event included Michael Stipe, [[Razorlight]], and [[The Thrills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/kidsweb/stars/mtf_concert.htm|title= 	
Make Trade Fair Concert 2004|accessdate=January 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008, the Make Trade Fair support CD ''The Cake Sale'' was produced. The 9 songs were performed by [[Lisa Hannigan]], [[Nina Persson]], [[Gary Lightbody]], [[Gemma Hayes]], [[Glen Hansard]], [[Josh Ritter]], [[Conor Deasy]] and [[Neil Hannon]], and written by Deasy, Hansard, [[Emm Gryner]], [[Paul Noonan]], [[Ollie Cole]], [[Damien Rice]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfamireland.org/whatwedo/campaigns_advocacy/make_trade_fair/thecakesale.shtml |title=Make Trade Fair CD 2008 |accessdate=February 29, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121174042/http://www.oxfamireland.org/whatwedo/campaigns_advocacy/make_trade_fair/thecakesale.shtml |archivedate=January 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005===
The Make Trade Fair campaign was active at the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005]], held in [[Hong Kong]], [[People's Republic of China]].  Various demonstrations and activities were held, including the handover of some 17.8 million signatures on the Big Noise petition to WTO Director General [[Pascal Lamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/pages/galleries/wto01.htm|title=WTO summit photos|accessdate=February 18, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090706203209/http%3A//www.maketradefair.com/en/pages/galleries/wto01.htm|archivedate=July 6, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Manager Tools Podcast''', founded in 2005, is a weekly audio [[podcast]] by Michael Auzenne and Mark Horstman, which focuses on career advice and helping managers become more effective.&lt;ref name="mtAbout"&gt;Manager Tools "About us" page https://www.manager-tools.com/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fan"&gt;Unofficial Manager Tools Fan Club on Squidoo&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded People's Choice Podcast from [[Podcast Awards]] in 2008, and won the Best Business Podcast award in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2012.In 2016, was awarded as the Legacy show in Business &lt;ref name="awards"&gt;Podcast Award Winners 2005-2011 http://podcastawards.com/index.php?option=pastwinners&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pa2012"&gt;PodcastAwards page January 8, 2012. http://www.podcastawards.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hosts==
The podcast hosts, Mark Horstman and Mike Auzenne, are both graduates of [[West Point]], the United States Military Academy, which is where they met.&lt;ref name="showabout"&gt;Manager Tools podcast about their Background http://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-show-about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Auzenne spent nearly two decades in Corporate America as a manager and executive.&lt;ref name="mike"&gt;"30- Leveraging Corporate Skills to Successful Entrepreneurship" http://strugglingentrepreneur.com/2008/03/02/wwwmanaagertoolscom-leverages-leadership-experience/%&lt;/ref&gt; His corporate career includes executive assignments in technology and Program Management for [[MCI Inc.]] and [[Bell Atlantic]] as well as several entrepreneurial pursuits in the restaurant and retail fitness industries.

Mark Horstman was a manager and executive in sales and marketing at [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]. Mark has been coaching and training managers and executives since 1988.&lt;ref name="mtAbout" /&gt;

==History==
Horstman and Auzenne learned about podcasting in 2005 and decided that this could be a way to disseminate their knowledge about effective management.&lt;ref name="showabout" /&gt; Auzenne said he didn’t want to create a model where he would only give away half of a solution and then require the audience to pay for the rest of the solution.&lt;ref name="Mikeint"&gt;Mike Auzenne in: Manager Tools: Making Money from Podcasting article by David Spark on http://www.sparkminute.com/2009/09/29/manager-tools-making-money-from-podcasting/&lt;/ref&gt;  The co-founders have stated that they believe they can change the world by changing management, and that the way to change it is one manager at a time.&lt;ref name="mtweb" /&gt; After starting with the weekly free podcasts, both hosts completely dedicated their work time, and became co-founders of Manager Tools LLC, a management consulting firm.&lt;ref name="mtAbout" /&gt; They regularly consult to and train managers in [[Fortune 1000]] companies around the world.&lt;ref name="careers"&gt;Career Tools Wins Business Category of People's Choice Podcast Awards http://www.eworldwire.com/pressreleases/211975&lt;/ref&gt; Their company also sells transcripts of the podcasts on-line through membership, and they organize public and in-company conferences to practice the Manager Tools.&lt;ref name="Mikeint"/&gt; As of 2012, the company has five full-time employees.

The Manager Tools '''"Basics"''' — is a special collection of podcasts on the essentials of effective managerial behavior and the base of all the Manager Tools advanced material.

The podcasts are often articulated around the 'Manager Tools Philosophy'.&lt;ref name="showabout" /&gt; Its main parts are ''''The Management Trinity'''' and the ''''Horstman's Laws''''. The founders focus on specific action steps that managers can apply to their job as opposed to theoretical management models.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atkinsonadvisor.com/hits-bytes/www-manager-tool-com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Content and theories==

===Foundational Principles - The Management Trinity===

The hosts often refers to the ''''Management Trinity'''':&lt;ref&gt;https://www.manager-tools.com/2013/01/positive-feedback-before-its-time&lt;/ref&gt; One on Ones, Feedback, and Coaching, plus their silent fourth partner, Delegation. These are at the heart of everything Manager Tools recommends.&lt;ref&gt;The Management Trinity http://www.manager-tools.com/2009/10/management-trinity-part-1&lt;/ref&gt; All Of The Manager Tools Trinity Tools are ''Teachable Equivalents'' that the hosts have developed. Most casts are based on these tools.

They usually include:&lt;ref name="mtBasics"&gt;List of Basic Manager Tools Podcasts https://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-basics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Managing Responsibilities http://www.ymresourcer.com/documents/Managing_Responsibilities.doc&lt;/ref&gt;
*One on Ones (Weekly meetings in order to reinforce relationships) - recognised as "the best business practice of all time" by profitguide.com&lt;ref&gt;http://www.profitguide.com/article/78170--the-30-best-business-practices-of-all-time&lt;/ref&gt; -
*Feedback (reinforcing or correcting behaviours)

Other foundational principles as described in the 'basics' podcasts include:&lt;ref name="mtBasics" /&gt;
* Running Effective Meetings
* Methods for rolling out the Manager Tools Trinity
* 'Solution to a Stalled Technical Career'

===DISC - Management adapted to the personality of the direct report===
Manager Tools podcasts often refer to the [[DISC assessment]] when adapting management and communication styles to individuals.

The DiSC model provides nonjudgmental language for exploring behavioral issues across four personality traits ('''D'''ominance, '''I'''nfluence, '''S'''teadiness and '''C'''onscientious.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inscapepartners.com/discclassic/&lt;/ref&gt; These four traits can be grouped in a grid with "D" and "I" sharing the top row and representing extroverted aspects of the personality, and "C" and "S" below representing introverted aspects. "D" and "C" then share the left column and represent task-focused aspects, and "I" and "S" share the right column and represent social aspects. In this matrix, the vertical dimension represents a factor of "Assertive" or "Passive", while the horizontal dimension represents "Open" vs. "Guarded".&lt;ref&gt;[[DISC assessment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other principles===
There are also some recurring references to other 'rules' or 'laws'. These are mostly referred to verbally in the podcasts:&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools Forum Post https://www.manager-tools.com/forums/hortsmans-laws-podcast&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools Forum Post https://www.manager-tools.com/forums/horstmans-laws-01&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4242">A '''hymn metre''' (Am. '''meter''') indicates the number of syllables for the lines in each [[stanza]] of a [[hymn]]. This provides a means of marrying the hymn's text with an appropriate [[hymn tune]] for singing.

==Hymn and poetic metre==
In the English language [[metre (poetry)|poetic metres]] and hymn metres have different starting points but there is nevertheless much overlap. Take the opening lines of the hymn ''[[Amazing Grace]]'':
:A'''maz'''ing '''grace''', how '''sweet''' the '''sound'''
:that '''saved''' a '''wretch''' like '''me'''.
Analyzing this, a poet would see a [[couplet]] with four [[Iamb (poetry)|iambic]] [[Foot (prosody)|metrical feet]] in the first line and three in the second. A musician would more likely count eight syllables in the first line and six in the second.

Completing that verse:
:A'''maz'''ing '''grace''', how '''sweet''' the '''sound'''
:that '''saved''' a '''wretch''' like '''me'''.
:I '''once''' was '''lost''', but '''now''' am '''found''',
:was '''blind''', but '''now''' I '''see'''.
the hymnist describes it as 8.6.8.6 (or 86.86).

Conventionally most hymns in this 86.86 pattern are iambic (weak-strong syllable pairs).  By contrast most hymns in an 87.87 pattern are [[trochee|trochaic]], with strong-weak syllable pairs:
:'''Love''' di'''vine''', all '''loves''' ex'''cel'''ling,
:'''joy''' of '''heav'n''' to '''earth''' come '''down''',...

In practice many hymns conform to one of a relatively small number of metres (syllable patterns), and within the most commonly used ones there is a general convention as to whether its stress pattern is iambic or trochaic (or perhaps [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]]). It is rare to find any significant [[substitution (poetry)|metrical substitution]] in a well-written hymn; indeed, such variation usually indicates a poorly constructed text.

==Representation==
All metres can be represented numerically.  In addition, some of those most frequently encountered are named:
*'''C.M.''', or '''CM'''&amp;mdash; [[Common metre]], 8.6.8.6; a quatrain (four-line stanza) with alternating lines of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter, which rhymes in the second and fourth lines and sometimes in the first and third.
*'''H.M.''', or '''HM'''&amp;mdash; [[Hallelujah meter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hymntime.com/tch/mid/met/HM.htm |title=HM Hallelujah Meter (66.66.88) |last= |first= |date=19 October 2018 |website= |publisher=The Cyber Hymnal |access-date=29 November 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 66.66.88;
*'''L.M.''', or '''LM'''&amp;mdash; [[Long metre]], 8.8.8.8; a quatrain in iambic tetrameter, which rhymes in the second and fourth lines and often in the first and third.
*'''S.M.''', or '''SM'''&amp;mdash; [[Meter (hymn)|Short metre]], 6.6.8.6; iambic lines in the first, second, and fourth are in trimeter, and the third in tetrameter, which rhymes in the second and fourth lines and sometimes in the first and third. "Blest Be the Tie that Binds" is an example of a hymn in short metre.
Often a longer verse will, in effect, be two short verses joined together or doubled. So:
*'''D.C.M.''' (also '''C.M.D.''', or '''CMD''')&amp;mdash;Doubled CM, 8.6.8.6.8.6.8.6.
*'''8.7.8.7.D'''&amp;mdash;equivalent to two verses of 8.7.8.7. [[Trochee|Trochaic]] or [[Iamb (poetry)|Iambic]].

Additionally, '''P.M.''', or '''PM''' is used to indicate a ''Peculiar meter'', where the regular count of syllables is not adhered to.

A large number of hymns, including many well known ones, use other metres, for example, "[[Abide With Me]]" (10.10.10.10) and "Come Down, O Love Divine" (6.6.11.D).

==Metrical index==
Hymns written in a particular meter may be sung to any tune in that same meter, as long as the [[Foot (prosody)|poetic foot]] (such as [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]], [[trochee|trochaic]]) also conforms.

Most hymnals include a metrical index of the book's tunes.

[[File:Witness impeachment.jpg|thumb|Mock trials allow researchers to examine [[confirmation bias]]es in a realistic setting]]

A '''mock trial''' is an act or imitation [[trial (law)|trial]]. It is similar to a [[moot court]], but mock trials simulate lower-court trials, while moot court simulates [[appellate court]] hearings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/07/court-moot-court-mock-court-and-mock.html Court, Moot Court, Mock Court and Mock Trial], Available at Learning the Law.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawyer|Attorneys]] preparing for a real trial might use a mock trial consisting of volunteers as role players to test theories or experiment with each other.  Mock trial is also the name of an [[extracurricular]] program in which [[student]]s participate in rehearsed trials to learn about the legal system in a competitive manner. Interscholastic mock trials take place on all levels including [[primary school]], [[middle school]], [[high school]], [[college]], and [[law school]].  Mock trial is often taught in conjunction with a course in [[trial advocacy]] or takes place as an after school enrichment activity. Some gifted and talented programs may also take place in one.

==Litigation related mock trials==
Litigators may use mock trials to assist with trial preparation and settlement negotiations of actual cases. Unlike school-related mock trials, these mock trials can take numerous forms depending on the information sought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelawinsider.com/mock-trial-lawschool/what-is-a-mock-trial/ scholastic mock trials]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when faced with complex fact issues in a particular case, attorneys might convene a mini mock trial to try different methods of presenting their evidence, sometimes before a jury.

==Competitive school-related mock trials around the world==

===Asia Pacific===
[[Guam]] has been hosting the annual Asia-Pacific Invitational Mock Trial Competition. In 2011 and 2012, there were 14 teams from Guam, [[South Korea]], and [[Saipan]] in its 4th annual competition. The competition was held at [[Government of Guam#The Superior Court of Guam|the Superior Court of Guam]]. The teams made up of mostly junior and senior students from [[high school]]s. The Champion of the 4th Annual Asia-Pacific Invitational Mock Trial Competition was Marianas Baptist Academy of Saipan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MBA is Asia-Pacific invitational mock trial competition champion |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=123309 |accessdate=29 December 2012 |newspaper=Saipan Tribune |date=12 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526073517/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=123309 |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2005, the [[Surana and Surana Moots|Surana &amp; Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot]] was conceived as one of its kind  with the aim of promoting skills of trial advocacy. In its 10th successful year (2014), this national moot trial is one of the most appreciated for its innovation and structure. Popular demand led to the creation of three more editions of this unique trial competition [India North, India South, India North East &amp; India West (from 2014–15) rounds.] This competition  has the distinction of being the first ever to be held in the North Eastern region of India in 2012. The structure is such that  law students from the host institution participate by enacting the role of  witnesses for the oral rounds. The students and faculty welcome this, as it provides a unique opportunity to learn practical aspects of a trial, first hand.

===Australia===
Mock trial competitions in Australia are held regionally. These include:
* The Law Society of South Australia Mock Trial Competition comprises a series of simulated court cases by students [[Education in Australia|years 10, 11 and 12]] from 32 schools in [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.lawsocietysa.asn.au/other/mock_trial.asp|publisher=The Law Society of South Australia|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Law Society of Western Australia Interschool Mock Trial Competition is held each year for students enrolled in years 10, 11 and 12 in [[Western Australia]]. There were 773 students representing 68 teams from 38 schools participated in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trials Competition |url=http://www.lawsocietywa.asn.au/mock-trials.html |publisher=The Law Society of Western Australia |accessdate=29 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101085042/http://www.lawsocietywa.asn.au/mock-trials.html |archivedate=1 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Capital Region Mock Trial Competition is organized by [[University of Canberra]]. There were teams of schools in [[Australian Capital Territory]] region with year 10, 11 and 12 students.
* The New South Wales Mock Trial Competition has been running since 1981 for students years 10 and 11 in [[New South Wales]] initially with 28 schools. There have also been international events with mock trial competitions between Australia and the United Kingdom. In 2008, schools from this region also traveled to [[New York City]] to compete in the Empire Mock Trial Competition. The first Asia-Australia mock trial competition via video conference between Australian teams and a Korean team was held in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au/community/forschools/mocktrial/Mocktrial|publisher=The Law Society of New South Wales|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Jodie|title=First Asia-Australia mock trial|journal=The National Legal Eagle|date=10 January 2009|volume=15|issue=2|page=18|url=http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&amp;context=nle|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe===
Mock trials in continental Europe are less coordinated than their UK or US counterparts, but there are a few isolated examples. In Germany, the Faculty of Legal Sciences of the [[University of Regensburg]] organizes the REGINA Mock Trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REGINA Mock Trial: Der Gerichtssimulator|url=http://www.uni-regensburg.de/rechtswissenschaft/fakultaet/medien/regina/mock_trial_flyer_hp.pdf|website=University of Regensburg|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] organizes a mock trial specialized in administrative law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial im Verwaltungsprozessrecht|url=https://www.jura.rw.fau.de/mock-trial-im-verwaltungsprozessrecht-2/|website=Fachbereich Rechtswissenschaft|publisher=Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, there is a mock trial program specialized in [[insurance law]] coordinated by the [[Fernando Peña López|Fundacion INADE-UDC Chair of Risk Management and Insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veredicto Ejemplar|url=https://catedrafundacioninade.org/veredicto-ejemplar/2018|website=Cátedra Fundación INADE-UDC|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Bar Mock Trial}}
The Bar National Mock Trial Competition involves students to take on the roles of [[barrister]]s and [[witness]]es and present their case against teams from other schools. It has been running annually since 1991 with regional tournaments and the national final. There are 2,000 students in years 10 to 13, 300 barristers and advocates, and 90 judges involved in this competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bar National Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.citizenshipfoundation.org.uk/main/comps.php?175|publisher=Citizenship Foundation|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School Mock Court Case Project runs both primary and secondary school competitions primarily in Scotland, although has undertaken a number of international competitions. Currently some 100 schools, circa 3,000 students are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School Mock Court Project- Background|url=https://www.mockcourt.org.uk/background.php|publisher=School Mock Court Case Project SCIO|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=schools-mock-court-project-seeks-legal-tutors|url=https://www.scottishlegal.com/article/schools-mock-court-project-seeks-legal-tutors|publisher=Scottish Legal News|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=dundee-people-dundee-high-school-pupils-win-national-mock-trial-competition|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/dundee-people-dundee-high-school-pupils-win-national-mock-trial-competition/|publisher=DC Thomson Co Ltd|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Competition framework====
Competitive mock trial functions in yearly cycles.  Each year, a case packet is distributed to all participating schools in late summer to early fall.  The case packet is a series of documents including the charges, penal code, stipulations, case law, and jury instructions as well as all [[Exhibit (legal)|exhibits]] and [[affidavit]]s relevant to the case.  During a mock trial, competitors are restricted to only the materials provided in the case packet and may not reference any outside sources.  In order to prepare for competition, teams thoroughly read and analyze the case packet.

National mock trial teams consist of a minimum of six and a maximum of twelve official members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/AMTA%20Rulebook%202012%20HL.pdf |title=American Mock Trial Association Rulebook, Page 16 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The size of state mock trial teams can vary; California, for example, allows up to 25 official team members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crf-usa.org/images/stories/mt_la/2014-15_mock_trial_team_rulebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each team prepares both sides of the case:  prosecution and defense in a criminal trial, plaintiff and defense in a civil action.  Each side is composed of two or three attorneys as well as two or three witnesses, all played by members of the team. Teams must be organized into two sides of five to six players for the prosecution/plaintiff and defense.&lt;ref name = "rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmocktrial.org/fullrules.cfm |title=National High School Mock Trial Championship |publisher=Nationalmocktrial.org |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Public_Resources/Law,_Youth_and_Citizenship/Mock_Trial_Tournament/Mock_Trial_Tournament.htm NYSBA Mock Trial] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that high school mock trial is governed by state bar associations, meaning that cases, rules, and competition structure vary from state to state whereas all of college mock trial is governed by the American Mock Trial Association, meaning that every school uses the same case and is subject to the same rules.

====Procedure====
[[Image:Mock trial closing.jpg|thumb|A [[student]] giving his closing argument during a mock trial]]

The mock trial begins with the judge entering the courtroom. The judge then gives out the instructions to the jury (about what they are to listen to). Then if there is a pretrial motion, the defense and prosecution give their respective pretrial arguments. The judge then lets the prosecution or plaintiff give an opening statement. Following the prosecution/plaintiff's opening statement, the judge may offer the defense to deliver the opening statement during that time as well, or to wait until after the prosecution has presented all of its witnesses. After the opening statements, examination of the witnesses begins. The prosecution/plaintiff calls their witnesses first. Witnesses are sworn in by their team's bailiff/timekeeper. A student competitor attorney for the prosecution/plaintiff does a direct examination of the witness. Once the direct examination is complete, the opposing team may cross-examine the witness. After the cross-examination, if the first team chooses, they may redirect the witness and, likewise, the other team may do a re-cross after this. However, redirect and re-cross examinations are only limited to the scope of the previous examination conducted by opposing counsel. This process is repeated for the two remaining plaintiff witnesses. Once the prosecution/plaintiff have finished with their witnesses, the defense may give their opening statement if not delivered before, and then the process is repeated with the defense witnesses, having the defense attorneys direct and the plaintiff attorneys cross-examine.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt;

Once all of the witnesses have been examined, the trial moves to closing arguments. The prosecutor/plaintiff again goes first and has the option to reserve time before hand for rebuttal. After the defense finishes their closing argument, the plaintiff may give their rebuttal argument if they still have time remaining. In some competitions, the rebuttal is limited to the scope of the defense’s closing argument.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; Time limits are set at each level of competition to prevent the trials from running too long and to keep rounds of competition running smoothly. Time limits are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Time Limits of Mock Trial Competition
!Statement/Examination/Argument
!Time Limit
|-
|Opening Statement
|5 minutes
|-
|Direct and Redirect Examination
|25 minutes
|-
|Cross and Recross Examination
|25 minutes
|-
|Pre-Closing Preparation
|2 minutes
|-
|Closing Argument
|9 minutes
|-
|Rebuttal (Prosecution only)
|Amount of time reserved before closing
|}
Time limits may vary from state-to-state competitions. Please note that time is kept track of by the bailiff/timekeeper, who times their co-counsel's statements, examinations, and arguments. Time is stopped for objections.

==== Objections ====
A main part of Mock Trial is the raising and arguing of objections given by opposing teams. Objections are raised when the opposing counsel attempts to bring in evidence or testimony that go against the rules of evidence. When an objection is raised, the judge may either overrule or sustain it immediately, or ask opposing counsel for their argument about why the testimony/evidence is admissible. Time is paused for objections, so an objection "battle" could go on for hours at a time until the judge makes a ruling. Mock Trial students receive an abridged version of [[Rules of evidence|Rules of Evidence]] to base their objections on in the case packet that contains the witness affidavits and other elements of the court case.

====Judging====
[[Image:Mock trial critique.jpg|thumb|left|Attorney evaluators give a critique at the end of a mock trial competition.]]

There are several different ways that a mock trial can be judged. In one, the judges for scoring the mock trial consist of the presiding judge and two scoring judges, all of whom score the teams. In a second method, there are two scoring judges and the presiding judge, as in the first method, but the presiding judge does not score the teams, rather the judge simply votes or casts a ballot for one team or another.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; In yet another method of judging, there are three scoring judges and the presiding judge is not involved in the scoring of the teams. Often at college invitationals, there are two scoring judges, one of whom doubles as the presiding judge. Since enticing attorneys to judge is notoriously difficult (as judges are rarely compensated with more than a free lunch), it is rare to see more than two judges in a round at most competitions.

Unlike real law, the victorious team does not necessarily have to win on the merits of the case. Instead, evaluators score individual attorneys and witnesses on a 1-10 scale (though some states use different scales for high school competitions) based on each stage of the trial. These consist of the opening statements for the plaintiff and defense, each of the witnesses’ testimony, direct and cross-examination by attorneys, and the closing statements for both sides. The team with the highest total number of points is often, but not always, the team that wins the judge's verdict. Given this method of scoring, it is possible for the defendant to be found guilty or lose the case but for the defense team to still win the round.

In some competitions, points can be deducted from a team’s score for testifying with information outside the scope of the mock trial materials and for unsportsmanlike conduct or abuse of objections. However, scores are completely at a judge's discretion, meaning that scores are subjective based on different evaluation criteria.

====Power matching====
In the first round of the tournament, all of the teams are randomly matched to compete with each other. After the first round of some tournaments, teams are “power matched” to go up against other teams with similar records (e.g. in the second round, a 1-0 team will be matched with another 1-0 team).&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; If there is a tie in record, the judges will use the number of ballots and total points earned to decide the matching.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; This allows for teams to compete with other teams of similar skill.

=====National championship format=====
In the national championship format, which is also employed by invitationals across the country, the tournament is power matched through the last round. While this determines the strongest team at the tournament overall, it does not provide an accurate representation of 2nd, 3rd, 4th place teams, etc., because they might have lost multiple ballots to a strong team who placed first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/mock/tabulation.php |title=The American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Collegemocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Exceptions=====
Of course, there are practical exceptions to the theory of power matching. Tab room coordinators who are creating brackets for each round may deviate from the rules of power matching in order to 1. allow each team to alternate between prosecution/plaintiff and defense between rounds, 2. avoid two teams from the same school competing against each other (Maryland Rule), 3. avoid having a team compete against a team it played in a prior round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tba.org/mocktrial/2010_stateforms/powermatching.pdf ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Power protection=====
When tournaments are power protected, it means that the first rounds of competition are power matched as stated above. In the last round(s), however, the team with the strongest record is paired against the team with the weakest record. This ensures that the best teams do not knock each other out of the running for a rank. Rather, it's anticipated that the stronger team will win and protect their chance at a rank, while there is no harm done to the weaker team who is already out of reach of a trophy. Additionally, this method gives weaker teams exposure to stronger programs that they can learn from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collegemocktrial.org/mock/tabulation_files/0809tabmanualfebruaryupdate_2-3-09.doc |title=American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Levels of competition====

=====Elementary school=====
At the elementary school level, the mock trial guide by [[American Bar Association]] suggests to use role-playing from scripted mock trials such as [[fairy tale]] mock trials as a way to introduce the concept of conflicts, trials, jury verdicts in civil trials, vocabulary of the court, damages, and the roles of individuals portrayed in the trial. Therefore, most of mock trials at this level are non-competitive classroom activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Putting on mock trials.|year=2002|publisher=Division for Public Education, American Bar Association|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=1-59031-154-X|url=http://lre.ncbar.org/media/27617684/mocktrialguide.pdf|edition=[Rev. ed.].}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no national competition for this level. However, a few states offer intrastate competitions. There are a couple difference formats of competitions for this level.

The first format focuses on how the cases are developed such as ''New Jersey Law Fair'' competitions. Students grades 3 to 6 are asked to generate, develop and write the case from their own idea to include details of the facts, issue, witnesses, statements, instructions, sub-issues, concepts and law. As the students at this age range may not know the details of applicable law, students are allowed to create their own law. There are no specific themes, students can choose any age-appropriate topics. The students are encouraged to do a role-playing in a mock trial based on the script that they have developed to involve other students in the classroom as juries in order to refine their case. Each team plays the roles of both side in their case during the mock trial. The winners will perform their case in the real court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law Fair for 3rd through 6thgraders|url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11471/Law%20Fair%202013%20Rules%20Booklet.pdf|publisher=The New Jersey State Bar Foundation|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204030526/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11471/Law%20Fair%202013%20Rules%20Booklet.pdf|archive-date=4 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Carolina, the competition has a different format which focuses more on presentation skills. All teams are given the same case which has been written prior to the competition and students are asked to perform role-playing on the case. ''North Carolina Elementary School Mock Trial Competition'' uses the winning entries from New Jersey Law Fair in the prior year as the cases for students to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Elementary School Mock Trial Competition|url=http://lre.ncbar.org/programs/elementary-mock-trial-competition|publisher=North Carolina Bar Association|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228180514/http://lre.ncbar.org/programs/elementary-mock-trial-competition|archive-date=28 December 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another format is to follow the standard format similar to the high school level but with less technical restriction. All teams are given the same material related to a case and prepare for the competition. Two teams compete in a live mock trial to represent two sides of the case. This format is used in the ''New Hampshire Bar Association's Mock Trial Competition''. However, the first round of the competition is done by video submission where each team performs in both sides of the case. The qualified teams will be invited to the live competition with each team on each side of the case.&lt;ref name="nh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition Handbook|url=http://www.nhbar.org/uploads/pdf/LRE-MT-CompetitionHandbook.pdf|publisher=New Hampshire Bar Association’s Law-Related Education Program|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Middle school=====
Although there is no national competition for middle/junior high school level, there are many intrastate competitions held by state/county level organizers:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; With the exception of New Jersey, all competitions have similar format as in high school competitions with some rules relaxed. In New Jersey, the format is similar to the ''New Jersey Law Fair'' at the elementary school level with two specific themes that the teams can choose to develop their cases.

=====High school=====
The mock trial program was started to allow high school students to experience the courtroom in a hands-on role. The mock trials are set up and structured just like a real court, bound by the same rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalexplorer.com/education/education-mock.asp |title=Mock Trial Education |publisher=Legalexplorer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can help the students to know exactly what role each of the different people in a court (judges, lawyers, witnesses, etc.) do in the judicial system. High school competitions are even held in functional court rooms in the local City Hall to lend additional authenticity to the trial. Cases typically have to do with problems faced by teens, and will usually involve teenagers as witnesses. Each year the case for pre-Nationals competitions alternates between a [[Civil case]] and a [[Criminal case]].

[[File:Mock trial team - Benet Academy.JPG|right|thumb|A high school mock trial team in [[Illinois]]]]
The [[National High School Mock Trial Championship]] started in 1984.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; This first competition consisted of teams from Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; The competition since has grown and now is considered to be an All-State tournament. Each year, various participating states around the country take turns hosting the tournament. The 2011 Championship was held in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]  hosted in 2012, [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] hosted in 2013, [[Madison, Wisconsin]] hosted in 2014, and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] is hosting in 2015. New York State does not participate in the national competition; rather, it has its own intrastate competition consisting of over 350 teams throughout the state. It follows similar rules to that of the national competition. New York has three levels of play, county competition, regional competition, and the finals, which is held in [[Albany, New York]] in May. The state of Maryland also does not compete in the National High School tournament, and thus has their own [[Maryland High School Mock Trial Competition|statewide mock trial competition]] similar to that of New York. New Jersey and North Carolina both pulled out of the NHSMTC competition following the 2005 season due to a refusal by the organization to accommodate an Orthodox Jewish team, Torah Academy of Bergen County, that had won New Jersey's state championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Public_Resources/Law,_Youth_and_Citizenship/Mock_Trial_Tournament/Mock_Trial_Tournament.htm |accessdate=October 17, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both states rejoined in 2010 after their concerns regarding accommodation had been addressed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalmocktrial.org/about/history-and-winners/&lt;/ref&gt;

Each state has its own case every year that is different from the national case. This means that the winners of the state competitions, who move on to nationals, must study and prepare a completely different case in time for the National High School Mock Trial Competition in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalexplorer.com/education/education-mock.asp |title=Law-related Education: Mock Trial main |publisher=Legalexplorer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national competition is governed by National Mock Trial Championship, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalmocktrial.org |title=National High School Mock Trial Championship, Inc |publisher=Nationalmocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====College=====
Inter-collegiate mock trial is governed by the American Mock Trial Association or AMTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegemocktrial.org |title=American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Collegemocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This organization was founded in 1985 by Dean Richard Calkins of Drake Law School and serves as a regulator of mock trial competition at the collegiate level.  AMTA sponsors regional and national-level competitions, writes and distributes case packets and rules, and keeps a registry of mock trial competitors and alumni.&lt;ref name="cooke1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooke |first=Jason |title=American Mock Trial Association |url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/welcome/welcome.php |accessdate=2012-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222093720/http://www.collegemocktrial.org/welcome/welcome.php |archivedate=2012-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case packet is generally written and distributed prior to the scholastic year in August, and case changes are made throughout the season, usually in September, December, and finally in February after Regional competitions and prior to the Opening Round of Championships. Approximately 600 teams from over 350 universities and colleges will compete in AMTA tournaments.  In total, AMTA provides a forum for over 5,300 undergraduate students each academic year to engage in intercollegiate mock trial competitions across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/about-amta/history-/|title=History of AMTA|publisher=American Mock Trial Association|accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the inter-collegiate circuit, a mock trial team consists of three attorneys and three witnesses on each side of the case (plaintiff/prosecution and defense). The attorneys are responsible for delivering an opening statement, conducting direct and cross examinations of witnesses and delivering closing arguments. Witnesses are selected in a [[draft (sports)|sports draft]] format from a pool of approximately eight to 10 available witnesses prior to the round. Typical draft orders are DPDPDP, PPPDDD, or DDPPPD but this may vary substantially between cases. Witnesses may be available only to the plaintiff/prosecution, only to the defense, or to both sides of the case. Witnesses consist of both experts as well as lay witnesses. Judges are usually attorneys or coaches, and in some occasions, practicing judges.

All collegiate mock trial cases take place in the fictional state of Midlands, USA.  Midlands is not geographically situated and falls under the protection of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name="cooke1"/&gt;

======Tournament competition======
A tournament consists of four rounds, two on each side of the case, typically scored by two to three judges in each round.  The season runs in two parts: the invitational season and the regular season. Invitational tournaments are held throughout the fall semester and into early spring across the country.  At invitationals, teams have the opportunity to test out particular case theories and improve as competitors before facing the challenge and pressure of regular season competition.

The regular season begins in late January, starting with regional tournaments. There are typically more than 600 teams spread across 24 regional tournaments. Each school is limited to two post-regional bids to the "Opening Round Championship Series." Though there were once direct bids from Regionals to the National Championship Tournament, these bids no longer exist. 192 teams advance to the Opening Round Championship, which is held at eight different tournament sites. The top teams at each Opening Round Championship Tournament qualify for a berth in the National Championship Tournament. There are 48 total bids to the final tournament.

For 22 years, the National Championship Tournament was held in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], the city in which collegiate mock trial began. The tournament left Iowa for the first time in 2007 when [[Stetson University]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] hosted the Championship. The 2008 National Championship Tournament was held in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. Between 2009-2011, the Championship returned to Des Moines in odd-numbered years, while even-numbered years featured a different venue. The 2010 Championship was hosted by [[Rhodes College]] at courthouses in downtown [[Memphis, Tennessee]], while the 2012 Championship was held in Minneapolis.  Beginning in 2013, future Championships will be awarded solely on a competitive bidding process, although Des Moines, if it bids, will be given preference during "landmark" years, such as anniversaries of AMTA's founding in 1985.  The 2013 Championship was held in [[Washington, D.C.]] with the [[University of Virginia]] handling hosting duties.  The 2014 Championship was held in [[Orlando, Florida]] at the [[Orange County Courthouse (Florida)|Orange County Courthouse]], with the [[University of Central Florida]] serving as the host institution. The 2015 Championship was hosted by the [[University of Cincinnati]], with trials held at the [[Hamilton County Courthouse (Ohio)|Hamilton County Courthouse]] in [[Cincinnati]]. The 2016 Championship was hosted by Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. In 2017, the Championship tournament will be hosted by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] (Stanley Mosk Courthouse) in downtown LA.

======Past championship results======
In 2006, the University of Virginia beat Harvard University to win the National Championship.&lt;ref name="cav"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=26730&amp;pid=1430 |title=Mock Trial team wins national championship |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |publisher=The Cavalier Daily |year=2006 |author=Jacqueline Minneman, Cavalier Daily Associate Editor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310182406/http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=26730&amp;pid=1430 |archivedate=March 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In what was the closest final round in AMTA history, the University of Virginia won the championship by a single point using a tiebreaker, after a three judge panel split with one judge choosing Virginia as the winner, one choosing Harvard, and one calling the round a draw. The University of Virginia's victory ended the then-recent run by UCLA, which had won the two previous national championships.

In 2007, the University of Virginia again defeated Harvard University. This marked the first ever re-match of a previous year's final round. Virginia again won via a split decision, winning two of the three ballots in the final round. Virginia also became the 4th school to repeat as champions, joining UCLA, the University of Iowa, and Rhodes College, which accomplished the feat twice. Harvard University became the second program to finish as runner up in consecutive years, joining the University of Maryland, College Park. Maryland, however, had the distinction of losing to themselves in one of those two defeats.

In 2008, the University of Maryland prevailed over the George Washington University in a split-ballot decision (2-1). This was Maryland's fifth title, giving them more total wins than any other university in AMTA history.

In 2009, Northwood University defeated George Washington University 5-0 to claim its first National Championship.

In 2010, New York University defeated Harvard University 3-1-1 to win its first National Championship. This was Harvard's third championship round appearance in the last five years following its consecutive losses to Virginia.

In 2011, UCLA defeated defending champion New York University 4-1 to claim the Bruins' third title, the third-most in the history of the American Mock Trial Association.

In 2012, Duke defeated Rutgers 2-1, in what was the first championship round appearance for both squads.

In 2013, Florida State University defeated Rhodes College in FSU's first championship round appearance by a 4-1 ballot decision. This was Rhodes' eighth championship round appearance to date.  2013 also marked the first year that the National Championship Tournament had 3 scoring judges per round (instead of 2).

In 2014, UCLA defeated Princeton University in a 3-2 ballot decision.  With this victory, UCLA tied Rhodes for the second-highest record of championships (4 wins), behind University of Maryland, College Park (5 wins).  This round was also Princeton's first championship round appearance.

In 2015, Harvard defeated Yale in a 4-0-1 ballot decision.  This marked Harvard's first championship win, despite having been the runner-up 3 times previously (in 2006, 2007, and 2010).  2015 also marked Yale's first championship round appearance.  Finally, 2015 marked the first year that the case problem for the National Championship Tournament was different from the case schools had been using in competition for the earlier elimination rounds.  (I.e. In the past colleges had argued the same case all year long, but starting in 2015 any team that qualified for the championship tournament was given a brand new case to learn and argue in the span of just a few weeks.)

In 2016, Yale won its first national championship in an 11-3-1 ballot decision, defeating the University of Virginia in the final trial. Yale is one of only nine schools to have competed in the final trial of the National Championship Tournament two years in a row.  2016 also marked the first year that the National Championship Tournament had 5 scoring judges per round, and 15 scoring judges in the final championship round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/about-amta/history-/national-championship-trial-results/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Virginia defeated Yale in a 6-1 ballot decision in a rematch of the 2016 final. Yale's appearance marked the first time in collegiate championship history the same school has appeared three consecutive times in the final championship round.

In 2018, Miami University of Ohio defeated Yale in a 4-3 ballot decision. This was Miami's second championship, the first having been in 2001. Yale extended its record of consecutive championship round appearances to 4, having been the champion in 2016 and the runner-up in 2017 and 2015.

* From 1992 until 2010, the "Maryland Rule" was in effect, which placed both teams from the same school in the same division in order to ensure there wouldn't be another championship round between two teams from the same school. The Maryland Rule was repealed before the 2010-11 season.

======Forums and social media======
Beyond merely competitive interactions, collegiate mock trial has established a presence in cyberspace. Some mock trial teams have created forums for themselves on [[Facebook]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Stanford Mock Trial|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/2200023395/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Miami Mock Trial|url=http://www.facebook.com/groups/2200142332/?ref=ts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoofs of characters from various cases have even made their way onto Facebook with their very own profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Joey Davis|url=https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001739776485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Brett Miller|url=http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001742140118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the American Mock Trial Association has a [[Twitter]] feed which provides updates on procedures and tournament results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter:  College Mock Trial @AMTAMockTrial|url=https://twitter.com/amtamocktrial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable presence of collegiate mock trial on the internet is Perjuries [http://www.perjuries.com], the national online mock trial community. On Perjuries, mock trial competitors, coaches, and alumni can create user accounts and post in a wide range of forums about mock trial and mock trial related issues.  Here, participants can discuss everything from case strategy to incidents in competition that they found humorous.  Furthermore, Perjuries provides a space for competitors to post tournament results and rank their competition.  The site is wildly popular boasting over 5,000 registered users, 2,000 discussions, and nearly 88,000 posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perjuries.com|url=http://www.perjuries.com/forums/forum.php|access-date=2012-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307045832/http://www.perjuries.com/forums/forum.php|archive-date=2012-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Law school=====
In the United States, law schools participate in interscholastic mock trial/trial advocacy. Teams typically consist of several "attorneys" and several "witnesses" on each side. A round consists of two law students acting as "attorneys" for each side.

The trial typically, although not always, begins with motions in limine and housekeeping matters, then moves through opening statements, witness testimony (both direct examination and cross examination), and finishes with a closing argument, sometimes called a summation. Throughout the trial, rules of evidence apply, typically the Federal Rules of Evidence, and objections are made applying these rules.

Every team in a tournament is given the same "problem" or "case", typically several months in advance, but for some tournaments only a few weeks ahead of the tournament's start. The problems can be criminal or civil, which affects many procedural aspects of the trial, for instance the increased rights of a criminal defendant not to testify against himself. The cases are written in an attempt to create an equal chance of either side prevailing, since the main objective is not to identify the winner of the case, but rather the team with superior advocacy skills.

Occasionally the winners of mock trial tournaments receive special awards such as money or invitations to special events, but the status of winning a tournament is significant in and of itself.

In addition, a university may require a mock trial course or courses as a requirement for graduation; among such universities is [[Baylor Law School]], whose third-year Practice Court courses are mandatory for all students and have been since the school's reopening in the 1920s.

Mock Trial Competitions*:
Georgetown White Collar Crime Invitational Mock Trial Competition, [[American Association for Justice]] Student Trial Advocacy Competition (formerly ATLA)
National Civil Trial Competition, Texas Young Lawyers Association/National Trial Competition Mock Trial Competition (NTC), Michigan State University National Trial Advocacy Competition (NTAC), California Association of Criminal Justice (CACJ) Mock Trial Competition, Capitol City Challenge, National Ethics Trial Competition at Pacific McGeorge School of Law, Lone Star Classic National Mock Trial Tournament

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12900">The relationship between '''psychoanalysis and music''' is as old as the history of [[psychoanalysis]] itself. Psychoanalysts have examined musical phenomena, and the relationship has been reciprocal, as also [[musicology|musicologists]] have applied psychoanalysis to their work. [[Music therapy]], too, has utilized psychoanalytic theories.

==History==
[[Sigmund Freud]] discussed shortly some musical phenomena in his book ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1900), but he was more interested in other arts, especially [[literature]] and the [[visual arts]].

Freud’s attitude toward music was ambivalent. Freud described himself as being "ganz unmusikalisch" (totally unmusical).&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1936) Letter to M. Bonaparte, 06.12.36. In letters of Sigmund Freud, 1873-1939.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his much-protested resistance, he could enjoy certain operas such as ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and he used musical metaphors in the context of theory and therapy.

Freud seemed to feel uneasy without a guide from the more rational part. To be emotionally moved by something without knowing what was moving him or why, was an intrinsically anxious experience.&lt;ref&gt;Roazen, P. (1975) Freud and his followers. Harmondsworth: Penguin books, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  The operas he listened were "conversational" and "narrative" forms of music, which is theorized, provided him with some kind of "cognitive control" over the emotional impact of the musical sounds. Cheshire argued that maybe he was jealous and feared the potential therapeutic power of music as a rival to [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheshire, N. M. (1996) The empire of the ear: Freud's problem with music. ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'', 77, 1127-1168.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was up to other early psychoanalysts than Freud to initiate a serious psychoanalytic study of musical phenomena. First of them was the [[musicology|musicologist]] and critic [[Max Graf]] (1873–1958) who presented his views in the "Wednesday meetings" in 1905–1912. Among other pioneers was Desiderius (Dezső) Mosonyi (1888–1945) who published his writings in Hungarian and in German.

The early views of music were reductive and romantic: the composer expresses him- or herself directly in a musical composition;&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, David M. (1993). Freud and Max Graf: On the Psychoanalysis of Music. — ''Psychoanalytic Explorations in Music. Second series'' (eds. Stuart Feder &amp; Richard L. Karmel &amp; George H. Pollock), pp. 279–307. International Universities Press, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt; the reception of music is regressive.&lt;ref&gt;Feder, Stuart — Karmel, Richard L. — Pollock, George H. (1990). Introduction. — ''Psychoanalytic Explorations in Music'' (eds. Stuart Feder &amp; Richard L. Karmel &amp; George H. Pollock), pp. ix–xvii. International Universities Press, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1950, psychoanalytical musicology started to flourish. Within a few years several studies were published by the French [[André Michel (musicologist)|André Michel]] (1951), [[Ernst Kris]] (1952), [[Anton Ehrenzweig]] (1953), [[Theodor Reik]] (1953), and others.

Theodor Reik (1888–1969) was one of Freud’s earliest students. Reik took up the theme of the "haunting melody" in Freud's Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1915–1917) to demonstrate, by contrast to Freud, that musical structure can represent feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Reik, Theodor (1953). ''The haunting melody: Psychoanalytic experiences in life and music'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In Reik's view, [[melody]] can convey emotion far better than words.

Reik showed that music is the voice of the “unknown itself” that may become compulsive in its attempt to convey a secret message.&lt;ref&gt;Reik, Theodor (1953). ''The haunting melody: Psychoanalytic experiences in life and music'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Reik speculated that the reason [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] material sometimes emerges as a melody rather than as mere thoughts may be that melody better indicates moods and unknown feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Reik, Theodor (1953). ''The haunting melody: Psychoanalytic experiences in life and music'', pp. 17–15.&lt;/ref&gt; He did demonstrate that [[songs]] on the [[mind]] could be effectively interacted with in a psychotherapeutic fashion in a way that helped resolve repressed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Reik, Theodor (1953). ''The haunting melody: Psychoanalytic experiences in life and music'', pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flow of studies and articles from the latter part of the twentieth century was summarised in the two-volume essay collection ''Psychoanalytic Explorations in Music'' (1990–1993).

==Modes of approach==
From a methodological point of view, there are several approaches visible in the psychoanalytical study of music and psychoanalytically inspired musicology:&lt;ref&gt;Lång, Markus (2004). ''Psykoanalyysi ja sen soveltaminen musiikintutkimukseen'', pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Introspective studies examine one's musically induced experiences and their relations to the unconscious processes.
# Biographical studies examine musicians' and composers' (auto)biographies and descriptions of musical experiences.
# Psychoanalyses of musical patients are discussed.
# Musical experiences are explained with theories of early personal development.
# The elements of [[opera]] (including the hall, staging, plot, the human voice) have been examined.
# Study of [[film music]].
# Analyses of musical compositions, without reference to the personality of the composer.
# In [[music therapy]], how to lift repressions and work them through.
# In cultural studies, the beliefs, conceptions, and habits related to music can be analyzed to reveal unconscious meanings and thought patterns.

== Future: psychoanalysis, neuroscience and music ==
Recent developments in [[cognitive neuroscience of music]] have led to a new way of looking at [[music and emotion]]. Neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] states that music occupies more areas of the [[brain]] than [[language]] does, and that humans are primarily a musical species.&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, O. (2007). ''Musicophilia, tales of music and the brain'', pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaborating on this idea, psychoanalyst [[Gilbert Rose]] argues that our responsiveness to music begins with the [[nonverbal]] emotional rapport of the earliest [[infant–parent interplay]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose, G. J. (2004). ''Psychoanalysis, Music, Art and Neuroscience'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Reaching back even further, since the [[fetus]] has an active auditory system 3–4 months before [[birth]], the [[rhythm]] of the mothers [[womb]] and the sound of her heartbeat could be the start of our responsiveness to music.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, G. J. (2004).: ''Psychoanalysis, Music, Art and Neuroscience'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroscientist]] [[Antonio Damasio]] states that when an organism interacts with an object, [[nonverbal]] neural images map the [[organism]], the object and the [[interaction]] between them.&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, A. (1999). ''The feeling of what happens.'' New York: Harcourt Brace.&lt;/ref&gt; As psychoanalysis gives verbal insight of non-verbal emotional involvement, and recent [[neurosciences]] found that music is able to contact this non-verbal emotions, music is stated to help the unison of thinking and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, G. J. (2004). ''Psychoanalysis, Music, Art and Neuroscience'', pp. xxx–xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The influence of psychoanalysis on music==
Although psychoanalysis has had some influence on [[Psychoanalysis and literature|literature]] and [[Psychoanalytical film theory|cinema]] since the early 20th century, it is more difficult to discern whether musical compositions have been actually inspired or influenced by psychoanalysis.

One candidate has been put up by [[Erik W. Tawaststjerna]]: in his biography of [[Jean Sibelius]], he repeatedly emphasizes the psychological and even psychoanalytical dimensions of Sibelius' [[Symphony No. 4 (Sibelius)|Fourth Symphony]] (1911). According to Tawaststjerna, the Symphony reflects the psychoanalytical and introspective era when Freud and [[Henri Bergson]] stressed the meaning of the unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Tawaststjerna, Erik (1989). ''Jean Sibelius 3'', pp. 8, 239, 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Even Sibelius himself called his composition "a psychological symphony".&lt;ref&gt;Tawaststjerna, Erik (1989). ''Jean Sibelius 3'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, the psychiatrist [[Christian Sibelius]] (1869–1922), was one of the first scholars to discuss psychoanalysis in [[Finland]]. According to Tawaststjerna, the Fourth Symphony is "one of the most remarkable documents of the psychoanalytical era."&lt;ref&gt;Tawaststjerna, Erik (1989). ''Jean Sibelius 3'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pādodaka''' ([[Sanskrit]]: पादोदक, lit. ''foot-water'') is holy water. Its prepared from bathing the [[Linga]] or [[guru]]'s feet. It is one of the [[Ashtavarana]] or the 'eight protections' of [[Lingayatism]].

This holy water is used in many sacred occasions to call upon good fortune and celestial blessing. It is sprinkled across while entering into a new house, on the newly bought vehicle etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30346">Dr Robert Brill is in the field of archaeological science, best known for his work on the chemical analysis of ancient [[glass]]. Born in the United States of America in 1929, Brill attended West Side High School in Newark, New Jersey, before going on to study for his B.S. degree at Upsala College, also New Jersey (Brill 1993a, Brill 2006, Getty Conservation Institute 2009). Having completed his Ph.D in Physical Chemistry at [[Rutgers University]] in 1954, Brill was to return to Upsala College to teach chemistry himself until 1960 when he joined the staff of the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] as their second research scientist (Corning Museum of Glass, 2009)

Throughout his lengthy career at Corning, where a four-year directorship punctuated his time as a research scientist, Brill was a forerunner in the scientific investigation of glass, glazes and colorants, developing and challenging the usefulness of emerging techniques. His pioneering work with the application of lead and oxygen [[isotope analysis]] in archaeology led him occasionally to add the investigation of metal objects to his portfolio so that, together, his published works number more than 160 (Brill and Wampler 1967). Perhaps the most famous of these is his ''Chemical Analyses of Early Glass'', a sum of his 39 years of work and now a seminal reference guide in the field (Brill 1999).

Brill is a strong proponent of interdisciplinary cooperation as well as the collaboration between scientists across the world, and has served since 1982 on the [[International Commission on Glass]]. Within this he founded TC17, the technical committee for the Archaeometry of Glass, which lists among its aims the ‘promotion of collaboration among glass specialists in widely separated countries’ and the stimulation and encouragement of glass scientists ‘in developing countries’  (Archaeometry of Glass 2005). His internationalism is aptly demonstrated by his study of glasses from around the world, with his attentions most recently being focused on those from the Silk Road. Here, as with other areas of Brill's remarkable career, it seems he was attracted by the lack of previous study and the need for further development in the field. Seeing a disparity between contemporary knowledge of glasses from the western world and those from East Asia, Brill was keen to add insight to a hitherto unexploited field and, as such, has gone on to contribute a great deal to Silk Road studies (Brill 1993b).

The broad span of Brill's career allows this paper to provide only an abridged synopsis of his métier and published works to date. Focusing on Brill's achievements during the decades after he joined the Corning Museum in February 1960, it aims to highlight areas in which Brill pioneered new techniques and improved existing ones, offering summaries of major publications and proposing sources the interested reader may turn to for more information (Brill 1999).

==The 1960s==
The 1960s saw Brill beginning to develop the analytical techniques that would define the early years of his career at Corning, and yet the scope of his interest within glass remained vast. Indeed, 1961 saw Brill pen a letter to Nature with a colleague, that was a ‘bombshell’, according to Newton, in the field of glass-dating (1971, 3). Here Brill suggested that the rather enigmatic weathering crust found to form on buried glass objects over time could be used to date the object in a method rather similar to [[dendrochronology]], using the separate layers of the shiny lamination (Brill 1961, Brill and Hood 1961, Newton 1971). Whilst in dendrochronology the tree-rings account simply for the tree's annual growth, in the weathering crust on glass Brill suggested the accumulation of a layer of laminate might respond to some kind of annual event of climatic change (Brill 1961). Unfortunately, despite the examples of the method's successful applications provided by Brill, such as the almost accurate count of 156 layers on a bottle-base from the York River submerged in 1781 and excavated in 1935, the technique largely failed to convince and did not see widespread adoption (Brill 1961, Newton 1971).

===Isotope analysis===
The most important of these techniques would prove to be Brill's pioneering application of lead isotope analysis, hitherto used only in [[geology]], to archaeological objects. Brill first presented this idea at the 1965 Seminar in Examination of Works of Art, held at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, but the first widely published account of the method seems to be Brill and Wampler's 1967 article in the ''American Journal of Archaeology''. Here, Brill and Wampler outlined how the technique could be used to [[provenance]] the lead contents of archaeological objects to lead ore sources around the world, based on the isotopic signature of various leads, which relates them to ‘ores occurring in different geographical areas’ (1967, 63). These different areas have different signatures because they are of varying geological age, something reflected by the individual lead isotopes which form only after the radioactive decay of [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] (Brill et al. 1965, Brill and Wampler 1967). While the lead isotope ratios used for provenancing are different, they are not unique: areas geologically similar will yield similar lead isotope signatures (Brill 1970). Furthermore, if leads were salvaged and mixed in ancient times, the isotope ratio will be compromised (Brill 1970). Aside from these two limitations, there is little else that could affect the lead isotope reading an object would yield. As such, Brill's method was greeted enthusiastically and he went on to develop the technique, as well as oxygen isotope analysis, in his 1970 publication. Here he demonstrated how the technique could be used both to classify early glasses and to a certain extent characterize the ingredients from which they were made (1970, 143).

===Chemical-analytical round robin===
Returning to 1965, this year saw Brill launch another important innovation in glass analysis, the comparison of interlaboratory experiments in order to verify analytical results (Brill 1965). ‘Originally inspired by a plea from W E S Turner’, according to Freestone, Brill first mooted his idea at the ''VIIth International Congress on Glass'', in Brussels (Brill 1965a, I. Freestone, ''pers. comm.'' 2009). It wasn’t until the ''VIIIth International Congress on Glass'' in 1968, however, that Brill fully launched his concept of an ‘analytical [[round robin test|round robin]]’, having distributed a number of reference glasses to be tested in different laboratories using a range of current techniques including [[X-ray fluorescence]] and [[neutron activation analysis]] (1968, 49). When discussing his motive for the experiment, Brill aptly stated: 'The truth is that the chemical analysis of glasses is a difficult undertaking and still remains in some senses an art' (1968, 49). By conducting the round robin experiment, Brill hoped the results gathered from different laboratories would help ‘correlate [...] earlier results’ and ‘[[calibrate]] future analyses in reference to one another’, as well as suggest which out of the analytical procedures used was the most accurate and effective (1968, 49). The results of the round robin were presented at the 'IXth International Congress on Glass' in 1971, and showed that, as Brill suspected, there was poor agreement between certain identified elements, and therefore these might be ‘troublesome’ generally across analyses (1971, 97). These included calcium, aluminium, lead and barium, among others (Brill 1971). Aside from their correctional potential, the results, from 45 different laboratories in 15 countries, also provided an enormous data set from which, Brill suggested, the participants could ‘evaluate their own methods and procedures against the findings of other analysts’ (1971, 97). At the time, Brill could hardly have suspected that the data would go on to have such great import, but Croegaard's generation of preferred glass compositions, from statistical analysis of the data, were used successfully by many people until Brill's own reference guide was published in 1999 (I. Freestone, 'pers. comm.', 2009).

===The Middle East===
It should not be thought that Brill spent the entire decade ensconced in the Corning laboratory; he made various forays to the Middle East, including accompanying Wertime's 1968 survey of the ancient technologies of Iran, alongside other great minds such as the noted ceramicist, Frederick Matson (UCL Institute for Archaeo-Metallurgical Studies 2007). In the years 1963-1964, the Corning Museum of Glass and the University of Missouri, following a long history of excavation at the necropolis of Beth She'Arim, conducted an examination of a huge slab of glass, some 2000 years old, that had been languishing in an ancient cistern (Brill and Wosinski 1965). Brill cannot recall who first suggested this slab, measuring 3.4m by 1.94m, could be made of glass, but the only way to test it was to drill a core through its 45&amp;nbsp;cm thickness and analyse it (Brill 1967, Brill and Wosinski 1965). On analysis of the core, Brill found that the glass was devitrified and stained, and not very homogenous, with a presence of wollastonite crystals throughout (1965, 219.2). Investigation of the manufacture technology required to produce the slab, suggested that in order to produce such a slab of glass, it would have been necessary to heat over eleven tons of batch material, and sustain it at around 1050˚C for between five and ten days (Brill 1967)! His initial interpretation was that the glass must have been heated either from above or from the sides using a kind of tank furnace; a hypothesis that was proven accurate when excavation underneath the slab suggested it had been melted ''in situ'', in a tank whose floor was a bed of limestone blocks with a thin parting layer of clay (Brill and Wosinski 1965, Brill 1967). Brill's interpretation, that the slab and its surroundings suggest ‘some early form of [[reverberatory furnace]]’ was the first suggestion of the use of tank furnaces in early glassmaking (1967, 92). The evidence at Beth She’arim encouraged further innovative thought because whilst the slab represented glass production on a grand scale, no associated evidence for glass working was found. Brill had already suspected that historical glassmaking occurred in two phases, the heavy ‘engineering’ stage when the glass is formed from the batch ingredients and the ‘crafting’ stage when the glass is formed into artefacts (Brill, pers. comm., 2009). These stages could occur in combination at one location, or at two differing locales, and the time span of production after the initial glass melt is highly flexible. For Brill, the idea of this ‘dual nature of all glassmaking’ was ‘crystallized’ at Beth She’Arim, where only the raw glass production was represented, and would be reinforced later by the contrasting evidence, where working was favoured over production, found at Jalame, as discussed below (Brill, pers. comm., 2009).

==The 1970s==
Aside from the aforementioned published results of his analytical round robin and his lead and oxygen isotope studies in the early 1970s, the decade saw Brill publish comparatively little, perhaps due to his post as director at The Corning Museum of Glass. Those publications he did pen are largely concerned with the development of lead isotope analysis and are listed in the further reading section. Alas, before Brill could be named Director, however, the museum was to be blighted by an enormous flood, ‘possibly the greatest single catastrophe borne by an American museum’ according to Buechner, Brill's successor in 1976 (1977, 7).

===The Corning flood===
The flood was brought to Corning by [[Hurricane Agnes]], a tropical storm that filled the Chemung River system to bursting until, on the morning of June 23, 1972, the river breached its banks and decimated the town (Martin and Edwards 1977). The Corning Glass Centre was under around twenty feet of water on the lower level's west side, while the museum itself was filled to a water-level of five feet and four inches (Martin and Edwards 1977). 528 of the museum's objects were damaged, the library's rare books were ruined and paper index systems, data and catalogues were all lost (Martin and Edwards 1977). In the wake of this destruction, Brill was named Director, so that his time holding this position, from 1972-1975, would be spent overseeing the complete restoration of the museum. Buechner praises how Brill 'painstakingly' prepared the insurance claim that would support the museum throughout the renovation process and facilitate the replacement of many wonderful objects (1977, 7). Under Brill's auspices, the Corning Museum of Glass was reopened just thirty-nine days after the event, on the 1st August, but it would be another four years before the collection and library were restored to their former glory (Buechner 1977).

==The 1980s==
In 1982, Brill joined the International Commission on Glass, ‘the world’s leading organization of glass scientists and technologists’ according to the Corning Museum (2009). The International Commission functions through various technical committees, among which Brill saw an opening for TC17, the committee for the Archaeometry of Glass, which he founded shortly after joining. The main purpose of TC17, whose members met for the first time in Beijing in 1984, is ‘to bring together glass scientists, archaeologists and museum curators to present and discuss the results of research on early glass and glassmaking and on the conservation of historical glass objects’, as expressed in their mission statement (Archaeometry of Glass 2005). Brill was to chair this committee until 2004 and received the W E S Turner Award from the International Commission of Glass on his departure, in recognition of his contribution as founder (Corning Museum of Glass 2009).

===Jalame===
One of the on-running projects of the Corning Museum of Glass published the excavation report from their many field seasons at the ancient glass factory in Jalame, in Late Roman Palestine (Brill 1988, Schreurs and Brill 1984). Brill was called upon to conduct scientific investigations of the huge amount of material generated at the site, in order to exploit the full potential of the artefacts; after all, the site was being excavated specifically because of its role as a glass factory (Brill 1988). Of the vast quantity of glass fragments from Jalame, both vessel sherds and [[cullet]], most were aqua and green and all were soda-lime-silica glasses melted in highly [[Redox|reducing]] conditions (Schreurs and Brill 1984). Where the melting conditions had been increasingly reducing, a ferri-sulfide [[chromophore]] complex was shown to have formed, thus changing the bluey-aqua colour of the glass to an olive, or even an amber shade (Schreurs and Brill 1984). Despite these colour variations, Brill's further chemical analysis showed the vessel glasses to be highly homogeneous in composition, apart from a clear divide where around 40 glasses demonstrated the intentional addition of [[manganese]] (Brill 1988). Brill conducted an investigation of the furnace at Jalame, nicknamed the Red Room, in which there was a mysterious absence of glass finds of any kind (Brill 1988). Whilst work at Beth She’Arim had eventually found there to be five firing chambers responsible for heating the one tank, the fragmentary remains at Jalame made it very difficult to interpret the furnace set-up, apart from the fact that they believed there to have been only one firing chamber (Brill 1988).

===The Institute of Nautical Archaeology===
In the late eighties Brill was to contribute various studies to the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, following the excavation of a number of exciting shipwrecks including the ''Serçe Liman'', and the ''Ulu Burun'' (Barnes et al. 1986, Brill 1989). Here Brill's own technique of lead isotope analysis was to provide a means for provenancing items aboard ship, and thus determine the ship's origin and her ports-of-call. The excavators of the ''Serçe Liman'' wanted to know whether she was [[Byzantine]] or Islamic, a complicated question for lead isotope analysis as the lead ores of the Eastern Mediterranean share geographical characteristics and therefore overlap (Barnes et al. 1986). Using 900 lead net sinkers divided into six loose groupings, Brill found groups III, V and VI to be Byzantine, that is with ores found in modern-day Turkey (Barnes et al. 1986). Group I, however, was taken to be most indicative of the ship's origin; this group contained net sinkers, but also two ceramic glazes and three glass vessels, all sharing virtually identical lead ores with only one isotopic match, ‘an ore from Anguran, northwest of [[Tehran]]’ according to Barnes et al. (1986, 7).

===The origins of Silk Road research===
Brill's submissions to the ''XIVth International Congress on Glass'', which took place in [[New Delhi]] in 1986, can be seen to represent the origins of his work on the Great Silk Road, the impressive trade route carrying goods from the East through India to Europe. Here, chemical analysis of Early Indian glasses would help Brill not just to determine the ingredients and techniques of production, but ‘to make certain broad generalizations as to regions or periods of manufacture’, and therefore to follow an object's movement along the trade route (1987, 1). For the XIVth Congress, Brill conducted [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]] (AAS) and optical emission spectroscopy (OES) on samples of 38 glasses from India, and the success of his method was made clear when he was able to separate 21 samples away from those made in the Middle East and Europe (Brill 1987). Here the glasses were shown to have mixed alkali compositions, a feature that is ‘rare among glasses from more westerly sources’, and therefore Brill concluded that they had definitely been manufactured in India (1987, 4). Brill also collaborated with Mckinnon to conduct chemical analyses of some glass samples from [[Sumatra]], Indonesia, the results of which would be the ‘first data of their kind from this island’ (1987, 1). The results of the study, which also used samples from Java, another important location for the Silk Road, were hoped by McKinnon and Brill to ‘stimulate a greater awareness of glass in the economy [...] of ancient Sumatra and further new lines of research in the archaeology of the region’ (1987, 1).

==The 1990s==
The beginning of the 1990s saw Brill accorded the Archaeological Institute of America's Pomerance Award for scientific contributions to archaeology; however the decade mostly reflects Brill's continuing dedication to Asian glasses and the study of the Silk Road (Archaeological Institute of America 2009). In ''Scientific Research in Early Chinese Glass'', Brill reflected that in comparison to the knowledge of glassmaking in the West, ‘little is known about Chinese glass and about the role it played in the overall unfolding of glass history on a worldwide basis’ (1991, vii). One reason for this is that glass was never produced in the East in such great quantities as it was in the West but also that archaeological Chinese glasses are often prone to problems (Brill 1991). The difficulties of analysing Chinese glasses were reflected later in the publication where, following the chemical investigation of 71 samples, Brill found that identifying the ‘basic formulation’, or ‘any of the primary batch materials’ of the glasses was still almost impossible (Brill et al. 1991). Brill had greater success in differentiating between Chinese glass samples when using lead isotope analysis, a method that has proven effective in the first instance of identifying Chinese glass as the leads used here are different from those anywhere else in the world (Brill, Barnes et al. 1991). Brill found his Chinese samples to fall into two distinct groups, possessing on one hand the highest, and on the other the lowest, lead isotope ratios he had ''ever'' encountered (Brill, Barnes et al. 1991). As such, he was able to show that despite the striking similarity in the glasses’  chemical composition and appearance, the ores from which their leads were sourced must have been from very geologically-different mines (Brill, Barnes et al. 1991).

Brill conducted further investigations of ancient Asian glasses for the Nara Symposium on the Silk Road's maritime route in 1991, ‘to demonstrate [...] that chemical analyses can be useful for learning how glass was traded along the Desert, Steppe, and Maritime Routes of the Silk Road’ (1993a, 71), as well as providing a more technical discussion on glass and glassmaking in China for the Glass Art Society's Toledo Conference in 1993 (Brill 1993b). Further lead isotope analysis, this time on Chinese and central Asian pigments, was conducted with a larger team for the Getty's Conservation of Ancient Sites on the Silk Road, which saw Brill et al. launching studies that held incredible potential for understanding ‘chronological or stylistic differences among Buddhist cave paintings’, or ‘distinguish[ing] between original and repainted parts of individual works’ (1993, 371).

===''Chemical Analyses of Early Glasses''===
In 1999, Brill published the sum of 39 years worth of results from his chemical investigations at Corning in two volumes of reference material with a third forthcoming (Brill 1999). Brill was reluctant to publish the data without any accompanying interpretation, but he felt that the most important factor was to quickly release the material into a wider sphere, made ‘readily accessible to the scientific community’ (1999, 8). Of Corning's 10,000 research artefacts, the master catalogue contains 6,400 samples, an abbreviated catalogue, or AbbCat, of which is presented in the two volumes (1999, 11). Nineteen geographical, typological or chronological categories of glass samples are recorded, spanning Brill's various research projects and collaborations, from Egypt to the East (Brill 1999). It also records the results of oxygen isotope analyses, reminding us that Brill was ever one for the integration of different investigative methods.

==Brill's legacy==
Since 2000, Dr Brill's interest in Silk Road studies and ancient glass compositions has continued, but his publication rate has slowed somewhat. His years of prolific publication, however, and his willingness to analyse glass from almost every situation have provided the archaeometry of glass with a bounty of reference material, as reflected by the ''Chemical Analyses of Early Glasses''.  Despite his official retirement from the Corning Museum of Glass on May 31, 2008, he returned to the laboratory the next day and continues to work, showing no intention of enjoying a retirement proper any time soon (Brill, ''pers. comm.'', 2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4051">'''Sandra Risa Leiblum''' (1943–2010) was an American author, lecturer, and researcher in [[sexology]].

==Biography==
Leiblum was born in [[Brooklyn, NY]], earned her B.A. from [[Brooklyn College]] and graduated with a Ph.D. in [[psychology]] from the [[University of Illinois]], [[Urbana-Champaign]], Illinois. She completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the  [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] Medical Center, Denver, Colorado.  In 1972 she joined the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry of UMDNJ, [[Robert Wood Johnson Medical School]]. During her career she studied sexual issues in many circumstances addressing among others  [[transgender]] situations, [[infertility]], and [[menopause]]. She was on the editorial board of the ''[[Journal of Sex Education and Therapy]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Gay and Lesbian Social Services]]''.  Among the honors she received were the ''Masters and Johnson Lifetime Achievement Award'' (awarded by the Society for Sex Therapy and Research in 2001) and the ''Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award'' (awarded by the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex for distinguished contributions to sexuality research over a lifetime in 2003). She was the first president the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health in 2000 and a past president of the Society for Sex Therapy and Research, as well as a Fellow of the [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]].

In 2001, Leiblum described the [[Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder]] as a new syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Leiblum | first1 = SR | last2 = Nathan | first2 = S |title=Persistent sexual arousal syndrome: a newly discovered pattern of female sexuality| journal=[[J Sex Marital Ther]]| year = 2001 | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 365–380 | doi=10.1080/009262301317081115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Science Week Ireland''' is an annual week-long event in Ireland each November, celebrating [[science]] in our everyday lives. Science Week is an initiative of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahlstrom|first1=Dick|title=Science Week offers parents a look at alternative paths for students|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/innovation/science-week-offers-parents-a-look-at-alternative-paths-for-students-1.3292760|website=The Irish Times Online|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the largest science festival in the country, engaging tens of thousands of members of the general public in workshops, science shows, talks, laboratory demonstrations, science walks and other science-related events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Foundation Ireland Events|url=http://www.sfi.ie/events/|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Week is a collaboration of events involving industry, colleges, schools, libraries, teachers, researchers and students throughout Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key objective of Science Week is to inspire young people to take up careers in area|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/key-objective-of-science-week-is-to-inspire-young-people-to-take-up-careers-in-area-1.1971458|website=Irish Times Online|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Science Week supports Science Foundation Ireland’s mission to catalyse, inspire and guide the best in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) education and public engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SFI Discover Funding Programme|url=http://www.sfi.ie/engagement/sfi-discover/|website=sfi.ie|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate aim of this effort is that Ireland will have the most engaged and scientifically informed public by 2020 as outlined in Science Foundation Ireland’s strategy Agenda 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Foundation Ireland Agenda2020|url=http://www.sfi.ie/resources/Agenga-2020.pdf|website=sfi.ie|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also aligns to the national science innovation strategy, Innovation 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovation 2020|url=https://dbei.gov.ie/en/Publications/Innovation-2020.html|publisher=Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Over the years, Science Week Ireland has grown from a small pilot initiative to a large promotional and event engine to its current identity as a recognised vehicle for regional activity supported by a national promotional campaign.&lt;ref name="oak1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahlstrom|first1=Dick|title=Science Week: From small acorn to giant oak tree . . .|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sponsored/science-week-from-small-acorn-to-giant-oak-tree-1.2403471|website=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The first Science Week in Ireland was held in 1996.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; It was organised by Forfás on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation under the name 'Information Technology and Science Week'. The week aimed to raise general awareness of the benefits of science and information technology to people, young and old throughout society. In 1997 it was renamed as Science Week. Professional bodies, voluntary groups, colleges, businesses and the public sector combined to organise 50 events countrywide.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; Events included conferences, lectures, interactive exhibitions, debates, and competitions for primary school students. 

SFI took over Science Week from the Forfás Discover Science and Engineering programme in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New legislation to focus scientific research on turning good ideas into good jobs|url=https://www.irishbuildingmagazine.ie/2012/12/12/new-legislation-to-focus-scientific-research-on-turning-good-ideas-into-good-jobs|publisher=Irish Building Magazine|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Week continued to grow and develop over the following years into what it represents today, a week-long&lt;ref name="sfi ie1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Week|url=http://www.sfi.ie/engagement/science-week/|website=sfi.ie|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebration of STEM public engagement, enhancing the public’s interest in STEM and enabling them to see the relevance of STEM to their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Foundation Ireland Discover Programme Call 2017|url=http://www.sfi.ie/funding/funding-calls/sfi-discover-programme/1.-SFI-Discover-Programme-Call-2017-FINAL.pdf|website=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science Week 2007 ==
Science Week 2007 took place between 11–18 November and the theme was "Surrounded by Science".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kildare.ie/community/notices/education/surrounded_by_science.asp Article on Science Week - Kildare.ie website]&lt;/ref&gt; The programme of events set out to illustrate that behind the everyday objects in our lives is a great inventor, scientist or engineer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10270">The '''Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation (SMGF)''' was an independent [[DNA]] and genealogical research institution with the goal of demonstrating how the peoples of the world are related. SMGF collected DNA samples and genealogical information from individuals across the globe to establish these connections.

== History ==
SMGF originated in 1999 and was inspired by several conversations between inventor and philanthropist [[James LeVoy Sorenson]] and [[Brigham Young University]] professor Dr. [[Scott Woodward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hart|first=John L.|title=Unlocking DNA|url=http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/45453/Unlocking-DNA.html|accessdate=July 26, 2011|newspaper=[[Church News]]|date=April 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Sorenson envisioned the development of a [[genetic genealogy|genetic-genealogical]] blueprint of all humankind.  This blueprint, as developed by Dr. Woodward, would show how closely humans are related to one another, demonstrating the familial relationships between unique individuals.  The collection of DNA samples and associated family pedigrees began in 2000, beginning first with Brigham Young University students, and quickly branching outside of Utah, then to the rest of the world.

In 2003, SMGF moved its operations from the Brigham Young University campus to Salt Lake City.  SMGF also outsourced all of its laboratory work to [[Sorenson Genomics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sorensongenomics.com/about-us/|title=Sorenson Genomics - About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; freeing researchers to create a publicly available online repository.  This repository was known as the Sorenson Database.

SMGF collected more than 100,000 DNA samples and familial pedigrees from donors around the world, all of which were available in the Sorenson Database.  This database was acquired by [[Ancestry.com]] prior to its launch of AncestryDNA when they purchased [[GeneTree]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourgeneticgenealogist.com/2012/05/ancestrycom-buys-genetree-and-launches.html|title=Ancestry.com Buys GeneTree (Another Competitor) and Launches Their New Autosomal DNA Product to Subscribers|publisher=Your Genetic Genealogist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genetree was SMGF's commercial arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestryinsider.org/2012/05/ancestrycom-launches-ancestrydna.html|title=Ancestry.com Launches AncestryDNA|publisher=Ancestry Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sorenson Database ==
The Sorenson Database contained more than 100,000 DNA samples and familial pedigrees, encompassing 2.8 million genealogical records and 2.4 million genotypes.

The Sorenson Database matched genetic information with familial surnames.  A person searching through the database was able to find both genetic and genealogical matches, but could search using either DNA haplotypes or familial surname.  The average family pedigree contained six generations of pedigree information (more than 150 years) with over 6 million genetically linked ancestors.

There were only two areas for individuals to search within the Sorenson Database, a [[Y chromosome]] database and a [[mitochondrial DNA]] database.  The Y-DNA database allowed males to search their direct paternal line; the mtDNA database allowed both males and females search their direct maternal line.  According to ISOGG.org, Sorenson "also had large X chromosome and autosomal STR databases, but these databases were never made publicly available."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isogg.org/wiki/Sorenson_Molecular_Genealogy_Foundation|title=''Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation'' ISOGG Wiki|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Y-chromosome Database:

The Y chromosome is passed on from father to son with little changes to Y-DNA. Surnames also tend to generally be passed on from father to son. The Sorenson Database used Y-chromosome genetic markers and surnames to determine common ancestors.  Users could share DNA results and pedigree charts obtained from other sources. They could search for ancestors using their surname, genetic marker values obtained through their DNA analysis, or a combination of the two. The database also had genetic marker default values if users did not have their own genetic information.

A Y-DNA test analyzes similarities in Y-chromosome DNA markers, corresponding to specific locations on the Y chromosome. Markers have a [[Short tandem repeat]] (STR) that involve repeats of 2-5 DNA base pairs. At Sorenson labs, the number of STRs in a 36-marker haplotype was compared between the sample given and the database to determine relatedness. The [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) was also examined. Y-chromosome SNPs are rare and can be used to separate populations of men or haplogroups and can be used in population studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfg.stanford.edu/SNP.html|title=''Simple Fool's Guide to Population Genomics'', Stanford University - Palumbi Lab|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitochondrial Database:
 
Both males and females inherit their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from their mother, which allows mtDNA to determine a maternal line. The Sorenson Database compared mitochondrial DNA from over 76, 000 people in their mitochondrial database to find cousins connected across generations. Users could share their mtDNA results from other commercial labs.

The mtDNA test examines three regions of the D-loop of mtDNA: HVR1, HVR2 and HVR3 which is called the [[Hypervariable region]]. Mutations in these areas of mtDNA are extremely rare and have likely not changed between maternal-line cousins within the last 500 years. Therefore, looking at mutations in these areas can determine maternal lineages. Samples of mtDNA submitted to the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation were compared to the [[Cambridge Reference Sequence]] (CRS) of mtDNA then to each other for relatedness.

== Participation ==
One of the perhaps overly ambitious missions of SMGF was to connect any two individuals in the world, showing to both how they are related.  In order to accomplish this goal, SMGF collected DNA samples and correlated familial pedigrees from participants around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Alan (3 July 2011). [http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/07/03/7006641-africans-visit-their-american-cousins]. Published by [[MSNBC]]. Last accessed 19 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching their 100,000 sample goal, SMGF modified their goals to focus less on collecting new samples and more on analysis of previous samples.

New participants were still accepted through SMGF's subsidiary, [[GeneTree]] for many years. Also, previous SMGF participants could buy their DNA report through GeneTree.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title =Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation’s Genetic Genealogy Database Crosses Historic Milestone with 100,000 DNA Samples, Aided by Multi-Million Dollar Gift from Founder|publisher =Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation|date =April 28, 2010| url =http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100428005716/en/Sorenson-Molecular-Genealogy-Foundation%E2%80%99s-Genetic-Genealogy-Database|accessdate = 19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another goal of SMGF was to advance research in the scientific field of molecular genealogy.  SMGF conducted research to identify additional DNA markers which link an individual to their genealogical family, however direct or distant. SMGF researchers published a number of research papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100629005443/en/World-15-%E2%80%98Founding-Mothers%E2%80%99-Latest-Study-Sorenson|title=''New World Had at Least 15 Founding Mothers''|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate = 19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which involved collaborations with other researchers.

DNA collection for the project initially involved drawing blood samples; since August 2002, the SMGF used a mouthwash-based collection method (GenetiRinse), which has the advantage that it can be mailed to participants living in remote areas.

== Controversy and Shutdown ==
In May 2015, Ancestry.com took down the SMGF website, citing that "the site has been used for purposes other than what was intended, forcing [Ancestry.com] to cease operations on the site."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title =RIP Sorenson - A crushing loss|date =May 15, 2015| url =https://dna-explained.com/2015/05/15/rip-sorenson-a-crushing-loss/|accessdate =May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action by Ancestry.com was taken in response to news revelations claiming that the SMGF database had been used by Ancestry.com and local law enforcement, without any court oversight [e.g., a warrant] and in violation of SMGF's privacy policy, to try to tie criminal suspects to crime scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title =How Private DNA Data Led Idaho Cops on a Wild Goose Chase and Linked an Innocent Man to a 20-year-old Murder Case|date =May 1, 2015| url =https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/how-private-dna-data-led-idaho-cops-wild-goose-chase-and-linked-innocent-man-20|accessdate =May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the actions in the case by all parties, particularly Ancestry.com and the local law enforcement, were eventually recognized to have followed proper constitutional procedures of privacy protection and court oversight in the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title =Facts Matter!|date =May 3, 2015| url =http://legalgenealogist.com/blog/2015/05/03/facts-matter/|accessdate =May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scandal significantly impacted Ancestry.com's reputation and led to the decision to deactivate the website and mothball the SMGF database.

'''Convergence''' is a phenomenon in telecommunication and media industry to integrate services, content offerings, and means of communication under one core technology or ecosystem. It includes cultural, society, business, service, technology, regulatory, and content aspects that need to be considered.

It’s practical application manifests in various concrete examples, as e.g. Internet, digital convergence, media convergence, home applications, and telecommunication. This article describes a wide are of aspects of convergence, with illustrations of convergent merging technologies (NBIC, nano-, bio-, info- and cognitive technologies) and convergence of media technology.

==Definitions==
"'''''Convergence''' is a deep integration of knowledge, tools, and all relevant activities of human activity for a common goal, to allow society to answer new questions to change the respective physical or social ecosystem. Such changes in the respective ecosystem open new trends, pathways, and opportunities in the following divergent phase of the process''" (Roco 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roco | first1 = MC | year = 2002 | title = 'Coherence and divergence of megatrends in science and engineering | url =https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1020157027792 | journal = J Nanopart Res | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 9–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bainbridge and Roco 2016 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bainbridge | first1 = W.S. | last2 = Roco | first2 = M.C. | year = 2016 | title = 'Science and technology convergence: with emphasis for nanotechnology-inspired convergence | url = | journal = J. Nanoparticle Res. | volume = 18 | issue = | page = 211 | doi=10.1007/s11051-016-3520-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[File:Leatherman-Charge-XTi.jpg|thumb|A converged mechanical tool, the multitool. Within one device, it provides many tools.]]
Siddhartha Menon defines convergence, in his ''Policy initiative Dilemmas on Media Covergence: A Cross National Perspective'', as integration and digitalization. Integration, here, is defined as "a process of transformation measure by the degree to which diverse media such as phone, data broadcast and information technology infrastructures are combined into a single seamless all purpose network architecture platform".&lt;ref&gt;Siddhartha, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Digitalization is not so much defined by its physical infrastructure, but by the content or the medium. [[Jan van Dijk]] suggests that "digitalization means breaking down signals into bytes consisting of ones and zeros".&lt;ref&gt;Van Dijk, J. (1999). The network society. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menon, Siddhartha. "Policy Initiative Dilemmas On Media Convergence: A Cross National Perspective." Conference Papers – International Communication Association (2006): 1–35. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. Web. 20 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Convergence is defined by Blackman, 1998, as a trend in the evolution of technology services and industry structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blackman | first1 = C | year = 1998 | title = Convergence between telecommunications and other media: how should regulation adapt? | url = | journal = Telecommunication Policy | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 163–170 | doi=10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convergence is later defined more specifically as the coming together of telecommunications, computing and broadcasting into a single digital bit-stream.&lt;ref&gt;Collin, 1998; Gates, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conlins | first1 = R | year = 1998 | title = Back to the future: Digital Television and Convergence in the United Kingdom | url = | journal = Telecommunication Policy | volume = 22 | issue = 4–5| pages = 383–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gate | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Convergence and competition: Technological change, industry concentration and competition policy in the telecommunications sector | url = | journal = University of Toronto Faculty of Law Review | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 83–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mueller stands against the statement that convergence is really a takeover of all forms of media by one technology: digital computers.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mueller | first1 = M | year = 1999 | title = Digital Convergence and its consequences | url = | journal = Javnost/The Public | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 11–27 | doi=10.1080/13183222.1999.11008716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media technological convergence''' is the tendency that as [[technological change|technology changes]], different technological system sometimes evolve toward performing similar tasks. Digital convergence refers to the convergence of four industries into one conglomerate, ITTCE ([[IT industry|Information Technologies]], [[telecommunication industry|Telecommunication]], [[Consumer Electronics]], and  [[Entertainment industry|Entertainment]]). Previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications), and video can now share resources and interact with each other synergistically. Telecommunications convergence (also called "network convergence") describes emerging [[telecommunications]] technologies, and [[network architecture]] used to migrate multiple communications services into a single network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworkingchannel.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid100_gci1310061,00.html|title=What is network convergence? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=SearchITChannel|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically this involves the converging of previously distinct media such as [[telephony]] and [[data communications]] into common interfaces on single devices, such as most smart phones can make phone calls and search the web.

'''Media convergence''' is the interlinking of computing and other information technologies, media content, media companies and communication networks that have arisen as the result of the evolution and popularization of the Internet as well as the activities, products and services that have emerged in the digital media space. Closely linked to the multilevel process of media convergence are also several developments in different areas of the media and communication sector which are also summarized under the term of [[media deconvergence]]. Many experts{{who|date=May 2013}} view this as simply being the tip of the iceberg, as all facets of institutional activity and social life such as business, government, art, journalism, health, and education are increasingly being carried out in these digital media spaces across a growing network of [[information and communication technology]] devices. Also included in this topic is the basis of computer networks, wherein many different operating systems are able to communicate via different [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]]. 
Convergent services, such as [[VoIP]], [[IPTV]], [[Smart TV]], and others, tend to replace the older technologies and thus can [[disruptive innovation|disrupt markets]]. IP-based convergence is inevitable and will result in new service and new demand in the market.&lt;ref name = "Shin"&gt;Shin, Dong Hee, Won – Yong Kim, and Dong-Hoon Lee. "Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications." Conference Papers – International Communication Association (2006): 1–19. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. EBSCO. Web. 26 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; When the old technology converges into the public-owned common, IP based services become access-independent or less dependent. The old service is access-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Grieve, W. and Levin, S. (2005). From Clones To Packets: The Development Of Competition In Local Residential Telecommunications. TPRC 2005 The 33rd Research Conference on Communication, Information and Internet Policy, September 23–25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of media technological convergence ==

Communication networks were designed to carry different types of information independently. The older media, such as television and radio, are broadcasting networks with passive audiences. Convergence of telecommunication technology permits the manipulation of all forms of information, voice, data, and video.  Telecommunication has changed from a world of scarcity to one of seemingly limitless capacity. Consequently, the possibility of audience interactivity morphs the passive audience into an engaged audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackman|first=Colin|journal=Telecommunication Policy|title=Convergence between telecommunications and other media|year=1998|volume=22|issue=Elsevier Science Ltd.|pages=163–170|doi=10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical roots of convergence can be traced back to the emergence of [[mobile telephony]] and the [[Internet]], although the term properly applies only from the point in marketing history when fixed and mobile telephony began to be offered by operators as joined products. Fixed and mobile operators were, for most of the 1990s, independent companies. Even when the same organization marketed both products, these were sold and serviced independently.

In the 1990s an implicit and often explicit assumption was that new media was going to replace the old media and Internet was going to replace broadcasting. In Nicholas Negroponte's ''[[Being Digital]]'', Negroponte predicts the collapse of broadcast networks in favor of an era of narrow-casting. He also suggests that no government regulation can shatter the [[media conglomerate]]. "The monolithic empires of mass media are dissolving into an array of cottage industries... Media barons of today will be grasping to hold onto their centralized empires tomorrow.... The combined forces of technology and human nature will ultimately take a stronger hand in plurality than any laws Congress can invent."&lt;ref&gt;Negroponte, Nicholas. ''Being Digital''. Knopf, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The new media companies claimed that the old media would be absorbed fully and completely into the orbit of the emerging technologies.
[[George Gilder]] dismisses such claims saying,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} "The computer industry is converging with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with the horse, the TV converged with the nickelodeon, the word-processing program converged with the typewriter, the CAD program converged with the drafting board, and digital desktop publishing converged with the Linotype machine and the letterpress." Gilder believes that computers had come not to transform mass culture but to destroy it.

Media companies put Media Convergence back to their agenda, after the [[dot-com bubble]] burst. Erstwhile Knight Ridder promulgated concept of portable magazines, newspaper, and books in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Smith, G. |title=Back to the Future: The Tablet computer that looks just like an iPad... but it is 17 Years Old |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1381528/Knight-Ridder-tablet-looks-just-like-iPad-17-YEARS-OLD.html |publisher=MailOnline |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;"Within news corporations it became increasingly obvious that an editorial model based on mere replication in the internet of contents that had previously been written for print newspapers, radio, or television was no longer sufficient."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ramón Salaverria, Media Convergence|url = https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&amp;year=2008|website = online.journalism.utexas.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120215558/https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&amp;year=2008|archive-date = 2015-11-20|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of digital communication in the late 20th century has made it possible for media organizations (or individuals) to deliver text, audio, and video material over the same wired, wireless, or fiber-optic connections. At the same time, it inspired some media organizations to explore multimedia delivery of information. This digital convergence of news media, in particular, was called "Mediamorphosis" by researcher Roger Fidler [https://web.archive.org/web/20090315053135/http://rji.missouri.edu/staff-and-advisers/roger-fidler.php], in his 1997 book by that name. Today, we are surrounded by a multi-level convergent media world where all modes of communication and information are continually reforming to adapt to the enduring demands of technologies, "changing the way we create, consume, learn and interact with each other".&lt;ref&gt;(Jenkins, Henry (2006) Convergence Culture, New York University Press, New York.)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NBIC''', an acronym for [[Nanotechnology|'''N'''anotechnology]], [[Biotechnology|'''B'''iotechnology]], [[Information technology|'''I'''nformation technology]] and [[Cognitive science|'''C'''ognitive science]], was, in 2014,  the most popular term for converging technologies. It was introduced into public discourse through the publication of ''[[Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance]]'', a report sponsored in part by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Roco and Bainbridge 2003"&gt;{{cite book| editor = Roco, Mihail C.| editor2 = Bainbridge, William Sims| editor2-link = William Sims Bainbridge| title = [[Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance]]| publisher = Springer| date = 2003| isbn = 1-4020-1254-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other acronyms have been offered for the same concept such as GNR ([[Genetics|'''G'''enetics]], '''N'''anotechnology and [[Robotics|'''R'''obotics]]) ([[Bill Joy]], 2000, [[Why The Future Doesn't Need Us|Why the future doesn't need us]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Why the Future Doesn't Need Us | first = Bill | last= Joy | authorlink= Bill Joy | url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html |publisher= Wired |date= 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Journalist [[Joel Garreau]] in ''[[Radical Evolution]]: The Promise and Peril of Enhancing Our Minds, Our Bodies — and What It Means to Be Human'' uses "GRIN", for '''G'''enetic, '''R'''obotic, '''I'''nformation, and '''N'''ano processes,&lt;ref name="Garreau 2005"&gt;{{cite book| author = Garreau, Joel| author-link = Joel Garreau| title = [[Radical Evolution]]: The Promise and Peril of Enhancing Our Minds, Our Bodies — and What It Means to Be Human| publisher =Doubleday| date = 2005 | isbn = 0-385-50965-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[science journalist]] Douglas Mulhall in ''Our Molecular Future: How Nanotechnology, Robotics, Genetics and Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Our World'' uses "GRAIN", for '''G'''enetics, '''R'''obotics, [[Artificial intelligence|'''A'''rtificial '''I'''ntelligence]], and '''N'''anotechnology.&lt;ref name="Mulhall 2002"&gt;{{cite book| author = Mulhall, Douglas| title = Our Molecular Future: How Nanotechnology, Robotics, Genetics and Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Our World| publisher =Prometheus Books| date = 2002 | isbn = 1-57392-992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another acronym coined by the [[:Category:Appropriate technology organizations|appropriate technology organization]] [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] is "BANG" for "[[Bit|'''B'''it]]s, [[Atom|'''A'''tom]]s, [[Neuron|'''N'''euron]]s, [[Gene|'''G'''ene]]s".&lt;ref name="ETC Group 2003"&gt;{{cite journal| author = ETC Group| author-link = ETC Group (AGETC)| title = The Strategy for Converging Technologies: The Little BANG Theory| date = 2003| url = http://www.etcgroup.org/upload/publication/169/01/combang2003.pdf| accessdate = 2007-02-09| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070925235057/http://www.etcgroup.org/upload/publication/169/01/combang2003.pdf| archivedate = 2007-09-25| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of technology implications ==

Convergent solutions include both [[Landline|fixed-line]] and mobile technologies. Recent examples of new, convergent services include:

* Using the Internet for voice and [[video telephony]]
* [[Video on demand]]
* [[Fixed-mobile convergence]]
* [[Mobile-to-mobile convergence]]
* [[Location-based service]]s
* Integrated products and bundles

Convergent technologies can integrate the fixed-line with mobile to deliver convergent solutions. Convergent technologies include:

* [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]]
* [[Session Initiation Protocol]]
* [[IPTV]]
* [[Voice over IP]]
* [[Voice call continuity]]
* [[DVB-H|Digital video broadcasting – handheld]]

==Convergence in appliances==
Some media observers expect that we will eventually access all media content through one device, or "black box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-04-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_071_1986_Apr#page/n21/mode/2|title=Compute! Magazine Issue 071|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, media business practice has been to identify the next "black box" to invest in and provide media for. This has caused a number of problems. Firstly, as "black boxes" are invented and abandoned, the individual is left with numerous devices that can perform the same task, rather than one dedicated for each task. For example, one may own both a computer and a video games console, subsequently owning two DVD players. This is contrary to the streamlined goal of the "black box" theory, and instead creates clutter.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2006, 15&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, technological convergence tends to be experimental in nature. This has led to consumers owning technologies with additional functions that are harder, if not impractical, to use rather than one specific device. Many people would only watch the TV for the duration of the meal's cooking time, or whilst in the kitchen, but would not use the microwave as the household TV. These examples show that in many cases technological convergence is unnecessary or unneeded.

Furthermore, although consumers primarily use a specialized media device for their needs, other "black box" devices that perform the same task can be used to suit their current situation. As a 2002 Cheskin Research report explained: "...Your email needs and expectations are different whether you're at home, work, school, commuting, the airport, etc., and these different devices are designed to suit your needs for accessing content depending on where you are- your situated context." Despite the creation of "black boxes", intended to perform all tasks, the trend is to use devices that can suit the consumer's physical position.&lt;ref&gt;Cheskin Research. "Designing Digital Experiences for Youth", Market Insights Series, Fall 2002 pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the variable utility of portable technology, convergence occurs in high end mobile devices. They incorporate multimedia services, GPS, Internet access, and mobile telephony into a single device, heralding the rise of what has been termed the "smart phone," a device designed to remove the need to carry multiple devices. Convergence of media occurs when multiple products come together to form one product with the advantages of all of them, also known as the black box. This idea of one technology, concocted by [[Henry Jenkins]], has become known more as a fallacy because of the inability to actually put all technical pieces into one. For example, while people can have e-mail and Internet on their phone, they still want full computers with Internet and e-mail in addition. Mobile phones are a good example, in that they  incorporate [[digital camera]]s, mp3 players, [[dictaphone|voice recorder]]s, and other devices. This type of convergence is popular.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} For the consumer, it means more features in less space; for [[media conglomerate]]s it means remaining competitive.

However, convergence has a downside. Particularly in initial forms, converged devices are frequently less functional and reliable than their component parts (e.g., a mobile phone's web browser may not render some web pages correctly, due to not supporting certain rendering methods, such as the [[iPhone]] browser not supporting [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] content). As the number of functions in a single device escalates, the ability of that device to serve its original function decreases.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. 2006. ''Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide'' New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As Rheingold asserts, technological convergence holds immense potential for the "improvement of life and liberty in some ways and (could) degrade it in others".&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"/&gt; He believes the same technology has the potential to be "used as both a weapon of social control and a means of resistance".&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"/&gt; Since technology has evolved in the past ten years or so, companies are beginning to converge technologies to create demand for new products. This includes phone companies integrating [[3G]] and [[4G]] on their phones. In the mid 20th century, television converged the technologies of movies and radio, and television is now being converged with the mobile phone industry and the Internet. Phone calls are also being made with the use of personal computers. Converging technologies combine multiple technologies into one. Newer mobile phones feature cameras, and can hold images, videos, music, and other media. Manufacturers now integrate more advanced features, such as video recording, GPS receivers, data storage, and security mechanisms into the traditional cellphone.

==Convergence on the internet==
The role of the [[internet]] has changed from its original use as a communication tool to easier and faster access to information and services, mainly through a [[broadband]] connection. The television, radio and newspapers were the world's media for accessing news and entertainment; now, all three media have converged into one, and people all over the world can read and hear news and other information on the internet. The convergence of the internet and conventional TV became popular in the 2010s, through [[Smart TV]], also sometimes referred to as "Connected TV" or "Hybrid TV", (not to be confused with [[IPTV]], [[Internet TV]], or with [[Web television|Web TV]]). Smart TV is used to describe the current trend of integration of the Internet and [[Web 2.0]] features into modern [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es, as well as the technological convergence between computers and these television sets or set-top boxes. These new [[information appliance|devices]] most often also have a much higher focus on [[online]] [[interactive media]], [[Internet TV]], [[over-the-top content]], as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and less focus on traditional [[broadcasting|broadcast]] media like previous generations of [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es always have had.&lt;ref name="businessinsider1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Kovach |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-2010-12 |title=What Is A Smart TV? |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital convergence==
Digital Convergence means inclination for various innovations, media sources, content that become similar with the time. It enables the convergence of access devices and content as well as the industry participant operations and strategy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Product Management, Technology and Practice: Interdisciplinary Perspectives: Interdisciplinary Perspectives|last=Strader|first=Troy|publisher=Business Science Reference|year=2011|isbn=9781616928773|location=Hershey, PA|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is how this type of technological convergence creates opportunities, particularly in the area of product development and growth strategies for digital product companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The same can be said in the case of individual content producers such as vloggers in the [[YouTube]] video-sharing platform. The convergence in this example is demonstrated in the involvement of the Internet, home devices such as smart television, camera, the YouTube application, and the digital content. In this setup, there are the so-called "spokes",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategies and Policies in Digital Convergence|last=Park|first=Sangin|publisher=Idea Group Reference|year=2007|isbn=1599041561|location=Hershey, PA|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are the devices that connect to a central hub, which could either be the smart TV or PC. Here, the Internet serves as the intermediary, particularly through its interactivity tools and social networking, in order to create unique mixes of products and services via horizontal integration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The above example highlights how digital convergence encompasses three phenomena:

# previously stand-alone devices are being connected by networks and software, significantly enhancing functionalities;
# previously stand-alone products are being converged onto the same platform, creating hybrid products in the process; and,
# companies are crossing traditional boundaries such as hardware and software to provide new products and new sources of competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing of High-technology Products and Innovations|last=Mohr|first=Jakki|last2=Sengupta|first2=Sanjit|last3=Slater|first3=Stanley|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=9780136049968|location=Upper Saddle, NJ|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the convergence of different types of digital contents. According to Harry Strasser, former CTO of [[Siemens]] "[digital convergence will substantially impact people's lifestyle and work style]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1110194/A_Computing_Studio_Method_for_Teaching_Design_Thinking|title=A Computing Studio Method for Teaching Design Thinking|last=Van der Post|first=L.|date=2010|publisher=Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University|pages=12–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next hot trend in digital convergence is converged content, mixing personal (user-generated) content with professional (copyright protected) content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/15/the-new-media-ownership-law-doesnt-address-the-real-crisis-journalism-is-facing|title=The new media ownership law doesn't address the real crisis journalism is facing|publisher=The Guardian|author=Margaret Simons}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example are personal music videos that combine user-generated photos with chart music. The German startup [[Trivid GmbH]] has developed [[Clipgenerator]] that enables users to create personal music videos with popular chart music and to share them in social communities such as [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]] and [[Bebo]].

==Convergence in the marketplace==
Convergence is a global marketplace dynamic in which different companies and sectors are being brought together, both as competitors and collaborators, across traditional boundaries of industry and technology. In a world dominated by convergence, many traditional products, services and types of companies will become less relevant, but a stunning array of new ones is possible. An array of technology developments act as accelerators of convergence, including mobility, analytics, cloud, digital and social networks. As a disruptive force, convergence is a threat to the unprepared, but a tremendous growth opportunity for companies that can out-innovate and out-execute their ever-expanding list of competitors under dramatically new marketplace rules. With convergence, lines are blurred as companies diversify outside of their original markets. For instance, mobile services are increasingly an important part of the automobile; chemicals companies work with agribusiness; device manufacturers sell music, video and books; booksellers become consumer device companies; search and advertising companies become telecommunications companies ("telcos"); media companies act like telcos and vice versa; retailers act like financial services companies and vice versa; cosmetics companies work with pharmaceutical companies; and more. Mobile phone usage broadens dramatically, enabling users to make payments online, watch videos, or even adjusting their home thermostat while away at work.

==Media convergence{{anchor|Media}}==
Generally, media convergence refers to the merging of both old and new media and can be seen as a product, a system or a process. Jenkins states that convergence is, "the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behaviour of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted"&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (2006) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, pg 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jenkins, there are five areas of convergence: technological, economic, social or organic, cultural and global.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of global online journalism, edited by Eugenia Siapera and  Andreas Vilglis, pg 26&lt;/ref&gt; So media convergence is not just a technological shift or a technological process, it also includes shifts within the industrial, cultural, and social paradigms that encourage the consumer to seek out new information. Convergence, simply put, is how individual consumers interact with others on a social level and use various media platforms to create new experiences, new forms of media and content that connect us socially, and not just to other consumers, but to the corporate producers of media in ways that have not been as readily accessible in the past. However, Lugmayr and Dal Zotto argued, that media convergence takes place on technology, content, consumer, business model, and management level.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 2, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926&lt;/ref&gt; They argue, that media convergence is a matter of evolution and can be described through the triadic phenomenon of convergence, divergence, and coexistence. Today's digital media ecosystems coexist, as e.g. mobile app stores provide vendor lock-ins into particular eco-systems; some technology platforms are converging under one technology, due to e.g. the usage of common communication protocols as in digital TV; and other media are diverging, as e.g. media content offerings are more and more specializing and provides a space for niche media.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence is NOT King: The Triadic Phenomenon of Media 'Convergence-Divergence-Coexistance' is King. Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302467971_Media_Convergence_is_NOT_King_The_Triadic_Phenomenon_of_Media_Convergence-Divergence-Coexistence_IS_King&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in technology bring the ability for technological convergence that Rheingold believes can alter the "social-side effects," in that "the virtual, social and physical world are colliding, merging and coordinating."&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"&gt;Rheingold, Howard (2000) Smart Mobs: the next social revolution, Perseus, Cambridge, Massachusetts, pp 157–82&lt;/ref&gt; It was predicted in the late 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1988-02-compute-magazine|title=COMPUTE! magazine issue 93 Feb 1988|quote=If the wheels behind the CD-ROM industry have their way, this product will help open the door to a brave, new multimedia world for  microcomputers, where the computer is intimately linked with the other household electronics, and every gadget in the house reads  tons of video, audio, and text data from CD-ROM disks. }}&lt;/ref&gt; around the time that [[CD-ROM]] was becoming commonplace, that a [[digital revolution]] would take place, and that old media would be pushed to one side by [[new media]]. Broadcasting is increasingly being replaced by the Internet, enabling consumers all over the world the freedom to access their preferred media content more easily and at a more available rate than ever before.

However, when the [[dot-com bubble]] of the 1990s suddenly popped, that poured cold water over the talk of such a digital revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. (2008) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, 2nd ed., p.6&lt;/ref&gt; In today's society, the idea of media convergence has once again emerged as a key point of reference as newer as well as established media companies attempt to visualize the future of the entertainment industry. If this revolutionary digital paradigm shift presumed that old media would be increasingly replaced by new media, the convergence paradigm that is currently emerging suggests that new and old media would interact in more complex ways than previously predicted. The paradigm shift that followed the digital revolution assumed that new media was going to change everything. When the dot com market crashed, there was a tendency to imagine that nothing had changed. The real truth lay somewhere in between as there were so many aspects of the current media environment to take into consideration. Many industry leaders are increasingly reverting to media convergence as a way of making sense in an era of disorientating change. In that respect, media convergence in theory is essentially an old concept taking on a new meaning. Media convergence, in reality, is more than just a shift in technology. It alters relationships between industries, technologies, audiences, genres and markets. Media convergence changes the rationality media industries operate in, and the way that media consumers process news and entertainment. Media convergence is essentially a process and not an outcome, so no single black box controls the flow of media. With proliferation of different media channels and increasing portability of new telecommunications and computing technologies, we have entered into an era where media constantly surrounds us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiner | first=Tobias | title=Under the Macroscope: Convergence in the US Television Market between 2000 and 2014 | url=https://www.academia.edu/2017902/Under_the_Macroscope_Convergence_in_the_US_Television_Market_between_2000_and_2014 | work=academia.edu|accessdate=4 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media convergence requires that media companies rethink existing assumptions about media from the consumer's point of view, as these affect marketing and programming decisions. Media producers must respond to newly empowered consumers.
Conversely, it would seem that hardware is instead diverging whilst media content is converging. Media has developed into brands that can offer content in a number of forms. Two examples of this are ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''. Both are films, but are also books, video games, cartoons, and action figures. Branding encourages expansion of one concept, rather than the creation of new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2006, p.101-112&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, hardware has diversified to accommodate media convergence. Hardware must be specific to each function. While most scholars argue that the flow of cross-media is accelerating,&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins H, Deuze M (2008) Editorial: Convergence culture. Convergence 14(1): 5¡V12.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell suggests, especially between films and video game, the semblance of media convergence is misunderstood by people outside of the media production industry. The conglomeration of media industry continues to sell the same story line in different media. For example, Batman is  in comics, films, anime, and games. However, the data to create the image of batman in each media is created individually by different teams of creators. The same character and the same visual effect repetitively appear in different media is because of the synergy of media industry to make them similar as possible.  In addition, convergence does not happen when the game of two different consoles is produced. No flows between two consoles because it is faster to create game from scratch for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, Casey. "Games Are Not Convergence: The Lost Promise Of Digital Production And Convergence." Convergence: The Journal of Research Into New Media Technologies 17.3 (2011): 271–286. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. Web. 8 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more interesting new media journalism forms is virtual reality. Reuters, a major international news service, has created and staffed a news “island” in the popular online virtual reality environment Second Life (www.secondlife.com, accessed January 3, 2008). Open to anyone, Second Life has emerged as a compelling 3D virtual reality for millions of citizens around the world who have created avatars (virtual representations of themselves) to populate and live in an altered state where personal flight is a reality, altered egos can flourish, and real money (US$1,296,257 were spent during the 24 hours concluding at 10:19&amp;nbsp;a.m. eastern time January 7, 2008) can be made without ever setting foot into the real world. The Reuters Island in Second Life is a virtual version of the Reuters real-world news service but covering the domain of Second Life for the citizens of Second Life (numbering 11,807,742 residents as of January 5, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Pavlic J. V. New Media Journalism // 21st Century Communication. A Reference Handbook. Volume 1 &amp; 2. /Ed. By William F. Eadie. Los Angeles, 2009. 970 p. P. 643-651.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media convergence in the digital era means the changes that are taking place with older forms of media and media companies. Media convergence has two roles, the first is the technological merging of different media channels – for example, magazines, radio programs, TV shows, and movies, now are available on the Internet through laptops, iPads, and smartphones. As discussed in ''Media Culture'' (by Campbell), convergence of technology is not new. It has been going on since the late 1920s.  An example is RCA, the Radio Corporation of America, which purchased Victor Talking Machine Company and introduced machines that could receive radio and play recorded music.  Next came the TV, and radio lost some of its appeal as people started watching television, which has both talking and music as well as visuals.  As technology advances, convergence of media change to keep up. The second definition of media convergence Campbell discusses is cross-platform by media companies. This usually involves consolidating various media holdings, such as cable, phone, television (over the air, satellite, cable) and Internet access under one corporate umbrella. This is not for the consumer to have more media choices, this is for the benefit of the company to cut down on costs and maximize its profits.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;Campbell, Richard, Christopher R. Martin, and Bettina Fabos. Media &amp; Culture An Introduction To Mass Communication. 8th ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2013. 9–10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  As stated in the article, Convergence Culture and Media Work, by Mark Deuze, “the convergence of production and consumption of media across companies, channels, genres, and technologies is an expression of the convergence of all aspects of everyday life: work and play, the local and the global, self and social identity."&lt;ref name=Holt&gt;Holt, Jennifer, and Alisa Perren, eds. Media Industries History, Theory and Method. West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009. 145. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergence culture ===

[[Henry Jenkins]] determines convergence culture to be the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want. The convergence culture is an important factor in [[transmedia storytelling]].  Convergence culture introduces new stories and arguments from one form of media into many. Transmedia storytelling is defined by Jenkins as a process "where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience. Ideally, each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://henryjenkins.org/2011/08/defining_transmedia_further_re.html#sthash.xLqb8MkC.dpuf |title= Transmedia 202: Further Reflections |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate= April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]] starts as a [[The Matrix|film]], which is followed by two other instalments, but in a convergence culture it is not constrained to that form. It becomes a story not only told in the movies but in [[The Animatrix|animated shorts]], video games and comic books, three different media platforms. Online, a wiki is created to keep track of the story's expanding canon. Fan films, discussion forums, and social media pages also form, expanding The Matrix to different online platforms. Convergence culture took what started as a film and expanded it across almost every type of media.&lt;ref name="Jenkens 2009"&gt;HCD Media Group, . Henry Jenkins. 2009. Video. YouTube.Com Web. 7 Feb 2013. &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibJaqXVaOaI&amp;feature=player_embedded&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bert is Evil]] (images) Bert and Bin Laden appeared in [[CNN]] coverage of anti-American protest following September 11. The association of Bert and Bin Laden links back to the Ignacio's Photoshop project for fun.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins, H. ''Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide''. New York: New York UP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

Convergence culture is a part of [[participatory culture]]. Because average people can now access their interests on many types of media they can also have more of a say. Fans and consumers are able to participate in the creation and circulation of new content. Some companies take advantage of this and search for feedback from their customers through social media and sharing sites such as [[YouTube]]. 
Besides marketing and entertainment, convergence culture has also affected the way we interact with news and information. We can access news on multiple levels of media from the radio, TV, newspapers, and the internet. The internet allows more people to be able to report the news through independent broadcasts and therefore allows a multitude of perspectives to be put forward and accessed by people in many different areas. Convergence allows news to be gathered on a much larger scale. For instance, photographs were taken of torture at [[Abu Ghraib]]. These photos were shared and eventually posted on the internet. This led to the breaking of a news story in newspapers, on TV, and the internet.&lt;ref name="Jenkens 2009"/&gt;

Media scholar Henry Jenkins has described the media convergence with [[participatory culture]] as:

{{quote|...a "catalyst" for amateur digital film-making and what this case study suggests about the future directions popular culture may take. Star Wars fan films represent the intersection of two significant cultural trends—the corporate movement towards media convergence and the unleashing of significant new tools, which enable the grassroots archiving, annotation, appropriation, and recirculation of media content. These fan films build on long-standing practices of the fan community but they also reflect the influence of this changed technological environment that has dramatically lowered the costs of film production and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html|title=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|work=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Cell phone convergence ===
The social function of the cell phone changes as the technology converges. Because of technological advancement, cell phones function more than just as a phone. They contain an internet connection, video players, MP3 players, gaming, and a camera. Another example, [[Rok Sako To Rok Lo]] (2004) was screened in Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and other part of India through EDGE-enabled mobile phones with live video streaming facility.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Social movements ===
The integration of [[social movement]]s in cyberspace is one of the potential strategies that social movements can use in the age of media convergence. Because of the [[Net neutrality|neutrality of the internet]] and the [[End-to-end principle|end-to-end design]], the power structure of the internet was designed to avoid discrimination between applications. Mexico's [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] campaign for land rights was one of the most influential case in the information age; Manuel Castells defines the Zapatistas as "the first informational guerrilla movement".&lt;ref&gt;Castells, 2004:82&lt;/ref&gt; The Zapatista uprising had been marginalized by the popular press. The Zapatistas were able to construct a grassroots, decentralized social movement by using the internet. The Zapatistas Effect, observed by Cleaver,&lt;ref&gt;Cleaver, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; continues to organize social movements on a global scale. A sophisticated webmetric analysis, which maps the links between different websites and seeks to identify important nodal points in a network, demonstrates that the Zapatistas cause binds together hundreds of global NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;Garrido and Halavais, 2003:181&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the social movement organized by Zapatistas targets their campaign especially against global neoliberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Cleaver, 1988:630&lt;/ref&gt; A successful social movement not only need online support but also protest on the street. Papic wrote, "Social Media Alone Do Not Instigate Revolutions", which discusses how the use of social media in social movements needs good organization both online and offline.&lt;ref&gt;Papic, M., Noonan, S. (2011) "Social Media As a Tool for Protest." Stratfor, 3 Feb. 2011. Web. 20 Nov. 2011. {{cite web |url=http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110202-social-media-tool-protest |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512075702/http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110202-social-media-tool-protest |archivedate=2013-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study, "Journalism in the age of media convergence: a survey of undergraduates’ technology-related news habits", concluded that several focus group respondents reported they generally did not actively engage in media convergence, such as viewing slide shows or listening to podcast that accompanied an online story, as part of their Web-based news consumption, a significant number of students indicated the interactive features often associated with online news and media convergence were indeed appealing to them.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins, L,.

== Examples in Regulation ==

===Example: VoIP===
The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has not been able to decide how to regulate VoIP (Internet Telephony) because the convergent technology is still growing and changing. In addition to its growth, FCC is tentative to set regulation on VoIP in order to promote competition in the telecommunication industry.&lt;ref&gt;Written in 2011, 10, 27&lt;/ref&gt; There is not a clear line between telecommunication service and the information service because of the growth of the new convergent media. Historically, telecommunication is subject to state regulation. The state of California concerned about the increasing popularity of internet telephony will eventually obliterate funding for the [[Universal Service Fund]]&lt;ref&gt;Kopytoff, V. (2005). Internet Phones in Spotlight, Companies face more scrutiny by U.S., state agencies. IP Telephony News, March, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states attempt to assert their traditional role of common carrier oversight onto this new technology.&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, J (2004). California Regulator Vote to Exammine Rules to Control Voice Over Internet Protocol. ''Electronic Commerce and Law Report'' (Vol. 9, No.7) 156-57&lt;/ref&gt; Meisel and Needles (2005) suggests that the FCC, federal courts, and state regulatory bodies on access line charges will directly impact the speed in which Internet telephony market grows.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel, J., Needles, M. Voice over Internet protocol development and public policy Implications. INFO: ''the journal of policy, regulation and strategy for telecommunications, information and media,'' Vol.7, Number 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, the FCC is hesitant to regulate convergent technology because VoIP with different feature from the old Telecommunication; no fixed model to build legislature yet. On the other hand, the regulations is needed because Service over the internet might be quickly replaced telecommunication service, which will affect the entire economy.

Convergence has also raised several debates about classification of certain telecommunications services. As the lines between data transmission, and voice and media transmission are eroded, regulators are faced with the task of how best to classify the converging segments of the telecommunication sector. Traditionally, telecommunication regulation has focused on the operation of physical infrastructure, networks, and access to network. No content is regulated in the telecommunication because the content is considered private. In contrast, film and Television are regulated by contents. The rating system regulates its distribution to the audience. Self-regulation is promoted by the industry. Bogle senior persuaded the entire industry to pay 0.1 percent levy on all advertising and the money was used to give authority to the Advertising Standards Authority, which keeps the government away from setting legislature in the media industry.&lt;ref&gt;PERSPECTIVE: Media convergence puts self-regulation at top of the agenda." Campaign 1 Nov. 2002: 02. General Reference Center GOLD. Web. 13 Oct. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The premises to regulate the new media, two-ways communications, concerns much about the change from old media to new media. Each medium has different features and characteristics. First, internet, the new medium, manipulates all form of information – voice, data and video. Second, the old regulation on the old media, such as radio and Television, emphasized its regulation on the scarcity of the channels. Internet, on the other hand, has the limitless capacity, due to the end-to-end design. Third, Two-ways communication encourages interactivity between the content producers and the audiences. 
"...Fundamental basis for classification, therefore, is to consider the need for regulation in terms of either market failure or in the public interests"(Blackman).&lt;ref&gt;

===Emerging trends in communications===
[[Network neutrality]] has emerged as an issue. Wu and Lessig (2004) set out two reasons to adapt neutral network model for computer networks. First, "a neutral network eliminates the risk of future discrimination, providing more incentive to invest in broadband application development." Second, "neutral network facilitates fair competition among application, no bias between applications."&lt;ref&gt;Wu, T., Lessig, L. EX Parte Submission in CS Docket No. 02-52. August, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The two reasons also coincide with FCC's interest to stimulate investment and enhance innovation in broadband technology and services.&lt;ref&gt;FCC, 2004d&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FCC (2004d). Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, March 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite regulatory efforts of deregulation, privatization, and liberalization, the  infrastructure barrier has been a negative factor in achieving effective competition. "Kim et al. argues that IP dissociates the telephony application from the infrastructure and Internet telephony is at the forefront of such dissociation."&lt;ref&gt;Kim, et al. Regulating Internet telephony: The Challenges and the Opportunities. Proceedings of 15th Portland International Conference on Technology Management.&lt;/ref&gt;  The neutrality of the network is very important for fair competition.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, T. (2004). Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination, Journal of Telecommunications &amp; High Technology Law, Vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As the former FCC Charman [[Michael Powell]] put it: "From its inception, the Internet was designed, as those present during the course of its creating will tell you, to prevent government or a corporation or anyone else from controlling it. It was designed to defeat [[discrimination]] against users, ideas and technologies".&lt;ref&gt;FCC (2004f). Remarks of Michael J. Copps: Federal Communications Commissioner: The Beginning Of The End Of The Internet? Discrimination, Closed Networks, And The Future of Cyberspace New America Foundation, Washington, Dc. October 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these reasons, Shin concludes that regulator should make sure to regulate application and infrastructure separately.

The layered model was first proposed by Solum and Chug, Sicker, and Nakahata. Sicker, Warbach and Witt have supported using a layered model to regulate the telecommunications industry with the emergence of convergence services. Many researchers have different layered approach, but they all agree that the emergence of convergent technology will create challenges and ambiguities for regulations.&lt;ref name = "Shin"/&gt; The key point of the layered model is that it reflects the reality of network architecture, and current business model.&lt;ref name = "Whitt"&gt;Whitt, R.S. (2004). A Horizontal Leap Forward: Formulating a New Communications
Public Policy Framework Based on the Network Layers Mode. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS
LAW JOURNAL, Vol. 56, Number 3, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
The layered Model consists of 1. Access Layer – where the physical infrastructure resides: copper wires, cable, or fiber optic. 2. transport layer – the provider of service. 3. Application layer –  the interface between the data and the users. 4. content layer – the layer which users see.&lt;ref name = "Whitt"/&gt; In ''Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications'', Shin combines the Layered Model and Network Neutrality as the principle to regulate the future convergent Media Industry.&lt;ref&gt;Shin, D. , Kim, W. and Lee, D. , 2006-06-16 "Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Dresden International Congress Centre, Dresden, Germany Online &lt;PDF&gt;. 2011-03-14 from http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p91470_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example: Messaging==
Combination services include those that integrate SMS with voice, such as voice SMS. Providers include Bubble Motion, Jott, Kirusa, and SpinVox. Several operators have launched services that combine SMS with mobile instant messaging (MIM) and presence. Text-to-landline services also exist, where subscribers can send text messages to any landline phone and are charged at standard rates. The text messages are converted into spoken language. This service has been popular in America, where fixed and mobile numbers are similar. Inbound SMS has been converging to enable reception of different formats (SMS, voice, MMS, etc.). UK companies, including consumer goods companies and media giants, should soon{{when|date=May 2011}} be able to let consumers contact them via voice, SMS, MMS, IVR, or video using one five-digit number or [[long number]]. In April 2008, O2 UK launched voice-enabled shortcodes, adding voice functionality to the five-digit codes already used for SMS. This type of convergence is helpful for media companies, broadcasters, enterprises, call centres and help desks who need to develop a consistent contact strategy with the consumer. Because SMS is very popular today, it became relevant to include [[text messaging]] as a contact possibility for consumers. To avoid having multiple numbers (one for voice calls, another one for SMS), a simple way is to merge the reception of both formats under one number. This means that a consumer can text or call one number and be sure that the message will be received.

==Example: Mobile==
"Mobile service provisions" refers not only to the ability to purchase mobile phone services, but the ability to wirelessly access everything: voice, Internet, audio, and video. Advancements in [[WiMAX]] and other leading edge technologies provide the ability to transfer information over a wireless link at a variety of speeds, distances, and non-line-of-sight conditions.

==Example: Multi-play in telecommunications==
Multi-play is a marketing term describing the provision of different telecommunication services, such as [[Internet access]], television, telephone, and mobile phone service, by organisations that traditionally only offered one or two of these services. Multi-play is a catch-all phrase; usually, the terms [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] (voice, video and data) or quadruple play (voice, video, data and wireless) are used to describe a more specific meaning. A dual play service is a marketing term for the provisioning of the two services: it can be high-speed Internet ([[digital subscriber line]]) and telephone service over a single broadband connection in the case of phone companies, or high-speed Internet ([[cable modem]]) and TV service over a single broadband connection in the case of cable TV companies. The convergence can also concern the underlying communication [[infrastructure]]. An example of this is a [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service, where communication services are packaged allowing consumers to purchase TV, Internet, and [[telephony]] in one subscription. The broadband cable market is transforming as pay-TV providers move aggressively into what was once considered the telco space. Meanwhile, customer expectations have risen as consumer and business customers alike seek rich content, multi-use devices, networked products and converged services including on-demand video, digital TV, high speed Internet, VoIP, and wireless applications. It is uncharted territory for most broadband companies.

A quadruple play service combines the [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service of broadband Internet access, television, and telephone with [[wireless]] service provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm Integrated Design for VoIP-Enabled Quadruple Play Devices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226070457/http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm |date=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This service set is also sometimes humorously referred to as "The [[Fantastic Four]]" or "Grand Slam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|title=Cable consortium mobilizes quad-play with Sprint|work=CED|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927040031/http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental aspect of the quadruple play is not only the long-awaited broadband convergence but also the players involved. Many of them, from the largest global service providers to whom we connect today via wires and cables to the smallest of startup service providers are interested. Opportunities are attractive: the big three telecom services – [[telephony]], cable television, and [[wireless]]—could combine their industries. In the UK, the merger of [[Virgin Media|NTL:Telewest]] and [[Virgin Mobile]] resulted in a company offering a quadruple play of cable television, broadband Internet, home telephone, and mobile telephone services.

==Example: Home network==
Early in the 21st century, home LAN convergence so rapidly integrated home [[Router (computing)|router]]s, [[wireless access point]]s, and [[DSL modem]]s that users were hard put to identify the resulting box they used to connect their computers to their Internet service. A general term for such a combined device is a [[residential gateway]].

In [[law]] and [[ethics]], '''universal law''' or '''universal principle''' refers as concepts of legal [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] actions, whereby those [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] and rules for governing human beings' conduct which are most universal in their acceptability, their applicability, translation, and [[philosophical]] basis, are therefore considered to be most legitimate.  One type of Universal Law is the Law of Logic which prohibits logical contradictions known as sophistry.  The Law of Logic is based upon the universal idea that logic is defined as that which is not illogical and that which is illogical is that which involves a logical contradiction, such as attempting to assert that an apple and no apple can exist at and in the same time and in the same place, and attempting to assert that A and not A can exist at and in the same time and in the same place. What goes around , comes around.

[[File:Yard Sale Northern CA 2005.JPG|thumb|A yard sale is a common place to find cheap used goods.]]

A '''secondhand''' or '''used good''' is a piece of [[personal property]] that is being purchased by or otherwise transferred to a second or later [[end user]]. A ''used'' [[Good (economics and accounting)|good]] can also simply mean it is no longer in the same condition as it was when transferred to the current owner. When the term ''used'' means that an item has expended its purpose (such as a used [[diaper]]), it is typically called [[garbage]], instead. 

Used goods may be transferred informally between friends and family for free as '''hand-me-downs'''.  They may be sold for a fraction of their original price at [[garage sale]]s, in [[bazaar|bazaar-style]] fundraisers, in privately owned consignment shops, or through [[Online auction|online auctions]]. Some things are typically sold in specialized shops, such as a [[Used car dealer|car dealership]] that specializes in the sale of used vehicles or a [[used bookstore]] that sells [[Used book|used books]].  In other cases, such as a [[charity shop]], a wide variety of used goods might be handled by the same establishment.  High-value used luxury goods, such as antique furniture, jewelry, watches, and artwork, might be sold through a generic [[auction house]] such as [[Sotheby's]] or a more specialized niche like [https://www.bobswatches.com Bob's Watches].

Governments require some used goods to be sold through regulated markets, as in the case of items which have safety and legal issues, such as used firearms or cars.  For these items, government licensing bodies require certification and registration of the sale, to prevent the sale of stolen, unregistered, or unsafe goods. For some high-value used goods, such as cars and motorcycles, governments regulate sales of used goods to ensure that the government gets its sales tax revenue from the sale.

==Benefits==
Secondhand goods can benefit the purchaser as the price paid is lower than that of the same items bought new. If the reduction in price more than compensates for the possibly shorter remaining lifetime, lack of warranty, and so on, there is a net benefit.

Selling unwanted goods secondhand instead of discarding them obviously benefits the seller.

[[Recycling]] goods through the secondhand market reduces use of resources in manufacturing new goods, and diminishes waste which must be disposed of, both of which are significant environmental benefits. However, manufacturers who profit from sales of new goods lose corresponding sales. Scientific research shows that buying used goods reduces carbon footprint and [[CO2]] emissions significantly compared to the complete product life cycle, because of less production, raw material sourcing and logistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.citeulike.org/article/9832067|title=Impact of closed-loop network configurations on carbon footprints: A case study in copiers|first=Harold|last=Krikke|date=1 October 2011|publisher=|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|volume=55|issue=12|pages=1196–1205|accessdate=25 May 2018|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the relative carbon footprint of production, raw material sourcing and the [[supply chain]] is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083915/http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse |date=2014-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientific methodology has been made to analyze how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used goods like secondhand hardware versus new hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.future-science.com/doi/full/10.4155/cmt.11.29 Scientific Greener CO2 calculator for reuse] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130124001944/http://www.future-science.com/doi/full/10.4155/cmt.11.29 |date=2013-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quality secondhand goods can be more durable than equivalent new goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/28/buying-secondhand-an-alternative-to-rampant-consumerism-of-black-friday|title=Buying secondhand: an alternative to rampant consumerism of Black Friday|first1=Sarah|last1=LaBrecque|first2=Hannah|last2=Gould|date=28 November 2014|website=the Guardian|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
Secondhand goods may have faults which are not apparent even if examined; purchasing sight unseen, for example, from an [[Internet auction]] site, has further unknowns. Goods may cause problems beyond their value; for example, furniture may have not easily seen [[Bed bug (insect)|bedbug]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11915026/ns/dateline_nbc-dont_let_the_bed_bugs_bite/t/what-you-need-know-about-bed-bugs/ Msnbc: What you need to know about bed bugs]: "Do not buy used furniture (especially bedding items or upholstered items) ... until inspected carefully for any signs of bedbugs"&lt;/ref&gt; which may cause an infestation which is difficult and expensive to eradicate. Faulty electrical and mechanical goods can be hazardous and dangerous. This is especially a big issue if sold to countries that do not have recycling facilities for these devices, which has led to an issue with [[electronic waste]].

==Types of transfers==
Many items that are considered obsolete and worthless in [[developed countries]], such as decade-old hand tools and clothes, are useful and valuable in impoverished communities in the country or in [[developing countries]]. Underdeveloped countries like Zambia are extremely welcoming to donated secondhand clothing. At a time when the country's economy was in severe decline, the used goods provided jobs by keeping "many others busy with repairs and alterations".&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004"&gt;Karen Tranberg-Hansen. 2004. Helping or hindering? Controversies around the international second-hand clothing trade. Anthropology Today 20(4):3-9.&lt;/ref&gt; It has created a type of spin-off economy at a time when many Zambians were out of work. The used garments and materials that were donated to the country also allowed for the production of "a wide range of fabrics" whose imports had been previously restricted.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; The trade is essentially executed by women who operate their small business based on local associations and networks. Not only does this provide self-employment, but it also increases household income and enhances the economy.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; But while many countries would be welcoming of secondhand goods, it is also true that there are countries in need who refuse donated items. Countries like Poland, Philippines and Pakistan have been known to reject secondhand items for "fear of venereal disease and risk to personal hygiene".&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt;  Similar to these countries, India also refuses the [[Global trade of secondhand clothing|import of secondhand clothing]] but will accept the import of wool fibers, including ''mutilated hosiery'' which is a term meaning "woollen garments shredded by machine in the West prior to export".&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; Through the production of ''[[shoddy]]'' (recycled wool), most of which is produced in Northern India today, unused clothing can be recycled into fibres that are spun into yarn for reuse in 'new' used goods.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; 

United States taxpayers can deduct donations of used goods to charitable organizations. Both [[Goodwill Industries]] and the [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] websites have lists of items with their estimated range of values. Another way that people transfer used goods is by giving them to friends or relatives. When a person gives an item of some value that they have used to someone else, such as a used car or a winter coat, it is sometimes referred to as a "hand-me-down".

[[File:Ebayscreen.png|thumb|[[Online auction]] sites have become a popular way to sell used goods in recent years.]]

Used items can often be found for sale in [[thrift store]]s and [[pawnshop]]s, [[auction]]s, [[garage sale]]s, and in more recent times [[online auction]]s. Some stores sell both new and used goods (e.g. [[car dealership]]s), while others only sell new goods but may take used items in exchange for credit toward the purchase of newer goods. For example, some musical instrument stores and high-end audio stores only sell new gear, but they will accept good quality used items as trade ins towards the purchase of new items; after the store purchases the used items, they then sell them using online auctions or other services.

When an item is no longer of use to a person they may sell or ''pawn'' it, especially when they are in need of [[money]]. Items can also be sold (or taken away free of cost) as [[scrap]] (e.g. a broken-down old car will be towed away for free for its scrap metal value). Owners may sell the good themselves or to a dealer who then sells it on for a profit. They may also choose to give it away to another person this is often referred to as [[freecycling]]. However, because the process takes some effort on part of the owner they may simply keep possession of it or dump it at a [[landfill]] instead of going to the trouble of selling it. It has been common to buy secondhand or used good on markets or bazaars for long time. When the web became popular, it became common with websites such as [[eBay]] and [[Yahoo!|Yahoo! Classifieds]].

==Purchases==
[[File:Landfill compactor.jpg|thumb|left|As dumped used goods take up space in landfills, some may purchase them for [[environmentalism|environmental motivations]].]]

The strategy of buying used items is employed by some to save [[money]], as they are typically worth less than the equivalent new items. Purchasing used items for [[reuse]] prevents them from becoming [[waste]] and saves costly production of equivalent new goods. Motivations for purchase include conserving [[natural resource]]s and protecting the [[natural environment|environment]], and may form part of a [[simple living]] plan.

==Types==

===Cars===
{{Main article|Used car}}
[[File:Toyota Corolla AE82 Sweden.JPG|thumb|Used cars like this 1980s-era [[Toyota Corolla]] are very inexpensive, but a buyer runs the risk of getting stuck with a [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]].]]

Used [[Automobile|cars]] are especially notable for depreciating in value much faster than many other items.  Used cars may have been bought or [[lease]]d by their previous user, and may be purchased directly from the previous owner or through a dealer. [[George Akerlof]] published a paper entitled "[[The Market for Lemons]]", examining the effects of [[information asymmetry]] on the used car market. Used cars may require more maintenance or have fewer features than later equivalent models.

=== Books ===
{{Main|Used book}}
Used books are often re-sold through a [[used bookstore]].  They may also be given away, perhaps as part of a program such as the [[Little Free Library|Little Free Library's]] programs.  Used bookstores may also sell secondhand music recordings or videos.

=== Used clothing ===
In developed countries, unwanted used clothing is often donated to charities that sort and sell it. Some of these distribute some of the clothing to people on low incomes for free or a very low price. Others sell all of the collected clothing in bulk to a commercial used clothing redistributor, and then use the raised funds to finance their activities.&lt;ref name="tsun2007"&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/News/TorontoAndGTA/2007/01/11/3299397-sun.html Old duds, big bucks; Clothes you think you're donating to charity are frequently sold for profit] [[Toronto Sun]], 2007-Jan-11, retrieved 2007-Apr-16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., almost 5 billion pounds of clothing is donated to charity shops each year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racked.com/platform/amp/2018/3/13/17082288/used-clothing-mexico-goodwill|title=Here’s What Really Happens to Your Used Clothes - Racked|last=Guo|first=Eileen|date=13 March 2018|website=Racked|publisher=Vox Media|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only about 10% of it can be re-sold by the charity shops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About a third of the donated clothing is bought, usually in bulk and at a heavy discount, by commercial dealers and fabric recyclers, who export it to other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some of the used clothes are also smuggled into Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Used clothing unsuitable for sale in an affluent market may still find a buyer or end-user in another market, such as a student market or a less affluent region of a developing country. In developing countries, such as [[Zambia]], secondhand clothing is sorted, recycled and sometimes redistributed to other nations. Some of the scraps are kept and used to create unique fashions which enable the locals to construct identity. Not only does the trade represent a great source of employment for women as well as men, it also supports other facets of the economy: the merchants buy timber and other materials for their stands, metal hangers to display clothing, and food and drinks for customers. Carriers also find work as they transport the garments from factories to various locations. The secondhand clothing trade is central to the lives of many citizens dwelling in such countries.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; A dress agent will often deal with a buyer and seller directly, taking unwanted clothes that still have value, and reselling them in a shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosmood.com/?module=articles&amp;id=1 |title=Second hand by cosmood |publisher=cosmood.com |date=2017-08-02 |accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Importation of used clothing is sometimes opposed by the [[textile industry]] in developing countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are concerned that fewer people will buy the new clothes that they make when it is cheaper to buy imported used clothing. Nearly all the clothes made in Mexico are intended for export, and the Mexican textile industry opposes the importation of used clothes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other items ===
The Sierra Club, an environmental organization, argues that secondhand purchasing of furniture is the "greenest" way of furnishing a home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sierraclub.typepad.com/greenlife/2008/09/green-your-re-1.html|title=Green Your Rental - Eco Furnishings - The Green Life|date=2008-09-30|publisher=Sierraclub.typepad.com|accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Vintage guitar]]s also became increasingly desired objects among musicians and collectors during the nineties and afterwards.  Some music stores specialize in selling used musical instruments, used copies of printed music, and related paraphernalia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3536">{{Unreferenced|date=August 2009}}The '''Web-based Inquiry Science Environment''' ('''WISE''') is a program hosted by [[Berkeley University]] and supported by the [[National Science Foundation]]. It provides a platform for creating [[inquiry-based science]] projects for middle school and high school students to work collaboratively using evidence and resources from the Web.  WISE inquiry projects are typically developed by teams including teachers, researchers, and scientists.  These projects range in duration from 2 days to 4 weeks, suitable for teachers in every science topic at all grade levels. The use of Internet materials provides the foundation of WISE.  All projects make use of some content from the World Wide Web, as well as additional Web pages authored for purposes of the project.  This approach helps students learn to use the Internet for inquiry, critiquing Web sites, designing approaches, or comparing arguments. Typical projects engage students in designing solutions to problems (e.g. building a desert house that is warm at night and cool during the day), debating contemporary science controversies (e.g. the causes of declining amphibian populations), investigating scientific phenomena (e.g. thermal equilibrium in the classroom), or critiquing scientific claims found in web sites (e.g. arguments for life on Mars).

WISE projects can also incorporate [[Java (programming language)|Java]] applets, flash models, forums to facilitate online discussions, data collection, drawing, argument creation, resource sharing, branching, concept mapping and other built-in components.  WISE is entirely browser-based, meaning that students only need access to a computer with an Internet connection, with no required software other than the Web browser).  All student work is saved on central project servers that enable student accounts and teacher accounts to be coordinated, with special Web environments designed to support teachers and students.  Students can access their work from any computer on the Internet. Teachers can choose from the library of curriculum projects in the WISE Teacher's Portal, each accompanied by a set of materials including a detailed lesson plan, pre and post assessments, connections to the AAAS National standards, tools for setting up a custom grading scheme, and even a software tool that enables customization of the WISE project for local issues, geographical features or student populations. Teachers can monitor and grade student work in real time, provide formative feedback during a project run, and manage their student accounts. 

Finally, WISE provides a user-friendly interface to facilitate the authoring of new projects, with numerous technology-based components including online discussions, data collection, drawing, argument creation, resource sharing, concept mapping and other built-in tools. Developers can also include custom tools of their own design. Projects are further customizable by teachers and other end users through the same interface to better meet the needs of their students and constraints of local educational settings. The website provides rich descriptions of the WISE learning environment, a library of inquiry projects for students and teachers, a teacher support center, and the complete authoring environment.

The '''Załuski Library''' ({{lang-pl|Biblioteka Załuskich}}, {{lang-la|Bibliotheca Zalusciana}}) was built in [[Warsaw]] in 1747–1795 by [[Józef Andrzej Załuski]] and his brother, [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]], both [[Roman Catholic]] bishops. The library was the first Polish public library, the largest library in Poland, and one of the earliest public libraries in Europe.&lt;ref name="utoronto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fyifrance"/&gt;

After the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] (1794), Russian troops, acting on orders from Czarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], seized the library's holdings and transported them to her personal collection at [[Saint Petersburg]], where a year later it formed the cornerstone of the newly founded [[Imperial Public Library]].&lt;ref name="fyifrance"/&gt;

In the 1920s the government of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] returned some of the former Załuski Library holdings to the recently established [[Second Polish Republic]] thanks to the [[Peace of Riga|Treaty of Riga]]. These holdings were deliberately destroyed by [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops during the [[planned destruction of Warsaw]] in October 1944, following the collapse of the [[Warsaw Uprising]].&lt;ref name="fyifrance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vogel Załuski Library.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Załuski Library under construction, by [[Zygmunt Vogel|Vogel]]]]
[[File:DPK1 DSC0038.JPG|thumb|left|250px|"House of the Kings" today (''ul. Daniłowiczowska 14'', corner of ''ul. Hipoteczna 2'', [[Warsaw]])]]
The Załuski brothers' greatest passion was [[book]]s. [[Józef Andrzej Załuski]] and his brother [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]] acquired the collections of earlier Polish bibliophiles such as [[Jakub Zadzik]], [[Krzysztof Opaliński]], Tomasz Ujejski, [[Janusz Wiśniowiecki]], [[Jerzy Mniszech]] and [[Jan III Sobieski]] (the latter, from his granddaughter, [[Maria Karolina Sobieska]]).

From the 1730s the brothers planned the creation of a [[library]], and in 1747 they founded the Załuski Library (''Biblioteka Załuskich''). Located in the 17th-century Daniłowicz Palace in [[Warsaw]] (built for [[Mikołaj Daniłowicz]] of Żurów),&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska"/&gt; the library building had two stories (the large reading room was on the second floor) and was topped with a small tower containing an astronomical [[observatory]].&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; The building's reconstruction in [[rococo]] style was accomplished in 1745 by [[Francesco Antonio Melana]] and his brother.&lt;ref name="50 lat Biblioteki Narodowej, Warszawa, 1928-1978 (50 years of the National Library, Warsaw, 1928-1978)"/&gt;

The Załuski Library was considered the first Polish [[public library]]&lt;ref name="Bygone Warsaw"/&gt; and one of the largest libraries in the contemporary world.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; In all of Europe there were only two or three libraries that could boast such holdings.&lt;ref name="welcometo"/&gt; The library initially held some 200,000 items, which grew to some 400,000 printed items, [[map]]s and [[manuscript]]s&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancour"/&gt; by the end of the 1780s. It also accumulated a collection of art, scientific instruments, and plant and animal specimens.

This library, open on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., asked patrons to be quiet and to say a prayer in the intention of the Załuski brothers.&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; It was prohibited to take the books outside the library, as the book theft was a growing problem, to an extent that the bishop patrons decided to ask the [[pope]] for help.&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; Responding to their request, in 1752 pope [[Benedict XIV]] issued a [[papal bull]] that threatened to [[excommunication]] individuals taking the books from this library; even that did not eliminate the problem completely.&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt;
[[File:Exlibris Zaluski.jpg|thumb|150px|Załuski Library ''[[Bookplate|exlibris]]'']] 
After the brothers' deaths, the newly formed [[Commission for National Education]] took charge of the library, renaming it the Załuski Brothers' Library of the Republic.

Twenty years later in 1794, in the aftermath of the [[second Partition of Poland]] and [[Kościuszko Uprising]], Russian troops, on orders from Russian Czarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], emptied&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eduskrypt"/&gt; the library and dispatched the whole collection to [[Saint Petersburg]], where the books formed the mass of the [[Imperial Public Library]] on its formation, a year later.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A Splendor of Letters: The Permanence of Books in an Impermanent World"/&gt; Parts of the collections were damaged or destroyed as they were mishandled while being removed from the library and transported to Russia, and many were stolen.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; According to the historian [[Joachim Lelewel]], the Zaluskis' books, "could be bought at [[Grodno]] by the basket".&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;

The collection was later dispersed among several Russian libraries. Some parts of the Zaluski collection came back to Poland on two separate dates in the nineteenth century: 1842 and 1863.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; In the 1920s, in the aftermath of the [[Polish-Soviet War]] and the [[Treaty of Riga]]&lt;ref name="Lancour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Holocaust and the Book: Destruction and Preservation."/&gt; the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]]'s government returned around 50,000 items from the collection to Poland,&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; yet [[Nazi Germany|German]] soldiers deliberately destroyed these items during the Planned destruction of Warsaw in October 1944, after collapse of the Warsaw Uprising.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="knuth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; Only 1800 manuscripts and 30,000 printed materials from the original library survived the war.

In 1821 the library's original home was altered into a [[Kamienica (architecture)|tenement house]].&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska" /&gt; During the building's reconstruction, the [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish monarchs]] that had originally adorned the library's interiors, and which had been hidden during the [[Partitions of Poland]], were discovered and placed on the building's facade; hence the building came to be called the "House of the Kings" (''Dom pod Królami'').&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska" /&gt;

The building was destroyed by the Germans during [[World War II]].  After the war, it was rebuilt under the [[Polish People's Republic]].&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska" /&gt;

Today's [[Polish National Library]] (''Biblioteka Narodowa''), founded in 1928,&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; considers itself the descendant of the Załuski Library.
