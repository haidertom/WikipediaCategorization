'''Analytical feminism''' is  a line of philosophy that applies analytic concepts and methods to feminist issues and applies feminist concepts and insights to issues that have traditionally been of interest to analytic philosophers. Like all [[Feminism|feminists]], analytical feminists insist on recognizing and contesting [[sexism]] and [[androcentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~acudd/Anfemdef.htm |title=One Woman's Attempt at a Definition |author=Ann E. Cudd |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324073853/http://web.ku.edu/~acudd/Anfemdef.htm |archivedate=2012-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term “analytical feminism” dates back to the early 1990s when the Society for Analytical Feminism was opened in at the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/analyticalfeminism/|title= Society for Analytical Feminism |author= Norco College - Riverside Community College District}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as an opportunity to discuss and examine issues concerning analytical feminism, in part to contrast the more prevalent influences of [[postmodernism]] and [[post-structuralism]], and also to demonstrate that analytic philosophy is neither inherently or  irredeemably male-biased. Analytic feminists have attempted to rehabilitate certain key concepts, such as truth, reason, objectivity, agency and autonomy, both because they are normatively compelling as well as in some ways liberating and empowering for women. Not limited to these concepts, analytical feminism has contributed to the historical arena of analytic philosophy such as the philosophy of language, [[epistemology]], [[metaphysic]]s and the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://books.publishing.monash.edu/apps/bookworm/view/A+Companion+to+Philosophy+in+Australia+and+New+Zealand/56/xhtml/chapter01.html#chapter01sec04|title=History of Analytical Feminism|author=Monash University Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the American philosophical magazine ''[[Hypatia]]'' published a special issue&lt;ref name="Hy 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hypatia-Special Issue: Analytic Feminism-August 1995|journal=Hypatia|volume=10|issue=3|doi=10.1111/hypa.1995.10.issue-3|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; clarifying the meaning of analytic feminism in the mainstream Anglo-American analytical context and in the range of [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosophical positions]]. In this issue, the authors such as [[Ann Cudd]] of the [[University of Kansas]], [[Ann Garry]] of [[California State University Los Angeles]], and Lynn Hankinson Nelson of the [[University of Washington]] proposed that analytic feminism typically was unrecognized and  somewhat depreciated by not only analytical philosophers but academic  feminist agenda as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.women.it/cyberarchive/files/allegrini.htm|title=THE NATURALISM QUESTION. HOW TO RE-THINK THE ANALYTIC – CONTINENTAL DICOTHOMY FROM A FEMINIST EPISTEMOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE|author=Alessandra Allegrini|access-date=2011-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928142832/http://www.women.it/cyberarchive/files/allegrini.htm#|archive-date=2011-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered a sub-category of both analytic philosophy, and feminism, analytic feminism acknowledge the philosophical traditions of both fields while simultaneously addressing prominent issues within said fields.

==Philosophical approach==
Analytical feminism, as defined by Ann E. Cudd: "Analytic feminism holds that the best way to counter  [[sexism]] and [[androcentrism]] is through forming a clear conception of and pursuing truth, logical consistency, objectivity, rationality, justice, and the good while recognising that these notions have often been perverted by androcentrism throughout the history of philosophy." (1996: 20) Analytic feminists engage the literature traditionally thought of as analytic philosophy, but also draw on other traditions in philosophy as well as work by feminists working in other disciplines, especially [[sociology]] and [[biology]]. They, like most [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]], value clarity and precision in argument and tend to use more rigorously structured logical and linguistic analysis in reaching their conclusions and positions as compared to other philosophical approaches.

The majority of philosophers, including feminist philosophers, have at least some formal training in analytic philosophy, with some possessing extensive education and experience regarding analyticity. There has been a conscious effort to use the word ‘analytical’, the reason being that within the field of philosophy there is sometimes an inclination to assume all feminist work as tied to other methods to philosophy, whereas upon review much of the work in feminism is closer in method to analytic conventions.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

According to most analytic feminists, the  best method for scholars to counter sexism and androcentrism in their respective areas of inquiry is by forming a clear conception of and practicing logical consistency and [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bookrags.com/research/analytic-feminism-eoph/ |title= Analytic Feminism |author= bookrags }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrines===
Even though analytical feminists retain only some traditional concepts{{Clarify|date=February 2013}}, it is not doctrinaire—indeed, there is even a spirit of contrarianism within it. Nevertheless, analytic feminists share a thing that we may call a "core desire" rather than a core principle, that is to say, the need to hold on to enough of the essential normative notions of the modern European tradition to aid the kind of [[norm (social)|norm]]ativity which is necessary for both [[feminist political theory]] and philosophy. This "core desire"  finds its appearance by means of the core concepts of analytical feminism.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridge building===
Analytic feminists' use of core ideas and their excerpt to the work of traditional analytic philosophers permit them to communicate with and build bridges amongst different types of scholars, for example, traditional analytic philosophers, other feminist philosophers, and, in some cases, scientists or scholars in social studies.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstructing philosophy===
One tenet of analytic feminism holds that if philosophers positions are applicable universally, they must be usable by men and women alike, and from a range of social situations. This is a basis for what can be considered the reconstruction of philosophy via analytic feminism. This approach, which somewhat mirrors the construction of feminist philosophy tradition, attempts to limit the creation of areas or categories of philosophy that apply to only some women and feminists. It's an attempt to apply to 'all' (men and women) instead of 'some' (women and/or feminists) with specific examples of topics being feminine ethics, gynocentric ethics, or lesbian ethics. The basis for this universal approach would be an analytic feminist ethics and metaphysics which would create and establish a new criterion of adequacy for the fields of ethics and metaphysics. The goal of Miranda Fricker and Jennifer Hornsby, editors of ''The Cambridge Companion to Feminism in Philosophy'', is to have this position included in the mainstream of the discipline  (Fricker and Hornsby 2000).

Not basing the approach on any 'essential' characteristics, be they experiences or otherwise, it can maintain the importance of a variety of perspectives, while crafting a 'working' theory. 'Working' is defined as being particularly inclusive, of both men and women, but also simultaneously eliminating oppressive consequences. A wide range of experiences, interests, and background must be reflected with the theory 'working' only if it is applicable to all these issues and concerns.

There are a variety of approaches regarding the reconstruction of philosophy within analytic feminism. Some philosophers, such as Bailey (Bailey 2010) and Gary (Garry 2012), include the use of [[intersectionality]] in their approach. Miranda Fricker (2007) and Kristie Dotson (2011) make use of concept of [[Privilege (social inequality)]] in theirs, particularly with regard to epistemic ignorance and [[epistemic injustice]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Architecture Studies Library''' (ASL) is located in the ''Paul B. Sogg Architecture Building'', located on the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] campus. The services of the library  address both the needs of the faculty and students of the  [[UNLV School of Architecture]], and also responds to the needs of researchers  through an email reference service.  The Library provides historical and current information and resources about [[architecture in Las Vegas]], primarily through its [http://www.library.unlv.edu/arch/archdb/arch.php  Las Vegas Architects and Buildings Database]. 

==History==
The building was completed and occupied in August 1997. The Architecture Studies Library (approximately 16,000 gross square feet) includes spaces for book and periodical stacks, individual carrels on both of its floors, current periodicals display shelving, exhibits, a reference area, clippings files, special collections, group study rooms, and a computer lab.

The architect for the building was Swisher &amp; Hall Architects of Las Vegas. The interiors furniture selection and placement was a project of one of the School's interior design classes.

==Collections==
The ASL provides an archival collection of Nevada AIA design awards spanning over a quarter of a century, in addition to summarized data on architectural projects, firms and individuals both through its inhouse collection of materials as well as its online materials, a few of which are listed below:

==Reception==
In their 2014 book ''Beyond Bibliometrics: Harnessing Multidimensional Indicators of Scholarly Impact'', [[Blaise Cronin]] and Cassidy R. Sugimoto noted that "for impact assessment of book-based fields, bibliometricians need a database with large numbers of books" and that while the Book Citation Index did meet this need, [[Google Books]] also fulfilled this purpose and was not only free, but was (at the time) more comprehensive for bibliometric analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cronin|first1=Blaise|last2=Sugimoto|first2=Cassidy R.|title=Beyond Bibliometrics: Harnessing Multidimensional Indicators of Scholarly Impact|date=2014|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262323291|pages=33, 289, 296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxSaAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296&amp;dq=%22Book+Citation+Index%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ig9sVZ2QB4rLsASwyYHYBw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Book%20Citation%20Index%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 article in the ''[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]]'' remarked on the index's opportunities and limitations. It stated that the "most significant limitations to this potential application are the high share of publications without address information, the inflation of publication counts, the lack of cumulative citation counts from different hierarchical levels, and inconsistency in citation counts between the cited reference search and the book citation index."&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorraiz|first1=Juan|last2=Purnell|first2=Philip J.|last3=Glänze|first3=Wolfgang|title=Opportunities for and limitations of the Book Citation Index|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=July 2013|volume=64|issue=7|pages=1388–1398|doi=10.1002/asi.22875|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22875/full|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that the Book Citation Index was "a first step toward creating a reliable and necessary citation data source for monographs — a very challenging issue, because, unlike journals and conference proceedings, books have specific requirements, and several problems emerge not only in the context of subject classification, but also in their role as cited publications and in citing publications."&lt;ref name=journal /&gt;

The '''Center for International Political Analysis''' ('''CIPA''') is a research center at the [[Policy Research Institute]] (PRI) at the [[University of Kansas]].
The primary project focus at present is on gathering information regarding the nature of inter-state relations during times of conflict in several localized areas: the [[Middle East]], Southern, Western, and Central Africa, and the [[Balkans]].

==Purpose==
Using filtered news leads in conjunction with a series of numeric codes, these inter-state relations can be quantified—both in number and intensity—through computer-aided coding.
In addition, CIPA employs several human coders to track mass atrocities throughout the world.
CIPA operates with funding from multiple sources with different research needs, although the overarching goal of the project is predictive in nature.
In all facets of the project's research, the intent is to advance efforts to understand and anticipate civil strife, [[genocide]], and mass killings.

== Project History ==

The Center for International Political Analysis is an outgrowth of [[Philip Schrodt]]'s and [[Deborah Gerner]]'s work on the [[Kansas Event Data System]] (KEDS). The initial focus of the KEDS project was the development of techniques for converting English-language reports of political events into event data.
&lt;br&gt;This replaced labor-intensive and error-prone process of human coding with inexpensive, transparent and reproducible automated coding.
&lt;br&gt;The centerpiece of this effort is the [[American Political Science Association|APSA]]-award-winning KEDS computer program, a [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] program with a user-friendly interface and a variety of output options. In support of KEDS, Schrodt and Gerner's staff produced several programs for filtering texts and aggregating the resulting event data so that it can be used in [[statistical analysis]]. The KEDS program has now been used in about half-a-dozen [[National Science Foundation]]-funded event data projects, as well as a number of dissertations and other smaller projects. The development and popularization of the KEDS software paved the way for CIPA's current framework, Tabari.

The early KEDS work focused primarily on the [[Levant]] region from the late 1980s to the late 1990s. Most of this research focused on the development of early warning techniques for political change, primarily using the Levant as a case study. The project experimented with a number of different methods, including factor analysis, discriminant analysis, an assortment of clustering algorithms, and [[hidden Markov]] models.

In recent years, grants from [[Science Applications International Corporation]] and the National Science Foundation have allowed CIPA to expand the scope of its research into [[Africa]], [[Yemen]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the former [[Yugoslavia]]. In addition, these grants have facilitated a shift in the CIPA project focus. Upcoming data sets will likely reflect a greater emphasis on contentious intrastate political relations.

'''Clyde Broadcast''' is a brand associated with the manufacture and supply of studio equipment for the radio broadcast industry. The name dates back to 'Clyde Electronics' who manufactured a series of analog mixers known as Alpha, Beta, Prima and Presenter. 

In 1997 Clyde Broadcast Products Limited was formed as a UK-based radio studio equipment manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/clyde-broadcast-launches-new-low-cost-professional-radio-broadcast-mixer| title=Clyde Broadcast launches new low cost professional radio broadcast mixer| publisher=Radio Info| date=May 12, 2010| access-date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/knowledge-hub/articles/comment/clyde-broadcast-at-the-ibc| title=Want to win business?

The '''World Summit on Sustainable Development''' ('''WSSD'''), or the '''ONG Earth Summit 2002''', took place in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, from 26 August to 4 September 2002. It was convened to discuss [[sustainable development]] by the United Nations. WSSD gathered a number of leaders from business and non-governmental organizations, 10 years after the first [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro. (It was therefore also informally nicknamed "Rio+10".)

==Declarations==
The [[Johannesburg Declaration]] was the main outcome of the Summit; however, there were several other international agreements.

It laid out the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation as an action plan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/WSSD_POI_PD/English/POIToc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreements==
Johannesburg, 27 August: agreement was made to restore the world's depleted fisheries for 2015. It was agreed to by negotiators at the World Summit. 

Instead of new agreements between governments, the Earth Summit was organized mostly around almost 300 "partnership initiatives" known as [[Type II Partnerships|Type II]], as opposed to Type I Partnerships which are the more classic outcome of international treaties.  These were to be the key means to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]].  These are kept in a database of Partnerships for Sustainable Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webapps01.un.org/dsd/partnerships/public/welcome.do|title=United Nations Maintenance Page|author=|date=|website=webapps01.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. participation==
The absence of the United States rendered the summit partially impotent. [[George W. Bush]] boycotted the summit and did not attend. Except for a brief appearance by [[Colin Powell]], who hurriedly addressed the closing stages of the conference while his airplane taxied on the runway of Johannesburg International, the US government did not send a delegation, earning Bush praise in a letter from conservative organizations such as [[Americans for Tax Reform]], [[American Enterprise Institute]], and [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brainerd Dispatch, citing AP|title=Conservatives praise Bush for opting out of U.N.

==History==

The United Nations [[Conference on the Human Environment]], was first held in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, in June 1972, and marked the emergence of international environmental law. The Declaration on the Human Environment also known as the Stockholm Declaration set out the principles for various international environmental issues, including human rights, natural resource management, pollution prevention and the relationship between the environment and development. The conference also led to the creation of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].

The [[Brundtland Commission]] set up by [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], the pioneer of [[sustainable development]], provided the momentum for first [[Earth Summit]] 1992 &amp;ndash; the United Nations Conference on Environmental Development (UNCED), that was also headed by Maurice Strong, who had been a prominent member of the Brundtland Commission &amp;ndash; and also for [[Agenda 21]].

South Africa's first [[South African National Conference on Environment and Development|National Conference on Environment and Development]] entitled, "Ecologise Politics, Politicise Ecology" was held at the [[University of the Western Cape]] in conjunction with the [[Cape Town Ecology Group]] and the Western Cape Branch of the [[World Conference on Religion and Peace]] in 1991. Prominent persons involved in this conference were [[Ebrahim Rasool]], [[Cheryl Carolus]], Faried Esack, and Julia Martin.

The initial informal discussions on a possible new Summit in 2002 were held in February 1998 and hosted by Derek Osborn who co-chaired the preparatory meetings for Rio+5 and [[Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future]]. A set of 10 governments started working informally to start putting together the possible agenda for a Summit. the non-papers produced in 1998 and 1999 ensured that when the UN Commission met in 2000 it could agree to host another Summit in 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18746">'''EyesOn Design''' are a series of events including an annual [[car show]] and a [[fundraiser]] for the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology. It has become a national event focused on the emotion and character of [[automotive design]].

== History ==
The Eyes on Design Show was established on the late-1986 as both celebration of [[automotive design]] and a fundraiser for the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, a [[nonprofit organization]] in [[Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan]], devoted to matters pertaining to the [[Ophthalmology|eye and vision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eyeson.org/index.php/eyeson/as-history |title=The History of the EyesOn Design Car Show in June at the Edsel &amp; Eleanor Ford House in Grosse Pointe |first=Philip C. |last=Hessburg |publisher=Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130128132027/http://www.eyeson.org/index.php/eyeson/as-history |archivedate=28 January 2013 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.3ds.com/company/news-media/press-releases-detail/release/dassault-systemes-continues-tradition-of-sponsoring-eyeson/single/2492/?cHash=52d09b3ccc0fc59eaa396693b0dd4e7b |title=Dassault Systèmes Continues Tradition of Sponsoring EyesOn Design Competition |date=8 January 2008 |publisher=Dassault Systèmes |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first shows were called "Eyes On The Classics". The first shows were held in the [[Grosse Pointe Academy]] parking lots. Initially focused on the domestic "[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]" ([[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chrysler LLC|Chrysler]]), the show was expanded to include automakers from around the world. The name was also changed to "EyesOn Design". For its third show, the venue moved to the grounds of the [[Edsel and Eleanor Ford House]].

To ease access and accommodate the increasing public attendance, the design chiefs at DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and General Motors suggested that the event be hosted by one of their companies each year.&lt;ref name="beauregard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.cardesignnews.com/features/2002/020715eyesondesign/index.html |title=Eyes on Design 2002 - A weekend of classic design |first=Marc |last=Beauregard |date=15 July 2002| publisher=Car Design News |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 show was held at the [[Chrysler Headquarters and Technology Center]] in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The theme for this 15th anniversary weekend-long show was "Performance Vehicles".&lt;ref name="beauregard"/&gt;

In 2003, the [[General Motors Technical Center]] in Warren, Michigan hosted the event. According to [[General Motors]], the 2003 event was the largest, most complete collection of concept vehicles ever assembled representing the very best efforts of GM, Ford, Chrysler, and other automakers.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gmeurope.info/social_media_newsroom/news/2003/news_030603b.html |title=Design Automotive Exhibit at the GM Technical Center |publisher=General Motors |date=6 March 2003 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120311212908/http://www.gmeurope.info/social_media_newsroom/news/2003/news_030603b.html |archivedate=11 March 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-day event was also the first time the GM Design Center was open to the general public.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt; Attendees also had the opportunity to purchase rides in notable GM [[concept car]]s.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt;

A Founding Chairman of the annual EyesOn Design event, Chuck Jordan, was commemorated during the January 2011 [[North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardesignnews.com/site/home/rss_display/item214620/|title=2011 EyesOn Design Awards |first=Eric |last=Gallina |date=21 January 2011| publisher=Car Design News |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EyesOn Design show celebrated its 25th anniversary during summer 2012, on the grounds of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House with over 200 vehicles displayed by invitation only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.candgnews.com/news/eyeson-design-celebrates-25-years-visionary-vehicles |title=EyesOn Design celebrates 25 years of visionary vehicles |first=K. Michelle |last=Moran |publisher=C and G news |date=7 June 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design focus ==
The "Eyes on Design Show" has grown from an East Side show to an automobile exhibition of national and international significance.&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://apps.detnews.com/apps/joyrides/index.php?id=408 |last=Wright |first=Richard A. |title=From modest beginnings, Eyes on Design is now a major show| newspaper=The Detroit News |date=7 July 2003 |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120318005148/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/joyrides/index.php?id=408 |archivedate=18 March 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Ford Motor Company]], the Eyes on Design Show is the world's only car show to focus on the emotion and character of automotive design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=8089 |title= Honorary Chairman Announced for 2001 Eyes On Design |date=20 April 2001 |publisher= Ford Motor |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121007092232/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=8089 |archivedate=7 October 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing together some 250 concept cars in one place is the secret of the show's success that has been driven by the enthusiastic assistance of automotive design executives.&lt;ref name="wright"/&gt; In addition to vehicles from various automakers, the event also features concept cars by invitation from some of the world's most renowned vintage automobile collectors and restorers.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt;

The vehicles shown at the annual event are by invitation. Judging in numerous classes is "based not on the quality of the restoration or authenticity"; rather it is on the basis of their "the design character, emotional appeal and artistic excellence of the vehicle."&lt;ref name="beauregard"/&gt;

== Lifetime Design Achievement ==
The EyesOn Design celebrations include the prestigious "Lifetime Design Achievement" award. This recognition is given to an accomplished automotive designer selected by previous winners of this award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dbusiness.com/DBusiness/January-February-2010/EyesOn-Design-Celebrates-23-Years-with-the-Launch-of-its-2010-Season/ |title=EyesOn Design Celebrates 23 Years with the Launch of its 2010 Season |date=23 December 2009 |journal=dbusiness |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flagellate''' is a cell or organism with one or more [[whip]]-like [[Appendage|appendages]] called [[flagellum|flagella]]. The word ''flagellate'' also describes a particular construction (or level of organization) characteristic of many [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s and their means of motion. The term presently does not imply any specific relationship or classification of the organisms that possess flagellae. However, the term "flagellate" is included in other terms (such as "[[dinoflagellate]]" and "[[choanoflagellata]]") which are more formally characterized.&lt;ref name="pmid8868448"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cavalier-Smith T. |title=Zooflagellate phylogeny and classification |journal=Tsitologiya |volume=37 |issue=11 |pages=1010–29 |year=1995 |pmid=8868448 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Form and behavior ==
Eukaryotic flagella are supported by [[microtubule]]s in a characteristic arrangement, with nine fused pairs surrounding two central singlets. These arise from a [[basal body]]. In some flagellates, flagella direct food into a [[cytostome]] or mouth, where food is [[Ingestion|ingested]].  Flagella often support hairs, called [[mastigonemes]], or contain rods. Their ultrastructure plays an important role in classifying [[eukaryote]]s. 

Among [[protoctist]]s and microscopic animals, a flagellate is an organism with one or more whip-like organelles called flagella. Some cells in animals may be flagellate, for instance the spermatozoa of most phyla. Flowering plants do not produce flagellate cells, but ferns, mosses, green algae, and some gymnosperms and closely related plants do so. Likewise, most fungi do not produce cells with flagellae, but the primitive fungal chytrids do. Many protists take the form of single-celled flagellates.

Flagella are generally used for [[propulsion]]. They may also be used to create a current that brings in food.  In most such organisms, one or more flagella are located at or near the anterior of the cell, e.g., ''[[Euglena]]''.  Often there is one directed forwards and one trailing behind. Among animals, fungi, which are part of a group called the [[opisthokont]]s, there is a single posterior flagellum. They are from the phylum Mastigophora. They can cause diseases and are typically heterotrophic. They reproduce by binary fission.They spend most of their existence moving or feeding. Many parasites that affect human health or economy are flagellates. Flagellates are the major consumers of primary and secondary production in aquatic [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] - consuming bacteria and other protists.[[Image:Flagellata 1.png|thumb|"Flagellata" from [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]]]
== Flagellates as specialized cells or life cycle stages ==

An overview of the occurrence of flagellated cells in eukaryote groups, as specialized cells of multicellular organisms or as life cycle stages, is given below (see also the article [[flagellum]]):&lt;ref&gt;Raven, J.A. 2000. The flagellate condition. In: (B.S.C. Leadbeater and J.C. Green, eds) ''The flagellates. Unity, diversity and evolution''. The Systematics Association Special Volume 59. Taylor and Francis, London. pp. 269–287.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster, J &amp; Weber, R (2007). ''Introduction to Fungi'' (3rd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 23–24, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SApIn7IEnucC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=&amp;pg=PT64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adl et al. 2012"&gt;Adl et al. (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Archaeplastida]]: most [[green algae]] ([[zoospores]] and male [[gamete]]s, except in [[Zygnematophyceae]]), [[bryophyte]]s (male gametes), [[pteridophyte]]s (male gametes), some [[gymnosperm]]s ([[cycad]]s and ''[[Ginkgo]]'', as male gametes)
* [[Stramenopiles]]: centric [[diatom]]s (male gametes), [[brown algae]] (zoospores and gametes), [[oomycete]]s (assexual zoospores and gametes), [[hyphochytrid]]s (zoospores), [[labyrinthulomycetes]] (zoospores), some [[chrysophyte]]s, some [[xanthophyte]]s, [[eustigmatophyte]]s

== Flagellates as organisms: the Flagellata==
In older classifications, flagellated [[protozoa]] were grouped in '''Flagellata''' (= '''Mastigophora'''), sometimes divided in Phytoflagellata (= Phytomastigina, mostly autotrophic) and Zooflagellata (= Zoomastigina, heterotrophic). They were sometimes grouped with [[Sarcodina]] (ameboids) in the group [[Sarcomastigophora]].

The autotrophic flagellates were grouped similarly to the botanical schemes used for the corresponding algae groups. The colourless flagellates were customary grouped in three groups, highly artificial:&lt;ref&gt;Fritsch, F.E. ''The Structure and Reproduction of the Algae''. Vol. I. Introduction, Chlorophyceae. Xanthophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Dinophyceae, Chloromonadineae, Euglenineae, Colourless Flagellata. 1935. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150615132446/http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/bitstream/1/2023644/1/BPT12884.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Protomastigineae, in which absorption of food-particles in holozoic nutrition occurs at a localised point of the cell surface, often at  a cytostome, although many groups were merely saprophytes; it included the majority of colourless flagellates, and even many "apochlorotic" algae;
* Pantostomatineae (or Rhizomastigineae), in which the absorption takes place at any point on the cell surface; roughly corresponds to "amoeboflagellates";
* Distomatineae, a group of binucleate "double individuals" with symmetrically distributed flagella and, in many species, two symmetrical mouths; roughly corresponds to current [[Diplomonadida]].

Presently, these groups are known to be highly [[polyphyletic]]. In modern classifications of the protists, the principal flagellated taxa are placed in the following eukaryote groups, which include also non-flagellated forms (A: autotrophic; F: free-living heterotrophic; P: parasitic; S: symbiotic):&lt;ref&gt;Jeuck, A., &amp; Arndt, H. (2013). A short guide to common heterotrophic flagellates of freshwater habitats based on the morphology of living organisms.

'''Gloria Daisy Wekker''' (born June 13, 1950) is an [[Afro-Surinamese]] Dutch educator and writer who has focused on gender studies and sexuality in the Afro-Caribbean region and diaspora. She was the winner of the Ruth Benedict Prize from the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 2007.

==Biography==
Gloria Wekker was born in 1950 in [[Paramaribo]], Suriname.&lt;ref name="Surinam Stars"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gloria Wekker|url=http://www.surinamstars.com/Gloria%20Wekker.html|publisher=Surinam Stars|accessdate=10 February 2016|location=Paramaribo, Suriname|language=Dutch|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[Amsterdam]] in the 1970s and became active in the Afro-European Women’s Movement.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pesole|first1=Betta|title=Gloria Wekker|url=http://www.encyclopediaofafroeuropeanstudies.eu/encyclopedia/gloria-wekker/|work=Encyclopedia of Afro-European Studies|accessdate=10 February 2016|location=Universidad de León, León, Spain|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wekker earned a master's degree in [[cultural anthropology]]&lt;ref name="Surinam Stars" /&gt; from the [[University of Amsterdam]] in 1981 and began her career working in various governmental agencies in Amsterdam, such as the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Culture on Ethnic Minorities' Affairs and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment. In 1984, she became a founding member of "Sister Outsider", an Amsterdam-based, literary circle for lesbian black women named after the work by [[Audre Lorde]]. In 1987, she served as a Policy Associate in the Office for the Coordination of Ethnic Minorities' Affairs.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt;

In 1992, Wekker earned her doctorate at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] with a thesis on the sexuality and subjectivity of Afro-Surinamese women. In 2001, she was appointed to the Aletta-chair of the Department of Women's Studies at the [[Utrecht University]].&lt;ref name="Surinam Stars" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dialogo Global"&gt;{{cite web|title=9th Annual Summer School on Black Europe|url=http://www.dialogoglobal.com/amsterdam/people.php|publisher=Dialogo Global|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UWI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gloria Wekker|url=https://sta.uwi.edu/crgs/november2009/gloriawekker.asp|publisher=The University of the West Indies|accessdate=11 February 2016|location=St Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work focuses on the intersections of [[colonialism]], racism, [[white privilege]], feminist theory, lesbian theory and women in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Duke Press"&gt;{{cite web|title=White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/white-innocence|publisher=Duke University Press|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Batra|2011|p=155}} Her work has earned her the title of "Holland’s [[Angela Davis]]"&lt;ref name="Neilson, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neilson|first1=Zoe|title=For Pete's sake|url=http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/pete%E2%80%99s-sake|accessdate=11 February 2016|work=[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]|date=7 December 2014|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; as she has forced the Dutch to examine their alleged ingrained stereotypes and attitudes towards racism and patriarchy.&lt;ref name="De Wereld Morgen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wekker|first1=Gloria|title=Acht wetenschappelijk onderbouwde argumenten tegen Zwarte Piet|work=De Wereld Morgen |date=23 October 2014|location=Antwerp, Belgium|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has led debate which questioned the racist nature of such iconic images in Dutch tradition as [[Santa|Sinterklaas]] (Santa Clause)'s helpers as [[blackface]] [[golliwogs]] known as ''Zwarte Piet'' (Black Pete),&lt;ref name="Neilson, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ten Broeke, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=ten Broeke|first1=Asha|title=Zwarte Piet|url=http://www.utnieuws.nl/opinie/60711/Zwarte_Piet|accessdate=11 February 2016|work=UT Nieuws |date=11 November 2014|location=University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the imagery of what constitutes beauty.&lt;ref name="Julen, 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Julen|first1=Jeannine|title='Kroes gaan' is een hele stap|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4328/Opinie/article/detail/3546096/2013/11/17/Kroes-gaan-is-een-hele-stap.dhtml|accessdate=11 February 2016|publisher=de Verdieping Trouw|date=17 November 2013|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HHpred and HHsearch are among the most popular methods for protein structure prediction and the detection of remotely related sequences, each having been cited over 500 times.&lt;ref&gt;Number of results returned from a search on Google Scholar. [https://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=(hhpred+OR+HHsearch)+and+protein&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search (Google Scholar search)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Sequence searches are frequently performed by biologists to infer the function of an unknown protein from its sequence. For this purpose, the protein's sequence is compared to the sequences of other proteins in public databases and its function is deduced from those of the most similar sequences. Often, no sequences with annotated functions can be found in such a search. In this case, more sensitive methods are required to identify more remotely related proteins or [[protein family|protein families]]. From these relationships, hypotheses about the protein's functions, [[Protein structure prediction|structure]], and [[Protein domain|domain composition]] can be inferred. HHsearch performs searches with a protein sequence through databases. The HHpred server and the HH-suite software package offer many popular, regularly updated databases, such as the [[Protein Data Bank]], as well as the [[InterPro]], [[Pfam]], [[Clusters of Orthologous Groups|COG]], and [[Structural Classification of Proteins|SCOP]] databases.

HHpred and HHsearch belong to the class of profile-profile comparison tools, which includes the most sensitive sequence search methods to date.&lt;ref name="pmid15531603"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10975570"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaroszewski L, Rychlewski L, Godzik A | title = Improving the quality of twilight-zone alignments | journal = Protein Science | year = 2000 | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 1487–1496 | pmid = 10975570 | doi = 10.1110/ps.9.8.1487 | pmc = 2144727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sadreyev RI, Baker D, Grishin NV | title = Profile–profile comparisons by COMPASS predict intricate homologies between protein families | journal = Protein Science | year = 2003 | volume = 12 | issue = 10 | pages = 2262–2272 | pmid = 14500884 | doi = 10.1110/ps.03197403 | pmc = 2366929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dunbrack RL Jr | title = Sequence comparison and protein structure prediction | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | year = 2006 | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 374–384 | pmid = 16713709 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2006.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They represent both the query sequence and the database sequences by ''sequence profiles'', also called ''[[position-specific scoring matrix|position-specific scoring matrices]]'' (PSSMs). Profiles are calculated from a [[multiple sequence alignment]] of related sequences which are collected, for example, using the [[BLAST|PSI-BLAST]] program or the HHblits program from the [[HH-suite]] package. A profile is a matrix containing for each position in the query sequence the similarity score for the 20 amino acids. These scores are calculated from the frequencies of the amino acids at the corresponding positions in the multiple sequence alignment. Because profiles contain much more information than a single sequence (e.g. the position-specific degree of conservation), profile-profile comparison methods are much more powerful than sequence-sequence comparison methods like [[BLAST]] or profile-sequence comparison methods like PSI-BLAST.&lt;ref name="pmid10975570" /&gt;

HHpred and HHsearch represent query and database proteins by [[hidden Markov model|profile hidden Markov models]] (HMMs), an extension of [[position-specific scoring matrix|sequence profiles]] which also record position-specific amino acid insertion and deletion frequencies. HHsearch searches a database of HMMs with a query HMM. Before starting the search through the actual database of HMMs, HHsearch/HHpred builds a [[multiple sequence alignment]] of related sequences using the HHblits program from the [[HH-suite]] package. From this alignment, a profile HMM is calculated. The databases contain HMMs that are precalculated in the same fashion using PSI-BLAST. The output of HHpred and HHsearch is a ranked list of database matches (including E-values and probabilities for a true relationship) and the pairwise query-database sequence alignments. A search through the PDB database of proteins with solved 3D structure takes a few minutes. If a significant match with a protein of known structure (a "template") is found in the PDB database, HHpred allows the user to build a homology model using the [[MODELLER]] software, starting from the pairwise query-template alignment.

==Applications==
Applications of HHpred and HHsearch include protein structure prediction, complex structure prediction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guerler A, Govindarajoo B, Zhang Y | title = Mapping Monomeric Threading to Protein–Protein Structure Prediction | journal = Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1021/ci300579r| pmc = 4076494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; function prediction, domain prediction, domain boundary prediction, and evolutionary classification of proteins.

==CASP Rankings==
HHpred servers have been ranked among the best servers during [[CASP]]7, 8, and 9, for blind protein structure prediction experiments. In CASP9, HHpredA, B, and C were ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd out of 81 participating automatic structure prediction servers in template-based modeling&lt;ref&gt;[http://predictioncenter.org/casp9/CD/data/html/groups.server.tbm.html Official CASP9 results for the template-based modeling category (121 targets)]&lt;/ref&gt; and 6th, 7th, 8th on all 147 targets, while being much faster than the best 20 servers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://predictioncenter.org/casp9/CD/data/html/groups.2.html Official CASP9 results for all 147 targets]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[CASP]]8, HHpred was ranked 7th on all targets and 2nd on the subset of single domain proteins, while still being more than 50 times faster than the top-ranked servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hildebrand A, Remmert M, Biegert A, Soding J | title = Fast and accurate automatic structure prediction with HHpred | journal = Proteins | year = 2009 | pmid = 19626712 | volume = 77 Suppl 9 | pages = 128–32 | doi = 10.1002/prot.22499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22428">The '''history of chromatography''' spans from the mid-19th century to the 21st.  [[Chromatography]], literally "color writing",&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=chromatography|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chromatography&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used&amp;mdash;and named&amp;mdash; in the first decade of the 20th century, primarily for the separation of plant [[pigments]] such as [[chlorophyll]] (which is green) and [[carotenoid]]s (which are orange and yellow).  New forms of chromatography developed in the 1930s and 1940s made the technique useful for a wide range of [[separation process]]es and [[chemical analysis]] tasks, especially in [[biochemistry]].

==Precursors==

The earliest use of chromatography&amp;mdash;passing a mixture through  an inert material to create separation of the solution components based on differential [[adsorption]]&amp;mdash;is sometimes attributed to German chemist [[Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge]], who in 1855 described the use of paper to analyze [[dye]]s.  Runge dropped spots of different inorganic chemicals onto circles of filter paper already impregnated with another chemical, and reactions between the different chemicals created unique color patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Runge placed drops of reactant solutions on blotting paper and then added a drop of a second reactant solution on top of the first drop.  The solutions would react as they spread through the blotting paper, often producing colored patterns.  His results were published in two books:
*  F. F. Runge, ''Farbenchemie.  Musterbilder für Freunde des Schönen und zum Gebrauch für Zeichner, Maler, Verzierer und Zeugdrucker, dargestellt durch chemische Wechselwirkung'' [Color chemistry.  Sample images for friends of beauty and for use by sketchers, painters, decorators, and printers, prepared by chemical interaction] (Berlin, (Germany):  (Self-published), 1850).
*  F. F. Runge, ''Der Bildungstrieb der Stoffe, veranschaulicht in selbstständig gewachsenen Bilder'' [The formative tendency of substances illustrated by autonomously developed images] (Oranienburg, (Germany):  (Self-published), 1855).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to historical analysis of L. S. Ettre, however, Runge's work had "nothing to do with chromatography" (and instead should be considered a precursor of chemical [[spot test]]s such as the [[Schiff test]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ettre (2001), p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.S. Ettre = Leslie Stephen Ettre (1922-2010), Hungarian-American chemist, author of several publications on the history of chromatography.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] and his student [[Friedrich Goppelsroeder]] published the first attempts to study the different rates at which different substances move through filter paper.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Schönbein (1861) [https://books.google.com/books?id=V3AxAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ueber einige durch die Haarröhrchenanziehung des Papiers hervorgebrachten Trennungswirkungen"] (On some separation effects produced by capillary attraction of paper), ''Verhandlungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft zu Basel'',  '''3''' (2) : 249-255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Goppelsröder (1861) [https://books.google.com/books?id=V3AxAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA268#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ueber ein Verfahren, die Farbstoffe in ihren Gemischen zu erkennen"] (On a method for detecting the colorings in mixtures of them), ''Verhandlungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft zu Basel'', '''3''' (2) :  268-275.&lt;br&gt;
See also:  Friedrich Goppelsroeder, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mVM4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Capillaranalyse beruhend auf Capillaritäts- und Adsorptionserscheinungen'' …] [Capillary analysis based on phenomena of capillarity and adsorption … ] (Basel, Switzerland:  Emil Birkhäuser, 1901).&lt;/ref&gt;  Schönbein, who thought [[capillary action]] (rather than adsorption) was responsible for the movement, called the technique [[capillary analysis]], and Goppelsroeder spent much of his career using capillary analysis to test the movement rates of a wide variety of substances.  Unlike modern paper chromatography, capillary analysis used reservoirs of the substance being analyzed, creating overlapping zones of the solution components rather than separate points or bands.&lt;ref&gt;Ettre (2001), pp. 411-412.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, in his book ''Capillaranalyse … '' (1901), Goppelsroeder stated (p. 168) that he had been separating plant colorants since 1880, and that he had achieved complete separations of those colorants.  From p. 166:&lt;br&gt;
''"Bietet sich auch dem Auge bei Betrachtung der verschiedenen Pflanzenorgane eine wunderbare Mannigfaltigkeit der Farben und Farbenabstufungen dar, so bleibt ihm doch die wichtige Thatsache verborgen, dass meist nicht nur ein einziger Farbstoff, sondern mehrere nebeneinander in demselben Organe vorkommen.  Während das Auge nur eine Färbung erkennt und wir desshalb glauben, dass dieselbe einem bestimmten einzelnen Farbstoff angehöre, lässt uns die Capillaranalyse meist mehrere verschieden gefärbte Zonen auf den Capillarstreifen in bestimmer, sehr oft von farblosen Zonen unterbrochener Reihenfolge erkennen.  Das Chlorophyll oder Blattgrün z.B. findet sich nicht nur in den grünen, sonder auch in anders gefärbten Organen, beispielsweise verdeckt durch die rote Färbung des Zellsafts in den Blättern der Blutbuche neben dem roten Anthokyan, sowie neben roten Phycoerythrin in den Rotalgen, den Florideen.  Diese verschiedenen Farbstoffe lassen sich durch Capillaranalyse in den gemeinschaftlichen Auszügen, ohne irgend welche sonstige Trennungsmanipulationen nebeneinander nachweisen.  Sind sie capillarisch in Zonen getrennt, dann genügt deren spectroscopische und chemische Prüfung zur endgiltigen Feststellung ihrer Natur."''&lt;br&gt;
(If a wonderful variety of colors and color gradations presents itself to the eye when looking at the different plant organs, yet the important fact remains hidden to it:  that usually not only a single colorant but several occur side by side in the same organs. While the eye perceives only one color and we believe therefore that it belongs to a certain individual colorant, capillary analysis [i.e., paper chromatography] allows us to detect usually several differently colored zones on the capillary strips in certain sequences [that are] very often interrupted by colorless zones.  Chlorophyll or leaf green, for example, is found not only in the green, but also in differently colored organs; for example, obscured by the red color of the protoplasm in the leaves of the copper beech together with red anthocyanin, as well as together with red phycoerythrin in red algae, the ''Florideae''.  These various colorants can be detected by capillary analysis in extracts where they are present in combination, without any other concurrent separation treatments.  If they are separated into zones by capillarity, then their spectroscopic and chemical examination suffices for the conclusive ascertaining of their nature.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on capillary analysis continued, but without much technical development, well into the 20th century.  The first significant advances over Goppelsroeder's methods came with the work of [[Raphael E. Liesegang]]: in 1927, he placed filter strips in closed containers with atmospheres saturated by solvents, and in 1943 he began using discrete spots of sample adsorbed to filter paper, dipped in pure solvent to achieve separation.&lt;ref&gt;See:

*  Liesegang, R.E. (1943) "Kreuz-Kapillaranalyse" (Cross capillary analysis), ''Naturwissenschaften'', '''31''' (29) :  348.&lt;/ref&gt;  This method, essentially identical to modern paper chromatography, was published just before the independent&amp;mdash;and far more influential&amp;mdash;work of [[Archer Martin]] and his collaborators that inaugurated the widespread use of paper chromatography.&lt;ref&gt;Ettre (2001), p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, the American chemist David Talbot Day (1859-1915), then serving with the U.S. Geological Survey, observed that crude petroleum generated bands of color as it seeped upwards through finely divided clay or limestone.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Day (1897) [https://books.google.com/books?id=IQkDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "A suggestion as to the origin of Pennsylvania petroleum,"] ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', '''36''' (154) :  112-115.  From page 115:  " … by experimental work it may easily be demonstrated that if we saturate a limestone such as the Trenton limestone with the oils characteristic of that rock and exert slight pressure upon it, so that it may flow upward through finely divided clay, it is easy to change it in its color … "&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1900, he reported his findings at the First International Petroleum Congress in Paris, where they created a sensation.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Day's discovery, other researchers investigated the diffusion of petroleum through finely divided earths; viz, the German organic chemist [[Karl Engler]] (1842-1925) of the Technical University Karlsruhe and the American chemist Joseph Elliot Gilpin (1866-1924) of Johns Hopkins University.

==Tsvet and column chromatography==
[[File:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 7.jpg|right|thumb|75px|Thin layer chromatography is used to separate the colorful components of a plant extract]]
The first true chromatography is usually attributed to the Russian-Italian botanist [[Mikhail Tsvet]].  Tsvet applied his observations with filter paper extraction to the new methods of column [[fractionation]] that had been developed in the 1890s for separating the components of [[petroleum]]. He used a liquid-adsorption column containing [[calcium carbonate]] to separate yellow, orange, and green plant [[pigment]]s (what are known today as [[xanthophylls]], [[carotenes]], and [[chlorophyll]]s, respectively). The method was described on December 30, 1901 at the 11th Congress of Naturalists and Doctors (XI съезд естествоиспытателей и врачей) in [[Saint Petersburg]]. The first printed description was in 1903, in the Proceedings of the [[Warsaw]] Society of Naturalists, section of biology.  He first used the term ''chromatography'' in print in 1906 in his two papers about chlorophyll in the German botanical journal, ''Berichte der Deutschen Botanischen Gesellschaft''. In 1907 he demonstrated his chromatograph for the German Botanical Society. Mikhail's surname "Цвет" means "color" in Russian, so there is the possibility that his naming the procedure chromatography (literally "color writing") was a way that he could make sure that he, a commoner in Tsarist Russia, could be immortalized.

In a 1903 lecture (published in 1905), Tsvet also described using filter paper to approximate the properties of living plant fibers in his experiments on plant pigments&amp;mdash;a precursor to [[paper chromatography]].  He found that he could extract some pigments (such as orange [[carotene]]s and yellow [[xanthophyll]]s) from leaves with [[non-polar solvent]]s, but others (such as [[chlorophyll]]) required [[polar solvent]]s.  He reasoned that chlorophyll was held to the plant tissue by [[adsorption]], and that stronger solvents were necessary to overcome the adsorption.  To test this, he applied dissolved pigments to filter paper, allowed the solvent to evaporate, then applied different solvents to see which could extract the pigments from the filter paper.  He found the same pattern as from leaf extractions: carotene could be extracted from filter paper using non-polar solvents, but chlorophyll required polar solvents.&lt;ref&gt;Ettre (2001), pp. 412-413.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsvet's work saw little use until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1952), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martin and Synge and partition chromatography==

Chromatography methods changed little after Tsvet's work until the explosion of mid-20th century research in new techniques, particularly thanks to the work of [[Archer John Porter Martin]] and [[Richard Laurence Millington Synge]].  By "the marrying of two techniques, that of chromatography and that of countercurrent solvent extraction",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| title = Archer J. P. Martin - Nobel Lecture - martin-lecture.pdf| accessdate = 2016-02-27| url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1952/martin-lecture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin and Synge developed [[partition chromatography]] to separate chemicals with only slight differences in [[partition coefficient]]s between two liquid solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 19| issue = 5| pages = 506–512| last = Ettre| first = C.| title = Milestones in Chromatography: The Birth of Partition Chromatography| journal = LCGC| accessdate = 2016-02-26| date = 2001| url = http://images.alfresco.advanstar.com/alfresco_images/pharma/2014/08/22/1598ed6f-5bbe-400b-bc08-ff07d2c59826/article-2090.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin, who had previously been working in vitamin chemistry (including attempts to purify [[vitamin E]]), began collaborating with Synge in 1938, brought his experience with equipment design to Synge's project of separating [[amino acids]].  After unsuccessful experiments with complex [[countercurrent distribution|countercurrent extraction]] machines and liquid-liquid chromatography methods where the liquids move in opposite directions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0264-6021| volume = 35| issue = 1-2| pages = 91–121| last1 = Martin| first1 = A J P| last2 = Synge| first2 = R L M| title = Separation of the higher monoamino-acids by counter-current liquid-liquid extraction: the amino-acid composition of wool| journal = Biochemical Journal| date = 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin hit on the idea of using silica gel in columns to hold water stationary while an organic solvent flows through the column.  Martin and Synge demonstrated the potential of the methods by separating amino acids marked in the column by the addition of [[methyl red]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1952), pp. 362-366&lt;/ref&gt;  In a series of publications beginning in 1941, they described increasingly powerful methods of separating amino acids and other organic chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 35| issue = 12| pages = 1358–1368| last1 = Martin| first1 = A J P| last2 = Synge| first2 = R L M| title = A new form of chromatogram employing two liquid phases A theory of chromatography. 2. Application to the micro-determination of the higher monoamino-acids in proteins| journal = Biochemical Journal| date = 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pursuit of better and easier methods of identifying the amino acid constituents of peptides, Martin and Synge turned to other chromatography media as well.  A short abstract in 1943 followed by a detailed article in 1944 described the use of filter paper as the stationary phase for performing chromatography on amino acids: [[paper chromatography]].&lt;ref&gt;Whelan (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1947, Martin, Synge and their collaborators had applied this method (along with [[Sanger's reagent|Fred Sanger's reagent]] for identifying [[N-terminal]] residues) to determine the pentapeptide sequence of [[Gramicidin S]].  These and related paper chromatography methods were also foundational to [[Fred Sanger]]'s effort to determine the [[amino acid sequence]] of [[insulin]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanger (1988), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refining the techniques==

Martin, in collaboration with [[Anthony T. James]], went on to develop [[gas chromatography]] (the principles of which Martin and Synge had laid out in their landmark 1941 paper) beginning in 1949.  In 1952, during his lecture for the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] (shared with Synge, for their earlier chromatography work) Martin announced the successful separation of a wide variety of natural compounds by gas chromatography.  (Austrian chemist Fritz Prior had achieved limited success with gas chromatography, separating [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]], in 1947 during his Ph.D. research.  The method of Martin and James, however, became the basis for subsequent developments in gas chromatography.)&lt;ref&gt;Lesney (1998).  Accessed July 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ease and efficiency of gas chromatography for separating organic chemicals spurred the rapid adoption of the method, as well as the rapid development of new detection methods for analyzing the output.  The [[thermal conductivity detector]], described in 1954 by N. H. Ray, was the foundation for several other methods: the [[flame ionization detector]] was described by J. Harley, W. Nel, and V. Pretorius in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;Ettre, L.S. ''Chapters in the Evolution of Chromatography.'' [http://www.chromsource.com/books/Milestones-FID.pdf Chapter 17, The Invention, Development and Triumph of the Flame Ionization Detector], pp. 171-180.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Lovelock]] introduced the [[electron capture detector]] that year as well.  Others introduced [[mass spectrometer]]s to gas chromatography in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Touchstone (1993), p. 1650&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Martin and Synge also set the stage for [[high performance liquid chromatography]], suggesting that small sorbent particles and pressure could produce fast liquid chromatography techniques.  This became widely practical by the late 1960s (and the method was used to separate amino acids as early as 1960).&lt;ref&gt;Touchstone (1993), pp. 1655-1656&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thin layer chromatography==
The first developments in [[thin layer chromatography]] occurred in the 1940s, and techniques advanced rapidly in the 1950s after the introduction of relatively large plates and relatively stable materials for [[sorbent]] layers.&lt;ref&gt;Touchstone (1993), pp. 1651-1652&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==

In 1987 [[Pedro Cuatrecasas]] and [[Meir Wilchek]] were awarded the [[Wolf Prize in Medicine]] for the invention and development of [[affinity chromatography]] and its applications to biomedical sciences.

The '''history of painting''' reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic humans, and spans all cultures. It represents a continuous, though periodically disrupted, tradition from Antiquity.

Initially serving utilitarian purpose, followed by imperial, private, civic, and religious patronage, Eastern and Western painting later found audiences in the [[aristocracy]] and the middle class. From the Modern era, the [[Middle Ages]] through the [[Renaissance]] painters worked for the church and a wealthy aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rr17bb/patronage.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:52:16 Discussion of the role of patrons in the Renaissance].

==Pre-history==

The oldest known paintings are approximately 40,000 years old. José Luis Sanchidrián at the [[University of Córdoba (Spain)|University of Cordoba]], Spain, believes the paintings are more likely to have been painted by [[Neanderthals]] than early modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21458-first-neanderthal-cave-paintings-discovered-in-spain.html|title=First Neanderthal cave paintings discovered in Spain |author=Fergal MacErlean|date=10 February 2012|accessdate=10 February 2012|work=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18449711 Jonathan Amos, ''Red dot becomes oldest cave art'', BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5883082/this-is-the-first-painting-humanity-ever-made Gizmodo, ''These Are the Earliest Human Paintings Ever'']&lt;/ref&gt; Images at the [[Chauvet cave]] in France are thought to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth or humans often hunting. There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc.

Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the people that made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to "catch" their [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[spirit]] in order to hunt them more easily or the paintings may represent an [[animistic]] vision and homage to surrounding [[nature]]. They may be the result of a basic need of expression that is [[innate]] to human beings, or they could have been for the transmission of practical information.

In [[Paleolithic]] times, the representation of humans in cave paintings was rare. Mostly, animals were painted, not only animals that were used as food but also animals that represented strength like the [[rhinoceros]] or large [[Felidae]], as in the Chauvet Cave. Signs like dots were sometimes drawn. Rare human representations include handprints and stencils, and figures depicting [[therianthrope|human / animal]] hybrids. The Chauvet Cave in the [[Ardèche]] [[Departments of France]] contains the most important preserved cave paintings of the Paleolithic era, painted around 31,000 BC. The [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira]] cave paintings in Spain were done 14,000 to 12,000 BC and show, among others, [[bison]]s. The hall of bulls in [[Lascaux]], Dordogne, France, is one of the best known cave paintings and dates to about 15,000 to 10,000 BC.

If there is meaning to the paintings, it remains unknown. The caves were not in an inhabited area, so they may have been used for seasonal rituals. The animals are accompanied by signs which suggest a possible magic use. Arrow-like symbols in Lascaux are sometimes interpreted as being used as [[calendar]]s or [[almanac]]s, but the evidence remains inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hoover, "Art of the Paleolithic and Neolithic Eras", from ''Art History Survey 1'', San Antonio College (July 2001; accessed 11 June 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The most important work of the [[Mesolithic]] era were the ''marching warriors'', a rock painting at Cingle de la Mola, [[Province of Castellón|Castellón]], Spain dated to about 7000 to 4000 BC. The technique used was probably spitting or blowing the pigments onto the rock. The paintings are quite naturalistic, though stylized. The figures are not three-dimensional, even though they overlap

The earliest known Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], Maharashtra state present a fine example of Indian paintings. The colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals.

[[Chinese painting]] is one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world. The earliest paintings were not representational but ornamental; they consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures. Early pottery was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals. It was only during the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 B.C.) that artists began to represent the world around them. [[Japanese painting]] is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. The history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. Korean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy.

China, Japan and Korea have a strong tradition in painting which is also highly attached to the art of [[calligraphy]] and [[printmaking]] (so much that it is commonly seen as painting). Far east traditional painting is characterized by water based techniques, less realism, "elegant" and stylized subjects, graphical approach to depiction, the importance of [[white space (visual arts)|white space]] (or [[negative space]]) and a preference for [[landscape]] (instead of the human figure) as a subject. Beyond ink and color on silk or paper scrolls, gold on [[lacquer]] was also a common medium in painted East Asian artwork. Although silk was a somewhat expensive medium to paint upon in the past, the invention of paper during the 1st century AD by the Han court eunuch [[Cai Lun]] provided not only a cheap and widespread medium for writing, but also a cheap and widespread medium for painting (making it more accessible to the public).

The ideologies of [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], and [[Buddhism]] played important roles in East Asian art. Medieval [[Song dynasty]] painters such as [[Lin Tinggui]] and his ''Luohan Laundering''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=1691|title=Open F-S: Sketch after Cecil Lawson's Swan and Iris|website=Freer - Sackler|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611100744/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=1691|archivedate=11 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (housed in the [[Smithsonian]] [[Freer Gallery of Art]]) of the 12th century are excellent examples of Buddhist ideas fused into classical Chinese artwork. In the latter painting on silk (image and description provided in the link), bald-headed Buddhist [[Arhat|Luohan]] are depicted in a practical setting of washing clothes by a river. However, the painting itself is visually stunning, with the Luohan portrayed in rich detail and bright, opaque colors in contrast to a hazy, brown, and bland wooded environment. Also, the tree tops are shrouded in swirling fog, providing the common "negative space" mentioned above in East Asian Art.

[[Image:Ch'iu Ying 001.jpg|left|thumb|''Spring Morning in the Han Palace'', by Ming-era artist [[Qiu Ying]] (1494–1552 AD)]]

The earliest surviving examples of Chinese painted artwork date to the [[Warring States]] Period (481 – 221 BC), with paintings on silk or tomb murals on rock, brick, or stone. They were often in simplistic stylized format and in more-or-less rudimentary geometric patterns. They often depicted mythological creatures, domestic scenes, labor scenes, or palatial scenes filled with officials at court. Artwork during this period and the subsequent [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 – 207 BC) and [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD) was made not as a means in and of itself or for higher personal expression; rather artwork was created to symbolize and honor funerary rites, representations of mythological deities or spirits of ancestors, etc. Paintings on silk of court officials and domestic scenes could be found during the Han Dynasty, along with scenes of men hunting on horseback or partaking in military parade. There was also painting on three dimensional works of art like figurines and statues, such as the original-painted colors covering the soldier and horse statues of the [[Terracotta Army]]. During the social and cultural climate of the ancient [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] (316 – 420 AD) based at Nanjing in the south, painting became one of the official pastimes of [[Confucian]]-taught bureaucratic officials and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] (along with music played by the [[guqin]] zither, writing fanciful [[calligraphy]], and writing and reciting of poetry). Painting became a common form of artistic self-expression, and during this period painters at court or amongst elite social circuits were judged and ranked by their peers.

[[Image:Zhang Shengwen. L'enseignement de Bouddha Sakyamuni.jpg|thumb|''The [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni Buddha]]'', by [[Zhang Shengwen]], 1173–1176 AD, [[Song dynasty]] period.]]
The establishment of classical Chinese landscape painting is accredited largely to the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] artist [[Gu Kaizhi]] (344 – 406 AD), one of the most famous artists of Chinese history. Like the elongated scroll scenes of Kaizhi, [[Tang dynasty]] (618 – 907 AD) Chinese artists like [[Wu Daozi]] painted vivid and highly detailed artwork on long horizontal handscrolls (which were very popular during the Tang), such as his ''Eighty Seven Celestial People''. Painted artwork during the Tang period pertained the effects of an idealized landscape environment, with sparse numbers of objects, persons, or amount of activity, as well as monochromatic in nature (example: the murals of Price Yide's tomb in the Qianling Mausoleum). There were also figures such as early Tang-era painter [[Zhan Ziqian]], who painted superb landscape paintings that were well ahead of his day in portrayal of realism. However, landscape art did not reach greater level of maturity and realism in general until the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period (907 – 960 AD). During this time, there were exceptional landscape painters like [[Dong Yuan]] (refer to this article for an example of his artwork), and those who painted more vivid and realistic depictions of domestic scenes, like [[Gu Hongzhong]] and his ''Night Revels of Han Xizai''.
[[Image:Loquats and Mountain Bird.jpg|thumb|left|''Loquats and Mountain Bird'', anonymous artist of the [[Southern Song dynasty]]; paintings in leaf album style such as this were popular in the Southern Song (1127–1279).]]

During the Chinese [[Song dynasty]] (960 – 1279 AD), not only landscape art was improved upon, but portrait painting became more standardized and sophisticated than before (for example, refer to [[Emperor Huizong of Song]]), and reached its classical age maturity during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368 – 1644 AD). During the late 13th century and first half of the 14th century, Chinese under the [[Mongol]]-controlled [[Yuan Dynasty]] were not allowed to enter higher posts of government (reserved for Mongols or other ethnic groups from Central Asia), and the [[Imperial examination]] was ceased for the time being. Many Confucian-educated Chinese who now lacked profession turned to the arts of painting and theatre instead, as the Yuan period became one of the most vibrant and abundant eras for Chinese artwork. An example of such would be [[Qian Xuan]] (1235–1305 AD), who was an official of the Song dynasty, but out of patriotism, refused to serve the Yuan court and dedicated himself to painting. Examples of superb art from this period include the rich and detailed painted murals of the Yongle Palace ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405094841/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |archivedate=5 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=245&amp;c=55|title=Chinastudies - bacheloropleiding - Geesteswetenschappen - Humanities - Universiteit Leiden|website=www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Dachunyang Longevity Palace", of 1262 AD, a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage site. Within the palace, paintings cover an area of more than 1000 square meters, and hold mostly Daoist themes. It was during the Song dynasty that painters would also gather in social clubs or meetings to discuss their art or others' artwork, the praising of which often led to persuasions to trade and sell precious works of art. However, there were also many harsh critics of others art as well, showing the difference in style and taste amongst different painters. In 1088 AD, the polymath scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] once wrote of the artwork of one [[Li Cheng (painter)|Li Cheng]], who he criticized as follows:

{{quote|
...Then there was Li Cheng, who when he depicted [[pavilion]]s and lodges amidst mountains, storeyed buildings, [[pagoda]]s and the like, always used to paint the [[eave]]s as seen from below. His idea was that 'one should look upwards from underneath, just as a man standing on level ground and looking up at the eaves of a pagoda can see its rafters and its cantilever eave rafters'. This is all wrong. In general the proper way of painting a landscape is to see the small from the viewpoint of the large...just as one looks at artificial mountains in gardens (as one walks about). If one applies (Li's method) to the painting of real mountains, looking up at them from below, one can only see one profile at a time, and not the wealth of their multitudinous slopes and profiles, to say nothing of all that is going on in the valleys and [[canyon]]s, and in the lanes and [[courtyard]]s with their dwellings and houses. If we stand to the east of a mountain its western parts would be on the vanishing boundary of far-off distance, and vice versa. Surely this could not be called a successful painting? Mr. Li did not understand the principle of 'seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large'. He was certainly marvelous at diminishing accurately heights and distances, but should one attach such importance to the angles and corners of buildings?&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986).

Although high level of stylization, mystical appeal, and surreal elegance were often preferred over realism (such as in [[shan shui]] style), beginning with the medieval Song dynasty there were many Chinese painters then and afterwards who depicted scenes of nature that were vividly real. Later Ming Dynasty artists would take after this Song dynasty emphasis for intricate detail and realism on objects in nature, especially in depictions of animals (such as ducks, swans, sparrows, tigers, etc.) amongst patches of brightly colored flowers and thickets of brush and wood (a good example would be the anonymous Ming Dynasty painting ''Birds and Plum Blossoms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704090030/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-07-04|title=Request Rejected|website=www.asia.si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; housed in the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.). There were many renowned Ming Dynasty artists; [[Qiu Ying]] is an excellent example of a paramount Ming era painter (famous even in his own day), utilizing in his artwork domestic scenes, bustling palatial scenes, and nature scenes of river valleys and steeped mountains shrouded in mist and swirling clouds. During the Ming Dynasty there were also different and rivaling schools of art associated with painting, such as the [[Wu School]] and the [[Zhe school (painting)|Zhe School]].

Classical Chinese painting continued on into the early modern [[Qing Dynasty]], with highly realistic portrait paintings like seen in the late Ming Dynasty of the early 17th century. The portraits of [[Kangxi Emperor]], [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and [[Qianlong Emperor]] are excellent examples of realistic Chinese portrait painting. During the Qianlong reign period and the continuing 19th century, European [[Baroque]] styles of painting had noticeable influence on Chinese portrait paintings, especially with painted visual effects of lighting and shading. Likewise, East Asian paintings and other works of art (such as [[porcelain]] and lacquerware) were highly prized in Europe since initial contact in the 16th century.

====Japanese ====
{{main|Japanese painting|Japonism}}

Japanese painting (絵画) is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the Japanese arts, encompassing a wide variety of genres and styles. As with Japanese arts in general, Japanese painting developed through a long history of synthesis and competition between native Japanese [[aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. [[Ukiyo-e]], or "pictures of the floating world," is a genre of Japanese [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] (or "[[woodcut]]s") and paintings produced between the 17th and 20th centuries, featuring motifs of landscapes, theater, and courtesan districts. It is the main artistic genre of [[woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese woodblock printing]]. Japanese printmaking, especially from the [[Edo period]], exerted enormous influence on [[French painting]] over the 19th century.

====Korean ====
{{main|Korean painting}}

Korean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy. It wasn't until the [[Joseon dynasty]] that Confucian themes began to take root in Korean paintings, used in harmony with indigenous aspects.

The history of Korean painting has been characterized by the use monochromatic works of black brushwork, often on mulberry paper or silk. This style is evident in "Min-Hwa", or colorful folk art, tomb paintings, and ritual and festival arts, both of which incorporated an extensive use of colour.

===Indian ===
{{main|Indian painting|Mughal painting}}
Indian paintings historically revolved around the religious deities and kings. Indian art is a collective term for several different schools of art that existed in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The paintings varied from large frescoes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] to the intricate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniature paintings to the metal embellished works from the [[Tanjore]] school. The paintings from the [[Gandhar(city/kingdom)|Gandhar]]–[[Taxila]] are influenced by the [[Persian art|Persian]] works in the west. The eastern style of painting was mostly developed around the [[Nalanda]] school of art. The works are mostly inspired by various scenes from [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]].

====History====
[[Image:Bhimbetka.JPG|thumb|[[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], [[rock painting]], [[Stone Age]], India]]

The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], Maharashtra state present a fine example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals.

[[Ajanta Caves]] in Maharashtra, India are [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] cave monuments dating back to the 2nd century [[BCE]] and containing paintings and sculpture considered to be masterpieces of both Buddhist religious art&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site.

=====Rajput =====
[[Rajput painting]], a style of [[Indian painting]], evolved and flourished, during the 18th century, in the royal courts of [[Rajputana]], India. Each Rajput kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, and humans. Miniatures were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but several manuscripts also contain Rajput paintings, and paintings were even done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelies, particularly, the havelis of Shekhawait.

The colors extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones, gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colors was a lengthy process, sometimes taking weeks. Brushes used were very fine.

=====Mughal =====
[[File:Two Scribes Seated with Books and a Writing Table Fragment of a decorative margin Northern India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Two Scribes Seated with Books and a Writing Table Fragment of a decorative margin Northern India (Mughal school), ca. 1640–1650]]
[[Mughal painting]] is a particular style of [[Indian painting]], generally confined to illustrations on the book and done in miniatures, and which emerged, developed and took shape during the period of the [[Mughal Empire]] 16th −19th centuries.

=====Tanjore =====
[[Tanjore painting]] is an important form of classical [[South India]]n painting native to the town of [[Tanjore]] in Tamil Nadu. The art form dates back to the early 9th century, a period dominated by the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] rulers, who encouraged art and literature. These paintings are known for their elegance, rich colors, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are [[Hindu]] Gods and Goddesses and scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.

The process of making a Tanjore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of a cloth pasted over a wooden base. Then chalk powder or [[zinc oxide]] is mixed with water-soluble [[adhesive]] and applied on the base. To make the base smoother, a mild [[abrasive]] is sometimes used. After the drawing is made, decoration of the jewellery and the apparels in the image is done with semi-precious stones. Laces or threads are also used to decorate the jewellery. On top of this, the gold foils are pasted. Finally, [[dyes]] are used to add colors to the figures in the paintings.

=====Madras School=====
During British rule in India, the crown found that Madras had some of the most talented and intellectual artistic minds in the world. As the British had also established a huge settlement in and around Madras, Georgetown was chosen to establish an institute that would cater to the artistic expectations of the royal family in London. This has come to be known as the [[Madras School]]. At first traditional artists were employed to produce exquisite varieties of furniture, metal work, and curios and their work was sent to the royal palaces of the Queen.

Unlike the Bengal School where 'copying' is the norm of teaching, the Madras School flourishes on 'creating' new styles, arguments and trends.

=====Bengal School=====
{{main|Bengal school of art}}

[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|right|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871–1951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]
The [[Bengal school of art]] was an influential style of art that flourished in [[British India|India]] during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. It was associated with Indian nationalism, but was also promoted and supported by many British arts administrators.

The Bengal School arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by [[Indian artist]]s such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures. This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havel was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianist]] model of art.

The Bengal School's influence in India declined with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas in the 1920s. In the post-independence period, Indian artists showed more adaptability as they borrowed freely from european styles and amalgamated them freely with the Indian motifs to new forms of art. While artists like [[Francis Newton Souza]] and [[Tyeb Mehta]] were more western in their approach, there were others like [[Ganesh Pyne]] and [[Maqbool Fida Husain]] who developed thoroughly indigenous styles of work. Today after the process of liberalization of market in India, the artists are experiencing more exposure to the international art-scene which is helping them in emerging with newer forms of art which were hitherto not seen in India. [[Jitish Kallat]] had shot to fame in the late 1990s with his paintings which were both modern and beyond the scope of generic definition. However, while artists in India in the new century are trying out new styles, themes and metaphors, it would not have been possible to get such quick recognition without the aid of the business houses which are now entering the art field like they had never before.

=====Modern Indian =====

During the colonial era, Western influences started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes. Others, like [[Jamini Roy]], consciously drew inspiration from folk art.

By the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.

The [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. The founders were six eminent artists – [[K. H. Ara]], [[S. K. Bakre]], [[H. A. Gade]], [[M.F. Husain]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[Francis Newton Souza|F. N. Souza]], though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, [[Manishi Dey]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde|V. S. Gaitonde]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], and [[Akbar Padamsee]]. Other famous painters like [[Jahar Dasgupta]], Prokash Karmakar, [[John Wilkins (Indian artist)|John Wilkins]], Narayanan Ramachandran, and Bijon Choudhuri enriched the art culture of India. They have become the icons of modern Indian art. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Geeta Vadhera has had acclaim in translating complex, Indian spiritual themes onto canvas like Sufi thought, the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Geeta.

Indian art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since the early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. In post-liberalization India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like the abstract painter [[Natvar Bhavsar]], figurative artist [[Devajyoti Ray]] and sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] whose mammoth [[postminimalist]] artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size. Many art houses and galleries have also opened in USA and Europe to showcase Indian artworks.

Filipino painting as a whole can be seen as an amalgamation of many cultural influences, though it tends to be more Western in its current form with Eastern roots.

Early Filipino painting can be found in red slip (clay mixed with water) designs embellished on the ritual pottery of the Philippines such as the acclaimed [[Manunggul Jar]]. Evidence of Philippine pottery-making dated as early as 6000{{nbsp}}BC has been found in Sanga-sanga Cave, Sulu and Laurente Cave, Cagayan. It has been proven that by 5000{{nbsp}}BC, the making of pottery was practiced throughout the country. Early Filipinos started making pottery before their Cambodian neighbors and at about the same time as the Thais as part of what appears to be a widespread Ice Age development of pottery technology. Further evidences of painting are manifested in the [[History of tattooing#Philippines|tattoo tradition]] of early Filipinos, whom the Portuguese explorer referred to as ''Pintados'' or the 'Painted People' of the Visayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |title=Islas de los Pintados: The Visayan Islands |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927161432/http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various designs referencing flora and fauna with heavenly bodies decorate their bodies in various colored pigmentation. Perhaps, some of the most elaborate painting done by early Filipinos that survive to the present day can be manifested among the arts and architecture of the [[Maranao]] who are well known for the [[Nāga]] Dragons and the [[Sarimanok]] carved and painted in the beautiful Panolong of their Torogan or King's House.

Filipinos began creating paintings in the European tradition during the 17th-century Spanish period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filipinocultured.blogspot.com/2007/09/best-of-filipino-art-part-1.html |title=Filipino Cultured: The Best of Filipino Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest of these paintings were Church frescoes, religious imagery from Biblical sources, as well as engravings, sculptures and lithographs featuring Christian icons and European nobility. Most of the paintings and sculptures between the 19th, and 20th century produced a mixture of religious, political, and landscape art works, with qualities of sweetness, dark, and light. Early [[modern art|modernist]] painters such as [[Damián Domingo]] was associated with religious and secular paintings. The art of [[Juan Luna]] and [[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo|Félix Hidalgo]] showed a trend for political statement. Artist such as [[Fernando Amorsolo]] used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated Philippine culture, nature, and harmony. While other artists such as [[Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo|Fernando Zóbel]] used realities and [[abstract art|abstract]] on his work.

[[Ancient Egypt]], a civilization with very strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colours) also had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on [[papyrus]] [[manuscript]]s. Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat [[silhouette]], in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian painting]] has close connection with its written language – called [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on [[linen]], remnants of which survive today. Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the [[afterlife]] of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the deceased to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses [[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Anubis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the [[New Kingdom]] and later, the [[Book of the Dead]] was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife.

To the north of [[Egypt]] was the [[Minoan civilization]] centered on the island of [[Crete]]. The wall paintings found in the palace of [[Knossos]] are similar to that of the [[Egyptians]] but much more free in style. [[Mycenaean Greece]], beginning around 1600 BC, produced similar art to that of Minoan Crete. [[Ancient Greek art]] during the [[Greek Dark Age]] became far less complex, but the renewal of Greek civilization [[Colonies in antiquity|throughout the Mediterranean]] during [[Archaic Greece]] brought about new forms of Greek art with the [[Orientalizing period|Orientalizing style]].

[[File:Hades and Persephone, Vergina.jpg|thumb|400px|A fresco showing [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]] riding in a [[chariot]], from the tomb of Queen [[Eurydice I of Macedon]] at [[Vergina]], Greece, 4th century BC]]
[[Ancient Greece]] had skilled painters, sculptors (though both endeavours were regarded as mere manual labour at the time), and architects. The [[Parthenon]] is an example of their architecture that has lasted to modern days. Greek marble sculpture is often described as the highest form of [[classicism|Classical]] art. Painting on [[pottery of Ancient Greece]] and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in Ancient Greece functioned. [[Black-figure vase painting]] and [[Red-figure vase painting]] gives many surviving examples of what Greek painting was. Some famous Greek painters on wooden panels who are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]], however no examples of Ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans. Zeuxis lived in 5–6{{nbsp}}BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes. Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color and modeling.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and [[fresco]]es, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy at sites such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the Ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portraits]] of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]]. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.

The rise of Christianity imparted a different spirit and aim to painting styles. [[Byzantine art]], once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional [[iconography]] and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the living traditions of Greek and Russian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[icon]]-painting.  Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation.  There were many [[fresco]]s, but fewer of these have survived than [[mosaic]]s.
Byzantine art has been compared to contemporary [[abstraction]], in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape.  Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the [[Chora Church]] in Istanbul.
[[Image:Hastings book of the hours.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Book of Hours]]]]
In post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in [[Evangelist portrait]]s. [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented.  The art of this period combines Insular and "barbarian" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.

Walls of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] churches were decorated with [[fresco]]es as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining [[mural]]s have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]].  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.

Churches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful [[stained glass]] become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the [[bourgeoisie]]. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as International style and [[tempera]] panel paintings and altarpieces gained importance.

The Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, heralded the study of classical sources, as well as advances in science which profoundly influenced European intellectual and artistic life. In the [[Low Countries]], especially in modern day [[Flanders]], a new way of painting was established in the beginning of the 15th century. In the footsteps of the developments made in the [[illuminated manuscript|illumination of manuscripts]], especially by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al"&gt;Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., &amp; Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430-437&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of [[oil painting]] whose invention was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to [[Jan van Eyck]], made possible a new [[verisimilitude]] in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of [[Melchior Broederlam]], but painters like Jan van Eyck and [[Robert Campin]] brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism they were aiming for. With this new medium the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and was a major difference to the matte surface of [[tempera]] paint used in Italy.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of Ancient Greece and Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism). The most important artist of this time was [[Jan van Eyck]], whose work ranks among the finest made by artists who are now known as [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painters]] or [[Flemish Primitives]] (since most artists were active in cities in modern day Flanders). The first painter of this period was [[the Master of Flémalle]], nowadays identified as [[Robert Campin]], whose work follows the art of the [[International Gothic]]. Another important painter of this period was [[Rogier van der Weyden]], whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]], which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists from this period are [[Hugo van der Goes]] (whose work was highly influential in Italy), [[Dieric Bouts]] (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point),&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[Gerard David]].

In Italy, the art of [[Classical antiquity]] inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. Artists such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Masaccio]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raphael]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic style emerged in [[Venice]]. Painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], such as [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting.

Flemish, Dutch and German painters of the Renaissance such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], [[Hieronymous Bosch]], and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] represent a different approach from their Italian colleagues, one that is more realistic and less idealized. [[Genre painting]] became a popular idiom amongst the Northern painters like [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]].

Renaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science ([[astronomy]], [[geography]]) that occurred in this period, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and the invention of the [[printing press]]. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere [[artisan]]s but [[Intellectual|thinkers]] as well. With the development of [[easel painting]] in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.

The [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylized art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as [[Tintoretto]], Pontormo, and [[Bronzino]], and appeared later in the work of [[Northern Mannerism|Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], and [[Joachim Wtewael]].

Baroque painting is associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]], a movement often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]] and the [[Counter Reformation]] or Catholic Revival;&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=11 December 2008 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of important Baroque painting in non-absolutist and Protestant states also, however, underscores its popularity, as the style spread throughout Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows. Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. During the period beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century, painting is characterized as Baroque. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are [[Caravaggio]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], and [[Johannes Vermeer]]. Caravaggio is an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.
Baroque painting often dramatizes scenes using light effects; this can be seen in works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, [[Le Nain]], [[Georges de La Tour|La Tour]], and [[Jusepe de Ribera]].

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Portret van een paar als oudtestamentische figuren, genaamd 'Het Joodse bruidje' - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Jewish Bride'', ca.&amp;nbsp;1665–1669]]
In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the [[Grand Manner]] by artists such as [[the Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Luca Giordano]]. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by [[Pietro da Cortona]] seemed to open to the sky. A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]], where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in [[genre painting|genre]], others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, [[Gerard ter Borch]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]] brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did [[Willem Claesz. Heda]] to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual [[painterliness|painterly]] style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]] lose their theatrical quality.

During the 18th century, [[Rococo]] followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion.  The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications.  It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, [[Bohemia]], and [[Austria]], where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.  German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while [[Frederician Rococo]] developed in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The French masters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]] represent the style, as do [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the ''Anti-Rococo''. [[Portrait]]ure was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were [[William Hogarth]], in a blunt realist style, and [[Francis Hayman]], [[Angelica Kauffman]] (who was Swiss), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] in more flattering styles influenced by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. In France during the Rococo era [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (the favorite painter of [[Denis Diderot]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–225. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; excelled in portraits and [[history painting]]s, and [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] and [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] were highly accomplished [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]]. La Tour specialized in [[pastel]] painting, which became a popular medium during this period.

[[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art.  Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737 Uni-Heidelberg.de]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] artists like [[Jacques-Louis David]].

After [[Rococo]] there arose in the late 18th century, in architecture, and then in painting severe [[neo-classicism]], best represented by such artists as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] and his heir [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]. Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize [[Romanticism]].
This movement turned its attention toward landscape and nature as well as the human figure and the supremacy of natural order above mankind's will. There is a [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophy (see [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]) within this conception that opposes [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals by seeing mankind's destiny in a more tragic or pessimistic light. The idea that human beings are not above the forces of [[Nature]] is in contradiction to [[Ancient Greek]] and Renaissance ideals where mankind was above all things and owned his fate. This thinking led romantic artists to depict the [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublime]], ruined churches, shipwrecks, massacres and madness.

By the mid-19th-century painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. The idea "art for art's sake" began to find expression in the work of painters like Francisco de Goya, John Constable, and J.M.W. Turner. Romantic painters saw [[landscape painting]] as an important genre to express the vanity of mankind in opposition to the grandeur of nature. Until then, landscape painting wasn't considered the most important genre for painters (like portraiture or history painting). But painters like J.M.W. Turner and Caspar David Friedrich managed to elevate landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting.
Some of the major painters of this period are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Théodore Géricault]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[John Constable]]. [[Francisco de Goya]]'s late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, while the work of [[Arnold Böcklin]] evokes mystery and the paintings of [[Aesthetic movement]] artist [[James McNeill Whistler]] evoke both sophistication and [[decadent movement|decadence]]. In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the [[Hudson River School]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708024742/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |last=Novack |first=Barbara |title=American Sublime Artforum |year=2002 |accessdate=30 October 2008 |work=ArtForum }}&lt;/ref&gt; exponents include [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[John Frederick Kensett]]. [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]] was a movement in American landscape painting related to the [[Hudson River School]].

[[Image:Mary Cassatt Young Mother Sewing.jpg|thumb|left|''Young Mother Sewing'', [[Mary Cassatt]]]]The leading [[Barbizon School]] painter [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]] painted in both a romantic and a [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] vein; his work prefigures [[Impressionism]], as does the paintings of [[Eugène Boudin]] who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors. Boudin was also an important influence on the young [[Claude Monet]], whom in 1857 he introduced to [[Plein air]] painting. A major force in the turn towards [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] at mid-century was [[Gustave Courbet]]. In the latter third of the century Impressionists like [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Mary Cassatt]], and [[Edgar Degas]] worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic pallette. Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of [[Water Lilies]] painted in [[Giverny]].
[[Image:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]], 1893, early example of [[Expressionism]]]]
Pissarro adopted some of the experiments of [[Post-Impressionism]]. Slightly younger Post-Impressionists like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georges Seurat]], along with [[Paul Cézanne]] led art to the edge of [[modernism]]; for Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism; Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like
compositions; Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted [[Expressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.
The spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Childe Hassam]], [[John Twachtman]], and [[Theodore Robinson]]; and in Australia where painters of the [[Heidelberg School]] such as [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Charles Conder]] painted ''[[en plein air]]'' and were particularly interested in the Australian landscape and light. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of [[Thomas Eakins]], the [[Ashcan School]], and the landscapes and seascapes of [[Winslow Homer]], all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms. The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].

In the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Among them were [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Arnold Böcklin]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Félicien Rops]], and [[Jan Toorop]], and [[Gustave Klimt]] amongst others including the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolists]] like [[Mikhail Vrubel]].

[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] mined [[mythology]] and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar [[emblems]] of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] movement and [[Les Nabis]]. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; [[Bernard Delvaille]] has described [[René Magritte]]'s surrealism as "Symbolism plus [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Delvaille| first = Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Delvaille| title = La poésie symboliste: [anthologie]| year = 1971| isbn = 978-2-221-50161-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century modern and contemporary===
{{main|Modern Art|Modernism|Contemporary art}}
The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]].

The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Henri Matisse]]'s second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] 1907, Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[analytic Cubism]] was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'', from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[synthetic cubism]], practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and countless other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.

[[Image:De Chirico's Love Song.jpg|thumb|[[Giorgio de Chirico]] 1914, pre-[[Surrealism]]]]

Les Fauves (French for ''The Wild Beasts'') were early-20th-century painters, experimenting with freedom of expression through color. The name was given, humorously and not as a compliment, to the group by art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]]. [[Fauvism]] was a short-lived and loose grouping of early-20th-century artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. Fauvists made the subject of the painting easy to read, exaggerated perspectives and an interesting prescient prediction of the Fauves was expressed in 1888 by [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Paul Sérusier]],

''"How do you see these trees? They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure [[ultramarine]]; these red leaves? Put in [[vermilion]]."''

The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]] — friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers. Ultimately [[Matisse]] became the ''yang'' to [[Picasso]]'s ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = John Elderfield|author2=Stephen Andrew Roberts| title = European Co-operation on Social Science Information and Documentation (ECSSID) Technical Meeting, University of Kent at Canterbury, 25th-26th March 1991: Report to British Library Research &amp; Development Department| year = 1991| isbn = 978-0-87070-638-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fauvism, as a movement, had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907, they only had three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse ''The Green Line'', (above), caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight; art as a decoration was his purpose and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], [[André Derain]] went to London and produced a series of paintings like ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' (above) in the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]]. Masters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] continued developing their narrative styles independent of any movement throughout the 20th century.

By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, soon it was replaced by [[Cubism]] on the critics' radar screen as the latest new development in [[Contemporary Art]] of the time.
In 1907 [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in La Falange, said, "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Stanley Rubin |author2=Judith Cousins |author3=Museum of Modern Art New York| title = Picasso and Braque: pioneering cubism| year = 1989| isbn = 0-87070-676-4| page = 348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Analytic cubism]]  was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and countless other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.

During the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of [[cubism]], several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio De Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade a member of the jury at the Salon d'Automne, where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and Salon d'Automne, his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. During the first half of the 20th century in Europe masters like [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], and [[Giorgio De Chirico]] continued painting independent of any movement.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the first two decades of the 20th century and after [[Cubism]], several other important movements emerged; [[futurism (art)|futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]), [[Der Blaue Reiter]]), [[Bauhaus]], ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]) and ([[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]], [[Jean Arp|Arp]]) and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio De Chirico|De Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]], [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]). Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] architecture and design, to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and [[concrete poetry]] to advertising art and fashion. Van Gogh's painting exerted great influence upon 20th-century [[Expressionism]], as can be seen in the work of the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], [[Die Brücke]] (a group led by German painter [[Ernst Kirchner]]), and the Expressionism of [[Edvard Munch]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaim Soutine]] and others..

[[Wassily Kandinsky]] a Russian painter, [[printmaker]] and art theorist, one of the most famous 20th-century artists is generally considered the first important painter of [[Modern Art|modern]] abstract art. As an early Modernist, in search of new modes of visual expression, and spiritual expression, he theorized as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]], that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the (above gallery) ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art.'' [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His later works were more abstract, reminiscent of [[Paul Klee]]. His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color, and a clear love of experimentation of both depth and tone. At the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Delaunay and his wife the artist [[Sonia Delaunay]], joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of abstract artists, in 1911, and his art took a turn to the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 |title=Der Blaue Reiter |publisher= Tate Glossary |accessdate=10 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], who after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917, and after pressure from the [[Stalinist]] regime in 1924 returned to painting imagery and ''Peasants and Workers in the field'', and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]] whose masterful color experiments made him an important pioneer of [[abstract painting]] at the [[Bauhaus]]. Still other important pioneers of abstract painting include the Swedish artist [[Hilma af Klint]], Czech painter [[František Kupka]] as well as American artists [[Stanton MacDonald-Wright]] and [[Morgan Russell]] who, in 1912, founded [[Synchromism]], an art movement that closely resembles [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics that involve several important and related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the avant-garde art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist artists are related to both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters.

Artists as interesting and diverse as [[Marc Chagall]], whose painting ''[[I and the Village]]'', (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Käthe Schmidt Kollwitz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and some of the Americans abroad like [[Marsden Hartley]], and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as an intense [[Surrealist]] sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.

[[Piet Mondrian]]'s art was also related to his spiritual and philosophical studies. In 1908 he became interested in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] movement launched by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. Blavatsky believed that it was possible to attain a knowledge of nature more profound than that provided by empirical means, and much of Mondrian's work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge.

[[De Stijl]] also known as [[neoplasticism]], was a Dutch artistic movement founded in 1917. The term ''[[De Stijl]]'' is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=82|title=De Stijl|accessdate=31 July 2006|work=Tate Glossary|publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book| last = Curl| first = James Stevens| title = A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture| type = Paperback| edition = Second| year = 2006| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 0-19-860678-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''De Stijl'' is also the name of a journal that was published by the Dutch painter, designer, writer, and critic [[Theo van Doesburg]] propagating the group's theories. Next to van Doesburg, the group's principal members were the painters [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Vilmos Huszár]], and [[Bart van der Leck]], and the architects [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff]], and [[J. J. P. Oud]]. The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the group's work is known as ''neoplasticism'' — the new plastic art (or ''Nieuwe Beelding'' in Dutch).

Proponents of De Stijl sought to express a new [[utopia]]n ideal of spiritual harmony and order. They advocated pure [[abstract art|abstraction]] and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to the vertical and horizontal directions, and used only [[primary colors]] along with black and white. Indeed, according to the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online article on neoplasticism, Mondrian himself sets forth these delimitations in his essay "Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art". He writes, "...&amp;nbsp;this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour." The Tate article further summarizes that this art allows "only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=191 |title=Neo-Plasticism |publisher=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article on De Stijl summarizes these traits in similar terms: "It [De Stijl] was posited on the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; and the relationship between positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |title=The style; Holland, 1917 |publisher=guggenheimcollection.org |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821042905/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Stijl movement was influenced by [[Cubist]] painting as well as by the mysticism and the ideas about "ideal" geometric forms (such as the "perfect straight line") in the [[neoplatonic]] philosophy of [[mathematician]] [[M. H. J. Schoenmaekers]]. The works of De Stijl would influence the [[Bauhaus]] style and the [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, it did not follow the general guidelines of an "ism" (Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism), nor did it adhere to the principles of art schools like Bauhaus; it was a collective project, a joint enterprise.

[[Marcel Duchamp]], came to international prominence in the wake of his notorious success at the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913, (soon after he denounced artmaking for [[chess]]). After Duchamp's [[Nude Descending a Staircase]] became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''[[Large Glass]]'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zurich]], Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several [[Dadaists]] are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]].'' The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly'', (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the [[Dada]] movement through 1919 in [[Zurich]] and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. [[Joan Miró]]'s ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' of 1923–1924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Miró's first Surrealist masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=25 September 2008 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved on 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Miró's ''The Tilled Field'' also contains several parallels to Bosch's ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights|Garden of Earthly Delights]]'': similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Miró saw as a young painter in [[The Prado]]. The more abstract [[Joan Miró]], [[Jean Arp]], [[André Masson]], and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.
Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works.

Dalí and [[René Magritte|Magritte]] created some of the most widely recognized images of the movement. The 1928/1929 painting ''This Is Not A Pipe'', by [[René Magritte|Magritte]] is the subject of a [[Michel Foucault]] 1973 book, ''This is not a Pipe'' (English edition, 1991), that discusses the painting and its [[paradox]]. Dalí joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.

Surrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth by stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, in order to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, and perception, sometimes evoking empathy from the viewer, sometimes laughter and sometimes outrage and bewilderment.

1931 marked a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: in one example, liquid shapes become the trademark of Dalí, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they are melting. Evocations of time and its compelling mystery and absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79018 |title=The Persistence of Memory |publisher=MoMA Online Collection }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of this style – a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological – came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[Modernism|modernist]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be "made whole with one's individuality."
[[File:Murdering Airplane.jpg|thumb|[[Max Ernst]], 1920, early [[Surrealism]]]]
Max Ernst whose 1920 painting ''Murdering Airplane'', studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]].'' The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text |title=Max Ernst (1891–1976). Men Shall Know Nothing of This 1923 / Les Hommes n'en sauront rien |publisher=tate.org.uk |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was enormously influential in helping the newly arrived in Paris and young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in the new [[Surrealist]] painting. Miró acknowledged in letters to his dealer [[Pierre Matisse]] the importance of Masson as an example to him in his early years in Paris.

Long after personal, political and professional tensions have fragmented the Surrealist group into thin air and ether, Magritte, Miró, Dalí and the other Surrealists continue to define a visual program in the arts. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]] among others.

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with [[Die Brücke]] which was founded the previous decade in 1905 and was a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members of Die Brücke were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]], [[Otto Mueller]] and others. The group was one of the seminal ones, which in due course had a major impact on the evolution of [[modern art]] in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="bruckemuseumbrucke"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm |title=The Artists' Association Brücke |publisher=Brücke Museum |accessdate=7 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]]'', 1909 is in the gallery above, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved.
[[File:Patrick Henry Bruce Stilleben.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[American modernism]], 1924]]

The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. It is also claimed that the name could have derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.

In the USA during the period between World War I and World War II painters tended to go to Europe for recognition. Artists like [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], created reputations abroad. In New York City, [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock|Ralph Blakelock]] were influential and important figures in advanced American painting between 1900 and 1920. During the 1920s photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] exhibited [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Alfred Henry Maurer]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[John Marin]] and other artists including European Masters [[Henri Matisse]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]], at his gallery ''[[the 291]].''

[[File:Grant Wood - American Gothic - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Grant Wood]], 1930, [[social realism]]]]
During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, German Expressionism, Expressionism, and [[modernist]] and masterful color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] characterized the European art scene. In Germany [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings, foreshadowing the coming of World War II. While in America [[American Scene painting]] and the [[social realism]] and [[regionalism (art)|regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world. Artists like [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent. In Latin America besides the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]] from Mexico, the [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] paintings by [[Frida Kahlo]] began a renaissance of the arts for the region, with a use of color and historic, and political messages. [[Frida Kahlo]]'s Symbolist works also relate strongly to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. The psychological drama in many of Kahlo's self portraits (above) underscore the vitality and relevance of her paintings to artists in the 21st century.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by [[Grant Wood]] from 1930. Portraying a [[pitchfork]]-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting, like [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Christopher Morley]], they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, "[[Man at the Crossroads]]", in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. The film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' includes a dramatization of the controversy. [[Frida Kahlo]] (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are [[Self portrait|self-portraits]], which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. Christian and Jewish themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition—which were often bloody and violent—with [[surrealist]] renderings. While her paintings are not overtly Christian – she was, after all, an avowed communist – they certainly contain elements of the macabre Mexican Christian style of religious paintings.

Political activism was an important piece of [[David Siqueiros]]' life, and frequently inspired him to set aside his artistic career. His art was deeply rooted in the [[Mexican Revolution]], a violent and chaotic period in Mexican history in which various social and political factions fought for recognition and power. The period from the 1920s to the 1950s is known as the Mexican Renaissance, and Siqueiros was active in the attempt to create an art that was at once Mexican and universal. He briefly gave up painting to focus on organizing miners in Jalisco.

University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was the scene of the "[[Bombing of Gernika]]" by the Condor Legion of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. The town was devastated, though the Biscayan assembly and the Oak of Gernika survived. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.

In its final form, ''Guernica'' is an immense black and white, {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall and {{convert|7.8|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white contrasts with the intensity of the scene depicted and invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/cubism/Pablo-Picasso.html|title=Pablo Picasso – Biography, Quotes &amp; Paintings |publisher=arthistoryarchive.com |accessdate=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Picasso painted the mural sized painting called ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' in protest of the bombing. The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then [[Scandinavia]], then London in 1938 and finally in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. The painting went on a tour of museums throughout the USA until its final return to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City where it was exhibited for nearly thirty years. Finally in accord with [[Pablo Picasso]]'s wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, through the years of World War II American art was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]] in the work of [[Grant Wood]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and several others. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. It is currently in the collection of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The scene was inspired by a [[diner]] (since demolished) in [[Greenwich Village]], Hopper's home neighborhood in [[Manhattan]]. Hopper began painting it immediately after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.

The Dynamic for artists in Europe during the 1930s deteriorated rapidly as the Nazi's power in Germany and across Eastern Europe increased. The climate became so hostile for artists and art associated with [[Modernism]] and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] that many left for the Americas. ''[[Degenerate art]]'' was a term adopted by the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany for virtually all [[modern art]]. Such art was banned on the grounds that it was un-German or [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevist]] in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art entirely.

''Degenerate Art'' was also the title of an exhibition, mounted by the Nazis in [[Munich]] in 1937, consisting of modernist artworks chaotically hung and accompanied by text labels deriding the art. Designed to inflame public opinion against modernism, the exhibition subsequently traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria. German artist [[Max Beckmann]] and scores of others fled Europe for New York. In New York City a new generation of young and exciting Modernist painters led by [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], and others were just beginning to come of age.

[[Arshile Gorky]]'s portrait of someone who might be [[Willem de Kooning]] (above) is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.

====Towards mid-century====
[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Edward Hopper]] 1942, [[American Scene painting]]]]
The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], Surrealism, [[Joan Miró]], Cubism, [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors. The figurative work of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Andrew Wyeth]] and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism.

Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]]. It is seen as combining the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[futurism (art)|futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]] and synthetic cubism. Abstract expressionism, [[action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

Additionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. As seen above in the gallery ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]]'', [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV'', [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1 |title=Willem De Kooning: Woman V 1952–53 |publisher= [[National Gallery of Australia]] |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street'', 1950 as with [[Jackson Pollock]] and other Abstract Expressionists, was labelled an "action painter" because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color Field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] (gallery) can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and Color Field painting.

Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or of the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. An exception might be the drip paintings of Pollock.

Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[Social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]] but also by the [[Socialist Realism|Social Realists]] of Mexico such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of those painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early 1940s at galleries in New York like ''[[The Art of This Century Gallery]]''. The late 1940s through the mid-1950s ushered in the [[McCarthy era]]. It was after World War II and a time of political conservatism and extreme artistic censorship in the United States. Some people have conjectured that since the subject matter was often totally abstract, Abstract expressionism became a safe strategy for artists to pursue this style. Abstract art could be seen as apolitical. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders. However, those theorists are in the minority. As the first truly original school of painting in America, Abstract expressionism demonstrated the vitality and creativity of the country in the post-war years, as well as its ability (or need) to develop an aesthetic sense that was not constrained by the European standards of beauty.

Although Abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the San Francisco Bay area. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of action painting, while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the Color Field painters. Many other artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]], [[Nicolas Carone]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.  

During the 1950s Color Field painting initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Adolph Gottlieb]]. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s, ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]], – all moving in a new direction. Artists like Clyfford Still, [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. In ''Mountains and Sea'', from 1952, a seminal work of [[Color Field]] painting by [[Helen Frankenthaler]] the artist used the stain technique for the first time.

In Europe there was the continuation of Surrealism, Cubism, Dada and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to Abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Pierre Soulages]] among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.

Eventually abstract painting in America evolved into movements such as [[Neo-Dada]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism]] and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. As a response to the tendency toward abstraction imagery emerged through various new movements, notably [[Pop art]].

====Pop art====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
{{main|Pop art}}
Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Alloway| first = Lawrence| title = Topics in American art: since 1945| year = 1975| publisher = W. W. Norton| isbn = 978-0-393-04401-0| pages = 119–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] were considered seminal examples in the movement.

[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s set the table for pop art in America. In New York City during the mid-1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works and the work of [[Larry Rivers]], were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion and the combining of mundane materials into their work. The innovations of Johns' specific use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the American flag; Rivers paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]], and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]] gave rise to a radical new movement in [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as pop art.

American pop art is exemplified by artists: [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein's most important work is arguably ''[[Whaam!]]'' (1963, [[Tate Modern]], London&lt;ref name="Tate_Whaam"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicts a fighter aircraft firing a rocket into an enemy plane, with a red-and-yellow explosion. The cartoon style is heightened by the use of the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] lettering ''"[[Whaam!]]"'' and the boxed caption ''"I pressed the fire control... and ahead of me rockets blazed through the sky..."''&lt;ref name=Tate_Whaam/&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'' the first major pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. [[Sidney Janis]] mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery at 15 E. 57th Street. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in the fall of 1962 an historically important and ground-breaking ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' exhibition of pop art, curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] sent shock waves across the Western United States.

While in the downtown scene in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of [[Pop Art]]. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront and made painted objects, and the [[Green Gallery]] on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. Later [[Leo Castelli]] exhibited other American artists including the bulk of the careers of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and his use of Benday dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and pop artists like [[Alex Katz]] (who became known for his parodies of portrait photography and suburban life), Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.

While throughout the 20th century many painters continued to practice landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, like [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[David Hockney]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Vija Celmins]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

During the 1930s through the 1960s abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction, allowing figurative imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery; practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[still-life]] painter [[Giorgio Morandi]], [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], [[Elaine de Kooning]] and others. Along with [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]], and other 20th-century masters. In particular Milton Avery through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Mark Rothko]] as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA1139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=miltonavery NY Times, Grace Glueck, Art in Review; ''Milton Avery &amp;ndash; Onrushing Waves'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.com/2002/05/the-summer-of-57-with-milton-avery-gottlieb-rothko/ Hilton Kramer, NY Observer, ''Summer of 57 with Avery, Gottlieb, Rothko'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Head VI]]'', 1949 is a painting by the Irish born artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and is an example of Post World War II European [[Expressionism]]. The work shows a distorted version of the [[Portrait of Innocent X]] painted by the Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Schmied| first = Wieland| title = Francis Bacon: commitment and conflict| year = 1996| publisher = Prestel Pub| isbn = 3-7913-1664-8| page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely "wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false [[Fauvism|fauve]] manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Peppiatt| first = Michael| title = เรื่องเก่าเล่าใหม่: รวมข้อคิดจากพงศาวดารและตํานานเก่า| year = 1998| publisher = Westview Press| isbn = 978-0-8133-3520-9| page = 147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied (1996), p20&lt;/ref&gt; The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt (1996), p148&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:'Still Life with Cup', oil on canvas painting by Paul Wonner, 1959, private collection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Wonner]], 1959, [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]]] 
Italian painter [[Giorgio Morandi]] was an important 20th-century early pioneer of Minimalism. Born in [[Bologna, Italy]] in 1890, throughout his career, Morandi concentrated almost exclusively on still lives and landscapes, except for a few self-portraits. With great sensitivity to tone, color, and compositional balance, he would depict the same familiar bottles and vases again and again in paintings notable for their simplicity of execution. Morandi executed 133 etchings, a significant body of work in its own right, and his drawings and watercolors often approach abstraction in their economy of means. Through his simple and repetitive motifs and economical use of color, value and surface, Morandi became a prescient and important forerunner of [[Minimalism]]. He died in Bologna in 1964.

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicholas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]] (who was always a figurative artist), and [[Nicolas de Staël|de Staël]], abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël 's work was quickly recognised within the post-war art world, and he became one of the most influential artists of the 1950s. His return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël 's late work – in particular his thinned, and diluted oil on canvas abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. [[Nicolas de Staël]]'s bold and intensely vivid color in his last paintings predict the direction of much of contemporary painting that came after him including Pop art of the 1960s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[post-painterly abstraction]], [[op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of [[Abstract expressionism]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[outsider art|art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L'Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949] (in English: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[fluxus]], [[neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I, (Landscape No. 1),'' 1963, Oil on canvas, 60 1/4 x 50 1/2 inches, collection: [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]) and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The Bay Area Figurative Movement of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1'', 1963 is a typical example were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Although throughout the 20th century painters continued to practice [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and use imagery, practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[Milton Avery]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], and others. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[John Baeder]] and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists, many of them affiliated with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of writers, including [[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], and [[James Schuyler]]. Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on [[Great Spruce Head Island, Maine]].

Also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the "death of painting". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Installation art]] [[Mail art]], the [[situationists]], [[Conceptual art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]] and [[body art]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''The End of Painting'', October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''On the Museum's Ruins'', Cambridge, Mass., 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada is also a movement that started 1n the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. Featuring the emergence of combined manufactured items, with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others were important pioneers of both abstraction and Pop Art; creating new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Color Field painting]] clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Color Field painting is related to [[post-painterly abstraction]], [[suprematism]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]].

During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Color Field]] painting, his work can serve as a bridge between [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, and [[minimal art]]. Two influential teachers [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. [[Josef Albers]] is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both [[hard-edge painting]] and Op art.

[[Josef Albers]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Terry |last=Fenton |title=Online essay about Kenneth Noland, and acrylic paint |url=http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials |accessdate=30 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Al Held]] and some others like [[Mino Argento]],&lt;ref&gt;Noel, Frackman "Mino Argento create. These canvases in which geometric forms, squares, arcs, and lines", Arts Magazine p.19 December 1979&lt;/ref&gt; are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well.

In 1965, an exhibition called ''[[The Responsive Eye]]'', curated by William C. Seitz, was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in New York City. The works shown were wide ranging, encompassing the [[Minimalism]] of [[Frank Stella]], the Op art of Larry Poons, the work of [[Alexander Liberman]], alongside the masters of the Op Art movement: [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], Bridget Riley and others. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. Op art, also known as optical art, is a style present in some paintings and other works of art that use [[optical illusion]]s. Op art is also closely akin to [[geometric abstraction]] and [[hard-edge painting]]. Although sometimes the term used for it is perceptual abstraction.

Op art is a method of painting concerning the interaction between illusion and picture plane, between understanding and seeing.&lt;ref&gt;John Lancaster. ''Introducing Op Art'', London: BT Batsford Ltd, 1973, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Op art works are abstract, with many of the better known pieces made in only black and white. When the viewer looks at them, the impression is given of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibration, patterns, or alternatively, of swelling or warping.

Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.

[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, [[minimalism|minimalists]], and [[Hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly [[abstract art|abstract]], formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Color Field]] painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against [[abstract expressionism]]s' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Another related movement of the late 1960s, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp.104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Conn. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lyrical Abstraction]] in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[fluxus]] movement and [[postminimalism]] (a term first coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] in the pages of ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1969)&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. [[Postminimalism]] often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"/&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[conceptual art]], [[postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], video, [[performance art]], [[installation art]], along with the continuation of fluxus, [[abstract expressionism]], [[Color Field]] painting, [[hard-edge painting]], [[minimal art]], [[op art]], [[pop art]], [[photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[contemporary art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. "The New Art: It's Way, Way Out", ''Newsweek'' 29 July 1968: pp.3,55–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.

Lyrical Abstraction shares similarities with color field painting and abstract expressionism, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] as exemplified by the 1968 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''For William Blake'', (above) especially in the freewheeling usage of paint – texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color field painting. However, the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from [[abstract expressionism]] and [[action painting]] of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in Lyrical Abstraction there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.,&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hard-edge painting, minimalism, postminimalism, monochrome painting====
&lt;gallery widths="140px" heights="140px" perrow="4"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], David Novros, Paul Mogenson, [[Charles Hinman]] are examples of artists associated with [[Minimalism]] and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and [[hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Minimalism]] and [[shaped canvas]] painting in New York City during the 1960s.

During the 1960s and 1970s artists such as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], Agnes Martin, [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like Brice Marden, [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web |title=Colorscope: Abstract Painting 1960–1979 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hoyland]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and dozens of others produced a wide variety of paintings.

During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against abstract painting. Some critics viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the 'death of painting'. Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[video art]], [[installation art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]], [[body art]], [[fluxus]], [[happening]], [[mail art]], the [[situationists]] and [[conceptual art]] among others.

However still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[monochrome painting]] and [[hard-edge painting]] inspired by Ad Reinhardt, [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]]. Artists as diverse as Agnes Martin, Al Held, [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, [[minimal art]], hard-edge painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in [[abstract expressionism]], [[neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and postminimal painting.

====Neo Expressionism====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;

In the late 1960s the [[abstract expressionist]] painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery. His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' 1973, seen above in the gallery is an example of Guston's final and conclusive return to representation.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 |title=Tate online glossary }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 1980s the [[Stuckists]] respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination. All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]]. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries. This type of art continues in popularity into the 21st century, even after the art crash of the late 1980s. [[Anselm Kiefer]] is a leading figure in European [[Neo-expressionism]] by the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and collective memory, but also [[occult]] [[symbol]]ism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]]. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.

During the late 1970s in the United States painters who began working with invigorated surfaces and who returned to imagery like [[Susan Rothenberg]] gained in popularity, especially as seen above in paintings like ''Horse 2'', 1979. During the 1980s American artists like [[Eric Fischl]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] (who began as a [[graffiti artist]]), [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], and Italian painters like [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], among others defined the idea of [[Neo-expressionism]] in America.

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colours and banal colour harmonies. The veteran painters [[Philip Guston]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with slightly younger artists like [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Keith Haring]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting.

Painting still holds a respected position in [[contemporary art]]. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.

At the beginning of the 21st century Contemporary painting and Contemporary art in general continues in several contiguous modes, characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. The "crisis" in painting and current art and current [[art criticism]] today is brought about by [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an ''anything goes'' attitude that prevails; an "everything going on", and consequently "nothing going on" syndrome; this creates an aesthetic traffic jam with no firm and clear direction and with every lane on the artistic [[superhighway]] filled to capacity. Consequently magnificent and important works of art continue to be made albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit.

During the period before and after European exploration and settlement of the Americas, including North America, Central America, South America and the Islands of the Caribbean, the [[Antilles]], the [[Lesser Antilles]] and other island groups, indigenous native cultures produced creative works including architecture, [[pottery]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[weaving]], [[Wikt:carving|carving]], sculpture, painting and [[murals]] as well as other religious and utilitarian objects. Each continent of the Americas hosted societies that were unique and individually developed cultures; that produced totems, works of religious symbolism, and decorative and expressive painted works. African influence was especially strong in the art of the Caribbean and South America. The arts of the indigenous people of the Americas had an enormous impact and influence on [[European art]] and vice versa during and after the [[Age of Exploration]]. Spain, Portugal, France, The Netherlands, and England were all powerful and influential [[colonial power]]s in the Americas during and after the 15th century. By the 19th century cultural influence began to flow both ways across the Atlantic

The depiction of humans, animals or any other figurative subjects is forbidden within Islam to prevent believers from [[idolatry]] so there is no religiously motivated painting (or sculpture) tradition within Muslim culture. Pictorial activity was reduced to [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]], mainly [[Abstract art|abstract]], with [[geometrical]] configuration or floral and plant-like patterns. Strongly connected to architecture and [[calligraphy]], it can be widely seen as used for the painting of [[tile]]s in mosques or in illuminations around the text of the Koran and other books. In fact, abstract art is not an invention of modern art but it is present in [[pre-classical]], [[barbarian]] and non-western cultures many centuries before it and is essentially a decorative or [[applied art]]. Notable illustrator [[M. C. Escher]] was influenced by this geometrical and pattern-based art. [[Art Nouveau]] ([[Aubrey Beardsley]] and the architect [[Antonio Gaudí]]) re-introduced abstract floral patterns into western art.

Note that despite the taboo of figurative visualization, some Muslim countries did cultivate a rich tradition in painting, though not in its own right, but as a companion to the written word. Iranian or Persian art, widely known as Persian miniature, concentrates on the illustration of epic or romantic works of literature. Persian illustrators deliberately avoided the use of shading and perspective, though familiar with it in their pre-Islamic history, in order to abide by the rule of not creating any lifelike illusion of the real world. Their aim was not to depict the world as it is, but to create images of an ideal world of timeless beauty and perfect order.

In present days, painting by art students or professional artists in Arab and non-Arab Muslim countries follows the same tendencies of Western culture art.

===Iran===
{{main|Persian painting|Persian calligraphy|List of Persian painters|Iranian art}}
Oriental historian Basil Gray believes "Iran has offered a particularly unique {{sic}} art to the world which is excellent in its kind". Caves in Iran's Lorestan province exhibit painted imagery of animals and hunting scenes. Some such as those in Fars Province and Sialk are at least 5,000 years old. Painting in Iran is thought to have reached a climax during the Tamerlane era, when outstanding masters such as Kamaleddin Behzad gave birth to a new style of painting.

Paintings of the Qajar period are a combination of European influences and Safavid miniature schools of painting such as those introduced by [[Reza Abbasi]] and classical works by [[Mihr 'Ali]]. Masters such as [[Kamal-ol-molk]] further pushed forward the European influence in Iran. It was during the Qajar era when "Coffee House painting" emerged. Subjects of this style were often religious in nature depicting scenes from Shia epics and the like.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

African traditional culture and tribes do not seem to have great interest in two-dimensional representations in favour of sculpture and [[relief]]. However, decorative painting in African culture is often abstract and geometrical. Another pictorial manifestation is [[body painting]], and [[face painting]] present for example in [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Kĩkũyũ]] culture in their ceremony rituals. Ceremonial [[cave painting]] in certain villages can be found to be still in use. Note that [[Pablo Picasso]] and other modern artists were influenced by [[African sculpture]] and [[masks]] in their varied styles.
Contemporary African artists follow western art movements and their paintings have little difference from occidental art works.

The [[Kingdom of Kush]] in ancient [[Nubia]] (i.e. modern [[Sudan]]), bordering [[Ancient Egypt]], produced a wide variety of arts, including wall paintings and painted objects. At the Sudanese site of [[Kerma]], center of the [[Kerma culture]] that predated the [[History of Sudan|Kingdom of Kush]], a circa 1700 BC fragmentary painting from a royal tomb depicts a [[sailing ship]] and houses with ladders that are similar to scenes in reliefs from the reign of [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Egyptian queen]] [[Hatshepsut]] (c. 1479-1458 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Hatke, George (2013).

===Influence on Western art===
{{see also|Picasso's African Period|Contemporary African art}}
At the start of the 20th century, artists like [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] became aware of, and were inspired by, [[African art]].&lt;ref name="African Influences in Modern Art"&gt;Murrell, Denise.

Retrieved on 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In a situation where the established [[avant garde]] was straining against the constraints imposed by serving the world of appearances, African Art demonstrated the power of supremely well organised forms; produced not only by responding to the faculty of sight, but also and often primarily, the faculty of imagination, emotion and mystical and religious experience. These artists saw in African art a [[Formalism (art)|formal]] perfection and sophistication unified with phenomenal expressive power.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, ''Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon and the Theater of the Absurd''. 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J.

The Hubble constant, named for [[astronomer]] [[Edwin Hubble]], whose work made clear the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]], measures the rate at which expansion occurs. In accordance with the [[Copernican principle]] that the Earth is not in a central, specially favored position, one would expect that measuring this constant at any point in the universe would yield the same value. If, on the other hand, Earth were at or near the center of a very low-density region of [[interstellar space]] (a relative void), denser material in a shell around it would strongly&lt;!--is "strongly" necessary?--&gt; attract material away from the centerpoint. Thus, stars inside such a "Hubble bubble" would accelerate away from Earth much&lt;!--much?--&gt; faster than the general expansion of the universe.&lt;ref name = astronweb/&gt;&lt;ref name= moss/&gt; This situation would provide an alternative to [[dark energy]] in explaining the apparent [[accelerating universe]].&lt;ref name=moss/&gt;

==Hubble bubble proposed==
In 1998, Zehavi et al. reported evidence in support of a Hubble bubble.&lt;ref name=zehavi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zehavi|first=Idit|author2=Adam G Riess |author3=Robert P Kirshner |author4=Avishai Dekel |title=A Local Hubble Bubble from Type IA Supernovae?|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=1998|volume=503|issue=2|page=483|doi=10.1086/306015|bibcode=1998ApJ...503..483Z|arxiv = astro-ph/9802252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial suggestion that local [[redshift]] velocities differ from those seen elsewhere in the universe was based on observations of [[Type 1a supernova]]e, often abbreviated "SNe Ia." Such stars have been used as [[standard candle]] distance markers for 20 years, and were key to the first observations of [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name=overbye&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=From the Clash of White Dwarfs, the Birth of a Supernova|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/science/space/23star.html?_r=1|accessdate=6 February 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zehavi ''et al.'' studied the peculiar velocites of 44 SNe Ia to test for a local void, and reported that Earth seemed to be inside a relative void of roughly 20% underdensity, surrounded by a dense shell, a "bubble".&lt;ref name=zehavi/&gt;

==Testing the hypothesis==

In 2007, Conley et al. examined the SNe Ia color data comparisons while taking into account the effect of cosmic dust in external galaxies. They concluded that the data did not support the existence of a local Hubble bubble.&lt;ref name=conley/&gt;

In 2010, Moss et al. analyzed the Hubble Bubble model although without using that name,&lt;ref name=astronweb/&gt; saying "The suggestion that we occupy a privileged position near the center of a large, nonlinear, and nearly spherical void has recently attracted much attention as an alternative to dark energy."&lt;ref name=moss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moss|first=Adam|author2=James P Zibin |author3=Douglas Scott |title=Precision Cosmology Defeats Void Models for Acceleration|date=July 21, 2010|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.83.103515|journal=Physical Review D|volume=83|issue=10 |pages=103515|arxiv=1007.3725|bibcode = 2011PhRvD..83j3515M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Looking not only at supernova data but also at the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic microwave background spectrum]], [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and other factors, they concluded that "voids are in severe tension with the data. In particular, void models predict a very low local Hubble rate, suffer from an "old age problem", and predict much less local structure than is observed."&lt;ref name = moss/&gt;

'''IDA Indoor''' '''Climate and''' '''Energy''' (IDA ICE) is a [[Building performance simulation]] (BPS) software. IDA ICE is a simulation application for the multi-zonal and dynamic study of indoor climate phenomenas as well as energy use. The implemented models are [[state of the art]], many studies show that simulation results and measured data compare well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cornaro|first=Cristina|last2=Puggioni|first2=Valerio Adoo|last3=Strollo|first3=Rodolfo Maria|title=Dynamic simulation and on-site measurements for energy retrofit of complex historic buildings: Villa Mondragone case study|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2016.02.001|journal=Journal of Building Engineering|volume=6|pages=17–28|doi=10.1016/j.jobe.2016.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=Jørgen Erik|last2=Chasapis|first2=Kleanthis|last3=Gazovic|first3=Libor|last4=Kolarik|first4=Jakub|title=Indoor Environment and Energy Consumption Optimization Using Field Measurements and Building Energy Simulation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1876610215020135|journal=Energy Procedia|volume=78|pages=2118–2123|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2015.11.281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nageler|first=P.|last2=Schweiger|first2=G.|last3=Pichler|first3=M.|last4=Brandl|first4=D.|last5=Mach|first5=T.|last6=Heimrath|first6=R.|last7=Schranzhofer|first7=H.|last8=Hochenauer|first8=C.|title=Validation of dynamic building energy simulation tools based on a real test-box with thermally activated building systems (TABS)|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.03.025|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=168|pages=42–55|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.03.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== User interface ==
The user interface of IDA ICE makes it easy to create simple cases but also offers the flexibility to go into detail of advanced studies. Many inputs are adaptable to local requirements such as climate data, material data, system components or result reports. IDA ICE provides a [[3D modeling|3D]] environment for geometry modeling, the table-based input of boundary conditions provide good visual feedback and enables efficient quality check. A simple procedure for calculating and reporting cooling, heating, air demand, and energy, together with a built-in version handling system, makes it efficient to compare different systems and results. 

Advanced daylight calculation are achieved by interfacing the [[Radiance (software)|Radiance]] lighting simulation tool with result visualization in the 3D environment. A module for Appendix G of [[ASHRAE 90.1]]-2010 is available, this is used for example in [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] and [[BREEAM]]. The integrated [[Radiosity (computer graphics)|radiosity method]] with single reflexion and one measuring point can be used for whole-year daylight analysis and allows modeling daylight-based control strategies (e.g. shading devices, artificial lightening).

There is also the "Early Stage Building Optimization" (ESBO)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.equa.se/en/esbo|title=ESBO user interface|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=EQUA Simulation AB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; user interface which makes it possible for users to experiment with variations in both buildings and systems at an early stage with a minimum of user input. A full range of component models for [[renewable energy]] studies is available, with boreholes, stratified tanks, heat pumps, solar collectors, [[Cogeneration|CHP]], [[Photovoltaics|PV]], [[Wind turbine|wind turbines]], etc.

An interface with [[OpenFOAM]] for detailed [[CFD in buildings|CFD]] studies is in development.

== Strengths ==
IDA ICE can be used for complete energy and design studies, involving the envelope, systems, plant and control strategies. The equation-based approach enables solving more complex mathematical problems than software using [[Imperative programming|imperative programming languages]]. The IDA ICE model library is [[Open-source software|open source]], the model equations can be viewed and adapted, every variable in the whole system can be logged. The flexible architecture of the software makes it easy to develop the software continuously to adapt it to local requirements and languages, and to expand it with new capabilities. Additional features like parametric simulation runs and [[Visual programming language|visual scripting]] support decision making in a [[parametric design]] process. The coupling with optimization engines like [https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO/ GenOpt]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO/|title=GenOpt project website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is available directly in the program.

The big advantage compared to other BPS software is the coupled simulation of building envelope, systems and controls. IDA ICE library components are either written in the [[Neutral Model Format]] (NMF) or [[Modelica]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahlin, P. and Sowell, E.F. (1989). A neutral format for building simulation models, Proceedings of the Second International IBPSA Conference, Vancouver, BC, Canada, pp. 147-154, http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS1989/BS89_147_154.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The software is fully scriptable with [[Common Lisp|Common LISP]]. The IDA general purpose solver comes with a variable timestep, which guarantees that no event in the system will be missed.

== Input ==
IDA ICE supports [[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]] [[Building information modeling|BIM]] models generated by tools such as [[ArchiCAD]], [[Revit]], MagiCAD, and others. Geometry an shading on site can also be imported from [[SketchUp]], [[Rhinoceros 3D|Rhino]] or other geometry tools. Solar influx is evaluated through windows (also internal) with full 3D accounting for the local shading situation. Additionally it has an integrated geometry editor where building and zone geometry can be modeled with 2D architectural drawings or pictures serving as template.

'''ITU-R 468''' (originally defined in [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] recommendation 468-4; sometimes referred to as '''CCIR-1k''') is a standard relating to [[noise measurement]], widely used when measuring noise in audio systems.  The standard,&lt;ref name="itu"&gt;{{cite web|title=RECOMMENDATION ITU-R BS.468-4 - Measurement of audio-frequency noise voltage|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.468-4-198607-I!!PDF-E.pdf|website=www.itu.int|publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]]|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; now referred to as ITU-R BS.468-4, defines a [[weighting filter]] curve, together with a [[quasi-peak]] [[rectifier]] having special characteristics as defined by specified [[tone-burst]] tests.  It is currently maintained by the [[International Telecommunications Union]] who took it over from the CCIR.

It is used especially in the UK, Europe, and former countries of the [[British Empire]] such as Australia and South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It is less well known in the USA where [[A-weighting]] has always been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.95|title=1910.95 - Occupational noise exposure. {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''M-weighting''' is a closely related filter, an offset version of the same curve, without the quasi-peak detector.  See [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting#Present usage of 468-weighting|Present usage of 468-weighting]].

== Explanation ==
While most audio engineers are familiar with the [[A-weighting]] curve, which was based on the 40 phon [[equal-loudness contour]] derived initially by [[Fletcher-Munson curves|Fletcher and Munson]] (1933) the later CCIR-468 weighting curve, now supported as an [[ITU]] standard is less well known outside of the UK and Europe. Originally incorporated into an ANSI standard for [[sound level meters]], A-weighting was intended for measurement of the audibility of sounds by themselves. It was never specifically intended for the measurement of the more random (near-[[White noise|white]] or [[Pink noise|pink]]) noise in electronic equipment, though has been used for this purpose by most microphone manufacturers since the 1970s. The human ear responds quite differently to clicks and bursts of random noise, and it is this difference that gave rise to the 468-weighting, which together with quasi-peak measurement (rather than the rms measurement used with A-weighting) became widely used by broadcasters throughout Britain, Europe, and former [[British Commonwealth]] countries, where engineers were heavily influenced by [[BBC]] test methods. Telephone companies worldwide have also used methods similar to 468 weighting with quasi-peak measurement to describe objectionable interference induced in one telephone circuit by switching transients in another.

== History ==
=== Original research ===
Developments in the 1960s, in particular the spread of [[FM broadcasting|FM]] broadcasting and the development of the [[Compact Cassette|compact audio cassette]] with [[Dolby-B Noise Reduction]], alerted engineers to the need for a weighting curve that gave subjectively meaningful results on the typical random noise that limited the performance of broadcast circuits, equipment and radio circuits. A-weighting was not giving consistent results, especially on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio transmissions and Compact Cassette recording where [[preemphasis]] of high frequencies was resulting in increased noise readings that did not correlate with subjective effect. Early efforts to produce a better weighting curve led to a DIN standard that was adopted for European Hi-Fi equipment measurement for a while.

Experiments in the [[BBC]] led to [[BBC Research Department]] Report EL-17, ''The Assessment of Noise in Audio Frequency Circuits'',&lt;ref&gt;BBC Research Department Report - The assessment of noise in audio-frequency circuits. http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1968-08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in which experiments on numerous test subjects were reported, using a variety of noises ranging from clicks to tone-bursts to [[pink noise]]. Subjects were asked to compare these with a 1&amp;nbsp;kHz tone, and final scores were then compared with measured noise levels using various combinations of weighting filter and quasi-peak detector then in existence (such as those defined in a now discontinued German [[DIN]] standard). This led to the CCIR-468 standard which defined a new weighting curve and quasi-peak rectifier.

The origin of the current ITU-R 468 weighting curve can be traced to 1956.  The 1968 BBC EL-17 report discusses several weighting curves, including one identified as ''D.P.B.'' which was chosen as superior to the alternatives: A.S.A, C.C.I.F and O.I.R.T.  The report's graph of the DPB curve is identical to that of the ITU-R 486 curve, except that the latter extends to slightly lower and higher frequencies.  The BBC report states that this curve was given in a "contribution by the D.B.P. (The Telephone Administration of the Federal German Republic) in the Red Book Vol. 1 1957 covering the first plenary assembly of the CCITT (Geneva 1956)". D.B.P. is [[Deutsche Bundespost]], the German post office which provides telephone service in Germany as the GPO does in the UK.  The BBC report states "this characteristic is based on subjective tests described by Belger." and cites a 1953 paper by E. Belger.    

Dolby Laboratories took up the new CCIR-468 weighting for use in measuring noise on their noise reduction systems, both in cinema (Dolby A) and on cassette decks (Dolby B), where other methods of measurement were failing to show up the advantage of such noise reduction. Some Hi-Fi column writers took up 468 weighting enthusiastically, observing that it reflected the roughly 10dB improvement in noise observed subjectively on cassette recordings when using Dolby B while other methods could indicate an actual worsening in some circumstances, because they did not sufficiently attenuate noise above 10&amp;nbsp;kHz.

=== Standards ===
[[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] Recommendation 468-1 was published soon after this report, and appears to have been based on the BBC work. Later versions up to CCIR468-4 differed only in minor changes to permitted tolerances. This standard was then incorporated into many other national and international standards (IEC, BSI, JIS, ITU) and adopted widely as the standard method for measuring noise, in broadcasting, professional audio, and '[[Hi-Fi]]' specifications throughout the 1970s. When the CCIR ceased to exist, the standard was officially taken over by the [[ITU-R]] ([[International Telecommunication Union]]). Current work on this standard occurs primarily in the maintenance of IEC 60268, the international standard for sound systems.

The CCIR curve differs greatly from A-weighting in the 5 to 8&amp;nbsp;kHz region where it peaks to +12.2 dB at 6.3&amp;nbsp;kHz, the region in which we appear to be extremely sensitive to noise. While it has been said (incorrectly) that the difference is due to a requirement for assessing noise intrusiveness in the presence of programme material, rather than just loudness, the BBC report makes clear the fact that this was not the basis of the experiments. The real reason for the difference probably relates to the way in which our ears analyse sounds in terms of spectral content along the [[cochlea]]. This behaves like a [[filter bank|set of closely spaced filters]] with a roughly constant [[Q factor]], that is, bandwidths proportional to their centre frequencies. High frequency [[hair cell]]s would therefore be sensitive to a greater proportion of the total energy in noise than low frequency hair cells. Though hair-cell responses are not exactly constant Q, and matters are further complicated by the way in which the brain integrates adjacent hair-cell outputs, the resultant effect appears roughly as a tilt centred on 1&amp;nbsp;kHz imposed on the A-weighting.

Dependent on spectral content, 468-weighted measurements of noise are generally about 11 dB higher than A-weighted, and this is probably a factor in the recent trend away from 468-weighting in equipment specifications as cassette tape use declines. 

It is important to realise that the 468 specification covers both weighted and 'unweighted' (using a 22&amp;nbsp;Hz to 22&amp;nbsp;kHz 18 dB/octave bandpass filter) measurement and that both use a very special quasi-peak rectifier with carefully devised dynamics (A-weighting uses [[root mean square|RMS]] detection for no particular reason{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}). Rather than having a simple 'integration time' this detector requires implementation with two cascaded 'peak followers' each with different attack time-constants carefully chosen to control the response to both single and repeating tone-bursts of various durations. This ensures that measurements on [[impulse noise (audio)|impulsive noise]] take proper account of our reduced hearing sensitivity to short bursts. This [[quasi-peak]] measurement is also called [[psophometric weighting]].

This was once more important because outside broadcasts were carried over 'music circuits' that used telephone lines, with clicks from [[Strowger switch|Strowger]] and other electromechanical telephone exchanges. It now finds fresh relevance in the measurement of noise on computer 'Audio Cards' which commonly suffer clicks as drives start and stop.

== Present usage of 468-weighting ==
468-weighting is also used in weighted distortion measurement at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. Weighting the distortion residue after removal of the fundamental emphasises high-order harmonics, but only up to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz or so where the ears response falls off. This results in a single measurement (sometimes called [[distortion residue]] measurement) which has been claimed to correspond well with subjective effect even for power amplifiers where [[crossover distortion]] is known to be far more audible than normal THD ([[Total harmonic distortion]]) measurements would suggest.

468-weighting is still demanded by the BBC and many other broadcasters,&lt;ref name="Lindos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lindos.co.uk/cgi-bin/FlexiData.cgi?SOURCE=Articles&amp;VIEW=full&amp;id=10 |title=468 - Weighting in Detail |publisher=Lindos |accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; with increasing awareness of its existence and the fact that it is more valid on random noise where pure tones do not exist.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Often both A-weighted and 468-weighted figures are quoted for noise, especially in microphone specifications.

While not intended for this application, the 468 curve has also been used (offset to place the 0 dB point at 2 kHz rather than 1 kHz) as "M weighting" in standards such as ISO 21727&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:21727:ed-2:v1:en|title=ISO 21727:2016(en) Cinematography — Method of measurement of perceived loudness of short duration motion-picture audio material|last=|first=|date=2016|website=ISO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to gauge loudness or annoyance of cinema soundtracks. This application of the weighting curve does not include the quasi-peak detector specified in the ITU standard.

==Summary of specification ==
Note: this is not the full definitive standard.
===Weighting curve specification ( Weighted measurement)===
The weighting curve is specified by both a circuit diagram of a weighting network and a table of amplitude responses.

[[File:Itu-r 468-circuit.png]]

Above is the ITU-R 468 Weighting Filter Circuit Diagram.  The source and sink impedances are both 600 ohms (resistive), as shown in the diagram.  The values are taken directly from the ITU-R 468 specification.  Note that since this circuit is purely passive, it cannot create the additional 12dB gain required; any results must be corrected by a factor of 8.1333, or +18.2dB.

The values of the amplitude response table slightly differ from those resulting from the circuit diagram, e.g. because of the finite resolution of the numerical values. In the standard it is said that the 33.06&amp;nbsp;nF capacitor may be adjusted or an active filter may be used.

Modeling at hand the circuit above and some calculus give this formula to get the amplitude response in dB for any given frequency value :


:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{ITU}(f) = \frac{1.246332637532143\cdot10^{-4} \, f}{\sqrt{(h_1(f))^2 + (h_2(f))^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ITU}(f) = 18.2+20\log_{10}\left(R_\mathrm{ITU}(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;h_1(f)=-4.737338981378384\cdot10^{-24} \, f^6 + 2.043828333606125\cdot10^{-15} \, f^4 - 1.363894795463638\cdot10^{-7} \, f^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h_2(f)=1.306612257412824\cdot10^{-19} \, f^5  - 2.118150887518656\cdot10^{-11} \, f^3 + 5.559488023498642\cdot10^{-4} \, f&lt;/math&gt;

The intent is to illustrate the hierarchical structure and relationship of events, accomplishments, criteria, and tasks.]]

In the [[United States Department of Defense]], the '''Integrated Master Plan''' ('''IMP)''' and the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) are important [[program management]] tools that provide significant assistance in the planning and scheduling of work efforts in large and complex materiel acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''AFMC Pamphlet 63-5, Integrated Master Plan and Schedule Guide'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/USAF/USAF-AFMC/download.php?spec=AFMC_PAM_63-5.004210.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Air Force]] | date=11 Nov 2004 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMP is an event-driven plan  that documents the significant accomplishments necessary to complete the work and ties each accomplishment to a key program event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Integrated Master Plan (IMP) / Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)'' | url=https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=24654  | publisher=[[Defense Acquisition University]] | accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMP is expanded to a time-based IMS to produce a networked and multi-layered schedule showing all detailed tasks required to accomplish the work effort contained in the IMP. The IMS flows directly from the IMP and supplements it with additional levels of detail——both then form the foundations to implement an [[Earned Value Management| Earned Value Management System]].

* The IMP is a bilateral agreement between the Government and a contractor on what defines the “event-driven” program. The IMP documents the key events, accomplishments, and the evaluation "criteria" in the development, production and/or modification of a military system; moreover, the IMS provides sequential events and key decision points (generally meetings) to assess program progress. Usually the IMP is a contractual document.
* Supporting the IMP is the IMS that is made up of "tasks" depicting the work effort needed to complete the "criteria".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Scheduling Guide for Program Managers'' | url=http://www.dau.mil/publications/publicationsDocs/schedulinguide.pdf | format=PDF | publisher= Defense Systems Management College Press, Fort Belvoir, VA | date=October 2001 |accessdate=19 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a detailed time-driven plan for program execution that helps to ensure on-time delivery dates are achieved, and that tracking and status tool are used during program execution. These tools must show progress, interrelationships and dependencies.

In civic planning or [[urban planning]], ''Integrated Master Plan'' is used at the levels of city &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''City of Riverside, Wastewater Integrated Master Plan'' | url=http://www.riversideca.gov/pworks/masterplan-wastewater.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Integrated Master Plan for Lahore 2021'' | url=http://www.urbanunit.gov.pk/pubpublic/pubcomp/70.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; county,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Santa Clara County Parks, Draft Integrated Master Plan'' | url=http://sccgov.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=4&amp;ID=101252}}&lt;/ref&gt; and state or province to refer to a document integrating diverse aspects of a [[public works]] project.

== Purpose and Objectives  ==
The primary purpose of the IMP—and the supporting detailed schedules of the IMS—is their use by the U.S. Government and Contractor acquisition team as the day-to-day tools for the planning, executing, and tracking program technical, schedule, and cost status, including risk mitigation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Integrated Master Plan and Integrated Master Schedule Preparation and Use Guide'' | url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/se/docs/IMP_IMS_Guide_v9.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |work=Ver. 0.9 |date=31 Oct 2005 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMP provides a better structure than either the [[Work breakdown structure|Work Breakdown Structure]] (WBS) or [[Organizational chart|Organizational Breakdown Structure]] (OBS) for measuring actual integrated master schedule (IMS) progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bachman, David C.| title=''Better Schedule Performance Assessments Derived From Integrated Master Plan-Referenced Schedule Metrics'' | url=http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/PubsCats/AR%20Journal/arj60/Bachman_ARJ60.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=[[Defense Acquisition University]] |date=October 2011 |work=Defense Acquisition Research Journal (ARJ) |pages=406–427 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objective of the IMP is a single plan that establishes the program or project fundamentals. It provides a hierarchical, event-based plan that contains: Events; Significant accomplishments; Entry and exit criteria; however it does not include any dates or  durations. Using the IMP provides sufficient definition for explain program process and completion tracking, as well as providing effective communication of the program/project content and the "''What and How''" of the program.

== Rationale ==
The IMP is a collection of [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] (called  "events") that form the process architecture of the program. This means the sequence of events must always result in a deliverable product or service. While delivering products or services is relatively straight forward in some instances (i.e.,  list the tasks to be done, arrange them in the proper sequence, and execute to this “plan”), in other cases, problems often arise: (i) the description of "complete" is often missing for intermediate activities; (ii) program partners, integration activities, and subcontractors all have unknown or possibly unknowable impacts on the program; and (iii) as products or services are delivered the maturity of the program changes (e.g., quality and functionality expectations, as well as other attributes)——this maturity provided by defining "complete"
serves as an insurance policy against future problems encountered later in the program.

Often, it's easier to define the IMP by stating what it is not. The IMP is NOT BASED on calendar dates, and therefore it is not
schedule oriented; each event is completed when its supporting accomplishments are completed, and this completion is evidenced by the satisfaction of the criteria supporting each of the accomplishments. Furthermore, many of the IMP events are fixed by customer-defined milestones
(e.g., Preliminary or Critical Design Review, Production Deliver, etc.) while intermediate events are defined by the Supplier (e.g., integration and test, software build releases, Test Readiness Review, etc.).

The critical IMP attribute is its focus on events, when compared to effort or task focused planning.
The event focus asks and answers the question ''what does done look like?'' rather than what work has been done. Certainly work must be done to complete a task, but a focus solely on the work hides the more important metric of ''are we meeting our commitments?'' While meeting commitments is critical, it's important to first define the criteria used for judging if the commitments are being met. This is where Significant Accomplishments (SA) and their Accomplishment Criteria (AC) become important. It is important to meet commitments, but recognizing when the commitment has been met is even more important.

== Attributes and Characteristics ==

The IMP  provides Program Traceability by expanding and complying with the program's Statement of Objectives (SOO), Technical Performance Requirements (TPRs), the Contract [[Work Breakdown Structure]] (CWBS), and the Contract [[Statement of work|Statement of Work]] (CSOW)—all of which are based on the Customer's WBS to form the basis of the IMS and all cost reporting. The IMP implements a measurable and trackable program structure to accomplish integrated product development, integrate the functional program activities, and incorporates functional, lower-level and subcontractor  IMPs. The IMP provides a framework for independent evaluation of Program Maturity by allowing insight into the overall effort with a level-of-detail that is consistent with levied risk and complexity metrics. It uses the methodology of decomposing events into a logical series of accomplishments having measurable criteria to demonstrate the completion and/or quality of accomplishments.

== Requirements Flowdown ==

A Government customer tasks a Supplier to prepare and implement an IMP that linked with the IMS and integrated with the EVMS. The IMP list the contract requirements documents (e.g., Systems Requirements Document and Technical Requirements Document (i.e., the system specification or similar document)) as well as the IMP events  corresponding to development and/or production activities required by the contract. The IMP should include significant accomplishments encompassing all steps necessary to satisfy all contract objectives and requirements, manage all significant risks, and facilitate Government insight for each event. Significant accomplishments shall be networked to show their logical relationships and that they flow logically from one to another. The IMP, IMS, and EVMS products will usually include the prime contractor, subcontractor, and major vendor activities and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''SMC-S-019, Rev. A'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/USAF/USAF-SMC/download.php?spec=SMC-S-019A_11AUG2008.021545.PDF | format=PDF | publisher=[[Space and Missile Systems Center]], Air Force Space Command, El Segundo, CA | date=11 Aug 2008 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation of an IMS ==

When evaluating a proposed IMS, the user should focus on realistic task durations, predecessor/successor relationships, and identification of [[critical path method|critical path]] tasks with viable risk mitigation and contingency plans. An IMS summarized at too high a level may result in obscuring critical execution elements, and contributing to failure of the EVMS to  report progress. A high-level IMS may fail to show related [[risk management]] approaches being used, which can  result in long duration tasks and artificial linkages masking the true critical path. In general, the IMP is a top-down planning tool and the IMS as the bottom-up execution tool. It should be noted, however, the IMS is a scheduling tool for management control of program progression, not for cost collection purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Systems Engineering Guide: Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)/Integrated Master Plan (IMP) Application'' | url=http://www.mitre.org/work/systems_engineering/guide/acquisition_systems_engineering/acquisition_program_planning/integrated_master_schedule_master_plan_application.html | publisher=Mitre Corporation] | date= |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An IMS would seek general consistency and a standardized approach to project planning, scheduling and analysis.  It may use guides such as the PASEG Generally Accepted Schedule Principles (GASP) as guidance to improve execution and enable EVMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| title = Planning &amp; Scheduling Excellence Guide (PASEG), Version 3.0

| publisher = NDIA
| accessdate = 17 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to other Documents ==

The IMP/IMS are related to the product-based ''' [[Work Breakdown Structure]] (WBS)''' as defined in MIL-STD-881, by giving a second type of view on the effort, for different audiences or to provide a combination which gives better overall understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Department of Defense Standard: Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) for Defense Material Items (Superseding MIL-HDBK-881A)'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0800-0899/download.php?spec=MIL-STD-881C.037590.pdf/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=3 Oct 2011 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linkage between the IMP/IMS and WBS is done by referencing the WBS numbering whenever the PE (Program Event), SA (Significant Accomplishment), or AC (Accomplishment Criteria) involves a deliverable product.

== Reporting Formats ==

The IMP is often called out as a contract data deliverable on [[United States Department of Defense]] materiel acquisitions, as well as other U.S. Government procurements. Formats for these deliverables are covered in [[Data Item Descriptions]] (DIDs) that define the data content, format, and data usages. Recently, the DoD  cancelled the DID (DI-MISC-81183A) that jointly addressed both the IMP and the IMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DI-MISC-81183A, Data Item Description: Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-MISC/DI-MISC-81183A_11978/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=9 Feb 1996  |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement  documents include DI-MGMT-81650 (Integrated Master Schedule), DI-MGMT-81334A (Contract Work Breakdown Structure) and DI-MGMT-81466 (Contract Performance Report).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DI-MGMT-81650, Data Item Description: Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-MGMT/DI-MGMT-81650_12009/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=30 Mar 2005  |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DI-MISC-81334D, Data Item Description: Contract Work Breakdown Structure'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-MGMT/download.php?spec=DI-MGMT-81334D.034122.pdf/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=18 May 2011  |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DI-MISC-81466A, Data Item Description: Cost Performance Report (CPR)'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-MGMT/DI-MGMT-81466A_16102/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=30 Mar 2005 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition DFARS 252.242–7001 and 252.242–7002 provide guidance for integrating IMP/IMS with [[Earned Value Management]].

'''Istishab''' ({{lang-ar|استصحاب}} {{lang-en|'''continuity'''|italic=yes}}) is an [[Islamic term]] used in the [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]] to denote the principle of the presumption of continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1138 |title=Istishab - Oxford Islamic Studies Online |website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com |language=en |quote=Islamic legal term for the presumption of continuity, where a situation existing previously is presumed to be continuing at present until the contrary is proven. |access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from an [[Arabic]] word ''suhbah'' meaning accompany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-en/%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B5%25D8%25AD%25D8%25A7%25D8%25A8/ |title= ترجمة و معنى استصحاب في قاموس عربي انجليزي|trans-title = Meaning of Istishab in English Arabic Almaany Dictionary |last=Team |first=Almaany |website=www.almaany.com |language=en |access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the fundamental principles of the [[Ijtihad|legal deduction]] that presumes the continuation of a fact. It is based on [[probability]] and can be applied in the absence of other proofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=wRlI0nJp5mEC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=Istishab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t_ecLTachv&amp;sig=OjAdj3A7UPGaO9xEYoZbe136ggs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC_f734eXXAhWDWBQKHXYoCz84ChDoAQheMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Istishab&amp;f=false |title=Theory and Practice of Modern Islamic Finance: The Case Analysis from Australia |last=Ahmad |first=Abu Umar Faruq |date=2010 |publisher=Universal-Publishers |isbn=9781599425177 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Istishab, an initiative of [[ash-Shafii]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=WZ5WDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT55&amp;lpg=PT55&amp;dq=shafii+employed+istishab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-zl6bHuU4I&amp;sig=A7h3bkME4UOx9COKq8xwvNBn31k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjogpuhg-bXAhVKQBQKHXewD7kQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=shafii%2520employed%2520istishab&amp;f=false |title=Understanding Islamic Theology |last=Sookhdeo |first=Patrick |date=2014-06-30 |publisher=BookBaby |isbn=9780989290548 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the rationalistic principle of extracting a [[Hukm|legal solution]] according to which changes are not considered to occur until clear signs of these changes are apparent. It serves as the basis for many legal rulings such as the presumption of innocence—the person is regarded as innocent unless proven guilty. [[Malik ibn Anas]] and [[ash-Shafii]] regarded it to be a proof until it is contradicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=bKveCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31&amp;lpg=PT31&amp;dq=Presumption+of+existence+before+evidence+is+available+istishab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dJv1PM-kVR&amp;sig=oQCji2_JvXa0FmiDsklBrgrtAeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY58uTh-bXAhXKuRQKHeoxAtsQ6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Presumption%2520of%2520existence%2520before%2520evidence%2520is%2520available%2520istishab&amp;f=false |title=Shari’a Law in Commercial and Banking Arbitration: Law and Practice in Saudi Arabia |last=Baamir |first=Abdulrahman Yahya |date=2016-04-01 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317055624 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several classical jurists differed over this principle with some [[Hanafi]] jurists refusing to regard it as an evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54049210 |title=Mabānī-i istinbāṭ-i ḥuqūq-i Islāmī, yā, Uṣūl-i fiqh |last=al-Ḥasan. |first=Muḥammadī, Abū |date=2002 |publisher=Muʼassasah-ʼi Intishārāt va Chāp-i Dānishgāh-i Tihrān |isbn=9640340766 |edition=Chāp-i 14 |location=Tihrān |oclc=54049210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=kX1yDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=Istishab+abu+hanifa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5BLE8eqMGV&amp;sig=DKwHLoPW9esAFbjQ3PWfHclrRQI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT5YOetubXAhVGSBQKHddgBh4Q6AEITTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Istishab%2520abu%2520hanifa&amp;f=false |title=Foundations of Jurisprudence - An Introduction to Imāmī Shīʿī Legal Theory: Mabādiʾ al-wuṣūl ilā ʿilm al-uṣūl |last=al-Ḥillī |first=al-ʿAllāmah |date=2016-11-10 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004311770 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now widely employed by the contemporaries scholars with the exception of  [[Hanbali]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=tyHaHZcRLWEC&amp;pg=PT156&amp;lpg=PT156&amp;dq=istishab+hanafi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3dqGgUcezs&amp;sig=mCSaE4cD1GKWtI3yPf1Cv5mtQX4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW96KG6eXXAhUKbxQKHUUeD70Q6AEIXDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=istishab%2520hanafi&amp;f=false |title=Shari'ah Law: An Introduction |last=Kamali |first=Mohammad Hashim |date=2008-03-17 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |isbn=9781780740379 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.smahate.com/islamic-classes/2013-winter/al-qawaaid-al-fiqhiyyah |title=Al Qawaaid al Fiqhiyyah - Shakeel Mahate |website=www.smahate.com |access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

[[Ibn al-Qayyim]] defined it as&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/lawbase/maliki_fiqh/usul9.html |title=The Eighth Principle: The Principle of Istishab (Presumption of Continuity) |website=www.iium.edu.my |access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The continuation of what is established or the negation of what does not exist, i.e. it is the judgement, negative or positive, continues until there is evidence of a change of state. This continuance is not proved by positive evidence, but by the absence of the existence of new evidence.}}

[[Al-Qarafi]] expressed it as the validity of the former state in the following words. {{quote|Istishab means the belief that the past or present matter must be assumed to remain as it is in the present or future.}}

== Types ==
Istishab is divided into several types. The majority of the scholars agree upon three types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=2zZVZN7AOG0C&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=types+of+istishab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2OAoLnwWkl&amp;sig=6N9mEUh9jDANkaq1f-n8oFZmRoA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB2K-n9uXXAhVIshQKHX2zAuMQ6AEIVDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=types%2520of%2520istishab&amp;f=false |title=Inevitable Doubt: Two Theories of Shīʻī Jurisprudence |last=Gleave |first=Robert |date=2000 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9004115951 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presumption of the original absence ===
It is the absence of any [[Shariah]] norms on an adult Muslim, until their legitimacy is established. An example is the absence of the mandatory sixth [[Salah|prayer]] for a Muslim, the resumption of the person's innocence in a crime, etc. Islamic theologians are [[Ijma|unanimous]] regarding the validity of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=kX1yDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=Presumption+of+the+original+absence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5BLE8dnNLV&amp;sig=8MtdQRW2nRXD28cwd9NJ0oz424A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCouiuhubXAhWBbRQKHa5fBx4Q6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Presumption%2520of%2520the%2520original%2520absence&amp;f=false |title=Foundations of Jurisprudence - An Introduction to Imāmī Shīʿī Legal Theory: Mabādiʾ al-wuṣūl ilā ʿilm al-uṣūl |last=al-Ḥillī |first=al-ʿAllāmah |date=2016-11-10 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004311770 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basis in everyday life is permissiveness ===
The overwhelming majority of jurists believe that the basis in useful everyday things is [[halal|permissiveness]] and in harmful things is [[Haram|prohibition]]. For example, a certain type of food is allowed until a Sharia argument is established, proving its prohibition.

=== Presumption of existence before evidence is available ===
If there are Sharia texts with respect to any norm, backed up by the Istishab, then statements about the abolition of this rule will not be accepted until they are backed up by evidence. An example is the continued ownership of property rights. The application to terminate property will not be accepted until evidence is submitted supporting these statements. Another example is the validity of the [[Wudu|ablution]], which will not invalidated on the mere basis of doubt.

The '''Klein Sexual Orientation Grid''' ('''KSOG''') developed by [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Fritz Klein]] attempts to measure [[sexual orientation]] by expanding upon the earlier [[Kinsey scale]]. Klein first described the KSOG in his 1978 book ''[[The Bisexual Option]]''.&lt;ref name="Coleman1987a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=Edmond J|title=Integrated Identity for Gay Men and Lesbians: Psychotherapeutic Approaches for Emotional Well-Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfXmSHMDIBgC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=29 August 2012|date=1987-09-10|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780866566384|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newitz1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=The Bad Subjects Production Team|title=Bad Subjects: Political Education for Everyday Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6inQN6MN0-AC&amp;pg=PT108|accessdate=29 August 2012|date=1997-11-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814757932|pages=108–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bancroft2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bancroft|first=John|title=Human Sexuality And It Problems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bI-Jau14aLAC&amp;pg=PA262|accessdate=29 August 2012|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780443051616|pages=262–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klein|first=Fritz|author2=Barry Sepekoff |author3=Timothy J.

In response to the criticism of the Kinsey scale only measuring two dimensions of sexual orientation, Klein developed a multidimensional grid for describing sexual orientation. Unlike the Kinsey Scale, the Klein grid investigates sexual orientation in the past, the present and in the idealized future with respect to seven factors each, for a total of twenty-one values. The KSOG uses values of 1–7, rather than the 0–6 scale of the Kinsey Scale, to describe a continuum from exclusively opposite-sex to exclusively same-sex attraction.&lt;ref name="Coleman1987b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coleman|first=Eli|year=1987|title=Assessment of Sexual Orientation|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=14|issue=1–2|pages=9–24|issn=0091-8369|doi=10.1300/J082v14n01_02|pmid=3655356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Introduced in Klein's book ''The Bisexual Option'' the KSOG uses a seven-point scale to assess seven different dimensions of sexuality at three different points in an individual's life: past (from early adolescence up to one year ago), present (within the last 12 months), and ideal (what would be chosen if it were voluntary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Fritz|title=The Bisexual Option|year=1993|publisher=The Haworth Press|isbn=978-1-56024-380-9|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortcomings==
{{main|Sexual orientation#Sexual orientation distinguished from sexual identity and behavior}}
{{Criticism section|date=October 2012}}
Klein, while recognizing that the grid explored many more dimensions of sexual orientation than previous scales, acknowledged that it omitted the following aspects of sexual orientation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Fritz|title=The Bisexual Option|year=1993|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Age of partner
* Differentiation of love and friendship in the emotional preference variable
* Sexual attraction being distinguished between [[sexual desire]] and [[limerence]]
* Whether [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] referred to number of partners or number of occurrences
* [[Sex role]]s as well as masculine and feminine roles

While Klein held the belief that including more dimensions of sexual orientation was better, Weinrich et al. (1993) found that all of the dimensions of the KSOG seemed to be measuring the same construct.&lt;ref name="Weinrich 1993 157–168"&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. Weinrich|title=A factor analysis of the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid in two disparate samples.|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=1993|volume=22|issue=2|pages=157–168|doi=10.1007/bf01542364|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study conducted a [[factor analysis]] of the KSOG to see how many factors emerged in two different samples. In both groups, the first factor to emerge loaded substantially on all of the grid's 21 items, indicating that this factor accounted for a majority of the variance. They further found that a second factor emerged containing time dimensions of social and emotional preferences suggesting that those dimensions may have also been measuring something other than sexual orientation. Therefore, despite the scale being helpful in promoting the concept of sexual orientation as being multidimensional and dynamic, the additional dimensions measured do not necessarily reveal any more of an accurate description of one's overall sexual orientation than the Kinsey Scale.

Another concern with the KSOG is that different dimensions of sexual orientation may not identify all people of a certain orientation in the same way. Measures of [[sexual attraction]], sexual activity, and [[sexual identity]] identify different (though often overlapping) populations. Laumann et al. (1994) found that of the 8.6% of women reporting some same gender sexuality, 88% reported same gender sexual attraction, 41% reported some same gender sexual behaviour and 16% reported a lesbian or gay identity.&lt;ref name="Laumann 1994 303"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laumann|title=The Social Organization of Sexuality|year=1994|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-46957-7|pages=303|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is not clear what exactly the scale may be measuring as depending on which aspect is taken into consideration, sexual orientation may or not be revealed.

'''Limerence''' is a state of mind which results from a [[Romance (love)|romantic attraction]] to another person and typically includes obsessive thoughts and fantasies and a desire to form or maintain a relationship with the object of love and have one's feelings reciprocated.

==Origin and meaning of the term==
[[Psychologist]] [[Dorothy Tennov]] coined the term "limerence" for her 1979 book, ''Love and Limerence:  The Experience of Being in Love'', to describe a concept that had grown out of her work in the mid-1960s, when she interviewed over 500 people on the topic of love.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tennov|first=Dorothy|authorlink=Dorothy Tennov|title=Love and Limerence: the Experience of Being in Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPsDAAAACAAJ|accessdate=12 March 2011|year=1999|publisher=Scarborough House|isbn=978-0-8128-6286-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence, which is not exclusively sexual, has been defined in terms of its potentially inspirational effects and in relation to [[attachment theory]]. It has been described as being "an involuntary potentially inspiring state of adoration and attachment to a limerent object (LO) involving [[Intrusive thought|intrusive]] and obsessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors from euphoria to despair, contingent on perceived emotional reciprocation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Willmott|first=Lynn|title=Love and Limerence: Harness the Limbicbrain| year= 2012| publisher= Lathbury House|isbn= 978-1481215312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachment theory emphasizes that "many of the most intense [[emotion]]s arise during the formation, the maintenance, the disruption, and the renewal of attachment relationships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first= John |last= Bowlby| title= Attachment| editor-first= Richard |editor-last= Gregory |work= The Oxford Companion to the Mind| publisher= Oxford |year= 1987| page= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that "the state of limerence is the conscious experience of sexual incentive motivation" during attachment formation, "a kind of subjective experience of sexual incentive motivation"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agmo|2007|pp=173, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the "intensive ... pair-forming stage"&lt;ref name="Morris1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; of human affectionate bonding.

==Characteristics==
The concept of 'limerence' "provides a particular carving up of the semantic domain of love",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=V. C. |editor-last=De Munck|title=Romantic Love and Sexual Behavior |year=1998 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents an attempt at a scientific study of the nature of love. Limerence is considered as a [[cognitive]] and emotional state of being emotionally attached to or even obsessed with another person, and is typically experienced involuntarily and characterized by a strong desire for reciprocation of one's feelings—a near-obsessive form of [[Romance (love)|romantic love]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Tennov, "sexual attraction is an essential component of limerence ... the limerent is a potential sex partner".&lt;ref name="Tennov"&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence is sometimes also interpreted as [[infatuation]], or what is colloquially known as a "crush".  However, in common speech, infatuation includes aspects of immaturity and extrapolation from insufficient information, and is usually short-lived.  Tennov notes how limerence "may dissolve soon after its initiation, as in an early teenage buzz-centered crush",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she is more concerned with the point when "limerent bonds are characterized by 'entropy' crystallization as described by [[Stendhal]] in his 1821 treatise ''On Love'', where a new love infatuation perceptually begins to transform ... [and] attractive characteristics are exaggerated and unattractive characteristics are given little or no attention ... [creating] a 'limerent object'".

According to Tennov, there are at least two types of love: limerence, which she describes as, among other things, "loving attachment", and "loving affection", the bond that exists between an individual and their parents and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/dec/14/features.magazine47 |work= The Guardian |title= That crazy little thing called love |date= 14 December 2003 |accessdate= 15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that one form may evolve into the other: "Those whose limerence was replaced by affectional bonding with the same partner might say ... 'We were very much in love when we married; today we love each other very much'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is comparable to that drawn by [[ethologists]] "between the pair-forming and pair-maintaining functions of sexual activity",&lt;ref name="Morris1994" /&gt; just as "the attachment of the attachment theorists is very similar to the emotional reciprocation longed for in Tennov's limerence, and each is linked to sexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence is characterized by [[Intrusive thoughts|intrusive thinking]] and pronounced sensitivity to external events that reflect the disposition of the limerent object towards the individual. It can be experienced as intense [[joy]] or as extreme [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], depending on whether the feelings are reciprocated. Basically, it is the state of being completely carried away by unreasoned [[passion (emotion)|passion]] or [[love]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} even to the point of [[Addiction|addictive]]-type behavior. Usually, one is inspired with an intense passion or admiration for someone. Limerence can be difficult to understand for those who have never experienced it, and it is thus often dismissed by non-limerents as ridiculous fantasy or a construct of romantic fiction.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt;

Tennov differentiates between limerence and other emotions by asserting that [[love]] involves concern for the other person's welfare and feeling. While limerence does not require it, those concerns may certainly be incorporated. [[Affection]] and fondness exist only as a disposition towards another person, irrespective of whether those feelings are reciprocated, whereas limerence deeply desires reciprocation, but it remains unaltered whether or not it is returned. Physical contact with the object is neither essential nor sufficient to an individual experiencing limerence, unlike with one experiencing [[sexual attraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa|title=Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=13|page=2|url=http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003453/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where early, unhealthy attachment patterns or [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] influence limerence, the limerent object may be construed as an idealization of the figure or figures involved in the original unhealthy attachment or trauma. Lack of reciprocation may in such instances serve to reinforce lessons learned in earlier, unhealthy bonding experiences, and hence strengthen the limerence.

==Components==
Limerence involves intrusive thinking about the limerent object.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; Other characteristics include acute longing for reciprocation, fear of rejection, and unsettling shyness in the limerent object's presence. In cases of unrequited limerence, transient relief may be found by vividly imagining reciprocation from the limerent object. Tennov suggests that feelings of limerence can be intensified through adversity, obstacles, or distance—'Intensification through Adversity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; A limerent person may have acute sensitivity to any act, thought, or condition that can be interpreted favorably. This may include a tendency to devise, fabricate, or invent "reasonable" explanations for why neutral actions are a sign of hidden passion in the limerent object.

A person experiencing limerence has a general intensity of feeling that leaves other concerns in the background. In their thoughts, such a person tends to emphasize what is admirable in the limerent object and to avoid any negative or problematic attributes.

===Intrusive thinking and fantasy===
During the height of limerence, thoughts of the limerent object (or person) are at once persistent, involuntary and intrusive. Such 'intrusive thoughts about the LO ... appear to be genetically driven':&lt;ref name="moore268"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, limerence is first and foremost a condition of cognitive obsession. This may be caused by low serotonin levels in the brain, comparable to those of people with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Marazziti D, Akiskal HS, Rossi A, Cassano GB. "Alteration of the platelet serotonin transporter in romantic love." ''Psychol Med.'' 2000&lt;/ref&gt; All events, associations, stimuli, and experiences return thoughts to the limerent object with unnerving consistency, while conversely the constant thoughts about the limerent object define all other experiences. If a certain thought has no previous connection with the limerent object, immediately one is made. Limerent fantasy is unsatisfactory unless rooted in reality,&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; because the fantasizer may want the fantasy to seem realistic and somewhat possible.  At their most severe, intrusive limerent thoughts can occupy an individual's waking hours completely, resulting—like severe addiction—in significant or complete disruption of the limerent's normal interests and activities, including work and family.  For serial limerents, this can result in debilitating, lifelong underachievement in school, work, and family life.  Comparisons{{which|date=December 2013}} made between limerence and substance addiction may draw attention to the constant, free availability of the limerent's "drug of choice".

Fantasies that are concerned with far-fetched ideas are usually dropped by the fantasizer.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; Sometimes fantasizing is retrospective: actual events are replayed from memory with great vividness. This form predominates when what is viewed as evidence of possible reciprocation can be re-experienced (a kind of selective or revisionist history). Otherwise, the long fantasy is anticipatory; it begins in the everyday world and climaxes at the attainment of the limerent goal. A limerent fantasy can also involve an unusual, often tragic, event.

The long fantasies form bridges between the limerent's ordinary life and that intensely desired ecstatic moment. The duration and complexity of a fantasy depend on the availability of time and freedom from distractions. The bliss of the imagined moment of consummation is greater when events imagined to precede it are possible (though they often represent grave departures from the probable). Not always is it entirely pleasant, and when rejection seems likely the thoughts focus on despair, sometimes to the point of [[suicide]]. The pleasantness or unpleasantness of the state seems almost unrelated to the intensity of the reaction. Although the direction of feeling, i.e. happy versus unhappy, shifts rapidly, with 'dramatic surges of buoyancy and despair',&lt;ref name=moore268/&gt; the intensity of intrusive and involuntary thinking alters less rapidly, and only in response to an accumulation of experiences with the particular limerent object.

Fantasies are occasionally dreamed by the one experiencing limerence. Dreams give out strong emotion and happiness when experienced, but often end with despair when the subject awakens. Dreams can reawaken strong feelings toward the limerent object after the feelings have declined.

=== Fear of rejection ===
Along with an emphasis on the perceived exceptional qualities, and devotion to them, there is abundant doubt that the feelings are reciprocated: [[social rejection#Romantic rejection|rejection]]. Considerable self-doubt is encountered, leading to "personal incapacitation expressed through unsettling timidity in the presence of the person",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; something which causes misery and galvanizes desire.

In most cases, what destroys limerence is a suitably long period of time without [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocation]]. Although it appears that limerence advances with adversity, personal discomfort may foul it.  This discomfort results from a fear of the limerent object's opinions.

=== Hope ===
Limerence develops and is sustained when there is a certain balance of hope and uncertainty. The basis for limerent hope is not in objective reality but in reality as it is perceived. The inclination is to sift through nuances of speech and [[wikt:subtleties|subtleties]] of behavior for evidence of limerent hope. "Lovers, of course, are notoriously frantic [[epistemologist]]s, second only to paranoiacs (and analysts) as readers of signs and wonders."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Adam. ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; "Little things" are noticed and endlessly analyzed for meaning. Such excessive concern over trivia may not be entirely unfounded, however, as body language can indicate reciprocated feeling. What the limerent object said and did is recalled with vividness. Alternative meanings for the behaviors recalled are sought. Each word and gesture is permanently available for review, especially those interpreted as evidence in favor of reciprocated feeling. When objects, people, places or situations are encountered with the limerent object, they are vividly remembered, especially if the limerent object  interacted with them in some way.

The belief that the limerent object does not and will not reciprocate can only be reached with great difficulty. Limerence can be carried quite far before acknowledgment of rejection is genuine, especially if it has not been addressed openly by the limerent object.

==Effects==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

===Physical effects===
The physiological correlations of intense limerence can include [[seizure]]-like [[trembling]], [[pallor]], [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[heart palpitations]], [[pupil dilation]] and general [[Muscle weakness|weakness]]. [[Awkwardness]], [[stuttering]], [[shyness]], and [[confusion]] predominate at the behavioral level. Less common effects include [[insomnia]], [[loss of appetite]],  and [[Syncope (medicine)|passing out]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

If there is extensive [[anxiety]], incorrect behaviour may torpedo the relationship, which may cause physical responses to manifest intensely. Some people acutely feel these effects either immediately or following contact with the limerent object.  Blended is dire ecstasy or keen despair, depending on the turn of events.

The sensitivity that stems from fear of rejection can darken limerent objects' perceived body language. Conflicted signs of [[desire]] may be emitted that confuse judgment.  Often the limerent object is currently involved with another or is in some other way unavailable.

A condition of sustained alertness, a heightening of awareness and an enormous fund of energy to deploy in pursuit of the limerent aim is developed. The sensation of limerence is felt in the midpoint of the chest, bottom of the throat, guts, or in some cases in the abdominal region.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; This can be interpreted as ecstasy at times of mutuality, but its presence is most noticeable during [[Broken heart|despair at times of rejection]].

===Psychological effects===
Sufferers complain of abandonment, despair, and diabolically humiliating disappointment. A sense of paralyzing ambiguity predominates, punctuated by pining. The fact of intermittent or nonreciprocal response lends to labile vacillation. This [[limbo]] is the threshold for mental prostration.

== Sexuality ==
Awareness of [[physical attraction]] plays a key role in the development of limerence,&lt;ref name="Tennov" /&gt; but is not enough to satisfy the limerent desire, and is almost never the main focus; instead, the limerent focuses on what could be defined as the "beneficial attributes". Nevertheless, Tennov stresses that "the most consistent result of limerence is mating, not merely sexual interaction but also commitment".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence can be intensified after a sexual relationship has begun, and with more intense limerence there is greater desire for sexual contact. However, while sexual surrender at one time indicated the end of uncertainty felt by the limerent object – because in the past, a sexual encounter more often led to a feeling of obligation to commit – in modern times this is not necessarily the case.

The sexual aspect of limerence is not consistent from person to person.  Most limerents experience limerent sexuality as a component of romantic interest.  Some limerents, however, may experience limerence as a consequence of hyperarousal. In such cases, limerence may form as a [[defense mechanism]] against the limerent object, who is not perceived initially as a romantic ideal, but as a physical threat to the limerent.

[[Sexual fantasy|Sexual fantasies]] are distinct from limerent fantasies. Limerent fantasy is rooted in reality and is intrusive rather than voluntary. Sexual fantasies are under more or less voluntary control and may involve strangers, imaginary individuals, and situations that could not take place. Limerence elevates body temperature and increases relaxation{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}, a sensation of viewing the world with [[Optimism|rose-tinted glasses]], leading to a greater receptiveness to sexuality, and to daydreaming.

People can become aroused by the thought of sexual partners, acts, and situations that are not truly desired, whereas every detail of the limerent fantasy is passionately desired actually to take place. Limerence sometimes increases sexual interest in other partners when the limerent object is unreceptive or unavailable.

The limerent reaction is a composite reaction – that is, it is composed of a series of separate reactions.  These reactions occur only where misperceptions meet adversity in the context of a romance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  Perhaps because of this unique specificity, limerent reactions can be uniquely quantified and predicted according to the schema described below.

Involvement increases if obstacles are externally imposed or if the limerent object’s feelings are doubted. Only if the limerent object were to be revealed as highly undesirable might limerence subside. The presence of some degree of doubt causes the intensity of the feelings to increase further.  The stage is reached at which the reaction is virtually impossible to dislodge. This adversity may be superficial or deep, internal or external, so that an individual may sometimes generate deep adversity where none exists.  Also "romance", as it were, need not be present in any genuine way for a limerent reaction to occur.

The course of limerence results in a more intrusive thinking pattern. This thinking pattern is an expectant and often joyous period with the initial focusing on the limerent object’s admirable qualities: [[crystallization (love)|crystallization]]. Then, under appropriate conditions of hope and uncertainty, the limerence intensifies further.

With evidence of reciprocation (real or imagined) from the limerent object, a state of extreme pleasure, even euphoria, is enjoyed. Thoughts are mainly occupied with considering and reconsidering what is attractive in the limerent object, replaying whatever events may have thus far transpired with the limerent object, and appreciating personal qualities perceived as possibly having sparked interest in the limerent object. At peak crystallization, almost all waking thoughts revolve around the limerent object. After this peak, the feelings eventually decline.

Fantasies are preferred to virtually any other activity with the exception of activities that are believed to help obtain the limerent object, and activities that involve actually being in the presence of the limerent object. The motivation to attain a "relationship" continues to intensify so long as a proper mix of hope and uncertainty exist.

== Limerent duration ==

Tennov estimates, based on both questionnaire and interview data, that the average limerent reaction duration, from the moment of initiation until a feeling of neutrality is reached, is approximately three years. The extremes may be as brief as a few weeks or as long as several decades. When limerence is brief, maximum intensity may not have been attained. According to David Sack, M.D., limerence lasts longer than romantic love, but is shorter than a healthy, committed partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Others suggest that 'the biogenetic sourcing of limerence determines its limitation, ordinarily, to a two-year span',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; that limerence generally lasts between 18 months and three years; but further studies on unrequited limerence have suggested longer durations. In turn, a limerent may only experience a single limerent episode, or may experience "serial" episodes, in which nearly one's entire mature life, from early puberty through late adulthood, can be consumed in successive limerent obsessions.

== Bond varieties ==
{{Main|Human bonding}}
Once the ''limerent reaction'' has initiated, one of three varieties of bonds may form, defined over a set duration of time, in relation to the experience or non-experience of limerence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa|title=Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=13|page=1|url=http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003453/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The constitution of these bonds may vary over the course of the relationship, in ways that may either increase or decrease the intensity of the limerence.

The basis and interesting characteristic of this delineation made by Tennov, is that based on her research and interviews with people, all human bonded relationships can be divided into three varieties being defined by the amount of limerence or non-limerence each partner contributes to the relationship.

With an affectional bond, neither partner is limerent. With a Limerent-Nonlimerent bond, one partner is limerent. In a Limerent-Limerent bond, both partners are limerent.

Affectional bonding characterize those affectionate sexual relationships where neither partner is limerent; couples tend to be in love, but do not report continuous and unwanted intrusive thinking, feeling intense need for exclusivity, or define their goals in terms of reciprocity.  These types of bonded couples tend to emphasize compatibility of interests, mutual preferences in leisure activities, ability to work together, and in some cases a degree of relative contentment.

The bulk of relationships, however, according to Tennov, are those between a limerent person and a nonlimerent other, i.e. ''limerent-nonlimerent bonding''.  These bonds are characterized by unequal reciprocation.

Lastly, those relationship bonds in which there exists mutual reciprocation are defined as ''limerent-limerent bondings''.  Tennov argues that since limerence itself is an "unstable state", mutually limerent bonds would be expected to be short-lived; mixed relationships probably last longer than limerent-limerent relationships. Some limerent-limerent relationships evolve into affectional bondings over time as limerence declines.  Tennov describes such couples as "old marrieds" whose interactions are typically both stable and mutually gratifying.

==Mitigation==
In her study Tennov identified three ways in which limerence subsides: 
;Consummation (reciprocation)
:Each limerent has a slightly different view of acceptable reciprocation, and the reactions to reciprocation vary.  Some limerents remain limerent (as documented by Tennov), while for others the limerence subsides as the certainty of reciprocity grows.  Other limerents do not achieve any "real" consummation (e.g. physical, or in the form of an actual relationship) but find their limerence waning after a limerent object professes similar feelings.
;Starvation
:In this process, a lack of ''any'' notice (i.e. starvation, described by Tennov as "the onslaught of evidence that LO does not return the limerence") causes the limerent to gradually desensitize. This desensitization may take a long time, in which case a limerent's latent hypersensitivity may cause any attention given by a former LO, regardless of how slight, to be interpreted as a reason for hope, precipitating a resurgence of limerence.
;Transference
:The limerent transfers their romantic feelings to another person, thereby ending the initial limerence; the limerence is sometimes transferred as well.

==Continuing research==
Tennov's research has been continued{{when|refers to 2008 articles|date=January 2018}} by Albert Wakin, who knew Tennov at the [[University of Bridgeport]] but did not assist in her research, and Duyen Vo, a graduate student of [[Southern Connecticut State University]].&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their goal is to refine the term limerence so that it refers mostly to the negative aspects.

The term "limerence" has been invoked in many popular media,{{according to whom|date=January 2018}} including self-help books, popular magazines, and websites.  However, according to a paper by Wakin and Vo, "In spite of the public’s exposure to limerence, the professional community, particularly clinical, is largely unaware of the concept."&lt;ref name="Wakin-Vo"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Wakin and Vo presented their updated research to the American Association of Behavioral and Social Sciences.  They reported that more research must be gathered before the condition is suitable for inclusion in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (''DSM'').&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;

Critics point out that Tennov's account "is based on interviews rather than on direct observation", but conclude that "despite its shortcomings, Tennov's work may constitute a basis for informed hypothesis formulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agmo|2007|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and development==
Born in [[Castrovirreyna Province|Ticrapo, Castrovirreyna Province, Peru]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Six decades later, world's youngest mother awaits aid |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1020827/asp/foreign/story_1140311.asp |work=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]] |date=27 August 2002 |accessdate=14 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iJ65vfQ8?url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1020827/asp/foreign/story_1140311.asp |archivedate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[silversmith]] Tiburelo Medina and Victoria Losea,&lt;ref name="await"&gt;Elgar Brown (for ''Chicago Evening American''). "American scientists await U.S. visit of youngest mother: Peruvian girl and baby will be exhibited", ''San Antonio Light'', 11 July 1939, page 2A.&lt;/ref&gt; she was brought to a hospital by her parents at the age of five years due to increasing abdominal size. She was originally thought to have a [[tumor]], but doctors determined she was in her seventh month of [[pregnancy]]. Dr Gerardo Lozada took Medina to [[Lima]] to have other specialists confirm that she was pregnant.&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Mikkleson |title=Youngest Mother|publisher=Snopes.com|accessdate=25 January 2017 |url=http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/medina.asp |date=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary newspaper accounts indicate that interest in the case developed on many fronts. The ''San Antonio Light'' newspaper reported in its 16 July, 1939, edition&amp;mdash;in anticipation of the girl's expected visit to U.S. university scientific facilities&amp;mdash;that a national Peruvian obstetrician/midwife association had demanded that the girl be transported to a national maternity hospital; the paper quoted 18 April reports in the Peruvian paper ''La Crónica'' stating that a North American film making concern had sent a representative "with authority to offer the sum of $5,000 to benefit the minor [in exchange for filming rights] ... we know that the offer was rejected."&lt;ref name="sympathy"&gt;Elgar Brown (for ''Chicago Evening American''). "Wide sympathy aroused by plight of child-mother: opportunity seen to make Lina independent," ''San Antonio Light'', 16 July 1939, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The same article, reprinted from a Chicago paper, noted that Lozada had made films of Medina for scientific documentation and had shown them around 21 April while addressing Peru's National Academy of Medicine; on a subsequent visit to Lina's remote hometown, some of the baggage carrying the films had fallen into the river while crossing "a very primitive bridge ... Enough of his pictorial record remained, however, to intrigue the learned savants."&lt;ref name="sympathy"/&gt;

A month and a half after the original diagnosis, Medina gave birth by [[caesarean section]] to a boy. She was 5 years, 7 months, and 21 days,&lt;ref name=Snopes/&gt; [[List of youngest birth mothers|the youngest known person in history to give birth]]. The caesarean birth was necessitated by her small [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. The surgery was performed by Lozada and Dr Busalleu, with Dr Colareta providing [[anaesthesia]]. When doctors performed the caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs from [[precocious puberty]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Her case was reported in detail by Dr. Edmundo Escomel in the medical journal ''La Presse Médicale'', including the additional details that her [[menarche]] had occurred at eight months of age, in contrast to a past report stating that she had been having regular periods since she was three years old&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation|year=1988|author1=Janice Delaney|author2=Mary Jane Lupton|author3=Emily Toth|isbn=0252014529|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njfQfrMr31EC&amp;q=Lina+Medina#v=snippet&amp;q=Lina%20Medina&amp;f=false|edition=2nd (revised)|publisher=University of Illinois Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shearman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rodney P.

The striking example is that of Lina Medina, who had a Caesarean section when 5 ½ years old, but there have been other pregnancies in children aged 6, 7, 8 and 9 years (Sickel, 1946).}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 2½ according to a different article).&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; 

Medina's son weighed {{convert|2.7|kg|lb st|abbr=on}} at birth and was named Gerardo after her doctor. Gerardo was raised believing that Medina was his sister, but found out at the age of 10 that she was, in fact, his mother.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;

==Identity of the father and later life==
Medina has never revealed the father of the child nor the circumstances of her impregnation. Escomel suggested she might not actually know herself by writing that Medina "couldn't give precise responses".&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt; Although Lina's father was arrested on suspicion of [[child sexual abuse]], he was later released due to lack of evidence, and the biological father was never identified.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="littlemother"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893791,00.html |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |title=Little Mother |date=16 December 1957 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iJ7D1EHq?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C893791%2C00.html |archivedate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son grew up healthy. He died in 1979 at the age of 40.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;

In young adulthood, Medina worked as a secretary in the Lima clinic of Lozada, who gave her an education and helped put her son through high school.&lt;ref name="leon"/&gt; Medina later married Raúl Jurado, who fathered her second son in 1972. {{As of|2002}}, they lived in a poor district of Lima known as "Chicago Chico".&lt;ref name="Dietz1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Dietz|title=Urban Poverty, Political Participation, and the State: Lima, 1970–1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qf0NQ3Eut2IC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=lima+chicago+chico|date=15 July 1998|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-7193-1|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; She refused an interview with [[Reuters]] that year,&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; just as she had turned away many reporters in years past.&lt;ref name="leon"/&gt;

==Documentation==
Although it was speculated that the case was a [[hoax]], a number of doctors over the years have verified it based on [[biopsies]], [[X rays]] of the fetal skeleton ''[[in utero]]'', and photographs taken by the doctors caring for her.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Medico-Physical"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Journal of Medical-physical Research: A Journal of Progressive Medicine and Physical Therapies, Volumes 15-16|year=1941|publisher=American Association for Medico-Physical Research|page=188|quote=Lina Medina...

There are two published photographs documenting the case. The first was taken around the beginning of April 1939, when Medina was seven-and-a-half months into pregnancy. Taken from Medina's left side, it shows her standing naked in front of a neutral backdrop. This is the only published photograph of Lina taken during her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/histoire/medica/resultats/?cote=100000x1939xartorig&amp;p=878&amp;do=page "La Presse médicale",  47(43): 875, 1939] "La Plus Jeune Mère du Monde".  (31 May 1939).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, except for the effects of precocious puberty,&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; there was no explanation of how a five-year-old girl could conceive a child.&lt;ref name="leon"&gt;{{cite news|author=Luis Leon|agency= Associated Press|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/iowa/cedar-rapids/cedar-rapids-gazette/1955/10-30/page-18|title=Son of child mother wants to be doctor|work=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=30 October 1955|page=18|via=[[NewspaperArchive.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme precocious pregnancy in children aged five or under has only been documented with Medina.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shearman"/&gt;

The '''McGovern Institute for Brain Research''' is a research institute within [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Its mission is to understand how the brain works and to discover new ways to prevent or treat brain disorders.   The institute was founded in 2000 by [[Patrick Joseph McGovern|Patrick McGovern]] and [[Lore Harp McGovern]] with a gift to MIT that is expected to total $350M over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2000/neurorelease.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The director is [[Robert Desimone]], formerly director of intramural research at the [[National Institute for Mental Health]].  The 19 current faculty members include a Nobel laureate ([[H. Robert Horvitz]]), a winner of the US National Medal of Science ([[Ann Graybiel]]) and 6 members of the US National Academy of Sciences (Desimone, Horvitz, Graybiel, and Feng Zhang, along with [[Emilio Bizzi]] and [[Nancy Kanwisher]]).   The founding director (2000-2004) was [[Phillip Sharp]], also a Nobel Laureate. 

The McGovern Institute conducts research into all aspects of brain function, including perception, cognition and action. It also conducts clinical and translational research on a wide range of brain disorders.

The Institute’s core facilities include the Martinos Imaging Center, which provides neuroimaging technologies for human and animal research, including [[MRI]], [[EEG]] and [[magnetoencephalography|MEG]].

The McGovern Institute occupies approximately 85,000 sq ft (net) within the MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences Complex.  This building, which was completed in 2005, also houses the [[Picower Institute for Learning and Memory]] and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and is among the largest neuroscience research buildings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/facilities/construction/completed/bcs.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was designed by Indian architect [[Charles Correa]] in collaboration with the Boston-based firm [[Goody, Clancy &amp; Associates, Inc]].  It is one of the most distinctive landmarks on the MIT campus, notable especially for the [[Grand Junction Railroad and Depot Company|Grand Junction railroad]] that runs through the center of the building.

'''Military geography''' is a sub-field of geography that is used by the military, as well as academics and politicians, to understand the geopolitical sphere through the military lens. To accomplish these ends, military geographers consider topics from [[geopolitics]] to physical locations’ influences on military operations and the cultural and economic impacts of a military presence. On a tactical level, a military geographer might put together the terrain and the drainage system below the surface, so a unit is not at a disadvantage if the enemy uses the drainage system to [[ambush]] it, especially in [[urban warfare]]. On a strategic level, an emerging field of strategic and military geography seeks to understand the changing human and biophysical environments that alter the security and military domains.  Climate change, for example, is adding and multiplying the complexity of military strategy, planning and training.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, J., Thomas, M.D. and Durrant, C. "Strategic Military Geography: Climate Change Adaptation and the Military." Handbook of Climate Change Adaptation. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2015. 493-514. http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/522/chp%253A10.1007%252F978-3-642-38670-1_24.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Freferenceworkentry%2F10.1007%2F978-3-642-38670-1_24&amp;token2=exp=1479360129~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F522%2Fchp%25253A10.1007%25252F978-3-642-38670-1_24.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Freferenceworkentry%252F10.1007%252F978-3-642-38670-1_24*~hmac=b6e7c0edff5f362fc667c8f3a6bd40215d3e7400c690401799a7ac3379d74b58&lt;/ref&gt;  Emerging responsibilities for the military to be involved in: protection of civilian populations ([[Responsibility to protect]]), women and ethnic groups; provision of humanitarian aid and disaster response (HADR); new technology and domains of training and operations,such as in cybergeography, make military geography a dynamic frontier.

{{cquote|If a general desired to be a successful actor in the great drama of war, his first duty is to study carefully the theater of operations so that he may see clearly the relative advantages and disadvantages it presents for himself and his enemies.}}
:— [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Baron De Jomini]]&lt;ref&gt;p.215, Jomini&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Development of Military Geography==
Military geography has a long and practical history.  For example, ''Imperial Military Geography'' in 1938 &lt;ref&gt;Cole, D. H. (1933). Imperial military geography: general characteristics of the empire in relation to defence. Sifton Praed &amp; CoY London.&lt;/ref&gt; shows how a colonial empire approach to military geography could describe the geographical setting of empire, the responsibilities and the resources that could be mobilised for national or imperial needs.  [[Environmental determinism]], [[regional geography]], [[geographic information system]]s and [[geography]] more generally have all evolved and entwined over hundreds of years.

Canadian, South African and Australian military geography (Pearson et al 2018) is inconspicuous compared to the United States and British traditions. 

There are important links to peace studies and particularly notable was Australian Professor Griffith Taylor who espoused Geopacifics as, ''an attempt to base the teachings of freedom and humanity upon real geographical deductions; it is humanized Geopolitics'' &lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. G. (1946). Our evolving civilization: An introduction to Geopacifics, geographical aspects of the path toward world peace. University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and later observed that, …''so few geographers are prepared to explore public problems which touch on geography as much as on most other disciplines. This is certainly the case with the problem of world peace.'' &lt;ref&gt;Taylor, G. (1963). Geographers and world peace a plea for Geopacifics. ''Geographical Research'', 1, 3–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Urbanistics ==
Russian colonel N. S. Olesik terms the field of analyzing the complex [[urban development|urban environment]] in particular “military geo-urbanistics.” In the open country, units only deal with terrain, weather, and the enemy. In [[urban warfare]], the terrain is more complex, filled with many structures and transformations of the land by the inhabitants, which restrict visibility from the air and create obstacles to ground units. Spaces may be narrow, and convoys may be restricted to certain routes between buildings, where they face roadside bombs and ambushes.

Units must work with or work around the people, some of whom may cooperate and others of whom may oppose, while others are neutral or caught between the two factions.  Guerilla fighters may count on an enemy's unwillingness to bomb or fire on heavily populated areas.

== Types of terrain ==
Several types of terrain and associated climate are prevalent, each affecting combatants differently.

=== Desert warfare ===
{{main article|Desert warfare}}

In an arid climate, as in many [[desert]] areas across the globe, sand is a main concern. [[Sand]] can hamper an army’s attempts to remain hydrated, sapping moisture from skin; sand also jams machinery including the firing mechanisms of firearms.

Terrain is usually fairly flat, though in some regions there are vast, rolling sand dunes.  The desert environment can also contain mountains; as in [[Afghanistan]] and in certain areas around Israel.  Due to the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, the U.S. military has redesigned the uniforms for the different branches of service.  All of the uniforms have a [[digital camouflage]] pattern that is very effective in the desert environment, and the boots have been changed from the standard polished black boots to light brown colored suede leather boots. These boots are cooler under the intense heat of the desert sun.

===Jungle and forest warfare===
{{Main article|Jungle warfare}}

The conditions of these regions are basically the opposite of those found in desert regions.  There are thousands of flora and fauna, and there is always moisture present which presents its own difficulties.  The moisture speeds up the rotting processes as well as causing wounds to become infected much easier because of all of the bacteria that live in the water.  With proper filtration systems an army should have no problem keeping hydrated.

The densely packed trees and underbrush provide concealment from the air as well as from the ground.  Ambushes can be easily conducted in this environment just like they can in an urban environment.   The jungle can also contain mountains, but these mountains are organized differently from those that exist in the desert.  The jungle mountains have far more plant life, and are usually much more difficult to ascend.  Helicopters have been proven as a very useful means of transportation through, actually over, jungle and forested areas; Vietnam was, of course, the testing ground for this.  Tanks and other vehicles have a hard time maneuvering through and around the densely packed trees, and most military aircraft fly too fast to accurately observe the ground through the trees.

===Winter warfare===
{{see also|Arctic warfare}}

This type of warfare is not based on a geographical design, but is based on the drastic differences in this particular climate.  During war it is much harder to remain warm than it is to remain cool.  Even Forested areas can, and many do, experience winter weather conditions.  For this specific type of combat there are soldiers that are specifically trained to fight under the conditions individual to the winter season.  It takes a special skill to fight in the deep snow and extreme cold.  These conditions call for a drastically thicker and thus warmer uniform, and the weapons even need to be refitted with the proper devices to ensure that they will operate in the cold.

===Mountain warfare===
{{main article|Mountain warfare}}

No two mountains are alike, but there is less oxygen at higher altitude. Fighting up a mountain can be very treacherous. There can be avalanches, rockslides, cliffs, and ambushes from higher up the slopes, and there are almost guaranteed to be caves somewhere in the mountain, as in Afghanistan.

===Mud===
Mud is a universal menace to all armies.  While it does not hamper the use of air power, it does slow, and sometimes stops, ground movements all together.  The most common season for mud across the globe is spring.  Following the thawing of winter’s snow and the addition of the rains that the season brings, the ground becomes very soft and almost any military vehicle would get bogged down if not properly equipped.  The mud is not always dependent on the spring. Rather, in some parts of the world, they are determined by the monsoons.

==Ocean fronts (harbors, beaches and sea cliffs)==

===Pirates===
Even today, there is still a problem of [[piracy]] on the world’s oceans.  One of the most commonly thought of areas for this criminal activity is off the coast of [[Somalia]].  There has always been the constant threat of small and fast attack craft coming out to greet a vessel as it passes through the waters between Africa and the Middle East.  Another region that piracy occurs, and it can be of a much larger scale, is in and around the [[Indonesia]]n islands and off the coasts of the Asian mainland.  Here the pirates have been able to capture much larger prizes, and they pose a much larger threat to the security of economic interests of many countries.  Pirates operate from bases that are concealed, but they must be on the waterfront in a country that is either ignorant of their activity, or worse, are paid to overlook it.

To deal with the pirates, if an American vessel is attacked, the [[U.S. Navy]] has multiple assets to deal with the situation.  If the pirates know an attack is imminent, it may be more logical to bomb their base with aircraft from one of the carriers.  However, more often than not, the U.S. Navy would opt for secrecy and send in a smaller force, such as the [[U.S. Navy SEALS]], to eliminate the threat.

===Harbors===
In the concerns of a seaport, especially if it is a goal to either capture or defend it, there are more difficulties than in defending a city that is in land.  With a harbor there is also the threat from the sea in addition to the land and the air.  A harbor is always a key objective for an army to capture when an invasion is commenced.  The sooner the harbor can be captured, the sooner it can be used to bring in massive amounts of reinforcements and material.  The trouble is to capture the harbor before the enemy can sabotage it by blocking the entrance with wreckage or by deploying mines throughout the harbor.  Defending the harbor is a treacherous task because odds are that the enemy can observe your position from both the air and the sea.  The harbor is on the periphery of the defense network of many nations, and even more so if the navy is either deployed or nonexistent.  The best ways to defend the harbor are to have military airfields in close vicinity, to have naval units based in the harbor on a permanent basis, and to be ready to make the harbor unusable by the enemy if they should overcome your defenses.

===Beaches===

===Sea cliffs===
The same rules apply to this category as to the preceding one with the exception of the mines.  Here there is almost no need for anti-vehicle mines, and so, the defenses could be planned without much concern for an armored attack.

== Resources; future flashpoints ==
The Middle East is, of course, the most obvious place that comes to mind when we think of valuable resources that major nations may compete over when supplies begin to fall around the world.  The first Gulf War was an example of the United States’ willingness to go to war to protect its access to the rich oilfields of the Persian Gulf.  The strong military presence there influenced some leaders to aid the United States with cheap oil, but over time those forces began to be viewed as a threat to the Muslim world.  The attacks of September 11, 2001, have brought new hostilities to the region with the invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq.  Other hotspots around the globe centering on oil are the areas around Venezuela, the Caspian Sea region, and possibly the offshore oil deposits around Vietnam and China.  In today’s age, especially for people living in developed countries,  it is hard to believe that there are other resources that can potentially cause a war.

The most precious and most needed resource of all is water, and in some parts of the world, that is a very expensive resource to obtain.  The most obvious areas that conflict may arise over disputes for water supplies would be in the desert, but at the moment oil is the most valuable liquid in the Middle East.  However, oil will not always be there, and if those people are going to survive, they must have water.  Several times, countries that are upriver have threatened to build dams across the rivers in order to cut off the country down river, starving that particular country of its water supply.  This has been the case with both the Nile and the River Jordan, and the results in both cases have been the same: the countries that are down river have threatened retaliation if such an event should occur.  As our global warming trend continues, our weather patterns will continue to shift, and that means that some places will fall into a severe drought.  These people may become desperate when they do not have the resources to obtain water if such a disaster should occur.

Water is not the only resource on this planet that is found to be a necessity. The forests are as well.  These densely wooded regions of the world are constantly shrinking, and as the oil runs out, people will need to keep warm in the winter.  Odds are that they will return to using wood as a primary fuel source for keeping warm.  As the forests shrink, neighboring countries will turn on each other for this resource in order to appease their populations.  The forests of Latin America and the Pacific Islands are the key hotspots for this resource; this is in part due to the already tense situations in and around those regions because of growing tensions over global oil supplies.

In 2002’s Die Another Day, the term "conflict diamonds" is at the heart of the film’s plot.  In the film, the diamonds are the currency that is used to fund illegal weapons deals, and are used to fund the construction of the Icarus space weapon.  The portrayal of the use of the diamonds that come out of Africa holds true in many cases.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  The term “conflict diamonds” is applied to those diamonds that are not sold through an internationally recognized company.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  They are “conflict diamonds” because warlords in Africa fight for these diamonds in order to sell them to acquire larger wealth and new weapons for continued fighting.  The same is true for the gold fields in southern Africa.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  There are many warlords that would love to have control of the vast wealth of the mines in order to further fund their lucrative endeavors.

== Base construction and closings ==
{{Globalize|date=April 2016}}
The [[United States Department of Defense]] maintains a larger number of domestic and foreign military bases than all other countries combined.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}   Closing redundant military bases in the United States often has a negative economic impact on local communities.  Analysts at [[the Pentagon]] respond to budget limitations by identifying installations that have become obsolete for various reasons.  Sometimes the needs for the location are no longer prevalent in defense strategies or the installation’s facilities have fallen into disrepair.  That is the case with the smaller Reserve and National Guard facilities that dot every state.  The personnel on the committees responsible for determining closures also observe the economic impact that their decisions will have on the communities surrounding the installations.  If 40,000 people are employed because of the installation, either directly or indirectly, it is more likely that that facility will remain open, but only if there is nowhere for the 40,000 people that would lose their jobs.  Those people could end up on welfare, thus becoming just as much of a draw on revenue as they were as employees.

Outside of the United States, some countries are strongly vying for inclusion in strategic treaties such as NATO.  These countries, many of which are in Eastern Europe, want to join [[NATO]] for the mutual advantages of defense and the possibility for foreign bases to be constructed on their soil.  These bases, if they were to be built, would bring fiscal resources that those nations would not get without the bases.  Sometimes foreign bases are viewed as a good thing.  In other regions, a strong political stance may be taken against the construction of foreign military bases, often for sovereignty issues.

==Decline in popularity; evolution of critical military geography==

Due to the subfield of military geography's perceived connection to traditional or classical [[geopolitics]], a field which has since the end of the Cold War been largely rejected as a research focus by proponents of the popular schools of both [[critical geography]] and [[Marxist]] or [[radical geography]], military geography has experienced a decline in popularity in academic circles. This is true particularly in institutions unaffiliated with or unconnected to military or governmental organizations. As a result, although there do exist some popular nonfiction writers of [[geography]] without academic credentials in the field who touch on military strategy or tactics, there are presently few practicing military geographers or students of military geography in academia. Similarly, there have been few major texts on military geography published specifically for a civilian academic audience since the early 2000s. More recently, in a 2014 article published in the journal ''Critical Military Studies'', the authors Rech et al. suggest a revival of the field in line with [[critical geography]] and [[critical geopolitics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/23337486.2014.963416 | volume=1 | title=Geography, military geography, and critical military studies | journal=Critical Military Studies | pages=47–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; One earlier example of this school of thought has been Woodward's 2004 text ''Military Geographies''. However, given the [[postmodern]] bias of critical geographical studies as well as critical geography academics' tendency to proudly claim for themselves a politically [[Political radicalism|radical]] or [[anti-authoritarian]] slant in their research, this form of a revival of military geography seems unlikely to provide sound recommendations for or detailed analyses of major [[geopolitical]] events. This shift in focus would also make military geography less likely to fruitfully inform governmental policy or military strategy, as well as potentially limit the ability of academics to provide their expertise to members of the general public interested in studying or reading about the geographic aspects of military strategy.

==Strategic and Military Geography revival==
The revival of geography and military geography as a sub-discipline is a remarkable trend since 2000 with a number of key geopolitical, international relations,&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R. D. (2012). ''The revenge of geography: what the map tells us about coming conflicts and the battle against fate.'' Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; historical geography  &lt;ref&gt;Kilcullen, D. (2015). ''Out of the mountains: The coming age of the urban guerrilla.'' Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and geographical approaches being developed.  The American Association of Geographers and Institute of Australian Geographers have interest groups that continue to develop the sub-discipline of military geography. At the American Association of Geographers meeting in 2018 a committee gathered evidence about militarism and military geography.
In 2018 ''Australian Contributions to Strategic and Military Geography'' &lt;ref&gt;Pearson, S. Holloway J.L. &amp; Thackway, R. (2018) ''Australian Contributions to Strategic and Military Geography'' Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined  a new Australian approach and included chapters on themes and specific regions.

'''''My Family''''' is a [[British sitcom]] created and initially co-written by Fred Barron, which was produced by DLT Entertainment and Rude Boy Productions, and broadcast by [[BBC One]] for eleven series between 2000 and 2011, with [[Christmas special]]s broadcast from 2002 onwards. My Family was voted 24th in the BBC's "[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]" in 2004 and was the most watched sitcom in the United Kingdom in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6221021.ece |location=London |work=The Times  | title=Robert Lindsay and Zo Wanamaker on My Family's 100th episode | first=Bruce | last=Dessau | date=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, it is one of only twelve British sitcoms to pass the 100-episode mark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/00000497/my_family_sitcom_axed/ BBC axes My Family sitcom after 11 years] The British Comedy Guide, 25 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Set in [[Chiswick]] in west London, it stars [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]] as Ben Harper, [[Zoë Wanamaker]] as his wife Susan, and [[Kris Marshall]], [[Daniela Denby-Ashe]], and [[Gabriel Thomson]] as their children Nick, Janey and Michael. Since the show’s debut, several characters have left and others have been introduced. The character of Janey left in 2002, then returned in 2004 and remained until the end. Kris Marshall's character, Nick, left in 2005 and returned for occasional brief guest appearances, though he was frequently mentioned by other characters. The character of Abi, as played by [[Siobhan Hayes]], was introduced in 2002 and left in 2008. The characters of Roger and Alfie were introduced in 2003 and 2005, played by [[Keiron Self]] and [[Rhodri Meilir]].

==Background==
In 1999, Fred Barron was considering producing a British sitcom the same way sitcoms were produced in the U.S. ''My Family'' was to feature a group of writers rather than the standard one or two, something that had been attempted in the UK with shows including ''[[Goodnight Sweetheart (TV series)|Goodnight Sweetheart]]'' and ''[[On the Buses]]'', but was nevertheless atypical. ''My Family'' was consciously designed to have wide appeal, with characters viewers could build a relationship with in the same way as previous BBC sitcom ''[[2point4 Children]]'' which focuses around a similar family unit.

The show chronicles the lives of the Harpers, a fictional middle-class British family who live at 78 Lancaster Road, [[Chiswick]], [[London]]. Dentist Ben and his wife Susan, a tour guide who later works for an art gallery, have three children: Nick, Janey, and Michael, who complicate their lives. Susan is a control freak, but Ben prefers to leave the children to it and stay as uninvolved as possible. Janey later goes to University, but drops out and moves back in later, while Nick finally gets his own place.

Mainly focusing on Ben and Susan, the show featured sub-stories ranging from Nick's harebrained schemes to Abi and Roger's love life. It is described as a "[[dysfunctional family]]"-style sitcom; however, many of the episodes feature the family working together to get one another out of trouble. Nick's bizarre jobs became a major feature of the first four series. After the departure of Nick then more prominence was given to Abi and Roger's love life, Michael's schemes, Janey's endless list of boyfriends, and Alfie's dream of musical stardom.

The show saw considerable development and change in its characters' lives, seeing Janey turn from teenage rebel to mother, Nick turn from prat to responsible prat, Abi marry Roger, and Michael go through and beyond school days. Meanwhile, Ben remained the same self-absorbed dentist, Susan remained the same control freak, and Alfie remained the same dimwitted layabout lodger.

==Cast and characters==
{{Main|List of My Family characters}}
The series featured eight main cast members throughout its run, with numerous characters recurring throughout the 10 series. The main cast members were familiar to television viewers before their roles on ''My Family'', but not all were considered stars. During the tenth series' run, the actors all achieved household-name celebrity status.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The main characters in ''My Family'' are parents Ben and Susan Harper. They have three children, Nick, Janey and Michael.

===Main characters===
*'''[[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]]''' (2000–11) portrays '''[[Ben Harper (My Family)|Ben Harper]]'''. Ben Harper is an overly-[[misanthropy|misanthropic]] and [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] dentist. When he is not at work sacking another assistant or trying to avoid fellow-dentist Roger, he is at home trying to relax (which never works). Ben isn't a bad man; behind his sardonic exterior he does really love his family and has to put up with being bossed about and manipulated by his wife Susan and continually fleeced for money by his children.&lt;ref name="comedy.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/my_family/characters/|title=My Family|work=comedy.org.uk|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Zoë Wanamaker]]''' (2000–11) portrays '''[[Susan Harper (My Family)|Susan Harper]]'''. Susan Harper is a control freak and very good at getting her way. She is constantly worried about her three children and often forces Ben to go out of his way to monitor or look after them. Susan is a [[tour guide]] but seems to spend most of her time at home. She is a terrible [[cooking|cook]]. This is a homage to ''[[Butterflies (TV series)|Butterflies]]'', in which the male lead is also a dentist called Ben and the rest of the family often have to sneak the food she has prepared into the bin without her noticing.
*'''[[Kris Marshall]]''' (2000–05) portrays '''[[Nick Harper (My Family)|Nick Harper]]'''. Nick Harper is the oldest sibling. He is a complete layabout who is constantly changing jobs – a self-employed stuntman one minute, a gorilla-o-gram the next, at one point a sperm-donor. Extremely laid-back, Nick cannot be trusted to look after money or handle important tasks. He was last seen moving into his own flat, and from phone conversations Ben and Susan have with him, he seems to be coping with living on his own.
*'''[[Daniela Denby-Ashe]]''' (2000–02; 2004–11) portrays '''[[Janey Harper]]'''. Fashion-conscious, money-loving, boy-mad Janey spends all her time on the phone, switching boyfriends, or pestering Ben for shopping money. Whilst at [[Manchester University]] (spending yet more of her dad's money) Janey got pregnant. She was expelled and returned home to once again take advantage of her parents. Susan does not seem to mind, as it means she now has [[List of My Family characters#Kenzo Harper|Kenzo Harper]] to look after.&lt;ref name="comedy.org.uk"/&gt;
*'''[[Gabriel Thomson]]''' (2000–11) portrays '''[[Michael Harper (My Family)|Michael Harper]]'''. Michael (or "Mikey" as Ben calls him) is Susan and Ben's youngest, a smart, geeky adolescent. He looks down on his family, thinking he is more sensible than the rest of them put together, and often ends up getting them out of trouble. Since starting university he has experimented with bleached hair and [[piercings]]. In series 10 Michael comes out and tells his family that he is gay; he is relieved when they accept this.
*'''[[Siobhan Hayes]]''' (2002–08) portrays '''[[Abi Harper (My Family)|Abi Harper]]'''. Abi moved into the Harper household in the third series. She is Ben's first cousin once removed, very clumsy and very dim, and often seen telling off Ben or Susan. When she finally realized that Roger was madly in love with her, they married in series seven, but she later left him to become a nun.&lt;ref name="comedy.org.uk"/&gt;
*'''[[Keiron Self]]''' (2002–11) portrays '''[[Roger Bailey (My Family)|Roger Bailey]]'''. Roger is the over-enthusiastic dentist who works in the same building as Ben. He often turns up at the Harper household uninvited and proceeds to unintentionally annoy Ben. For a long [[Period of time|period]] Roger was trying to build up the courage to ask Abi out. They were, after all, ideally suited – like Abi, Roger possesses no common sense and is [[gullible]]. Eventually they did marry but have since split as Abi has decided to become a nun. He's now a part-time policeman as well a dentist.&lt;ref name="comedy.org.uk"/&gt;
*'''[[Rhodri Meilir]]''' (2005–09) portrays '''[[List of My Family characters#Alfie Butts|Alfie Butts]]'''. Alfie is a friend of Nick's who turned up at the Harper household at Christmas 2005. Alfie comes from a small community in Wales which, based on his stories, has some rather backwards traditions. Also, there weren't many girls where he came from, so he savors spending time at the Harpers' and meeting Michael's friends. Most of the family have turned to him at various times for advice. He's a struggling musician who is very laid-back about life despite not having a home or a steady income.&lt;ref name="comedy.org.uk"/&gt; He did not appear in the 2009 Christmas special and was completely absent from the whole of series 10 and 11, with no explanation.
*'''[[Tayler Marshall]]''' (2006–11; character introduced in 2003) portrays '''[[List of My Family characters#Kenzo Harper|Kenzo Harper]]'''. Kenzo is the youngest member of the Harper household, son of Janey, grandson of Ben and Susan and nephew of Michael and Nick. Even at such a young age, he's shown a massive [[intelligence]] which at times even rivals, and at times even beats, Michael's. At the end of series nine, he has done a project about his family and he tells them his teachers want him to see a [[psychologist]]. As portrayed by Tayler Marshall, Kenzo bears a striking resemblance to his uncle Nick (Kris Marshall).&lt;ref&gt;Tayler and Kris Marshall are not related.&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming Kenzo in 2006, Tayler Marshall portrayed a guest at Kenzo's third-birthday party in 2005.

===Other characters===
*'''[[Daisy Donovan]]''' portrays '''Brigitte McKay''', Ben Harper's dental assistant for the entire first series. She was known for her unique way of thinking and living, and often tried to offer Ben and his patients spiritual guidance. She often forgot to take phone messages for Ben and irritated him while he worked. She and Nick appeared to be attracted to each other.
*'''Chloe Bale''' portrays '''Sasha''', Janey's best friend in series 8–11. Storylines focused on the pair getting into trouble (usually instigated by Sasha). She was disliked by Ben, then by Janey until they became friends again.
*'''Maxine''' an [[unseen character]] was Janey's best friend from school. Although she was never seen, it was hinted that Maxine was very much like Janey: popular, and fashion-conscious. Janey once admitted to Susan that she hung out with Maxine because Maxine's alleged "ugliness" made Janey look more beautiful. Janey was also jealous that Maxine's parents treated her with expensive designer labels. It is unknown if they kept in touch.
*'''[[Rosemary Leach]]''' portrays '''Grace Riggs''', Susan Harper's mother, known for her addiction to alcohol, especially [[Martini (cocktail)|martinis]]. She and Susan have a cold relationship, and are locked in a constant psychological battle. Grace has had various boyfriends in the show and was the one who told Ben that Susan was married before she married him. She likes to make Susan feel guilty for not visiting her and often uses deceitful tactics to lure her over. Her own late mother, Mary, owned a highly-successful [[brothel]] in London's West End. She first appeared in series two, played by Avril Elgar and credited as "Rebecca" (although she was not referred to by name in the episode). She did not reappear until Leach took up the role in series four. It was announced in the episode "A Decent Proposal" that she had died.
*'''[[Kevin Bishop]]''' portrays '''Stupid Brian''', Janey's boyfriend in the show's second series when he and Janey were still at school but he was getting into decorating. Although he lived up to the nickname 'Stupid Brian,' he was surprising apt at building a bookshelf for the Harpers' kitchen.
*'''Alex Dawson''' portrays '''Hubert''', Michael's best friend (it's unknown whether they're still in touch). Hubert was known for being very square but very smart. He once created a television remote that could gain 'free' access channels that required PINs for them.
*'''Andy Taylor''' portrays '''Hotel Receptionist''', appearing in five episodes. He appears in different hotels across the country as a hotel receptionist. Each time he encountered the Harper family he became more familiar with their dysfunctional antics. He once suspected that Susan was an escort and that Ben had a mistress.
*'''[[Nickolas Grace]]''' portrays '''Mr. Casey''', the Harpers' next-door neighbour, although he doesn't get along with them. Viewers first met him as a recent widower who had adopted a dog and named her Gemma. He also tried to scam Ben for money after Ben ran over this dog.
*'''[[Rachel Hyde-Harvey]]''' portrays '''Fiona''', Michael's girlfriend throughout the fourth series. She and Michael are caught in bed together but never had sex. They are also caught kissing in the airing cupboard, and in another scene they begin to take their clothes off but Susan is listening and says they should stop.
*'''Nathan Brine''' portrays '''Scott Marsh''' in series 10. Scott is Michael's first boyfriend. In his first appearance, Ben accidentally outed him to his homophobic father and he was forced to leave home. Susan invited him to live at the house, but Michael and Scott moved into a new flat instead. A few episodes later, it was revealed that Scott and Michael had split up, although they got back together in the same episode.

===Guest cast===
''My Family'' has used several actors from various past hit sitcoms, most notably [[David Haig]] from ''[[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|The Thin Blue Line]]'', [[Belinda Lang]] of ''[[2point4 Children]]'', [[Diana Weston]] (Robert Lindsay's former long-term partner) from ''[[The Upper Hand]]'' who portrayed a male-female transsexual named Charlie, [[Pauline Quirke]] of ''[[Birds of a Feather]]'' played a bank robber (whilst her husband in ''Birds of a Feather'' was a bank robber), and [[Sam Kelly]] from ''[[On the Up]]''.

==Series synopses==
{{See also|List of My Family episodes}}

[[File:Peter Capaldi 2009 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Capaldi]] portrays movie-star "Colin Judd" who visits Ben for dental health. Capaldi appeared in episode "[[List of My Family episodes#Series Five (2004)|Dentist To The Stars]]" which is the tenth episode of series five.]]

The '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series One (2000)|first series]]''', Ben, a dentist, and Susan, the worst cook in the world, are certainly loving, caring parents; they just have a problem showing it. Ben seems to be confused as to how much time and money his kids demand from him. Susan has to juggle motherhood, a career, and a husband and hasn't enough time to manage everything, including improving her cooking skills. Nick is always working on his next hair-brained scheme to keep him amused. Janey, like any normal teenage daughter, feels that her parents are seriously embarrassing whilst Michael keeps his head in his books to get away from the noise.

The '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Two (2001)|second series]]''', Ben Harper, husband and father to three different and often difficult children, has spent his working life as a dentist. Just as well as most of his life seems rather like pulling teeth. His wife Susan is usually busy showing foreign tourists around London, a place she knows much better than her own kitchen. Ben and Susan have been married happily enough to have three children. However, Ben has the feeling that most of the time his children seem to speak a different language. Nick (20) has persuaded his parents he would benefit from a gap year to see something of the world, but he has hardly seen anything beyond the confines of the sofa. Janey (17) is into boys, fashion labels (expensive ones), and getting her own way. Michael (14) is the brightest of the trio. He is seriously into computers and not so seriously (yet) into girls.

[[File:Anthony Head Cleveland Vulkon Slayercon cropped.jpg|left|thumb|135px|upright|[[Anthony Head]], portrays Ben's cousin and the father of Abi Harper. Head appeared in episode "[[List of My Family episodes#Series Four (2003)|May the Best Man Win]]", which is the twelfth episode of the fourth series. He appears again in the 2009 Christmas special, played by Nathaniel Parker.]]

In '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Three (2002)|series three]]''', life in the Harper household is as hectic as ever, Janey has left for university but the seriously accident-prone Cousin Abi has moved in. Ben sees this new addition to their home as a threat to the peace and quiet he's wanted throughout his married life, while Susan is happy to have another woman in the house. As for Michael, he is now spending as much time thinking about girls now as his schoolwork. Furthermore, Nick continued to work on his next hair-brained scheme, whether that means starring as Jesus in the local nativity play or dressing up as a drag queen!

In the '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Four (2003)|fourth series]]''', Susan looks forward to the birth of her first grandchild, but dreads being a grandmother. Nick is getting fed up with living in his ghastly flat and trying to think of a way to move back into the family home. The gap between Michael's IQ and the rest of the family's seems to be increasing, but so is his libido. And Abi is still Abi, only more so! As for perennially put-upon Ben, what with a new arrival causing chaos in the surgery, being forced to take tango lessons and being officially declared dead, life is just one long major-league cirsis.

In '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Five (2004)|Series five]]''', Ben and Susan are enjoying some new-found tranquility, Nick has moved into his own flat, Janey is at university and Abi is usually out at evening class. Naturally the peace is not to last! Janey comes back home with baby Kenzo and Michael has been "born again" and is holding Bible study sessions in the living room. With Ben's famous dental patients, Susan's election ambitions and an unheathly obsession with Inspector Morse – not to mention the unlikely perils of house-sitting in a luxury modern apartment – domestic life will soon be back to Harper-Normal. So when Ben and Susan start being nice to each other, it's no wonder Abi's suspicious; they could not be getting a divorce, could they?

[[File:John Barrowman 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Barrowman]], portrays a man called "The Doctor" that Susan begins to fall for at an airport. He appeared in episode "[[List of My Family episodes#Series Nine (2009)|The Guru]]", which is the eighth episode of series nine.]]

In the '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Six (2006)|sixth series]]''', Janey and son Kenzo spend much more time at the Harper house than is good for Ben, and Michael moves from scam to scam with alarming ease. Add to that the ever-so-slowly blossoming of the Abi-Roger romance and the new cuckoo in the nest, wiser-than-he-looks Alfie Butts and the problems multiply. The family's hurdles include Ben joining a secret society (The Brotherhood of the Cockerel), Susan's new job leading her to a dinner date with a new man and an encounter with squatters. In other words, as usual, problems and situations constantly conspire to remind Ben and Susan that "family" is an "F" word.

In the '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Seven (2007)|seventh series]]''', a mystery man arrives asking for Janey – Susan finally discovers the identity of Kenzo's father. Roger and Abi's marriage announcement gives Susan the idea to renew her marriage vows despite protests from Ben. A death in the dentist's chair is not very good for business, but Ben discovers it's not good for his private life either. Michael succeeds in placing the whole family on ''The Weakest Link'', but Anne Robinson raises more difficult questions than might have been expected.

In the '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Eight (2008)|eighth series]]''', love is in the air in the Harper house. Ben is in love with an extremely large television; Janey is in love with a new man; and Michael's current love has announced that she is pregnant. Meanwhile, Ben and Susan's credit-card statement highlights each of their secret vices, and an armed robbery at the local bank leads to Ben and Janey being taken as hostages. Michael and Alfie investigate the world of internet dating with mixed results, and Abi realises her true vocation in life is to become a nun!

In '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Nine (2009)|series nine]]''', chaos, paranoia and misunderstanding – yes, it's life as usual in the Harper household. Ben stands up to – and gets put down by – his own school bully and gets a little jealous as a rich businessman falls for Susan – or is that Janey? There are new worries as they discover that Michael's seeing a therapist and Ben fails his retraining exam – and, while the family is divided over mean Uncle Norris' inheritance and the acquisition of a puppy, Ben's delighted to discover he's the inspiration for a wealthy if unhappy, celebrity dentist!

In the '''[[List of My Family episodes|tenth series]]''', in the second episode ("The Son'll Come Out") Michael comes out as gay to his parents, first to his father after coming home drunk, then later to his mother. He then tells them that he has been in a relationship with a guy for some time, 25-year-old solicitor Scott Marsh, who later moves into the Harper residence, though he is later seen in gay clubs picking up guys and giving out his number, suggesting that he and Scott have broken up, but they later get back together. These consist of a nine-part tenth series and a seven-part eleventh series.

Finally, in the '''[[List of My Family episodes|eleventh series]]''', Ben and Susan trial separating following some extensive humiliation of each other! Michael wrestles with taking care of Kenzo and Janey's fed up with being a grown up... At last, Roger is back on the dating scene but with Ben suddenly becoming attached to his sworn enemy, he might find it more difficult than he expects. Susan is back to her career and in classic Harper style, she's going after her boss from day one!

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of My Family episodes}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:My Family.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''My Family'' title card from the third series. (2002)|{{deletable image-caption|1=Monday, 12 October 2009}}]] --&gt;
The first episode aired on 19 September 2000, and ten series have so far been aired with seven specials, including nine Christmas specials. The eleventh series began airing on Friday 17 June 2011. A [[Comic Relief]] special short-episode has also aired.

The BBC and UKTV refuse to re-broadcast the series four episode "Blind Justice", due to the receipt of 4 complaints (from a viewing public of 12m). Although no reason was given, as this was not subject to any Ofcom procedure, it is likely that was considered offensive to blind people. This episode is banned from British TV, but it is still on the series four UK DVD release and has been screened on [[BBC America]].

The episodes are recorded in front of a live audience in [[Pinewood Studios]], [[Iver]], Buckinghamshire, except where the set used is too large, this is then filmed, and played out to an invited audience 'as-live'. Also, the show, unlike most British sitcoms but in common with most American television comedies, has no location footage. Scenes taking place outdoors were actually sets.

The series is scripted by a team of writers, following the American model. Historically, British sitcoms were more generally written by one or two writers. By employing a wider number of writers to brainstorm jokes for each episode, DLT Entertainment UK Ltd, the production company, has been able to maintain a consistent and relatively long-lived product without having to wait for a single writer to produce more material.

===Opening sequence===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MyFamilyopeningtitles2007.png|thumb|right|205px|''My Family'' title card from the seventh (2007) and eight (2008) series.]] --&gt;
At the start of the first two series, it slides across four boxes with each character's face in them. The first box stands alone with Ben and Susan in it. The other three are lapped over each other with a photo of Michael, Janey and Nick from left to right in them. While it slides across at the start, each character's face turns with Janey and Nick smiling and the others being fairly plain faced. Once the boxes are placed, the boxes with youngsters in them drop to the bottom of the screen and are replaced with the show's logo.

At the start of the third series, four rectangle blocks fall onto a completely white screen to create Ben's face. Those blocks are then replaced with blocks that create Susan's face; each block then shows different parts of the other characters to finally reveal Nick's face. It continues to do this for Janey, Michael and (starting from the fourth episode entitled "Of Mice and Ben") the new character to the show Abi. Abi's (for the first three episodes, Michael's) face then falls into the bottom right corner while the previous faces spread across to other places of the white screen. It reveals that Nick, Janey and Michael are next to Abi and Ben and Susan are with each other at the top left of the screen.  The logo fades on the top right of the screen.

The fourth series is similar to the third series opening sequence.  Only difference is that the photo of each character is changed, each block does not show different parts of each character when it transitions; instead it transitions in various styles, for example in an opening in a window blind style. Series five titles still remain similar; the photos are changed again and there are eleven rectangles instead of four. Nick is almost completely absent from the opening titles in series five except in episode six of series five titled "My Will Be Done"; he was missing in some episodes from series four and a few from series three.

The series six opening titles have cut-outs of each character, as they fade into the white screen and zoom in and out and eventually stop moving. The line-up from left to right is Abi, Michael, Susan, Ben, Janey and Roger. The titles remain the same for series seven and eight; the one difference is that Janey's clothes are changed. In series nine, the line-up changes due to Abi's departure at the end of the previous series. Her place is taken by Alfie, who has been a regular since series six but never appeared in the titles until the ninth series. Starting in the 2009 Christmas Special, Alfie has been replaced by Kenzo.

==Writers==
The first writer of My Family was its creator, [[Fred Barron (producer)|Fred Barron]] with British writer, [[Penny Croft]]. Barron wrote eight episodes up until the fourth series. Other major writers include James Hendrie and Ian Brown who wrote numerous episodes, including the first episode together up until the 2004 Christmas Special.  Steven and Jim Armogida are the only writers to remain on the show throughout its run.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Myfamily ben susan.jpg|thumb|right|212px|Robert Lindsay and Zoë Wanamaker as Ben and Susan.]] --&gt;Writers such as  Sophie Hetherington, Georgia Pritchett, James Cary and Tess Morris have all written at least one episode for the sitcom at one point. None of these writers have written more than five episodes. Andrea Solomons has written many episodes for My Family, she wrote from the second series to the sixth series. Meanwhile, Darin Henry has written one episode for the fifth series before returning for the eighth series onwards.

Paul Minett and Brian Leveson are the sitcom's current main writers. Credited for most of the specials, at least three episodes from every series since 2005. Bert-Tyler Moore and George Jeffrie both have written a few episodes for the sitcom in its sixth and seventh series and returned for series ten. Tom Leopold wrote two episodes for the sixth series only. Tom Anderson, currently ''My Family's'' executive producer and [[showrunner]], wrote his first episode for series seven and wrote until series ten, but remained showrunner for series eleven. Ed Dyson and David Cantor have written episodes for the seventh, eighth, ninth and eleventh series. Table correct as of episode 120.

==Reception==
Initially, the show received a poor critical response, and many dismissed its humour as mundane and dated. In spite of this, the programme received above average audience ratings, and further series were commissioned, with critical approval gradually improving as the series progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leigh Holmwood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/27/bbc.television |title=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |date= 27 March 2008|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Dessau, writing on the 100th episode, noted that it was a comedy that "the critics hate, but the public love", on the basis of ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sam Coates and Jenny Booth Updated 14 minutes ago |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6221021.ece |title=The Times May 5, 2009 |publisher=Entertainment.timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoë Wanamaker said in 2007 that she was no longer happy with the quality of the writing, claiming she and co-star Robert Lindsay even refused to film one episode because it was so poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a44676/wanamaker-criticises-my-family.html|title=Wanamaker criticises "My Family"|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=31 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, the two stars revealed they were still unhappy with the writing quality, with Lindsay stating "There's some real dross (in the scripts) and we're aware of it". He later admitted that the eleventh series might be the last stating "As far as Zoë (Wanamaker) and I are concerned, we will do a tenth series of 16 episodes, which the BBC will probably split into a tenth and eleventh, then that will be it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/my_family/about/ My Family - Article - British Comedy Guide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the show came 24th in ''[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]''.

==Cancellation==
[[BBC One]] controller [[Danny Cohen (television executive)|Danny Cohen]], when commenting on the decision to axe the series, said "Now that all the Harper children have flown the nest we feel it's time to make room for new comedies". [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]] said in an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'': "I'm amazed by the public's love for the series [...] When [[Kris Marshall]] left in 2005 I was convinced that was it. But somehow Zoë and I have kept the essence of it together."&lt;ref name="My Family dropped after 11 years"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12859085 My Family dropped after 11 years] BBC News, 25 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Op art''', short for '''optical art''', is a style of visual [[art]] that uses [[optical illusion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Artspeak, Robert Atkins, {{ISBN|978-1-55859-127-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Op art works are abstract, with many better known pieces created in black and white. Typically, they give the viewer the impression of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibrating patterns, or of swelling or warping.

== History ==
[[File:Francis Picabia, c. 1921-22, Optophone I, encre, aquarelle et mine de plomb sur papier, 72 x 60 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Picabia]], c. 1921–22, ''Optophone I'', encre, aquarelle et mine de plomb sur papier, 72 × 60 cm. Reproduced in Galeries Dalmau, ''Picabia'', exhibition catalogue, Barcelona, November 18 – December 8, 1922.]]
[[Image:Soto Sphere.jpg|thumb|alt=Daytime photo of sky, mountains, vegetation, a billboard, and, in the center of the image, poles with an orange circle in the center|[[Jesús Soto]], Caracas]]
The antecedents of op art, in terms of graphic and color effects, can be traced back to [[Neo-impressionism]], [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Dada]].&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10139|title=The Collection - MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time Magazine'' coined the term ''op art'' in 1964, in response to [[Julian Stanczak]]'s show ''Optical Paintings at the Martha Jackson Gallery'', to mean a form of abstract art (specifically non-objective art) that uses optical illusions.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Borgzinner. "Op Art", ''Time'', October 23, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/op-art.htm|title=Op-Art: History, Characteristics|website=www.Visual-Arts-Cork.com|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works now described as "op art" had been produced for several years before ''Time's'' 1964 article. For instance, [[Victor Vasarely]]'s painting ''Zebras'' (1938) is made up entirely of [[curvature|curvilinear]] black and white stripes not contained by contour lines. Consequently, the stripes appear to both meld into and burst forth from the surrounding background. Also, the early black and white "dazzle" panels that [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]] installed at the ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'' exhibit in 1956 and his ''Pandora'' series at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in 1962 demonstrate proto-op art tendencies. [[Martin Gardner]] featured op Art and its relation to mathematics in his July 1965 [[Mathematical Games column]] in ''Scientific American''. In Italy, [[Franco Grignani]], who originally trained as an architect, became a leading force of graphic design where op art or [[kinetic art]] was central. His Woolmark logo (launched in Britain in 1964) is probably the most famous of all his designs.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
[[Image:Hungary pecs - vasarely0.jpg|thumb|An [[optical illusion]] by the Hungarian-born artist [[Victor Vasarely]] in [[Pécs]]]]

Op art perhaps more closely derives from the [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] practices of the [[Bauhaus]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} This German school, founded by [[Walter Gropius]], stressed the relationship of form and function within a framework of analysis and rationality. Students learned to focus on the overall design or entire composition to present unified works. Op art also stems from [[trompe-l'œil]] and [[anamorphosis]]. Links with psychological research have also been made, particularly with [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt theory]] and [[psychophysiology]].&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; When the Bauhaus was forced to close in 1933, many of its instructors fled to the United States. There, the movement took root in [[Chicago]] and eventually at the [[Black Mountain College]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], where [[Anni Albers|Anni]] and [[Josef Albers]] eventually taught. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Op artists thus managed to exploit various phenomena," writes Popper, "the after-image and consecutive movement; line interference; the effect of dazzle; ambiguous figures and reversible perspective; successive colour contrasts and chromatic vibration; and in three-dimensional works different viewpoints and the superimposition of elements in space."&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1955, for the exhibition « Mouvements » at the [[Denise René]] gallery in Paris, Victor Vasarely and [[Pontus Hulten]] promoted in their "Yellow manifesto" some new kinetic expressions based on optical and luminous phenomenon as well as painting illusionism. The expression ''[[Kinetic art#Apparent Movement and Op Art|kinetic art]]'' in this modern form first appeared at the [[Museum für Gestaltung]] of [[Zürich]] in 1960, and found its major developments in the 1960s. In most European countries, it generally includes the form of optical art that mainly makes use of [[optical illusion]]s, like op art, as well as art based on movement represented by [[Yacov Agam]], [[Carlos Cruz-Diez]], [[Jesús Rafael Soto]], [[Gregorio Vardanega]] or [[Nicolas Schöffer]]. From 1961 to 1968, the ''[[Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel]]'' (GRAV) founded by [[François Morellet]], [[Julio Le Parc]], [[Francisco Sobrino]], Horacio Garcia Rossi, [[Yvaral]], Joël Stein and [[Vera Molnár]] was a collective group of opto-kinetic artists that—according to its 1963 manifesto—appealed to the direct participation of the public with an influence on its behaviour, notably through the use of interactive [[labyrinth]]s.

Some members of the group [[Nouvelle tendance]] (1961–1965) in Europe also were engaged in op art as Almir Mavignier and [[Gerhard von Graevenitz]], mainly with their serigraphics. They studied optical illusions. The term ''op'' irritated many of the artists labeled under it, specifically including Albers and Stanczak. They had discussed upon the birth of the term a better label, namely ''perceptual art''.&lt;ref&gt;Bertholf. "Julian Stanczak: Decades of Light" Yale Press&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964, Arnold Schmidt ([[Arnold Alfred Schmidt]]) had several solo exhibitions of his large, black and white shaped optical paintings exhibited at the [[Terrain Gallery]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terraingallery.org/Some-History.html|title=A Brief History of the Terrain Gallery|website=TerrainGallery.org|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Responsive Eye'' ===
In 1965, between February 23 and April 25, an exhibition called ''The Responsive Eye'', created by William C. Seitz, was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City and toured to St Louis, Seattle, Pasadena and Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seitz|first1=William C.|title=The Responsive Eye (exhibition catalog)|date=1965|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|location=New York|url=http://ubu.com/historical/responsive/ResponsiveEyeMOMA1965.pdf|access-date=January 23, 2016|oclc=644787547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=February 25, 1965|title=The Responsive Eye|url=https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/3439/releases/MOMA_1965_0015_14.pdf?2010|location= New York|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|agency= |access-date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works shown were wide-ranging, encompassing the minimalism of [[Frank Stella]] and [[Ellsworth Kelly]], the smooth plasticity of [[Alexander Liberman]], the collaborative efforts of the [[Anonima group]], alongside the well-known  [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Wen-Ying Tsai]], [[Bridget Riley]] and [[Getulio Alviani]]. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships.
[[File:Wen-Ying Tsai, "Super-imposed Painting- Random Field," 1963.jpg|thumb|[[Wen-Ying Tsai]], "Super-imposed Painting: Random Field" (1963)]]
The exhibition was enormously popular with the general public (the attendance was over 180,000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Gordon Hyatt]] (writer and producer), [[Mike Wallace]] (presenter)|date=1965|title=The Responsive Eye|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSVQqJo0Pmk|medium=Television production|publisher=Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.}} (Available on YouTube in three sections.)&lt;/ref&gt; though less so with the critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2006/02/moma_1965_the_r.php|title=MoMA 1965: The Responsive Eye|website=CoolHunting.com|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics dismissed op art as portraying nothing more than ''trompe-l'œil'', or tricks that fool the eye.  Regardless, op art's popularity with the public increased, and op art images were used in a number of commercial contexts. One of [[Brian de Palma]]'s early works was a documentary film on the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people= [[Brian De Palma]] (director)|date=1966|title=The Responsive Eye|url=http://ubu.com/film/depalma_responsive.html|medium=Motion picture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method of operation ==

=== Black-and-white and the figure-ground relationship ===
Op art is a perceptual experience related to how vision functions. It is a dynamic visual art that stems from a discordant [[figure–ground (perception)|figure-ground]] relationship that puts the two planes—foreground and background—in a tense and contradictory juxtaposition.  Artists create op art in two primary ways. The first, best known method, is to create effects through pattern and line.  Often these paintings are [[black-and-white]], or otherwise [[grisaille]]—as in Bridget Riley's famous painting, ''Current'' (1964), on the cover of ''The Responsive Eye'' catalogue. Here, black and white wavy lines are close to one another on the canvas surface, creating a volatile figure-ground relationship. [[Getulio Alviani]] used aluminum surfaces, which he treated to create light patterns that change as the watcher moves (vibrating texture surfaces).  Another reaction that occurs is that the lines create after-images of certain colors due to how the retina receives and processes light. As [[Goethe]] demonstrates in his treatise ''[[Theory of Colours]]'', at the edge where light and dark meet, color arises because lightness and darkness are the two central properties in the creation of color.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

=== Color ===
Beginning in 1965 [[Bridget Riley]] began to produce color-based op art;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFuXfLYqQVsC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA147&amp;dq=op+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=RA1-PA147#v=onepage&amp;q=op+art&amp;f=false|title=After Modern Art 1945-2000|first=David|last=Hopkins|date=September 14, 2000|publisher=OUP Oxford|page=147|access-date=November 5, 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, other artists, such as [[Julian Stanczak]] and [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], were always interested in making color the primary focus of their work.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Color Function Painting: The Art of Josef Albers, Julian Stanczak and Richard Anuszkiewicz'' Wake Forest University, reprinted 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josef Albers]] taught these two primary practitioners of the "Color Function" school at [[Yale]] in the 1950s. Often, colorist work is dominated by the same concerns of figure-ground movement, but they have the added element of contrasting colors that produce different effects on the eye.  For instance, in Anuszkiewicz's "temple" paintings, the juxtaposition of two highly contrasting colors provokes a sense of depth in illusionistic three-dimensional space so that it appears as if the architectural shape is invading the viewer's space.
[[Image:Intrinsic-Harmony.jpg|thumb|210px|''Intrinsic Harmony'', by Richard Anuszkiewicz, 1965]]

==== Color interaction ====
{{Quote|text=There are three major classes of the interaction of color: ''simultaneous contrast, successive contrast, and reverse contrast (or assimilation)''. (i) Simultaneous contrast may take place when one area of color is surrounded by another area of a different color. In general, contrast enhances the difference in brightness and/or color between the interacting areas ... Such contrast effects are mutual, but if the surround area is larger and more intense than the area it encloses, then the contrast is correspondingly out of balance, and may appear to be exerted in one direction only. (ii) In successive contrast, first one color is viewed and then another. This may be achieved either by fixing the eye steadily on one color and then quickly replacing that color with another, or by shifting fixation from one color to another. (iii) In reverse contrast (sometimes called the assimilation of color or the spreading effect) the lightness of white or the darkness of black may seem to spread into neighbouring regions. Similarly, colors may appear to spread into or become assimilated into neighbouring areas. All effects tend to make neighbouring areas appear more alike, rather than to enhance their differences as in the more familiar simultaneous contrast, hence the term reverse contrast (Jameson and Hurvich). Note that in the interaction of color the constituent colors retain much of the own identity even though they may be altered somewhat by contrast.|sign=Floyd Ratliff|source=The Theory of Color and the Practice of Painting&lt;ref&gt;Floyd Ratliff. "The Theory of Color and the Practice of Painting," in 'Color Function Painting: The Art of [[Josef Albers]], [[Julian Stanczak]] and [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]]', [[Wake Forest University]], 1996, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Photographic op art ==
Although being relatively mainstream, photographers have been slow to produce op art. In painting, [[Victor Vasarely]] and [[Bridget Riley]] were producing large amounts of art and the same can be said for many [[digital art]]ists, such as [[Akiyoshi Kitaoka]]. One of the primary reasons for the lack of photographers doing op art, is the difficulty in finding effective subject matter. [[László Moholy-Nagy]] produced photographic op art and taught the subject in the [[Bauhaus]]. One of his lessons consisted of making his students produce holes in cards and then photographing them.

[[File:Darwin's Pangenesis.svg|thumb|upright=2|[[Charles Darwin]]'s pangenesis theory postulated that every part of the body emits tiny particles called gemmules which migrate to the [[gonad]]s and are transferred to offspring. Gemmules were thought to develop into their associated body parts as offspring matures. The theory implied that changes to the body during an organism's life would be inherited, as proposed in [[Lamarckism]].]]

'''Pangenesis''' was [[Charles Darwin]]'s hypothetical mechanism for [[heredity]], in which he proposed that each part of the body continually emitted its own type of small organic particles called '''gemmules''' that aggregated in the [[gonad]]s, contributing heritable information to the [[gamete]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holterhoff, Kate |date=2014 |title=The History and Reception of Charles Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=47 |pages=661–695 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9377-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented this 'provisional hypothesis' in his 1868 work ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', intending it to fill what he perceived as a major gap in evolutionary theory at the time. The etymology of the word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''pan'' (a prefix meaning "whole", "encompassing") and ''genesis'' ("birth") or ''genos'' ("origin"). Pangenesis mirrored ideas originally formulated by [[Hippocrates]] and other pre-Darwinian scientists, but built off of new concepts such as [[cell theory]], explaining cell development as beginning with gemmules which were specified to be necessary for the occurrence of new growths in an organism, both in initial development and regeneration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|last=de Beer|first=Gavin|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|year=1965|isbn=|location=Garden City, New York|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also accounted for [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] and the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] concept of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, as a body part altered by the environment would produce altered gemmules. This made Pangenesis popular among the neo-Lamarckian school of evolutionary thought.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This hypothesis was made effectively obsolete after the 1900 rediscovery among [[biologist]]s of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theory of the [[Mendelian inheritance|particulate nature of inheritance]].

==Early history==

Pangenesis was similar to ideas put forth by [[Hippocrates]], [[Democritus]] and other pre-Darwinian scientists in proposing that the whole of parental organisms participate in heredity (thus the prefix ''pan'').&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zirkle | first1 = Conway | authorlink = Conway Zirkle | year = 1935 | title = The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis | url = | journal = [[The American Naturalist]] | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 417–445 | doi=10.1086/280617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin wrote that Hippocrates' pangenesis was "almost identical with mine—merely a change of terms—and an application of them to classes of facts necessarily unknown to the old philosopher."&lt;ref name="Deichmann 2010"&gt;Deichmann, Ute. (2010). ''Darwinism, Philosophy, and Experimental Biology''. Springer. pp. 41-42. {{ISBN|978-90-481-9901-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science historian [[Conway Zirkle]] wrote that:

{{quote|The hypothesis of pangenesis is as old as the belief in the inheritance of acquired characters. It was endorsed by [[Hippocrates]], [[Democritus]], [[Galen]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Lactantius]], [[St. Isidore of Seville]], [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]], [[St. Albert the Great]], [[St. Thomas of Aquinas]], [[Pietro de' Crescenzi|Peter of Crescentius]], [[Paracelsus]], [[Jerome Cardan]], [[Levinus Lemnius]], [[Nicolas Venette|Venette]], [[John Ray]], [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]], [[Charles Bonnet|Bonnet]], [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertius]], [[Albrecht von Haller|von Haller]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Zirkle demonstrated that the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics had become fully accepted by the 16th century and remained immensely popular through to the time of Lamarck's work, at which point it began to draw more criticism due to lack of hard evidence.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; He also stated that pangenesis was the only scientific explanation ever offered for this concept, developing from Hippocrates' belief that "the semen was derived from the whole body."&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; In the 13th century, pangenesis was commonly accepted on the principle that semen was a refined version of food unused by the body, which eventually translated to 15th and 16th century widespread use of pangenetic principles in medical literature, especially in gynecology.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; Later pre-Darwinian important applications of the idea included hypotheses about the origin of the differentiation of races.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt;

A theory put forth by [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] in 1745 called for particles from both parents governing the attributes of the child, although some historians have called his remarks on the subject cursory and vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |date=1981 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674364462 |pages=328, 646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|last=de Beer|first=Gavin|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|year=1965|isbn=|location=Garden City, New York|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749, French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] developed a hypothetical system of heredity much like Darwin's pangenesis, wherein 'organic molecules' were transferred to offspring during reproduction and stored in the body during development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hull, David L. (1988). ''Science as a Process: An Evolutionary Account of the Social and Conceptual Development of Science''. University of Chicago Press. p. 86. {{ISBN|0-226-36051-2}} "As Darwin was to discover many years later, Buffon had devised a system of heredity not all that different from his own theory of pangenesis."&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on Buffon's views, Darwin stated, "If Buffon had assumed that his organic molecules had been formed by each separate unit throughout the body, his view and mine would have been very closely similar."&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"/&gt;

In 1801, [[Erasmus Darwin]] advocated a hypothesis of pangenesis in the third edition of his book ''[[Zoonomia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Deichmann, Ute. (2010). ''Darwinism, Philosophy, and Experimental Biology''. Springer. p. 42. {{ISBN|978-90-481-9901-3}} "Among the other authors were Buffon, who proposes "organic molecules" with affinities to various organs, and, in particular, Erasmus Darwin, who in 1801 anticipated his grandson's concept of pangenesis, suggesting that small particles were given off by parts of the bodies of both parents; and that they are circulated in the blood, ending in the sexual organs from where they could be combined during reproduction in order to form the nucleus of an offspring."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1809, [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] in his ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'' put forth evidence for the idea that characteristics acquired during the lifetime of an organism, either from effects of the environment or  may be passed on to the offspring.  Charles Darwin first had significant contact with [[Lamarckism]] during his time at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] in the late 1820s, both through [[Robert Edmond Grant]], whom he assisted in research, and in Erasmus's journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=E.

In 1861, Irish physician [[Henry Freke]] developed a variant of pangenesis in his book ''Origin of Species by Means of Organic Affinity''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Macalister|Macalister, Alexander]]. (1870). ''Reviews and Bibliographical Notices''. In ''[[Irish Journal of Medical Science|Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science]], Volume 50''. Fannin and Company. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Freke proposed that all life was developed from microscopic organic agents which he named ''granules'', which existed as 'distinct species of organizing matter' and would develop into different biological structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a944AAAAMAAJ&amp;rdid=book-a944AAAAMAAJ&amp;rdot=1|title=On the origin of species by means of organic affinity|last=Freke|first=Henry|date=1861|publisher=Longman and Co.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, four years before the publication of ''Variation'', [[Herbert Spencer]] in his book ''Principles of Biology'' proposed a theory of "physiological units" similar to Darwin's gemmules, which likewise were said to be related to specific body parts and responsible for the transmission of characteristics of those body parts to offspring.&lt;ref name="Deichmann 2010"/&gt; He also supported the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] idea of transmission of acquired characteristics.

Darwin had debated whether to publish a theory of heredity for an extended period of time due to its highly speculative nature. He decided to include pangenesis in ''Variation'' after sending a 30 page manuscript to his close friend and supporter [[Thomas Huxley]] in May 1865, which was met by significant criticism from Huxley that made Darwin even more hesitant.&lt;ref name="Geison69" /&gt; However, Huxley eventually advised Darwin to publish, writing: "Somebody rummaging among your papers half a century hence will find Pangenesis &amp; say 'See this wonderful anticipation of our modern Theories—and that stupid ass, Huxley, prevented his publishing them'"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-4875.html | title = Letter 4875 – Huxley, T. H. to Darwin, C. R., 16 July (1865) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's initial version of pangenesis appeared in the first edition of ''Variation'' in 1868, and was later reworked for the publication of a second edition in 1875.

==Theory==

=== Darwin ===
Darwin's pangenesis theory attempted to explain the process of [[sexual reproduction]], inheritance of traits, and complex [[developmental biology|developmental]] phenomena such as cellular [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] in a unified mechanistic structure.&lt;ref name="Geison69"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Geison | first1=G.

When passed on to offspring via the reproductive process, gemmules were thought to be responsible for developing into each part of an organism and expressing characteristics inherited from both parents.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Darwin thought this to occur in a literal sense: he explained cell proliferation to progress as gemmules to bind to more developed cells of their same character and mature. In this sense, the uniqueness of each individual would be due to their unique mixture of their parents’ gemmules, and therefore characters.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Similarity to one parent over the other could be explained by a quantitative superiority of one parent's gemmules.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|date=May 2008|title=A new perspective on Darwin’s Pangenesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2008.00036.x|journal=Biological Reviews|language=en|volume=83|issue=2|pages=141–149|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.2008.00036.x|issn=1464-7931|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yongshen Lu points out that Darwin knew of cells' ability to multiply by self-division, so it is unclear how Darwin supposed the two proliferation mechanisms to relate to each other.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He did clarify in a later statement that he had always supposed gemmules to only bind to and proliferate from developing cells, not mature ones.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-6442.xml;query=gemmule;brand=default|title=To Scientific Opinion|last=Darwin|first=Charles|date=October 20, 1869|work=Darwin Correspondence Project|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin hypothesized that gemmules might be able to survive and multiply outside of the body in a letter to J.

[[File:Gemmule cell proliferation (pangenesis).jpg|thumb|right|350px|Darwin's description of cell proliferation using pangenesis theory in ''The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication'']]

Some gemmules were thought to remain dormant for generations, whereas others were routinely expressed by all offspring. Every child was built up from selective expression of the mixture of the parents and grandparents' gemmules coming from either side. Darwin likened this to gardening: a flowerbed could be sprinkled with seeds "most of which soon germinate, some lie for a period dormant, whilst others perish."{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=276}} He did not claim gemmules were in the blood, although his theory was often interpreted in this way. Responding to [[Fleming Jenkin]]'s review of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', he argued that pangenesis would permit the preservation of some favourable variations in a population so that they wouldn't die out through blending.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=283}}

Darwin thought that environmental effects that caused altered characteristics would lead to altered gemmules for the affected body part. The altered gemmules would then have a chance of being transferred to offspring, since they were assumed to be produced throughout an organisms life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, pangenesis theory allowed for the Lamarckian idea of transmission of characteristics acquired through use and disuse. Accidental gemmule development in incorrect parts of the body could explain deformations and the 'monstrosities' Darwin cited in ''Variation''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== De Vries ===
[[Hugo de Vries]] characterized his own version of pangenesis theory in his 1889 book ''Intracellular Pangenesis'' with two propositions, of which he only accepted the first:

:I. In the cells there are numberless particles which differ from each other, and represent the individual cells, organs, functions and qualities of the whole individual. These particles are much larger than the chemical molecules and smaller than the smallest known organisms; yet they are for the most part comparable to the latter, because, like them, they can divide and multiply through nutrition and growth. They are transmitted, during cell-division, to the daughter-cells: this is the ordinary process of heredity.
:II. In addition to this, the cells of the organism, at every stage of development, throw off such particles, which are conducted to the germ-cells and transmit to them those characters which the respective cells may have acquired during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Vries|first=Hugo|title=Intracellular Pangenesis|url=http://www.esp.org/books/devries/pangenesis/facsimile/|accessdate=May 2, 2015|date=1910|origyear=1889|page=63|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vries also coined the term 'pangene' which 20 years later was shortened by [[Wilhelm Johannsen]] to [[gene]].

=== Other variants ===
Science historian [[E. Janet Browne|Janet Browne]] points out that while [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Carl von Nägeli]] also put forth ideas for systems of inheritance involving gemmules, their version of gemmules differed in that it contained "a complete microscopic blueprint for an entire creature."{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=281}} Spencer published his theory of "physiological units" three years prior to Darwin's publication of ''Variation''.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt;

She goes on to say that Darwin believed specifically in gemmules for each body part because they might explain how environmental effects could be passed on as characteristics to offspring.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=281}}

Interpretations and applications of pangenesis continued to appear frequently in medical literature up until [[August Weismann|Weismann's]] experiments and subsequent publication on germ-plasm theory in 1892.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; For instance, an address by Huxley spurred on substantial work by Dr. James Ross in linking ideas found in Darwin's pangenesis to the [[germ theory of disease]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Graft Theory of Disease: Being an Application of Mr. Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis to the Explanation of the Phenomena of the Zymotic Diseases|last=Ross|first=James|publisher=Lindsay and Blakiston|year=1872|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross cites the work of both Darwin and Spencer as key to his application of pangenetic theory.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Collapse ==

=== Galton's experiments on rabbits ===
Darwin's half-cousin [[Francis Galton]] conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to refute Charles Darwin's hypothetical theory of pangenesis. In consultation with Darwin, he set out to see if gemmules were transported in the blood.  In a long series of experiments from 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring. He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bulmer|2003|pp=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Galton|Galton]] was troubled because he began the work in good faith, intending to prove Darwin right, and having praised pangenesis in ''Hereditary Genius'' in 1869. Cautiously, he criticized his cousin’s theory, although qualifying his remarks by saying that Darwin's gemmules, which he called "pangenes," might be temporary inhabitants of the blood that his experiments had failed to pick up.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=291–292}}

Darwin challenged the validity of Galton's experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in ''Nature'' where he wrote:&lt;ref name=Darwin1871&gt;{{cite journal |author=Darwin, Charles R. |authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=27 April 1871 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1751&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=1 |title=Pangenesis |journal=Nature. A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Science |volume=3 |pages=502–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Now, in the chapter on Pangenesis in my ''Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,'' I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any circulating system. It is, indeed, obvious that the presence of gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood." He goes on to admit: "Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.&lt;ref name=Darwin1871/&gt;}}

After the circulation of Galton's results, the perception of pangenesis quickly changed to severe skepticism if not outright disbelief.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Weismann ===
[[File:Weismann's Germ Plasm.svg|thumb|[[August Weismann]]'s [[germ plasm]] theory. The hereditary material, the germ plasm, is confined to the gonads. Somatic cells (of the body) develop afresh in each generation from the germ plasm. The implied [[Weismann barrier]] between the germ line and the soma prevents Lamarckian inheritance.|270x270px]]

[[August Weismann]]'s idea, set out in his 1892 book ''Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung'' (The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/weismann_keimplasma_1892|title=Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung|author=Weismann, August|date=1892|publisher=Fischer|location=Jena|trans-title=The Germ Plasm: A theory of inheritance}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that the hereditary material, which he called the [[germ plasm]], and the rest of the body (the [[Somatic (biology)|soma]]) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. This distinction is commonly referred to as the [[Weismann barrier|Weismann Barrier]]. If correct, this made Darwin's pangenesis wrong and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails across multiple generations, was proposed as a proof of the non-existence of Lamarckian inheritance, although Peter Gauthier has argued that [[Weismann's experiment]] showed only that injury did not affect the germ plasm and neglected to test the effect of Lamarckian use and disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gauthier|first=Peter|date=March–May 1990|title=Does Weismann's Experiment Constitute a Refutation of the Lamarckian Hypothesis?|journal=BIOS|volume=61|pages=6–8|jstor=4608123|number=1/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weismann argued strongly and dogmatically for Darwinism and against neo-Lamarckism, polarising opinions among other scientists.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40193707|title=Neo-Lamarckism and the evolution controversy in France, 1870-1920|last=1940-|first=Persell, Stuart Michael,|date=1999|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=077348275X|location=Lewiston, NY|oclc=40193707}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to [[Eclipse of Darwinism|its eclipse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution: The History of an Idea|last=Bowler|first=Peter J.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-520-23693-6|edition=3rd completely rev. and expanded|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=253–256|authorlink=Peter J.

Darwin's pangenesis theory was widely criticised, in part for its [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] premise that parents could [[inheritance of acquired characters|pass on traits acquired]] in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|last2=Li|first2=Xiuju|date=2014-09-23|title=Has Darwin's Pangenesis Been Rediscovered?|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/64/11/1037/2754242|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=64|issue=11|pages=1037–1041|doi=10.1093/biosci/biu151|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the neo-Lamarckians of the time seized upon pangenesis as evidence to support their case.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Italian Botanist Federico Delpino's objection that gemmules' ability to self-divide is contrary to their supposedly innate nature gained considerable traction; however, Darwin was dismissive of this criticism, remarking that the particulate agents of small pox and scarlet fever seem to have such characteristics.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lamarckism fell from favour after [[August Weismann]]'s research in the 1880s indicated that changes from use (such as lifting weights to increase muscle mass) and disuse (such as being lazy and becoming weak) were not heritable.&lt;ref name="ImaginaryLamarck"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.textbookleague.org/ |title=The Textbook Letter |last=Ghiselin |first=Michael T. |publisher=The Textbook League |publication-date=September–October 1994 |contribution=Nonsense in schoolbooks: 'The Imaginary Lamarck' |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin |accessdate=2008-01-23 |contribution-url=http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q |title=A History of the Life Sciences |last=Magner |first=Lois N. |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]], [[CRC Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-203-91100-6 |edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scientists continued to voice their support  in spite of Galton's and Weismann's results: notably, in 1900 Karl Pearson wrote that pangenesis "is no more disproved by the statement that ‘gemmules have not been found in the blood,’ than the atomic theory is disproved by the fact that no atoms have been found in the air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=PSwRAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=The+Grammar+of+Science&amp;ots=T5EHpFM1SO&amp;sig=1AasXoTNJ_snuqbDZwDknU7ilks#v=snippet&amp;q=atomic%20theory&amp;f=false|title=The Grammar of Science|last=Pearson|first=Karl|publisher=Adam and Charles Black|year=1900|isbn=9785877362529|location=London|pages=335|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the rediscovery of Mendel's Laws of Inheritance in 1900 led to pangenesis being fully set aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Beer|first1=Gavin|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|date=1965|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|location=Garden City, NY|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Huxley has observed that the later discovery of [[chromosome]]s and the research of [[T. H. Morgan]] also made pangenesis untenable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heredity East and West: Lysenko and World Science|last=Huxley|first=Julian|publisher=Henry Schuman|year=1949|isbn=|location=New York|pages=11, 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Darwin's pangenesis principles do relate to heritable aspects of [[phenotypic plasticity]], although the status of gemmules as a distinct class of organic particles has been firmly rejected. However, starting in the 1950s, many research groups in revisiting Galton's experiments found that heritable characteristics could indeed arise in rabbits and chickens following DNA injection or blood transfusion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|date=2008|title=A new perspective on Darwin's Pangenesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2008.00036.x|journal=Biological Reviews|volume=83|issue=2|pages=141–149|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.2008.00036.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1940's in the work of Sopikov and others, and was later corroborated by researchers in Switzerland as it was being further developed by the Soviet scientists.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kosin, I. L. and Masaru Kato|first=|date=1963|title=A failure to induce heritable changes in four generations of the White Leghorn chicken by inter- and intra-specific blood transfusion|url=http://lysvav.narod.ru/VH/Kosin_Kato.pdf|journal=Genetics Research Cambridge|volume=4|pages=221–239|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Notably, this work was supported in the USSR in part due to its conformation with the ideas of [[Trofim Lysenko]], who espoused a version of neo-Lamarckism as part of [[Lysenkoism]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Further research of this heritability of acquired characteristics developed into, in part, the modern field of [[epigenetics]]. Darwin himself had noted that "the existence of free gemmules is a gratuitous assumption"; by some accounts in modern interpretation, gemmules may be considered a prescient mix of DNA, RNA, proteins, prions, and other mobile elements that are heritable in a non-Mendelian manner at the molecular level.&lt;ref name="Geison69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="West=Eberhard08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West-Eberhard |first1=M.

[[Image:Musicfirstaudioclassicpreamplifier.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a typical high-end [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] preamplifier.]]

A '''preamplifier''' (preamp or "pre") is an [[electronic amplifier]] that converts a weak electrical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] into an output signal strong enough to be noise-tolerant and strong enough for further processing, or for sending to a [[power amplifier]] and a [[loudspeaker]]. Without this, the final signal would be noisy or distorted. They are typically used to amplify signals from analog sensors such as [[microphone]]s and [[pickup (guitar)|pickups]]. Because of this, the preamplifier is often placed close to the [[sensor]] to reduce the effects of [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] and [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]].

==Description==
An ideal preamp will be linear (have a constant [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] through its operating range), have high [[input impedance]] (requiring only a minimal amount of current to sense the input signal) and a low [[output impedance]] (when current is drawn from the output there is minimal change in the output voltage).  It is used to boost the signal strength to drive the cable to the main instrument without significantly degrading the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR). The noise performance of a preamplifier is critical. According to [[Friis formulas for noise|Friis's formula]], when the gain of the preamplifier is high, the SNR of the final signal is determined by the SNR of the input signal and the [[noise figure]] of the preamplifier.

Three basic types of preamplifiers are available:
* current-sensitive preamplifier
* [[parasitic capacitance|parasitic-capacitance]] preamplifier
* [[charge amplifier|charge-sensitive preamplifier]].

==Audio systems==
In an audio system, they are typically used to amplify signals from analog sensors to [[line level]]. The second amplifier is typically a [[power amplifier]] (power amp).  The preamplifier provides [[voltage]] gain (e.g., from 10 mV to 1 V) but no significant [[Electric current|current]] gain. The power amplifier provides the higher voltage necessary to drive [[loudspeaker]]s. For these systems some common sensors are [[microphone]]s, [[pickup (music technology)|instrument pickups]], and [[phonograph]]s. Preamplifiers are often integrated into the audio inputs on [[mixing console]]s, [[DJ mixer]]s, and [[sound card]]s. They can also be stand-alone devices.

==Misnomer== 
In a home [[audio system]], the term 'preamplifier' may sometimes be used to describe equipment which merely [[switch]]es between different [[line level]] sources and applies [[attenuation|volume control]] and possibly [[tone control circuit]]s. Such equipment prepares the signal before amplification but, in fact, no actual amplification circuitry may be involved.

== Examples ==
* The integrated preamplifier in a foil [[electret microphone]].
* The first stages of an [[instrument amplifier]], which is then sent to the power amplifier. With instrument amplifiers, the preamp is often designed to produce [[distortion (music)|overdrive]] or distortion effects.
* A stand-alone unit for use in [[live music]] and [[recording studio]] applications.
* As part of a stand-alone [[channel strip]] or channel strip built into an audio [[mixing desk]].
* A [[Radio masts and towers|masthead]] amplifier used with [[television]] receiver [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] or a [[satellite]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] dish.
* The circuit inside of a hard drive connected to the magnetic heads or the circuit inside of CD/DVD drive which connects to the [[photodiode]]s.
* A [[switched capacitor]] circuit used to null the effects of mismatch offset in most [[CMOS]] comparator-based flash [[analog-to-digital converter]]s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">In [[broadcasting]], '''program test authority''' ('''PTA''') is an authorization to conduct [[Broadcasting|on-air]] testing of [[Radio station|broadcast station]] facilities authorized to be built under a [[construction permit]].  Once this testing is successfully completed, and all measured [[parameter]]s match what was authorized in the permit, the permittee can apply to the [[broadcasting authority]] for a [[broadcast license]] to cover the permit.  PTA lasts until the license is issued (or, rarely, denied).

"Program" refers to the permission to broadcast regular [[radio program]]ming or [[TV program]]ming, instead of just a test transmission such as a [[test card]] or [[bars and tone]] (TV only), [[broadcast callsign]] or other required [[station identification]], or [[dead air]] (which may not be permissible).  Otherwise, only brief tests are allowed without PTA, in order to verify proper installation and functioning of all transmission equipment, such as the [[transmitter (radio)|transmitter]] components (exciter and [[amplifier]]), [[feedline]], [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], and any [[diplexer]]s that may be used.

In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) gives most stations automatic program test authority if they are using an [[omnidirectional antenna]].  For stations with a [[directional antenna]], PTA is only for half of regular [[effective radiated power|power]], and is not granted until the permittee's [[broadcast engineer]] certifies that the antenna is installed properly so that the station's [[radiation pattern]] is correct.  Stations must apply for a license within 30 days of starting broadcasts under program test authority.  Upon issuance of the license, directional stations then commence full-power operation.

The '''Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies''' was established in 2005 as a partnership between the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] and the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nanotechproject.org/about/mission/ nanotechproject.org] &amp;ndash; Mission&lt;/ref&gt; The Project was intended to address the social, political, and public safety aspects of [[nanotechnology]]. It intended in particular to look for research and policy gaps and opportunities in knowledge and regulatory processes, and to develop strategies for closing them. The project worked with multiple U.S. and foreign governments and organizations.

The project's stated goal was "to inform the debate and to create an active public and policy dialogue. It was not an advocate either for, or against, particular nanotechnologies. Rather, the Project sought to ensure that as these technologies are developed, potential human health and environmental risks were anticipated, properly understood, and effectively managed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nanotechproject.org/about About The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RPM Nautical Foundation''' is a non-profit [[archaeological]] research and educational organization dedicated to the advancement of [[maritime archaeology]] that includes littoral surveys and excavation of individual [[shipwreck]] and [[harbor]] sites.

RPM Nautical Foundation (RPMNF) is organized to operate exclusively for charitable, scientific, literary and educational purposes, all within the meaning of sections [[Charitable contribution deductions in the United States|170(c)(2) and 501(c)(3)]] of the [[United States Internal Revenue Code]]. The operating purpose of the company is to engage in the detection, identification, study and preservation of nautical archaeological and [[historic site]]s for scientific research, public education, the advancement of technology. The organization also provides fieldwork and training experience in the field to students as well as the personnel and staff of various government, cultural and educational institutions.

Among the goals for RPMNF is the effort to assist [[Mediterranean countries]] with the location, identification, assessment, and research of their submerged cultural material so that these important cultural resources can be protected for future generations.  Accordingly, RPMNF projects are carried out in conjunction with host governments in the Mediterranean and serve as a crucial component in the effort to protect submerged archaeological sites and maritime heritage in association with UNESCO’s efforts to preserve world heritage sites. RPMNF policy stipulates that all artifacts are under the jurisdiction of the host government at all times. The location and assessment of [[Shipwreck|wreck sites]], as well as site and artifact analysis is beneficial to the many governments that RPMNF works with, as it provides cultural authorities pertinent information for protecting archaeological resources.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt;

Over the past decade RPMNF has made advances in maritime archaeology of the littoral region of the Mediterranean through intensive and systematic use of technology. RPMNF’s research vessel, the R/V Hercules, is a purpose-built maritime archaeological platform that has seafloor mapping and three-dimensional modeling capabilities for identification of submerged cultural material sites. The vessel is designed as a self-sufficient base for a wide range of project functions in moderately deep littoral waters, typically limited to 500 m.  These operations include remote sensing equipment that includes autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and various multibeam systems, the deployment of ROVs, data and media processing and other research functions.  Hercules is equipped with a dynamic positioning system and advanced data processing capabilities, as well as adequate deck space and lifting systems to transport and deploy survey equipment.  Potential sites are verified and documented with ROV investigation.  The ROV is employed for video and image documentation, sampling, artifact retrieval, and limited excavation of sites.&lt;ref name=Hvistendahl2011&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hvistendahl, Mara |title=The Adriatic's Uncharted Past |journal=[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]] |year=2011 |volume=64 |issue=2 |url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1103/features/adriatic_shipwrecks_albania.html |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROV is also employed for the excavation of deep-water sites; an excavation methodological process that RPMNF is helping to advance within the field of [[maritime archaeology]].

RPMNF research vessel R/V ''Hercules'' is Maltese flagged and based in [[Valletta]], Malta during the winter months.  This research vessel can be deployed throughout the Mediterranean on a project basis.

==History==
[[File:RPMNF expedition areas through 2014.png|thumbnail|RPMNF expedition areas through 2014]]
The foundation was established in 2001 by its President, George Robb, who was a Director for the Institute of Nautical Archaeology.  As part of RPMNF's initial foundation, it was establishes as a supporting institute for the Institute of Nautical Archaeology  Early field work centered in Florida and select supporting projects in the Mediterranean.  In 2003, Dr. Jeff Royal became Archaeological Director, then in 2011 took over as Executive Director, during which time RPMNF's focus has centered on the Mediterranean.  At the end of 2010, RPMNF entered into an agreement and is a supporting institute for the Program in Maritime Studies at [[East Carolina University]].  RPMNF continues to grow its associations with Universities, individual scholars, students, and new countries around the Mediterranean.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Project History==
[[File:Maritimearchaeologistworking.jpg|thumbnail|left]]
RPMNF's cooperative projects have proved successful in the identification, mapping, and recording of shipwreck sites and harbor works from the ancient through modern eras.  To date, project areas include Spain, Albania, Montenegro, Croatia, Malta, Morocco, Cyprus, Sicily, Amalfi and Calabria in Italy, Tunisia, and Turkey.  As all archaeological work is performed in conjunction with the host country’s cultural authority, the one of the crucial outcomes is that the projects assist in both scholarly research and educational projects.  All recovered artifacts remain under the jurisdiction of the host government for educational/research purposes and eventual museum display in each country.  The location and assessment data of wreck sites has proved beneficial to the many governments with which RPMNF have worked as it provides their cultural authorities pertinent information for protecting their submerged archaeological resources.  Bathymetric data is also made available to host country hydrographic departments in order to supplement their oceanographic mapping programs.  RPMNF research vessel Hercules is flagged in Malta, where it based in Valletta during the off-season, and is deployed throughout the Mediterranean on a project basis.

==Publications==
RPMNF Project reports are filed with the appropriate government agency in each country.  Scholarly articles from RPMNF field work are published.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1298">In [[computer engineering]], a '''register–memory architecture''' is an [[instruction set architecture]] that allows operations to be performed on (or from) memory, as well as [[processor register|registers]].&lt;ref name=Flynn9 &gt;{{cite book|title=Computer architecture: pipelined and parallel processor design|author=Michael J. Flynn|author-link=Michael J. Flynn|year=1995|isbn=0867202041|page=9-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the architecture allows all operands to be in memory or in registers, or in combinations, it is called a "register plus memory" architecture.&lt;ref name=Flynn9 /&gt;

In a register–memory approach one of the operands for ADD operation may be in memory, while the other is in a register. This differs from a [[load/store architecture]] (used by [[reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] designs such as [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]]) in which both operands for an ADD operation must be in registers before the ADD.&lt;ref name=Flynn9 /&gt;

Examples of register memory architecture are [[IBM System/360]], its successors, and [[Intel x86]].&lt;ref name=Flynn9 /&gt; Examples of register plus memory architecture are [[VAX]] and the [[Motorola 68000 family]].&lt;ref name=Flynn9 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56736">'''Revenge porn''' or '''revenge pornography''' is the distribution of [[sexually explicit]] images or video of individuals without their permission.&lt;ref name=W346&gt;{{harvnb|Citron &amp; Franks|2014|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexually explicit images or video may be made by a partner of an [[intimate relationship]] with the knowledge and consent of the subject, or it may be made without his or her knowledge. The possession of the material may be used by the perpetrators to [[blackmail]] the subjects into performing other sex acts, to coerce them into continuing the relationship, or to punish them for ending the relationship.

In the wake of civil lawsuits and the increasing numbers of reported incidents, legislation has been passed in a number of countries and jurisdictions to outlaw the practice, though approaches have varied. The practice has also been described as a form of [[psychological abuse]] and [[domestic violence]], as well as a form of [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://summit.sfu.ca/item/15668|title="Stripped": An analysis of revenge porn victims' lives after victimization|first=Samantha|last=Bates|publisher=Simon Fraser University|date=2015-08-04|accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "revenge porn" generally refers to the uploading of this sexually explicit material to [[humiliate]] and [[intimidate]] the subject, who has broken off the relationship.&lt;ref name= W346/&gt; The term is also often misused to describe non 'revenge' scenarios, including nonconsensual pornography distributed by [[hacker (term)|hackers]] or by individuals seeking profit or notoriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayward &amp; Rahn|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images are usually accompanied by [[doxing|sufficient information]] to identify the pictured individual, typically names and locations, and can include links to [[social media]] profiles, home addresses and workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Bazelon, [http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/09/revenge_porn_legislation_a_new_bill_in_california_doesn_t_go_far_enough.html Why Do We Tolerate Revenge Porn?"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' (Sept. 25, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;Eric Larson, [http://mashable.com/2013/10/21/revenge-porn/ "It's Still Easy to Get Away With Revenge Porn"], ''[[Mashable]]'', 21 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Victims, whose images expose them to [[workplace discrimination]], [[cyber-stalking]] or physical attack, can have their lives ruined as a result. Given the practice by some companies of searching for potential sources of bad publicity, many victims of revenge porn have lost their jobs and found themselves effectively unhirable.&lt;ref name = Citron&gt;Danielle K. Citron, [http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/29/opinion/citron-revenge-porn/index.html "‘Revenge porn’ should be a crime"], ''CNN Opinion'' (Aug. 30, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Some academics argue that the term "revenge porn" should not be used, and instead that it should be referred to as '''image based sexual abuse'''.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Rackley &amp; Clare McGylnn, "Image Based Sexual Abuse" (2017) Oxford Journal of Legal Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the 1980s, ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine began a monthly feature of reader-submitted images of naked women called "Beaver Hunt".&lt;ref name=artporn&gt;Kelly Dennis, ''Art/Porn: A History of Seeing and Touching'', Oxford International Publishers (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Beaver Hunt photographs were often accompanied by details about the woman, like her hobbies, her sexual fantasies, and sometimes her name.&lt;ref name=artporn /&gt; Not all of the women featured in Beaver Hunt submitted their own images and several women sued the magazine for publishing their photographs without their permission, or without verifying information on forged consent forms.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://leagle.com/decision/19841820736F2d1084_11634.xml/WOOD%20v.%20HUSTLER%20MAGAZINE,%20INC. ''Wood v. Hustler''], 736 F.2d 1084 (5th Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Two decades later, Italian researcher [[Sergio Messina]] identified "realcore pornography", a new genre consisting of images and videos of ex-girlfriends distributed through [[Usenet]] groups.&lt;ref name=history&gt;Alexa Tsoulis-Reay, [http://nymag.com/news/features/sex/revenge-porn-2013-7 "A Brief History of Revenge Porn"], ''New York Magazine'' (July 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, amateur porn aggregator [[XTube]] began receiving complaints that pornographic content had been posted without subjects' consent. Several sites began staging consensual [[pornography]] to resemble revenge porn, as well as hosting "authentic" user-submitted content.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref name=twsEconomist&gt;{{cite news|title=Revenge porn: Misery merchants|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21606307-how-should-online-publication-explicit-images-without-their-subjects-consent-be|work=[[The Economist]]|date=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenge porn began garnering international media attention when [[Hunter Moore]] launched the website ''[[IsAnyoneUp]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref name=frontier&gt;On The Media, [http://www.onthemedia.org/story/173718-revenge-porns-latest-frontier/transcript "Revenge Porn’s Latest Frontier"], WNYC (Dec. 2, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The site featured user-submitted pornography,&lt;ref name=frontier /&gt; and was one of the first sites to adopt the model initiated by Beaver Hunt: ''IsAnyoneUp'' often included identifying information, such as the subjects' names, employers, addresses and links to social networking profiles.&lt;ref name=frontier /&gt; Activist [[Charlotte Laws]] was the first person to speak out against Moore and one of the first people to publicly support revenge porn victims. This prompted backlash from some of Moore's devotees, who stalked Laws and sent her death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/mar/30/charlotte-laws-fight-with-internet-revenge-porn-king|title=Charlotte Laws' fight with Hunter Moore, the internet's revenge porn king|author=Carole Cadwalladr|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the [[social media]] site and [[Internet forum|online bulletin board]] [[Reddit]] announced a change to its privacy policy to ban the posting of sexually explicit content without the consent of those depicted. The announcement was made after a company meeting at which the issue of "illicit pornography—pictures and video—was a burning one".&lt;ref name=2015Reddit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pardon|first1=Rhett|title=Reddit to Ban Sexually Explicit Content Posted Without Consent|url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/191561|accessdate=25 February 2015|publisher=XBIZ.com|date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, [[Twitter]] followed suit with new rules to address the posting of unauthorized content and specifically revenge porn. Starting March 11, Twitter stated it would immediately remove "any 'link to a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct' that has been posted without consent."&lt;ref name=2015TwitterChange&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hymes|first1=Tom|title=Twitter Targets Revenge Porn with New Abusive Behavior Policies New tougher prohibitions start today.|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/technology/Twitter-Targets-Revenge-Porn-with-New-Abusive-Behavior-Policies-591209.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article, the changes were in response to growing concerns "that [Twitter] has not done enough to prevent bad behavior on its site."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tsukayama|first1=Hayley|title=Twitter updates its rules to specifically ban ‘revenge porn'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/03/11/twitter-updates-its-rules-to-specifically-ban-revenge-porn/|accessdate=12 March 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, [[Google]] announced it would remove links to revenge porn on request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golbeck|first1=Jennifer|title=Google to Remove Revenge Porn from Search Results|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/06/19/google_announces_plan_to_remove_revenge_porn_from_search_results.html|website=slate.com|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] followed suit in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beauchere|first1=Jacqueline|title=‘Revenge porn:' Putting victims back in control|url=http://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2015/07/22/revenge-porn-putting-victims-back-in-control/|website=blogs.microsoft.com/|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both have placed forms on-line for victims to complete.&lt;ref&gt;[https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/3111061#ts=2889054,2889099 "Remove information from Google"].

==Advocacy==
The website ''endrevengeporn.org'', founded by [[Holly Jacobs]], a revenge porn victim, campaigns for the criminalization of revenge porn and considers it to be a form of [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endrevengeporn.org/petition/|title=End Revenge Porn: Petition|website=www.endrevengeporn.org|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCRI FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.endrevengeporn.org/faqs/|website=.endrevengeporn.org|publisher=[[Cyber Civil Rights Initiative]]|quote=Revenge porn, n. – A form of sexual abuse that involves the distribution of nude/sexually explicit photos and/or videos of an individual without their consent. Revenge porn, sometimes called cyber-rape or nonconsensual pornography, is usually posted by a scorned ex-lover or friend, in order to seek revenge after a relationship has gone sour.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs is also the founder of the [[Cyber Civil Rights Initiative]] (CCRI), a nonprofit organization that seeks to challenge cyber harassment. [[Danielle Citron]], known for her discourse on cyber harassment as a civil rights issue, is an advisor for the CCRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCRI: About us|url=http://www.cybercivilrights.org/about|website=cybercivilrights.org|publisher=[[Cyber Civil Rights Initiative]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvardnb|Citron|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Anne Franks]], CCRI's Vice-President and Legislative &amp; Tech Policy Director, has been heavily involved with legislative and policy efforts to combat revenge porn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/mary-anne-franks-revenge-porn/|title=Meet the Krav Maga-fighting law professor behind U.S. revenge porn laws|work=The Daily Dot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Laura Hilly and Kira Allmann of the [[Oxford Human Rights Hub]] have characterized revenge porn as a kind of gendered hate speech designed to silence women. An article of theirs argues that this stifling of free expression is often ignored in debates over revenge porn.&lt;ref name=OxHRH&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hilly|first1=Laura|last2=Allman|first2=Kira|title=Revenge porn does not only try to shame women – it tries to silence them too|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/22/revenge-porn-women-free-speech-abuse?CMP=ema_565|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not solely focused on revenge porn, the older non-profit organization ''Without My Consent'' provides legal resources related to it and lobbies to protect the privacy and free speech rights of online harassment victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/magazine/mag-24lede-t.html|title=How to unmask the Internet's vilest characters|first=Emily|last=Bazelon|publisher=New York Times Magazine|date=2011-04-22|accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, there has also been a website ''Women Against Revenge Porn'', calling itself "not an organization or a business", which has been cited as an advocacy group for people exposed in revenge porn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/revenge-porn-the-ugly-side-of-sexting-20131122-2y1ns.html|title=Revenge porn the ugly side of sexting|first=Miles|last=Godfrey|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2013-11-23|accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014, Elisa D'Amico and David Bateman, partners at the law firm [[K&amp;L Gates]], launched the Cyber Civil Rights Legal Project (CCRLP), a project offering free legal help to victims of revenge porn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Law Firm Founds Project to Fight 'Revenge Porn'|url = https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/law-firm-founds-project-to-fight-revenge-porn/?_r=0|website = DealBook|access-date = 2016-01-28|first = Matthew|last = Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BigLaw firm fights 'revenge porn' with pro bono advocacy; suit alleges copyright infringement|url = http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/biglaw_firm_fights_revenge_porn_with_pro_bono_advocacy_suit_alleges_copyrig|website = ABA Journal|access-date = 2016-01-28|first = Debra|last = Cassens Weiss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To better facilitate the introduction of relevant legislation, some anti-revenge porn activists have called upon others in their community to use gender-neutral language more often when discussing the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialchangenyu.com/revenge-porn-legislation-activists-and-the-lessons-from-sexual-harassment-jurisprudence-gender-neutrality-public-perceptions-and-implications/#_ftn1|title=Revenge Porn Legislation Activists and the Lessons from Sexual Harassment Jurisprudence: Gender Neutrality, Public Perceptions and Implications|first=Amy|last=Lai|publisher=NYU|year=2015|accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "revenge porn" itself has also come under fire. The CCRI for instance prefers the term "nonconsensual pornography".&lt;ref name=CCRImission&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=About|url=http://www.endrevengeporn.org/welcome/|publisher=CCRI|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In analogy with "child sexual abuse images" being the preferred term for child pornography, McGlynn and Rackley proposed "image-based sexual abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGlynn | first1 = Clare | last2 = Rackley | first2 = Erika | title = Not ‘revenge porn', but abuse: let's call it image-based sexual abuse (blog) | journal = Inherently Brief | volume = 41 | publisher = Postgraduate Students, [[Durham University|Gender &amp; Law at Durham (GLAD)]] via [[WordPress]]| date = 15 February 2016 | url = https://inherentlyhuman.wordpress.com/2016/02/15/not-revenge-porn-but-abuse-lets-call-it-image-based-sexual-abuse/ | ref = none | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with journalist [[Sarah Jeong]], they have argued that it is harmful to associate revenge porn with pornography which revolves around consent. Jeong also considers it a mistake for activists to focus on revenge porn itself as the main problem, rather than the underlying culture which leads to its subjects being socially ostracized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Snap Judgment {{!}} Bitch Media|url = https://bitchmedia.org/article/snap-judgment-revenge-porn|website = Bitch Media|accessdate = 2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Australian Capital Territory]], an electronic petition was started in March 2017 that called upon the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly to consider criminalizing the non-consensual disclosure of sexual images and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/petition-calls-on-act-government-to-introduce-revenge-porn-laws-20170322-gv4gaj.html|title=Calls for ACT government to introduce 'revenge porn' laws|first=Michael|last=Gorey|date=23 March 2017|work=canberratimes.com.au|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The A.C.T Legislative Assembly consequently passed a Bill that criminalised the distribution, or threatened distribution, of intimate photos and videos on 16 August 2017.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Legislation==

Since 2009, the Philippines has criminalized copying, reproducing, sharing or exhibiting sexually explicit images or videos over the Internet without written consent of the individual depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act of 2009 (Republic Act No. 9995) | date = 15 February 2010 | accessdate = 25 June 2015 | work = The LawPhil Project | url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2010/ra_9995_2010.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israel]] responded quickly to public pressure in January 2014 and passed a law making sharing sexually explicit videos without the consent of the pictured individual punishable by up to five years in prison.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"&gt;{{cite news | author = Yaakov, Yifa | url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-law-labels-revenge-porn-a-sex-crime|title= Israeli Law Makes Revenge Porn a Sex Crime | work = The Times of Israel | date = 6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Israel's bill was passed, it was widely predicted that nearby countries such as Egypt, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia would not introduce similar bills as they have been slow to adopt legislation against sexual harassment in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/06/sexual-harassment-made-crime-egypt-201465172339220160.html|title=Sexual harassment made a crime in Egypt|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=2014-06-06|accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some commentators have suggested that victims could find recourse in existing laws against pornography, indecency, defamation and invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ajbaili, Mustapha | date = 10 January 2014 | title = Banning ‘Revenge Porn:' Will Arabs follow Israel's lead? | work = Al Arabiya News | accessdate = 25 June 2015 | url = http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/features/2014/01/10/Banning-Revenge-Porn-Will-Arabs-follow-Israel-s-lead-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia ===
In November 2014, the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] modified its existing [[sexting]] laws. In addition to prohibiting the sending of nude pictures without consent, the amendment also added safeguards to prevent minors from receiving child pornography charges for self-made content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vic.gov.au/news/sexting.html|title=Sexting|first=|last=|date=3 November 2014|publisher=Department of Justice and Regulation, Government of Victoria|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubStatbook.nsf/f932b66241ecf1b7ca256e92000e23be/73A4F3B93BAA3547CA257D780015AC59/$FILE/14-074aa%20authorised.pdf|title=Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences and Other Matters) Act 2014|publisher=Government of Victoria|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation followed an upsurge in the practice and the case ''Giller v Procopets'', which had to be argued on the equity of [[breach of confidence]] and [[tort]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;The Age, 4 October 2015: [http://www.theage.com.au/national/government-urged-to-outlaw-revenge-porn-20150926-gjvod5 Revenge porn: government urged to make it illegal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSCA|236|2008|litigants=Giller v Procopets |date=10 December 2008 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ag.gov.au/Consultations/Documents/Righttosueforseriousinvasionofpersonalprivacy-issuespaper/69%20Peter%20A%20P%20Clarke.PDF A statutory right of privacy] by Peter A P Clark&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Australia]] followed in 2016, with a bill making it illegal to distribute or threaten to distribute invasive nude photographs.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Offences (Filming and Sexting Offences) Amendment Bill 2016|url=https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/B/CURRENT/SUMMARY%20OFFENCES%20(FILMING%20AND%20SEXTING%20OFFENCES)%20AMENDMENT%20BILL%202016.aspx|publisher=Government of South Australia|author=Office of Parliamentary Counsel|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New South Wales]] passed a Bill that criminalised the distribution, or threatened distribution, of intimate photos or videos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/bills/Pages/bill-details.aspx?pk=3396|title=Crimes Amendment (Intimate Images) Bill 2017|publisher=Parliament of New South Wales|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which commenced on 25 August 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/revenge-porn-now-a-crime-in-nsw-20170825-gy4c9d.html|title=Revenge porn now a crime in NSW|author=|date=25 August 2017|publisher=|agency=Australian Associated Press|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===North America===

====Canada====
In 2014, with the passage of the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act, Canada criminalized the "non-consensual distribution of intimate images" that were made under a "reasonable [[expectation of privacy]]".&lt;ref name=Laws_Lois/&gt;

====United States ====
[[Tort]], [[Privacy law|privacy]], [[copyright]], and criminal laws offer remedies against people who submit revenge porn.&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Hartzog, [http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2013/05/how-fight-revenge-porn "How to Fight Revenge Porn"], Stanford Law Center for Internet and Society (May 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doug Barry, [http://jezebel.com/5993942/a-new-bill-in-florida-would-make-non+consensual-revenge-porn-a-felony "A New Bill in Florida Would Make Non-Consensual ‘Revenge Porn’ a Felony"], ''[[Jezebel]]'', 7 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Forty states have laws against revenge porn as of August 2018.&lt;ref name="cybercivilrights.org"/&gt;
For example, New Jersey law prohibits both the capture and the distribution of sexually explicit photographs and films by any person, "knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so" and without the subjects' consent.{{Cite NJSA|title=2C|chapter=14|section=9|subsection=b|citeonly=true}} The law was used to prosecute [[Dharun Ravi]], the [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] student who distributed webcam footage of his roommate Tyler Clementi engaging in sexual activity, after which [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|Clementi killed himself]].&lt;ref&gt;Megan DiMarco and Alexi Friedman, [http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/dharun_ravi_sentenced_for_bias.html "Live Blog: Dharun Ravi Sentenced to 30 Days in Jail"], ''The Star-Ledger'' (May 12, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The law has also been used to prosecute several men who allegedly distributed revenge porn of their ex-girlfriends.&lt;ref&gt;Marueen O'Connor, [http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/08/crusading-sisterhood-of-revenge-porn-victims.html "The Crusading Sisterhood of Revenge-Porn Victims"], ''[[New York Magazine]]'' (Aug. 29, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Anne Franks]], a law professor and constitutional scholar who drafted the model legislation and advised legislators in the majority of the above states, emphasizes that many of these laws are still deeply flawed.&lt;ref name= Huff4&gt;{{cite web|last1=Franks|first1=Mary Anne|title=How to Defeat 'Revenge Porn': First, Recognize It's About Privacy, Not Revenge|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-anne-franks/how-to-defeat-revenge-porn_b_7624900.html|website=huffingtonpost.com|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives from the Department of Justice, California's Office of the Attorney General, 50 major technology companies, victim advocates, and legislative and law enforcement leaders joined together in 2015 to form a Cyber Exploitation Working Group, and have announced the creation of a working hub "to combat so-called cyber exploitation – the practice of anonymously posting explicit photographs of others online, often to extort money from the victims."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = California teams with tech firms to fight cyber exploitation|url = http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-1015-cyber-exploitation-20151015-story.html|website = [[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate = 2015-10-20|date = 2015-10-15|last = [[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Criminal prosecutions =====
Several well-known revenge porn websites, including ''IsAnyoneUp'' and the ''Texxxan'', have been taken down in response to actual or threatened legal action.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Goode, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/us/victims-push-laws-to-end-online-revenge-posts.html?pagewanted=all "Victims Push Laws to End Online Revenge Posts"], ''New York Times'' 23 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The former was investigated by the FBI after anti-revenge porn activist [[Charlotte Laws]] uncovered a hacking scheme associated with the website. Indictments for fifteen felonies were handed down under the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] in January 2014 for the site owner and his accomplices, and the trial was initially set to begin in November 2014 in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=2014FBITime&gt;{{cite news|last=Roy|first=Jessica|title=Revenge-Porn King Hunter Moore Indicted on Federal Charges|url=http://time.com/1703/revenge-porn-king-hunter-moore-indicted-by-fbi/|publisher=Time|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hunter Moore]], the owner of ''IsAnyoneUp'' pleaded guilty to hacking and identity theft in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/revenge-porn-kingpin-hunter-moore-pleads-guilty-faces-jail-n313061|title=Revenge Porn Kingpin Hunter Moore Pleads Guilty, Faces Jail|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore was sentenced to two and a half years in prison on December 2, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/27/is-this-the-end-of-revenge-porn.html|title=Is This the End of Revenge Porn?|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/12/03/revenge-porn-purveyor-hunter-moore-is-sentenced-to-prison/|title=Revenge porn purveyor Hunter Moore is sentenced to prison|first=Abby|last=Ohlheiser|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2015-12-03|accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, California Attorney General [[Kamala Harris]] charged Kevin Bollaert, who ran the revenge porn website ''UGotPosted'', with 31 felony counts, including [[extortion]] and [[identity theft]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-arrest-revenge-porn-website-operator "Press Release: Attorney General Kamala D.

In April 2015 Bollaert was sentenced to 18 years in prison.&lt;ref name="LAtimes_ 2015-04-03"&gt;{{Cite news | title = 'Revenge porn' website operator sentenced to 18 years | last = Perry | first = Tony | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 3 April 2015 | accessdate = 2015-04-04 | url = http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-revenge-porn-sentenced-20150403-story.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sitting behind a computer, committing what is essentially a cowardly and criminal act, will not shield predators from the law or jail", said Attorney General Harris following the verdict.&lt;ref name="LAtimes_ 2015-04-03"/&gt; Also in California, a man named Noe Iniguez was given jail time for posting a naked photo of his ex-girlfriend on her employer's [[Facebook]] page.&lt;ref name="BBC_30307657"&gt;{{Cite news | title = 'Revenge porn' Facebook post leads to jail sentence | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 2015-04-04 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30307657 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casey Meyering, the operator of revenge porn website ''WinByState'', was arrested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/revenge-porn-website-operator-sentenced-to-years/article_fd4ea4fe-16c7-517c-a763-115e92f66cdf.html|title='Revenge porn' website operator sentenced to 3 years|author=Sean Scully|work=Napa Valley Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Oklahoma in 2014 and extradited to Napa County. Meyering's website invited users to submit nude photos of ex-girlfriends and other women, with the photos categorized by state. He would then make the women featured on his website pay $250 to have their photos taken down. There were about 400 images of California women on the website, including at least one in Napa Valley, where California Attorney General [[Kamala Harris]] had filed the case. After originally pleading not guilty, on May 8, 2015, the 28-year-old man pleaded no contest to one count of [[extortion]], three counts of attempted extortion, and one count of [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]]. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment as of early June 2015.

=====Tort and privacy law=====
States without specific laws about revenge porn have seen lawsuits alleging [[invasion of privacy]], [[privacy laws|public disclosure of private fact]] and [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] against the individuals who uploaded the images.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/138909420/Revenge-Porn-Complaint-Holly-Jacobs-vs-Ryan-Seay Complaint in ''Jacobs v. Seay''], 13-1362 6CA0 (Fl. Apr. 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Forty states, including California and New York, have [[computer crime|anti-cyberharassment]] laws that may be applicable to cases of revenge porn.&lt;ref name="ncsl.org"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/telecom/cyberstalking-and-cyberharassment-laws.aspx | title = State Cyberstalking and Cyberharassment Laws | work = National Conference of State Legislatures | date = 16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, a US$500,000 settlement was awarded to a Texas woman who brought suit against her ex-boyfriend for posting video and photos of her on the Internet. The state did not have a specific "revenge porn" law at the time of the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=ABCNewsTX&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Houston woman wins $500,000 in 'revenge porn' lawsuit|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=9447698|publisher=abclocal.go.com|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AVNTexas&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Texas Jury Awards Revenge-Porned Woman Half a Mil|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/legal/Texas-Jury-Awards-Revenge-Porned-Woman-Half-a-Mil-550467.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adi Robertson, [https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/1/5459904/texas-woman-wins-half-million-dollar-revenge-porn-lawsuit "Texas Woman Wins Half a Million Dollars in Revenge Porn Lawsuit"], ''[[The Verge]]'' (Mar. 1, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; California has a private right of action in tort for acts of revenge pornography within the civil code, as well as a specific criminal statute punishing revenge pornography as an invasion of privacy.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=====Communications Decency Act §230=====
Some revenge porn lawsuits have named service providers and websites as defendants alongside individuals who uploaded the images.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/121463764/Class-Action-Suit-Against-GoDaddy-com-Texxxan-com ''Toups v.

=====Copyright=====
An estimated 80% of revenge porn pictures and videos are taken by the subjects themselves.&lt;ref name="kelly"&gt;Heather Kelly, [http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/tech/web/revenge-porn-law-california/ "New California 'Revenge Porn' Law May Miss Some Victims"], ''CNN'' (Oct. 3, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Those individuals can bring actions for [[copyright infringement]] against the person who uploaded their nude or semi-nude "[[selfie]]s".

=====First Amendment and anti-SLAPP=====
Some [[free speech]] advocates object to revenge porn laws on [[First Amendment]] grounds, citing the fact that US laws restricting expression have a history of being overturned.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2853347803518998660&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr ''United States v.

===Europe===
Many European countries have broad privacy statutes that may be applicable to revenge porn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rotenberg &amp; Jacobs|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; France also criminalizes the willful violation of the intimate private life of another by "transmitting the picture of a person who is within a private place, without the consent of the person concerned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archive.equal-jus.eu/181/1/French_penal_code.pdf | title = French Penal Code Article 226-1 | date = 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German [[High Court]] made a May 2014 ruling that intimate photographs of partners should be deleted if the partner so requests.&lt;ref name=2014IndependentGrayling/&gt;

====Malta====
A law criminalising revenge porn in Malta entered into force in November 2016. Article 208E of the Maltese Criminal Code punishes whoever, with an intent to cause distress, emotional harm or harm of any nature, discloses a private sexual photograph or film without the consent of the person or persons displayed or depicted in such photograph or film. Such person would, on conviction be liable to imprisonment for a term of up to two years or to a fine of not less than €,3000 and not more than €5,000, or to both such imprisonment and fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-04-17/local-news/Government-does-not-exclude-updating-current-laws-on-suits-for-pain-and-suffering-6736173075|title=Government does not exclude updating current laws on suits for pain and suffering|last=Grech|first=Helena|date=17 April 2017|website=|publisher=The Malta Independent|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=April 2017}}

In 2012, the English singer-songwriter [[Tulisa (singer)|Tulisa Contostavlos]] obtained an injunction preventing the distribution of a sex-tape of her and a former lover that had been published on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2012/850.html|title=Tulisa Contostavlos v Michael Mendahun and others|author=|date=29 March 2012|work=bailii.org|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9155127/Tulisa-sex-tape-removed-after-lawyers-obtain-injunction.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Tulisa 'sex tape' removed after lawyers obtain injunction | date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was set to include considerable damages, but was settled out of court before it could be considered.&lt;ref name = "House of Lords report"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Triumphant Tulisa settles legal action against ex over sex tape publication|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2172471/Tulisa-Contostavlos-settles-legal-action-ex-Justin-Edwards-sex-tape.html|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=12 July 2012|location=London|first1=Sarah|last1=Bull|first2=Donna|last2=McConnell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, UK charities including [[The National Stalking Helpline]], [[Women's Aid]], and the [[UK Safer Internet Centre]] reported increased use of revenge porn websites.&lt;ref name=2014IndependentGrayling/&gt; Women's Aid Charity Chief Executive Polly Neate stated, "To be meaningful, any attempt to tackle revenge porn must also take account of all other kinds of psychological abuse and [[controlling behaviour]], and revenge porn is just another form of [[coercive control]]. That control is central to domestic violence, which is why we're campaigning for all psychological abuse and coercive control to be criminalised". In July [[Chris Grayling]], the [[Secretary of State for Justice]], announced plans to "take appropriate action" to address revenge porn in Britain.&lt;ref name=2014IndependentGrayling&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=Jack|title=Revenge porn: What is it and how widespread is the problem?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/what-is-revenge-porn-9580251.html|website=www.independent.co.uk|publisher=Independent UK|accessdate=7 July 2014|location=London|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A House of Lords Committee, in a report on social media and the law, subsequently called for clarification from the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|DPP]] as to when revenge porn becomes a crime.&lt;ref name = "House of Lords report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Social media and criminal offences – Communications Committee Contents|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldselect/ldcomuni/37/3704.htm|publisher=[[House of Lords]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Revenge porn' laws must be clearer, say Lords|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jul/29/revenge-porn-laws-must-be-clearer-say-lords|work=[[The Guardian]]|agency=Press Association|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6T1o04Z9x?url=http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jul/29/revenge-porn-laws-must-be-clearer-say-lords|archivedate=2 October 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015 the [[Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015]], which has a specific amendment dealing with such actions, received [[Royal Assent]]. Section 33 of the Act makes it an offence in England and Wales to disclose private sexual photographs and films without the consent of the individual depicted and with the intent to cause distress. There is a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31429026|title='Revenge porn' illegal under new law in England and Wales|work=BBC News | date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/2/section/33/enacted#section-33-1-a|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2015, a seminar was held in [[Westminster]] on the new legislation. The seminar was organised by the [[Oxford Human Rights Hub]] and co-hosted with the law firm [[McAllister Olivarius]], the [[End Violence Against Women Coalition]], [[The University of Durham]], and [[The University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Call to extend revenge porn laws|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3052592/Call-extend-revenge-porn-laws.html|website=dailymail.co.uk|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|date=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Event: Revenge Porn: The New Law|url=http://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/revenge-porn-the-new-law/|website=ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk|publisher=[[Oxford Human Rights Hub]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seminar called for the law to be extended to cover activities such as [[upskirting]].

In June 2015 it was reported that [[BriaAndChrissy|Chrissy Chambers]], a [[YouTube]] star from the United States, was pursuing a civil suit against her British ex-boyfriend who posted sexually-explicit videos taken without her knowledge or consent to [[Facebook]] where they were [[viral video|repeatedly shared]]. Chambers chose to pursue a civil case as the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 does not apply retroactively to content posted prior to its passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kleeman|first1=Jenny|title=US woman pursues ex-boyfriend in landmark UK revenge-porn action|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/03/us-woman-pursues-ex-boyfriend-in-landmark-uk-revenge-porn-action|website=theguardian.com|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luckhurst|first1=Phoebe|title=YouTube star Chrissy Chambers: 'Discovering revenge porn video devastated me|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/youtube-star-chrissy-chambers-discovering-revenge-porn-video-devastated-me-10307182.html|website=standard.co.uk|publisher=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 2015 (the date that section 33 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 came into force) and December 2015 the number of reported incidents of revenge pornography in England and Wales was 1,160. However, 61% of them resulted in no action being taken and the number of people prosecuted for disclosing private sexual images during the legislation's first year was 206.

=====Scotland=====
In Scotland, revenge porn became a specific offence in April 2016 when the Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm Act came into effect.

=====Northern Ireland=====
In Northern Ireland, revenge porn was made a crime in February 2016 through the amendment of an existing law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revenge porn: More than 200 prosecuted under new law|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37278264|date=6 September 2016|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
The 2017 independent film ''[[From Jennifer (2017 film)|#FromJennifer]]'' tackles the subject of revenge porn. In the film, the main character's acting career is derailed by an ex-boyfriend who posts a video of them online without her consent. When the video goes viral, her manager drops her as a client, and the ensuing humiliation she suffers leads her toward a path of destruction and counter-revenge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18198">A '''sacred natural site''' is a natural feature or a large area of land or water having special [[Spirituality|spiritual]] significance to peoples and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Oviedo, G. and Jeanrenaud, S. (2007) 'Protecting sacred natural sites of indigenous and traditional peoples', in Mallarach, J.M. and Papayannis, T. (eds) (2007) Protected Areas and Spirituality, IUCN and Publicacions de l'Abadia de Montserrat, Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred natural sites consist of all types of natural features including mountains, hills, forests, [[Sacred grove|groves]], [[Tree worship|trees]], rivers, lakes, lagoons, caves, islands and springs. The interest in sacred natural sites, from the perspective of [[nature conservation]], lies in the component of [[biological diversity]] that they harbor.

== Overview ==
Sacred natural sites are natural features in or areas of land or water having special spiritual significance to peoples and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Wild, R and McLeod, C (eds) (2008) 'Sacred Natural Sites: Guidelines for Protected Area Managers'. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN&lt;/ref&gt; This working definition is broad and can be used as a basis for more specific articulations. Whilst “sacred natural sites” is the main term used, for reasons of variety and readability, other terms are used interchangeably, including [[sacred site]], [[sacred place]] and sacred area.

The interest in sacred natural sites from the perspective of [[nature conservation]] lies in the components of [[biological diversity]] that they harbour, such as the species of animals and plants, the [[habitat]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, as well as the ecological dynamics and functions that support life within and outside the places. Linked to such biological diversity is the array of distinct [[human culture]]s that care for them and hold them sacred.&lt;ref name=v&gt;Verschuuren, B., Wild, R., McNeely, J., Oviedo G. (eds.), 2010. Sacred Natural Sites, Conserving Culture and Nature. EarthScan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacred natural sites consist of all types of natural features including mountains, hills, forests, groves, rivers, lakes, lagoons, caves, islands and springs. They can vary in size from the very small: an individual tree, small spring, or a single rock formation, to whole landscapes and mountain ranges.  They consist of [[geological formation]]s, distinct [[landform]]s, specific [[ecosystem]]s and [[natural habitat]]s.  They are predominantly [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] but are also found in inshore [[Ocean|marine]] areas, [[island]]s and [[archipelago]]s.  They may also be the location of [[temple]]s, [[shrine]]s, [[mosque]]s and [[Church (building)|church]]es, and they can incorporate other features such as [[pilgrimage]] trails.  In some sites nature is itself sacred, while in others sanctity is conferred by connections with spiritual heroes, religious structures or sacred histories.

== Sacred natural sites and religion==
Sacred natural sites are just one of many domains where religions or belief systems interact with nature. Most if not all religions have [[mythology]], [[cosmology]], [[theology]] or [[ethics]] related to earth, nature and land. Contemporarily, such connections are increasingly being revived or rearticulated through ethical positions expressed for example in statements that many of the mainstream faiths have produced, setting out their relationship to the natural world and their responsibility towards the planet.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

Sacred sites associated with living cultures always have institutions and rules associated with them. These institutions are usually religious or spiritual in nature and may be distinct from other parts of society, while in some communities of indigenous and traditional peoples, sacred site institutions are closely integrated within society with little distinction between the sacred and secular, the religious and civil.

The vast majority of sacred natural sites were arguably founded by indigenous or [[folk religion]]s and [[spirituality|spiritualities]], but many were subsequently adopted or co-opted by mainstream religions. There is consequently a considerable 'layering' and mixing of religious and other spiritual or belief systems. Within the larger mainstream religions there are many if not more autonomous or semi-autonomous sub-groups. While fifty per cent of the world's population profess to belong to either [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] and many others are [[Hindu]]s or [[Buddhist]]s, 80 per cent of all people ascribe to a mainstream religion, a large part of which continue to adhere to at least some traditional or [[folk religion]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. and Palmer, M. (1997)'The Atlas of Religion', University of California Press, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred natural sites are thus connected to a wide range of socio-cultural systems and institutions, some more complex than others, and to different dynamics of change and cultural interaction.

==Sacred natural sites, indigenous peoples and mainstream faiths==
Establishing a duality between '[[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]]', in the sense of being native or belonging to a place, and 'mainstream', while pragmatic for discussion, does present some problems. Several mainstream faiths can be considered indigenous in much of their range e.g. [[Daoism]], [[Shinto]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], while [[Zoroastrianism]] now has very few followers and is essentially no longer 'mainstream'. More problematic is that this duality renders invisible the many merged or [[syncretic]] faiths and folk variants of mainstream religions where elements of the preceding indigenous beliefs are still practiced. These folk religions can have much stronger nature ethics than the more symbolic orthodox form.

Within human history, religion has been used (or abused) as a tool of domination. These issues, although much reduced, have not gone away and some faiths still seek converts from other faiths. The destruction of [[sacred site]]s has been part of that domination and still continues today. Conversely, most faiths over long periods of time have peaceably co-existed and shared sacred sites. Mutual respect and accommodation have often been reached. Further compassion and peace-building lie at the heart of many religious traditions and belief systems.

==The distribution of sacred natural sites==
Sacred natural sites are, with the exception of [[Antarctica]], found on every continent and probably in every country. Some of them are surely among the oldest venerated places of earth and at the same time new sacred natural sites are still being established, in some cases by migrants to new countries.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N., Higgins-Zogib L and Mansourian, S. (2005) ‘Beyond Belief, Linking faiths and protected areas to support biodiversity conservation’, WWF, Equilibrium and The Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC).&lt;/ref&gt; Paleo-anthropological evidence indicates that earlier humans such as [[Neanderthal]]s practised the cult of ancestors in burial sites over 60,000 years ago, which is arguably one of the origins of sacred sites. [[Ancestor worship]] and veneration of [[burial ground]]s seem to be a common trait of every culture of modern humans, as well as the adoration of natural features of great significance such as high mountains or large rivers. Australian sacred sites may go back at least 50,000 years; [[rock art]] considered of a sacred nature date to 20,000 years ago, and some of the [[Neolithic]] [[henge]]s date from 5,000 years ago.

At a landscape level, [[anthropologist]]s have long recognized the sacred status that cultures have given to nature not only in specific sacred sites,{{cn|date=February 2017}} but also in larger areas of cultural significance and entire landscapes. Interest on the importance of sacred sites for living cultures has seen an upsurge since the mid 1990s, which has contributed to the exploration of new paradigms and multidisciplinary views to the advantage of both the understanding and conservation of sacred sites.&lt;ref&gt;Berkes, F. (1999) ‘Sacred Ecology, Traditional ecological knowledge and resource management’, Taylor &amp; Francis, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, D.L., Hubert, J., Reeves, B. and Schanche, A. (1994) ‘Sacred Sites, Sacred Places’, Routledge, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Posey, D. (ed.) (1999) ‘Cultural and Spiritual Values of Biodiversity’, a comprehensive contribution to the UNEP Global Biodiversity Assessment. Intermediate Technology Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Because of their diversity, origins, and different and varying degrees of sacrality of their elements, it is not really possible to have full knowledge about the number of sacred sites existing in the world today. Exhaustively documenting sacred natural sites would have to be done by bottom-up identification at the community level, which is not really practicable. However, estimates have been made for some countries, notably India, where at least 13,720 [[sacred grove]]s have been reported and experts estimate that the total number for the country may be in the range of 100,000 to 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;Malhotra, K C., Ghokhale, Y., Chatterjee, S. and Srivastava, S. (2001) ‘Cultural and Ecological Dimensions of Sacred Groves in India’, INSA: New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; India may be exceptional because of its size, cultural diversity and widespread practices about sacred groves, but it would not be unrealistic to estimate that sacred natural sites must exist in the hundreds of thousands.

==Importance for the conservation of nature and culture==
Many sacred natural sites have been well protected over long time periods and have seen low levels of utilization.  Many are demonstrably high in [[biodiversity]] and represent a strong biodiversity conservation opportunity.{{cn|date=February 2017}} Sacred natural sites also represent ancient and profound [[cultural]] values. The roles of sacred sites’ custodians from indigenous, local community and mainstream religions are expressions of dedicated efforts that cultures that have specifically, if not always consciously, cared for nature in various ways.

While sacred natural sites are connected to the [[human spirit]] and intangible heritage they also have strong material components. In addition to being places where animals and plant species survive,  they provide resources such as water and medicines and other [[ecosystem service]]s, they are the location of events and ceremonies, and traditionally are sites of education. They link to livelihoods in many ways and the concepts of cultural services and human wellbeing are associated with them.{{cn|date=February 2017}} They support [[pilgrimage]]s and [[tourism]], both of which have large associated service sectors and generate significant economic activity.

==A brief history in conservation==
Following a seminal workshop organized by [[UNESCO]] in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Lee C, Schaaf T. (2003) ‘The Importance of Sacred Natural Sites for Biodiversity Conservation’, Proceedings of the International Workshop held in Kunming and Xishuangbanna Biosphere Reserve, People’s Republic of China, 17–20 February 2003. UNESCO, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaaf T., and Lee, C. (2006) ‘Conserving Cultural and Biological Diversity: The Role of Sacred Natural Sites and Cultural Landscapes’ Proceedings of UNESCO-IUCN International Conference, Tokyo, Japan. UNESCO, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; international conservation organisations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[IUCN]], working with indigenous groups and networks such as the [[Rigoberta Menchu Tum Foundation]], started to explore ways to integrate sacred natural sites in their conservation work. A number of international events and processes followed, and case studies and scientific and practitioner articles started to appear in books and journals. In 2003 IUCN’s Specialist Group on the Cultural and Spiritual Values of Protected Areas (CSVPA) and UNESCO started work on guidelines for the management of sacred natural sites.&lt;ref name=Wild&gt;Wild, R and McLeod, C (eds) (2008) 'Sacred Natural Sites: Guidelines for Protected Area Managers'. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN&lt;/ref&gt;  This Group has advanced a significant amount of work on sacred natural sites, including through specific projects such as the [[Delos Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallarach, J M. and Papayannis, T. (eds.) (2007) ‘Protected Areas and Spirituality’, IUCN and Publicacions de l’Abadia de Montserrat. Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Papayannis, T. and Mallarach, J M. (eds) (2009) ‘The Sacred Dimension of Protected Areas’, Proceedings of the Second Workshop of the Delos Initiative – Ouranoupolis 2007. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN and Athens, Greece: Med-INA.&lt;/ref&gt; Among international conservation NGO’s, The [[Nature Conservancy]] has developed a planning tool for the conservation of sacred sites and cultural heritage in protected areas and tested it across countries in [[Central America]] such as [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Secaira, E. and &amp; Molina M E, (2005) ‘Planning for the Conservation of Sacred Sites in the Context of Protected Areas’, an adaptation of a Methodology and lessons from its application in the Highlands of Western Guatemala. The nature conservancy, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; WWF studied sacred sites in one hundred protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N., Higgins-Zogib L and Mansourian, S. (2005) ‘Beyond Belief, Linking faiths and protected areas to support biodiversity conservation’, WWF, Equilibrium and The Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC).&lt;/ref&gt;

==International importance of sacred natural sites==
The urgent need for the protection of sacred natural sites has also been recognized by the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the [[UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]]. The CBD in 2004 developed the Akwe Kon voluntary guidelines for the conduct of cultural, environmental and social impact assessments regarding proposed developments that may affect sacred sites and on lands and waters traditionally occupied or used by indigenous and local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2004, Akwé: Kon Voluntary Guidelines for the Conduct of Cultural, Environmental and Social Impact Assessment regarding Developments Proposed to Take Place on, or which are Likely to Impact on, Sacred Sites and on Lands and Waters Traditionally Occupied or Used by Indigenous and Local Communities’, CBD Guidelines Series, Montreal, 25p.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the political level, as described before, the adoption of the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] &lt;ref name=UNDRIP/&gt; is an important benchmark.  Article 12 in particular provides significant political leverage for developing appropriate policies for the protection and recognition of sacred natural sites at the national level. It states:  “Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practice, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; the right to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites; the right to the use and control of their ceremonial objects; and the right to the repatriation of their human remains.”.&lt;ref name=UNDRIP&gt;UNDRIP (2007) ‘Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, United Nations’, General Assembly, 61st session, agenda item 68, Report of the Human Rights Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacred natural sites and the ethics of research and inventory==
It is particularly important to raise the concept of free prior, [[informed consent]] (FPIC), which has emerged as a standard for engaging with [[indigenous people]] and local communities. This is particularly important with regard to sacred natural sites.  For many custodians of sacred natural sites [[secrecy]] is of the utmost importance and needs serious consideration and respect.&lt;ref name=Wild/&gt;  At the same time it needs to be recognised that research and inventory can be powerful tools for the communication and conservation of sacred natural sites.

==Sacred natural sites and global change==
Verschuuren et al. (2010) identified significant global changes, many of which affect sacred natural sites and their custodian communities.  These include:&lt;ref name=v/&gt;
*global human [[population increase]],
*modernity and erosion of traditional [[culture]],
*[[biodiversity loss]], [[Habitat destruction|habitat]] and species declines, [[species extinction]] and [[ecosystem]] damage,
*[[industrialization]] of [[agriculture]],  [[forestry]], [[Fishery|fisheries]] or other types of [[Land use|land]] and sea use,
*[[Mining|extractive]] and energy industries,
*growth of cities, [[urbanization]] and transport networks,
*increased conflict over [[natural resource]]s,
*weakened livelihood systems and [[poverty]],
*[[Social change|social]] and political changes and conflicts in the [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] realm,
*[[globalization]] of the dominant economic model based on continual growth, detached from ecological realities,
*decline in [[spirituality|spiritual]] values,
*[[climate change]].

Many of the drivers of these global changes are mutually reinforcing and affect cultural and [[biological diversity]] and the many services that sacred natural sites provide to human well-being. 

Generating a greater recognition of the sacred dimensions of nature focused on sacred natural sites is expected to be an important means of building public support for the policies that conserve biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the diversity of human adaptations to a changing environment.

'''Sakarya University Middle East Institute''' ({{lang-tr|Sakarya Üniversitesi Ortadoğu Enstitüsü}}, also known as '''ORMER''') is located on the campus of [[Sakarya University]] in Sakarya, Turkey. Its mission is to enhance understanding the Middle East and contribute with rigorous programs to research and teaching on the people, economies, religions and politics of the region. As part of this mission, the institute hosts graduate programs and organizes academic conferences and events. Almost half of ORMER’s graduate students are international, coming mostly from the Balkans, the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. ORMER has more than 10 full-time faculty and 18 research assistants.

==History==
The idea of Sakarya University Middle East Institute goes back to the year 2005 when the first issue of Middle East Annual ('''Ortadoğu Yıllığı''') was published by a group of academics including the founding director of the institute, [[Kemal Inat]]. In the aftermath of the [[Arab Spring]], this idea turned a concrete step with the opening of a master program on the Middle East under the Social Science Institute of [[Sakarya University]] in May 2012. At the same year, an online master program on the Middle East was also inaugurated. Those who opened Master-level programs organized the first Middle East Congress on Politics and Society between 9 and 11 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://researchturkey.org/middle-eastern-congress-on-politics-and-society-conference/&lt;/ref&gt;

After the opening of another Middle East program at PhD level, '''the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Sakarya University''' was established on 11 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2013/12/20131211-9.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the center was the effect of the [[Arab Spring]] on politics, society and economy of the Middle East. Accordingly, the second Middle East Congress on Politics and Society was organized in order to deal with effects of the Arab Spring on the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;http://ormer.sakarya.edu.tr/en/ii-middle-eastern-congress-on-politics-and-society/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:ormer.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Building of Middle East Institute]]
According to founding director of the institute, Turkey's need for academically-educated experts on the Middle East became a problem especially after two important political developments in the opening years of the 21st Century, rising interest of Turkey towards the Middle East region, and political turmoil following the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sakaryayenigun.com.tr/19039-uzmanlar-burada-yetisiyor-haberi.html&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by these political developments, the center reorganized itself as an institute. Therefore, Sakarya University Middle East Institute was officially established on May 25, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2015/06/20150605-25-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and all graduate programs and staff were transferred to this institute. However, the institute continues to use ORMER as its abbreviation. ORMER is a shortened form of '''Ortadoğu Merkezi''' (Middle East Center).

==Graduate programs==
'''Sakarya University Middle East Institute''' mainly offers graduate programs of study at both MA level and PhD level. Both MA and PhD programs cover a wide range of elective courses (such as media, international relations, postcolonial studies, religion, and sociology).

'''Master of Arts''' (MA) - This two-year degree program is research-focused, allowing students to produce an original 15,000-word thesis. The program’s interdisciplinary coursework emphasizes contemporary Middle Eastern politics, Middle Eastern history, Middle Eastern economies, and Islamic studies. Courses are lectured in Turkish and English.

'''Doctor of Philosophy''' (PhD) - This at least four-year degree program is research-focused, composing three stages, completion of coursework, a [[comprehensive examination]], and a dissertation. After student complete first two stages, they are expected to produce an original dissertation. The program’s interdisciplinary coursework emphasizes political theories with a special focus on the Middle East, Islamic philosophy, religious studies, and security studies. Courses are lectured in Turkish and English.

In addition to graduate programs, ORMER also provides courses on main Middle Eastern languages such as Arabic, Persian, and Hebrew.

==Activities==
As part of its mission, Sakarya University Middle East Institute offers a variety of opportunities including conferences, lecture series, workshops, and outreach activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://ormer.sakarya.edu.tr/en/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; The institute also publishes booklets, detailed reports, policy briefs, and short commentaries on current affairs of the Middle East.

The main activity of the institute is to organize '''Middle East Congress on Politics and Society''' biennially. Prior to the establishment of the institute, this congress was organized firstly by [[Department of International Relations, Sakarya University]] in 2012. The second Middle East Congress on Politics and Society was organized by the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at [[Sakarya University]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://ormer.sakarya.edu.tr/en/i-middle-eastern-congress/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Quds_hall.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Jerusalem Hall in Middle East Institute Building]]

==Ibn Khaldun Library==
The Ibn Khaldun Library, which is named after the leading Islamic sociologist [[Ibn Khaldun]], is one of the largest libraries collecting books on the Middle East in [[Turkey]]. It contains over 10,000 books, and many periodicals focusing on the Middle East. Although it is a newly established library, it includes a significant number of academic sources on [[postcolonial studies]]. The library also provides Web access to its own holdings, and the holdings of the main library of [[Sakarya University]].

The library is located on the first floor of the institute building.

==Periodicals==
In addition to policy briefs, and short commentaries published in its web page on occasion, '''Sakarya University Middle East Institute''' is the editorial home to a peer-review academic journal and a peer-review academic annual, both of which focus particularly on the Middle East.

[[The Middle East Annual]], ({{lang-tr|Ortadoğu Yıllığı}}), published since 2005, covers political, economic and societal developments in each country of the Middle East.

[[Turkish Journal of Middle Eastern Studies]] ({{lang-tr|Türkiye Ortadoğu Çalışmaları Dergisi}}),&lt;ref&gt;http://tjmes.org/index.php/TJMES&lt;/ref&gt; published since 2014, is a peer-review academic journal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6539">'''Science Education at the Crossroads''' is an annual national [[academic conference]], initially funded by the [[National Science Foundation]], designed to enable various stakeholders in [[science education]] to confer in a legitimate and productive manner.  The conference also claims to offer an alternative to the standard model of conferring and professional development.   Conference creators and coordinators are [[John Settlage]] of the [[University of Connecticut]] and Adam Johnston of [[Weber State University]].

==Philosophy==
Many organizations and conferences exist for science educators.  These include the [[National Science Teachers Association]] (NSTA), the [http://narst.org/ National Association for Research in Science Teaching] (NARST), the [http://aste.chem.pitt.edu/ Association for Science Teacher Education] (ASTE), and many others dedicated to specific fields (e.g., physics and chemistry) within science education.  While these organizations are adept at presenting research results or at sharing innovations in teaching, organizers and many participants in Crossroads feel that none of them provide a means for new research questions, policy directives, or general science education goals to be discussed and deliberated.

Crossroads uses the [[Vexation and Venture]] format for conference sessions in which an "Incubator Forum" allows for an interactive, discussion based and dynamic intersection of views.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, A. &amp; Settlage, J. (2008). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t6206m3q01x0v750] Framing the professional development of members of the science teacher education community. Journal of Science Teacher Education, 19, 513-521.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, A. &amp; Settlage, J. (2006, January). [http://physics.weber.edu/johnston/research/crossroads_ASTEproceedings_2006.pdf Science Education at the Crossroads]. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Science Teacher Education, Portland, OR.&lt;/ref&gt; This mode of interaction has been shown to engage presenters and participants in a way that new ideas and problems can be proposed, and the group takes on responsibility for a generative session.  In this format, problems (vexations) are dissected and their possible specific solutions (ventures) are proposed.  In this manner, the process of research and innovation is presented in a public forum in its early development stages, rather than after its completion, as would be the case in other [[academic conference]] formats.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, A. &amp; Settlage, J. (2008). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t6206m3q01x0v750] Framing the professional development of members of the science teacher education community. Journal of Science Teacher Education, 19, 513-521.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Settlage, J., Johnston, A., Meadows, L., Harkins, H., Kittleson, J. (2007, January). [http://physics.weber.edu/johnston/research/ASTE%202007workshop.pdf Professional Development at a Crossroads. Using Vexations as the Focal Point.] Workshop presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Science Teacher Education, Clearwater, FL.&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants represent backgrounds from science and education, and represent perspectives from classroom teaching, policy, and research. This variety of perspectives allows each participant to tap into expertise that they might not otherwise encounter within the typical course of their professional lives. In this regard the metaphor of a [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] describes a [[culture]] and place where people can meet.

==History==
Crossroads originated from a disenchantment with more [[professional conference|traditional education conferences]].  As a consequence, Crossroads was designed, utilizing the [[Vexation and Venture]] format, to make generative discussions a deliberate feature of the conference.

Crossroads has a history of finding a specific place and space each year for conferring.  Oscillating from venue to venue has allowed each year to have its own character, as well as allow people from specific regions to have more access to the conference.  Crossroads has been held at the following venues:
* Storrs, CT (2005)
* Ogden, UT (2006)
* Amherst, MA (2007)
* Alta, UT (2008)
* Portland, OR (2009)
* San Antonio, TX (2011)
* Providence, RI (2012)
* Portlandia (2014)
* Cleveland, OH (2015)

Crossroads has a history of inviting poets as keynotes to its conferences.  These have included:
* [[Taylor Mali]] (2005)
* [[Jimmy Santiago Baca]], joined by [http://www.yurcic.com/ Jason Yurcic] (2006)
* [http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/97 Marilyn Nelson] (2007)
* [http://www.herondance.org/David-Lee-Poetry-W191C49.aspx David Lee] (2008)
* [[Lawson Fusao Inada]] (2009)
* [[Naomi Shihab Nye]] (2011)

Additionally, illustrator/artist/educator [http://www.fredlynch.com/ Fred Lynch] contributed the keynote address in 2012.

Crossroads has also established a line of work that has called for scholarly work in science education to reach out to create significant impact in education.  This has been referred to as "scholar activism" by David Moss, Crossroads' first keynote speaker in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, D. M. (2005). Toward scholar activism.  Keynote address given at the Science Education at the Crossroads Conference, October 9–11, University of Connecticut.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other speakers have included John Settlage in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Settlage, J. (2006).  Prospects of pragmatism: The generation of science education adventurists.  Keynote address given at the Science Education at the Crossroads Conference, September 28–30, Ogden, UT.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Johnston in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, A. (2007). Orchestrations of Science Education Adventurism.  Keynote address given at the Science Education at the Crossroads Conference, September 23–25, Amherst, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidi Carlone in 2008, and Magnia George in 2009.  Conference organizers have contributed joint addresses in 2011 and 2012.

==Future==
''Science Education at the Crossroads'' has moved its conference each fall, from east to west and back again, through the year 2009. Most notably, [[National Science Foundation]] funding was established to fund the conference from 2007 - 2009.  In 2010, the conference organizers are considering next steps for future sequences of the event.

'''Southern Illinois University Carbondale''' ('''SIUC''') is a public research university in [[Carbondale, Illinois]], United States. Founded in 1869, SIUC has historically been the largest of the campuses of the [[Southern Illinois University]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icpn.museum.state.il.us/institution/morris-library-southern-illinois-university-carbondale|title=Morris Library at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university enrolls students from all 50 states as well as more than 100 countries. SIU Carbondale offers 3 associate's, 100 bachelor's, 73 master's, and 36 Ph.D programs in addition to professional degrees in architecture, law and medicine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irs.siu.edu/_common/documents/factbook17.pdf|title=Factbook 2016-2017|last=|first=|date=|website=irs.siu.edu|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.siu.edu/programs/index.php|title=Undergraduate Programs {{!}} 2017-2018 Academic Catalog {{!}} SIU|website=2017-2018 Academic Catalog|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gradschool.siu.edu/academics/|title=Degree Programs {{!}} Graduate School {{!}} SIU|website=Graduate School|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Pulliamclocktower.jpg|thumb|The Pulliam Hall clock tower has a carillon that is regularly played. This landmark tower has been incorporated into the logo of Southern Illinois University Carbondale.]]
[[File:Pulliam Hall (SIU).JPG|thumb|SIU Pulliam Hall during sunset]]

An Act of the Twenty-sixth General Assembly of Illinois, approved March 9, 1869, created '''Southern Illinois Normal College,''' the second state-supported [[normal school]] in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Howard, ''Illinois: A History of the Prairie State'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1972), 341.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carbondale held the ceremony of cornerstone laying, May 17, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, Eli G. (1955). ''Seventy-Five Years in Retrospect'', Carbondale, IL.: Southern Illinois University. pp. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt; The first historic session of Southern Illinois Normal University was a summer institute, with a first faculty of eight members and an enrollment of 53 students.&lt;ref&gt;"Southern Illinois University: the First Seventy-Five Years." ( Jan 1949). [http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=ua_docs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The university continued primarily as a teacher's college until [[Delyte W. Morris]] took office as president of the university in 1948. Morris was SIU's longest-serving president (1948–1970).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19991010060656/http://www.dailyegyptian.com/fall98/delytemorris/]&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Morris transformed SIU, adding Colleges of Law, Medicine and Dentistry. Since World War II, higher education has been emphasized as a goal for more students. Southern Illinois University grew rapidly in size from 3,500 to over 24,800 students between 1950 and 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptianaaa.org/SI-History3.htm/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328072315/http://www.egyptianaaa.org/SI-History3.htm/|date=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, a second campus of SIU was established at Edwardsville.  This school, now known as [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]], is an independent university within the SIU system.

== Leadership ==
[[Randy Dunn]] was the eighth president of the Southern Illinois University System. Dr. Dunn served as president at two other state institutions and was the state superintendent of education, appointed to that role by the Illinois State Board of Education. His career in education includes classroom teaching, serving as principal at two school districts, serving as superintendent for two Illinois school systems, and holding the rank of professor at two universities including SIUC. Dr. Dunn has served on a number of committees, councils and task forces, and he contributes to a variety of scholarly publications. 
Dunn received his doctorate in educational administration from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1991.  He graduated from Illinois State University with a master's in administration and foundations in 1983, and the B.S. in education in 1980.
Before coming to Southern Illinois, he served as president at two other state institutions — Murray State University in Kentucky (2006-2013) and Youngstown State University in Ohio (2013-2014).  Before that, Dunn was the state superintendent of education, appointed to that role by the Illinois State Board of Education.  He is not a stranger to the SIU System, having held the rank of professor in the Department of Educational Administration and Higher Education at SIUC.  Dunn started at the Carbondale campus as an associate professor in 1995 and was named department chair in 2000, before leaving to assume the state superintendency.

{{main|Southern Illinois Salukis}}
The '''Southern Illinois Salukis''' are the athletic teams representing Southern Illinois University Carbondale. The university first sponsored athletic teams during the 1913–14 school year, when they were known as the "Maroons." Students and faculty began lobbying for a new mascot during the late 1940s. On March 19, 1951, the student body voted to change the official nickname to the Salukis. The [[saluki]], the royal dog of ancient Egypt, was chosen as the mascot due to its reputation as a fast and tenacious hunter and because the southern Illinois region is known as "[[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siusalukis.cstv.com/ot/saluki-mascot.html |title=Southern Illinois Official Athletic Site – Athletics |publisher=Siusalukis.cstv.com |date=March 19, 1951 |accessdate=January 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708212123/http://siusalukis.cstv.com/ot/saluki-mascot.html |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salukis sponsor 16 varsity teams. Most compete in the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] (MVC), specifically in men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's golf, softball, women's swimming, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's track and field, and volleyball. The football program competes in the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference]] (MVFC). Men's swimming is part of the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC).

=== Cardboard Boat Regatta ===
[[File:Siucampus lake.JPG|thumb|Sunset over Southern Illinois University's Campus Lake.]]
The Cardboard Boat Regatta is an event held every spring semester at Campus Lake. Participants include university students and community members both young and old. The goal is to complete three trips around a 200-yard course on the lake using makeshift cardboard boats. There are three different categories for entries: canoes or kayaks, experimental boats and instant boats (boats created on-site the day of the event).

The idea for a Cardboard Regatta first originated in 1974 at Southern Illinois University. Richard Archer, a professor of Art and Design, dreamed up a final examination for students in his freshman design class. [[Buckminster Fuller]], then a Distinguished Professor at SIU, had espoused the principle of "doing the most with the least," and faculty members found it intriguing to apply these principles in their classes. Archer felt it would be a real test of students' creativity and three-dimensional design skills to build human-sized boats made only of cardboard, and more than 40 years later, it is still happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcbr.com/faqs.html|title=The Great Cardboard Boat Regatta FAQs|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160211185621/http://www.gcbr.com/faqs.html|archivedate=2016-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many communities, organizations and other universities around the country have joined in on the fun and now organize their own Cardboard Boat Regattas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7166">A '''story arc''' (also '''narrative arc''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-narrative-arc-in-literature-852484 "Narrative Arc – What is Narrative Arc in Literature?"]. ThoughtCo.&lt;/ref&gt; is an extended or continuing [[narrative|storyline]] in [[episode|episodic]] storytelling media such as [[television]], [[comic book]]s, [[comic strip]]s, [[boardgames]], [[video game]]s, and [[films]] with each episode following a [[dramatic arc]]. On a [[television program]], for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in [[comedy|comedies]], especially in [[soap opera]]s. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Lew, "Lew Hunter's Screenwriting 434: The Industry's Premier Teacher Reveals the Secrets of the Successful Screenplay", Peregee Books, a division of Penguin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Webcomic]]s are more likely to use story arcs than [[comic strip|newspaper comics]], as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term "story arc" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series ''[[Wiseguy]]'',{{clarification needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Boulware, Hugh (September 18, 1988). [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-09-18/entertainment/8802010198_1_wiseguy-ken-wahl-sonny-steelgrave "Hollywood Not Ken Wahl's Kind Of Town"]. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was quickly adapted for other uses.

Many American comic book series are now written in four or six-issue arcs, within a continuing series. Short story arcs are easier to package as [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s for resale, and more accessible to the casual reader than the never-ending [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that once characterised US comics.
A corollary to the absence of continuity, however, is that, as exemplified in 1950s DC ''Superman'' comics, no permanent change to characters or situations occurs, meaning no growth can take place; thus storylines repeat over time in an endless loop.

==Dramatic structure and purpose==
The purpose of a story arc is to move a character or a situation from one state to another; in other words, to [[Peripeteia|effect change]]. This change or transformation often takes the form of either a [[tragedy|tragic]] fall from grace or a reversal of that pattern. One common form in which this reversal is found is a character going from a situation of weakness to one of strength. For example, a poor woman goes on adventures and in the end makes a fortune for herself, or a lonely man falls in love and marries.

Another form of storytelling that offers a change or transformation of [[Character arc|character]] is that of "hero's journey," as laid out in [[Joseph Campbell]]'s theory of the [[monomyth]] in his work, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. [[Christopher Vogler]]'s ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]'' details the same theory specifically for western storytelling.

Story arcs in contemporary drama often follow the pattern of bringing a character to a low point, removing the structures the character depends upon, and then forcing the character to find new strength without those structures. In a story arc, the character undergoes substantial growth or change, which culminates in the [[denouement]] in the last third or quarter of a story.

==In television and radio==
{{See also|Serial (radio and television)}}
Story arcs on television (and also on radio) have existed for decades (one notable (albeit, unusual) example, from the so-called "Golden Age of Radio", being the 1946 [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] Summer-run docudrama serial, ''The Fifth Horseman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/The_Fifth_Horseman|title=The Fifth Horseman|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; which (in part) featured a four-episode arc regarding a hypothetical chain of events (spanning nearly two full "future" decades) surrounding a fictitious [[nuclear holocaust]]), and are common in many countries where multi-episode storylines are the norm (an example being the UK's ''[[Doctor Who]]''), as well as most [[anime]] series.

Many arc-based series in past decades, such as ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'', were often short-lived and found it difficult to attract new viewers; they also rarely appear in traditional [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] (one notable example being the science fiction "novel for television" ''[[Babylon 5]]''). However, the rise of [[DVD]] retail and [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] of television series has worked in arc-based productions' favor as the standard season collection format allows the viewer to have easy access to the relevant episodes. One area of television where story arcs have always thrived, however, is in the realm of the soap opera, and often episodic series have been derisively referred to as "soap operas" when they have adopted story arcs.

Arc-based series draw and reward dedicated viewers, and fans of a particular show follow and discuss different story arcs independently from particular episodes. Story arcs are sometimes split into subarcs, if deemed significant by fans, making it easy to refer to certain episodes if their production order titles are unknown. Episodes not relevant to story arcs (such as "monsters of the week") are sometimes dismissed as [[filler (media)|filler]] by fans, but might be referred to as self-contained or stand-alone episodes by producers.

===Usage in manga and anime===
[[Manga]] and anime are usually good examples of arc-based stories, to the point that most series shorter than twenty-six chapters are a single arc spanning all the chapters. This makes syndication difficult, as episodes watched in isolation often confuse viewers unless watched in conjunction with the series as a whole. Series of thirty chapters or longer usually have multiple arcs.

''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', for example, is a single story arc spanning twenty-six episodes. Other longer anime have multiple story arcs, such as ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', ''[[Higurashi When They Cry|Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and ''[[Fairy Tail]]''. The anime ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' adapts four different story arcs from the ''Dragon Ball'' manga, each with its own ultimate antagonist, along with original story arcs created for the TV series.

In [[condensed matter physics]], a '''string-net''' is an extended object whose collective behavior has been proposed as a physical mechanism for [[topological order]] by [[Michael A. Levin]] and [[Xiao-Gang Wen]]. A particular string-net model may involve only closed loops; or networks of oriented, labeled strings obeying branching rules given by some [[gauge group]]; or still more general networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levin, Michael A. |author2=Xiao-Gang Wen |last-author-amp=yes |title=String-net condensation: A physical mechanism for topological phases |journal=Physical Review B |volume=71 |issue=45110 |pages=21 |date=12 January 2005|arxiv=cond-mat/0404617 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.71.045110 |bibcode=2005PhRvB..71d5110L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The string-net model is claimed to show the derivation of photons, electrons, and U(1) gauge charge, small (relative to the [[Planck mass]]) but nonzero masses, and suggestions that the [[leptons]], [[quarks]], and [[gluons]]  can be modeled in the same way. In other words, string-net condensation provides a unified origin for [[photons]] and [[electrons]] (or [[gauge bosons]] and [[fermions]]). It can be viewed as an origin of [[light]] and [[electron]] (or [[gauge bosons|gauge interactions]] and [[Fermi statistics]]).
However, their model does not account for the [[chiral]] coupling between the [[fermions]] and the SU(2) [[gauge bosons]] in the [[standard model]].

For strings labeled by the positive integers, string-nets are the [[spin network]]s studied in [[loop quantum gravity]]. This has led to the proposal by Levin and Wen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Journal |title=Photons and electrons as emergent phenomena |first1=Michael |last1=Levin |first2=Xiao-Gang |last2=Wen |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0407140.pdf |journal=Rev.

To date, a rigorous derivation from LQG's spin networks to Levin and Wen's spin lattice has yet to be done, but the project to do so is called [[Event symmetry#Quantum_graphity_and_other_random_graph_models|quantum graphity]], and in a more recent paper, Tomasz Konopka, [[Fotini Markopoulou]], [[Simone Severini]] argued that there are some similarities to spin networks (but not necessarily an exact equivalence) that gives rise to U(1) gauge charge and electrons in the string net mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Quantum graphity: A model of emergent locality |first1=Tomasz |last1=Konopka |first2=Fotini |last2=Markopoulou |first3=Simone |last3=Severini |journal=Phys.

'''Structural linguistics''' is an approach to [[linguistics]] originating from the work of Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and is part of the overall approach of [[structuralism]]. Structural linguistics involves collecting a [[Speech corpus|corpus of utterances]] and then attempting to classify all of the elements of the corpus at their different linguistic levels: the [[phoneme]]s, [[morpheme]]s, [[Lexical category|lexical categories]], [[noun phrase]]s, [[verb phrase]]s, and [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] types.&lt;ref name="Searle1972"&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/19720629.htm John R. Searle, "Chomsky's Revolution in Linguistics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911081630/http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/19720629.htm |date=2013-09-11 }}, ''New York Review of Books'', June 29, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saussure's ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'', published posthumously in 1916, stressed examining language as a static system of interconnected units. He is thus known as a father of modern linguistics for bringing about the shift from [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] (historical) to [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] (non-historical) analysis, as well as for introducing several basic dimensions of [[semiotic]] analysis that are still important today. Two of these are his key methods of [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] and [[paradigmatic analysis]] (or 'associations' as Saussure was still calling them),&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand de Saussure, ''Course in General Linguistics'', Open Court House.&lt;/ref&gt; which define units [[Syntax|syntactically]] and [[Lexicon|lexically]], respectively, according to their contrast with the other units in the system.

== History ==
Structural linguistics begins with the posthumous publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's ''Course in General Linguistics'' in 1916, which was compiled from lectures by his students. The book proved to be highly influential, providing the foundation for both modern linguistics and [[semiotics]]. Structuralist linguistics is normally seen as giving rise to independent European and American traditions.

===European structuralism===
In [[Europe]], Saussure influenced: (1) the [[Geneva School]] of [[Albert Sechehaye]] and [[Charles Bally]], (2) the [[Prague School]] of [[Roman Jakobson]] and [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]], whose work would prove hugely influential, particularly concerning [[phonology]], (3) the [[Copenhagen school (linguistics)|Copenhagen School]] of [[Louis Hjelmslev]], and (4) the Paris School of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]].&lt;ref&gt;Siobhan Chapman and Christopher Routledge (eds.), ''Key Thinkers in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 107: "Algirdas Greimas".&lt;/ref&gt; Structural linguistics also had an influence on other disciplines in Europe, including [[anthropology]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[Marxism]], bringing about the movement known as [[structuralism]].

===American structuralism===
First, in America, linguist [[Leonard Bloomfield|Leonard Bloomfield's]] reading of Saussure's course proved influential, bringing about the Bloomfieldean phase in American linguistics that lasted from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s. Bloomfield "bracketed" all questions of [[semantics]] and meaning as largely unanswerable, and encouraged a mechanistic approach to linguistics. Those working in more or less the tradition of Bloomfield included [[Charles Hockett]], [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]], and [[Zellig Harris]]. Bloomfieldean linguistics in America was challenged by [[generative grammar]], initially articulated in the publication of [[Noam Chomsky|Noam Chomsky's]] ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' in 1957.

== Basic theories and methods ==
The foundation of structural linguistics is a ''[[Sign (semiotics)|sign]]'', which in turn has two components: a "signified" is an idea or concept, while the "signifier" is a means of expressing the signified. The "sign" is thus the combined association of signifier and signified. Signs can be defined only by being placed in contrast with other signs, which forms the basis of what later became the paradigmatic dimension of semiotic organization (i.e., collections of terms/entities that stand in opposition). This idea contrasted drastically with the idea that signs can be examined in isolation from a language and stressed Saussure's point that linguistics must treat language synchronically.

Paradigmatic relations hold among sets of units that (in the early Saussurian renditions) exist in the mind, such as the set distinguished phonologically by variation in their initial sound ''cat, bat, hat, mat, fat'', or the morphologically distinguished set ''ran, run, running''. The units of a set must have something in common with one another, but they must contrast too, otherwise they could not be distinguished from each other and would collapse into a single unit, which could not constitute a set on its own, since a set always consists of more than one unit. Syntagmatic relations, in contrast, are concerned with how units, once selected from their paradigmatic sets of oppositions, are 'chained' together into structural wholes.

One further common confusion here is that syntagmatic relations, assumed to occur in time, are anchored in speech and are considered either diachronic (confusing syntagmatic with historical) or are part of parole ("everyday speech": confusing syntagmatic with performance and behaviour and divorcing it from the linguistic system), or both. Paradigmatic and syntagmatic organizations  both belong to the abstract system of language ''[[langue (linguistics)|langue]]'' (French for "Language;" or an abstract, Platonic ideal). Different linguistic theories place different weight on the study of these dimensions: all structural and generative accounts, for example, pursue primarily characterisations of the syntagmatic dimension of the language system (syntax), while functional approaches, such as [[systemic linguistics]], focus on the paradigmatic. Both dimensions need to be appropriately included, however.

Syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations provide the structural linguist with a tool for categorization for phonology, morphology and syntax. Take morphology, for example. The signs ''cat'' and ''cats'' are associated in the mind, producing an abstract paradigm of the word forms of ''cat''. Comparing this with other paradigms of word forms, we can note that in the English language the plural often consists of little more than adding an ''S'' to the end of the word. Likewise, through paradigmatic and syntagmatic analysis, we can discover the syntax of sentences. For instance, contrasting the syntagma {{lang|fr|je dois}} ("I should") and {{lang|fr|dois je?}} ("Should I?") allows us to realize that in French we only have to invert the units to turn a statement into a question. We thus take syntagmatic evidence (difference in structural configurations) as indicators of paradigmatic relations (e.g., in the present case: questions vs. assertions). The most detailed account of the relationship between a paradigmatic organisation of language as a motivator and classifier for syntagmatic configurations is that set out in the systemic-network organization of [[systemic functional grammar]], where paradigmatic relations and syntagmatic configurations each have their own separate formalisation, related by realization constraints. Modern linguistic formalisms that work in terms of lattices of linguistic signs, such as [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]], similarly begin to separate out an explicit level of paradigmatic organization.

Saussure developed structural linguistics, with its idealized vision of language, partly because he was aware that it was impossible in his time to fully understand how the human brain and mind created and related to language: 
:Saussure set out to model language in purely linguistic terms, free of psychology, sociology, or anthropology. That is, Saussure was trying precisely ''not'' to say what goes on in your or my mind when we understand a word or make up a sentence. ... Saussure was trying to de-psychologize linguistics.&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;Holland, Norman N. (1992) The Critical I, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-07650-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent perceptions of structuralism==
Those working in the generativist tradition often regard Structuralist approaches as outdated and superseded. For example, Mitchell Marcus writes that structural linguistics was "fundamentally inadequate to process the full range of natural language".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Mitchell, (1984) "Some Inadequate Theories of Human Language Processing." ''Talking Minds: The Study of Language in Cognitive Science''. Eds. Thomas G. Bever, John M. Carroll, and Lance A. Miller. Cambridge MA: MIT P, 1984. 253–277.&lt;/ref&gt; Holland&lt;ref name="Holland"/&gt; writes that Chomsky had "decisively refuted Saussure". Similar views have been expressed by [[Jan Koster]],&lt;ref&gt;"Saussure, considered the most important linguist of the century in Europe until the 1950s, hardly plays a role in current theoretical thinking about language," Koster, Jan. (1996) "Saussure meets the brain", in R. Jonkers, E. Kaan, J. K. Wiegel, eds., ''Language and Cognition'' '''5'''. Yearbook 1992 of the Research Group for Linguistic Theory and Knowledge Representation of the University of Groningen, Groningen, pp. 115–120.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Turner,&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Mark. 1987. ''Death is the Mother of Beauty: Mind, Metaphor, Criticism''. University of Chicago Press, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;Fabb, Nigel. (1988) "Saussure and literary theory: from the perspective of linguistics". ''Critical Quarterly'' '''30''':2 (June 1988), 58–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Dylan. (2005) "From Lacan to Darwin", in ''The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative'', eds. Jonathan Gottschall and David Sloan Wilson, Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 2005, pp. 38–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others however stress the continuing importance of Saussure's thought and Structuralist approaches. In 2012, [[Gilbert Lazard]] dismissed the Chomskyan approach as passé while applauding a return to Saussurrean structuralism as the only course by which linguistics can become more scientific.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Lazard. "The case for pure linguistics." ''Studies in Language'' '''36''':2 (2012), 241–259. doi 10.1075/sl.36.2.02laz&lt;/ref&gt;  Matthews (2001) notes the existence of many "linguists who are structuralists by many of the definitions that have been proposed, but who would themselves vigorously deny that they are anything of the kind", suggesting a persistence of the structuralist paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Peter. ''A Short History of Structural Linguistics'', Cambridge Univ. Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of structuralist linguistics upon other disciplines==
In the 1950s Saussure's ideas were appropriated by several prominent figures in [[Continental philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and from there were borrowed in [[literary theory]], where they are used to interpret novels and other texts. However, several critics have charged that Saussure's ideas have been misunderstood or deliberately distorted by continental philosophers and literary theorists and are certainly not directly applicable to the textual level, which Saussure himself would have firmly placed within parole and so not amenable to his theoretical constructs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Tallis|Tallis, Raymond]]. Not Saussure: A Critique of Post-Saussurean Literary Theory, Macmillan Press 1988, 2nd ed. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Raymond. ''Theorrhoea and After'', Macmillan, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Therapy freedom''' is the freedom of [[physicians]] to apply whichever therapy their medical knowledge makes them believe to be appropriate. That often means:
# Physician have the [[legal right]] to prescribe an unlicensed drug.
# A [[health insurance company]] is obliged to pay for the treatment, regardless of whether or not it considers the treatment to be appropriate.

Therapy freedom, however, is limited to cases of no treatment existing that is both well-established and more [[efficacious]].

Therapy freedom is established in [[Germany]], where it is known as ''[[:de:Therapiefreiheit|Therapiefreiheit]]''.

It happened in 1963 when fast development of resources of [[Western Siberia]] began. In 1963 the decision to create the profile higher education institution training experts for an oil and gas complex of Siberia in Tyumen was made.

In 1994 the name was changed to "Tyumen State Oil and Gas University".

Today in higher education institution 35 thousand students on all steps of education are trained. The leading technical higher education institution of Western Siberia offers 36 directions of preparation according to programs of the higher education (bachelor's degree, specialist program), 31 directions of master's degree program, 37 specialties of secondary professional education, 14 programs of training in working professions and 8 directions of study in postgraduate study. Since June 2007 graduates and teachers of TSOGU can receive the European supplement to the diploma.

As a part of the scientific staff of TSOGU there are 225 doctors of science, professors, 787 candidates of science, associate professors. Among them there are 3 academicians, 4 corresponding members of the Russian Academy of Sciences and more than 100 full members and corresponding members of Academies of Sciences, the winner of the Lenin award, 3 winners of the State award, 7 honored worker of science and technology of the Russian Federation.

Partnership for many years connects TSOGU with the largest oil and gas, transport and service companies, such as OAO Surgutneftegas, OAO Lukoil, OAO Transneft – Siberia, OAO Gazprom, OAO Rosneft, Baker Hughes, "Schlumberger", "Halliburton", "KCA DeutagDrilling", "Repsol", etc. Today the higher education institution has signed over 190 contracts on cooperation.

The priority direction in this area is the conclusion of the long-term complex contracts providing training of specialists with the higher education, professional development of employees of the enterprises, carrying out Companies' Days, the organization of the students' internships, employment of graduates. The partner enterprises provide support to higher education institution in updating and modernization of industrial practice base establishing of the modern laboratories, audiences, computer classes, training centers. So, in higher education institution a set of personalized lecture halls, e.g. ООО "Rosneft, OAO Transneft – Siberia, OAO Lukoil, specially equipped with an educational program of Microsoft IT Academy, Slavneft-Megionneftegaz (JSC SN-MNG), "Schlumberger" lecture hall etc.

In TSOGU the Joint Council of Students (JCS) conducts active work. Members of JCS participate in meetings of the Academic council and administration; consist in the commissions conducting work on creation of local normative legal acts. As a part of Council there are more than 20 public associations of a social, scientific, military patriotic orientation. Since 2008 the Joint Council of Students and students of TSOGU is the best student council in the Tyumen region.

The Joint Primary Trade-union Organization (JPTUO) is the voluntary public association of the citizens connected by common interests by the nature of their activity, created for representation and protection of their social and labor rights and interests. Regularly trade-union activists become nominal scholars of TSOGU JPTUO and of the All-Russian labor union of education. Internal competitions in which everyone can participate are held.

In higher education institution there are a lot of communities, clubs and organizations for interests, e.g. International club considered as popularization of foreign students in public, creative, scientific and sports life of university; Intellectual club promoting the student's intellectual movement; The Tyumen student's office of the international society of petroleum engineers at TSOGU (SPE); Military patriotic association of "Panthers of Neftegaz"; Student information bureau is a community of nonprofessional journalists; Formula Neftegaz engineering design office; Student's Sports club "Neft", etc.

'''''The Venice Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites''''' is a set of guidelines, drawn up in 1964 by a group of conservation professionals in Venice, that provides an international framework for the [[conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] and [[Building restoration|restoration]] of historic buildings.&lt;ref name="Erder" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/erder.pdf |title=Erdem, C. The Venice Charter under Review. (1977). Ankara. |format=PDF |date= March 1977 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the document is now seen as outdated, representing Modernist views opposed to reconstruction. Reconstruction is now cautiously accepted by UNESCO in exceptional circumstances if it seeks to reflect a pattern of use or cultural practice that sustains cultural value, and is based on complete documentation without reliance on conjecture. The change in attitude can be marked by the reconstruction in 2015 of the Sufi mausoleums at the Timbuktu World Heritage Site in Mali after their destruction in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Christina''Reconstruction: changing attitudes'', UNESCO[https://en.unesco.org/courier/july-september-2017/reconstruction-changing-attitudes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic background==

===Athens Charter===
The development of new conservation and restoration techniques have threatened the historic buildings in a general sense.&lt;ref name="hx" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/history.pdf |title=ICOMOS. (2004). The History of the Venice Charter. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, the International Museum Office organized a meeting of specialists about the conservation of historic buildings. The conference resulted with the [[Athens Charter (Preservation)|Athens Charter]] for the Restoration of Historic Monuments. This consisted of a manifesto of seven points:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icomos.org/index.php/en/charters-and-texts?id=167:the-athens-charter-for-the-restoration-of-historic-monuments&amp;catid=179:charters-and-standards |title=The Athens Charter for the Restoration of Historic Monuments.

* to establish organizations for restoration advice
* to ensure projects are reviewed with knowledgeable criticism
* to establish national legislation to preserve historic sites
* to rebury excavations which were not to be restored.
* to allow the use of modern techniques and materials in restoration work.
* to place historical sites under custodial protection.
* to protect the area surrounding historic sites.

The Athens Charter proposed the idea of a common world heritage, the importance of the setting of monuments, and the principle of the integration of new materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/research_resources/charters/charter02.html|title= The GETTY Conservation Institute. Cultural Heritage Policy Documents: General Conclusions of the Athens Conference 1931 |format=Web page |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter had very progressive suggestions for its period, influencing the creation of conservation institutions, as well as the eventual Venice Charter.

===First International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings===
With the concern that listing and safeguarding historic buildings was not enough, in 1957 architectural specialists arranged a congress in Paris called The First International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings. At its conclusion, the congress published seven recommendations:&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;
# the countries which still lack a central organization for the protection of historic buildings provide for the establishment of such an authority,
# the creation of an international assembly of architects and specialists of historic buildings should be considered,
# a specialized professional training of all categories of personnel should be promoted so as to secure highly qualified workmanship and that remuneration should be commensurate with such qualifications,
# the hygrometric problems relating to historic buildings should be discussed in a symposium,
# contemporary artists should be requested to contribute to the decoration of monuments,
# close cooperation should be established among architects and archeologists,
# architects and town-planners cooperate so as to secure integration of historic buildings into town planning.

The Congress agreed to have its second meeting in Venice and Piero Gazzola, who was to serve as the chairman of the Venice Charter, was invited to hold the Venice Congress.&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;

===Second International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings===
In 1964, at the Second International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings, 13 resolutions were adopted of which the first was the Venice Charter and the second was creation of [[ICOMOS|ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites)]].&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;

The Venice Charter consisted of seven main titles and sixteen articles. The concept of historic monuments and sites was interpreted as the common heritage, therefore safeguarding them for the future generations with authenticity was defined as the common responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/publications/hommedecin.pdf|title= IInd International Congress of Architects and Technicians of Historic Monuments Committee. (1964). Decisions and Resolutions. Venice. |format=PDF |date= 1964-03-31|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following text is the original 1964 text agreed on by the representatives of the participating [[nation]]s mentioned at the end of the [[Charter]].

==Venice Charter Text==

===Definitions===
'''Article 1.''' The concept of a historic monument embraces not only the single architectural work but also the urban or rural setting in which is found the evidence of a particular civilization, a significant development or a historic event. This applies not only to great works of art but also to more modest works of the past which have acquired cultural significance with the passing of time.

'''Article 2.''' The conservation and restoration of monuments must have recourse to all the sciences and techniques which can contribute to the study and safeguarding of the architectural heritage.

===Aim===
'''Article 3.''' The intention in conserving and restoring monuments is to safeguard them no less as works of art than as historical evidence.

===Conservation===
'''Article 4.''' It is essential to the conservation of monuments that they be maintained on a permanent basis.

'''Article 5.''' The conservation of monuments is always facilitated by making use of them for some socially useful purpose. Such use is therefore desirable but it must not change the lay-out or decoration of the building. It is within these limits only that modifications demanded by a change of function should be envisaged and may be permitted.

'''Article 6.''' The conservation of a monument implies preserving a setting which is not out of scale. Wherever the traditional setting exists, it must be kept. No new construction, demolition or modification which would alter the relations of mass and color must be allowed.

'''Article 7.''' A monument is inseparable from the history to which it bears witness and from the setting in which it occurs. The moving of all or part of a monument cannot be allowed except where the safeguarding of that monument demands it or where it is justified by national or international interest of paramount importance.

'''Article 8.''' Items of sculpture, painting or decoration which form an integral part of a monument may only be removed from it if this is the sole means of ensuring their preservation.

===Restoration===
'''Article 9.''' The process of restoration is a highly specialized operation. Its aim is to preserve and reveal the aesthetic and historic value of the monument and is based on respect for original material and authentic documents. It must stop at the point where conjecture begins, and in this case moreover any extra work which is indispensable must be distinct from the architectural composition and must bear a contemporary stamp. The restoration in any case must be preceded and followed by an archaeological and historical study of the monument.

'''Article 10.''' Where traditional techniques prove inadequate, the consolidation of a monument can be achieved by the use of any modern technique for conservation and construction, the efficacy of which has been shown by scientific data and proved by experience.

'''Article 11.''' The valid contributions of all periods to the building of a monument must be respected, since unity of style is not the aim of a restoration. When a building includes the superimposed work of different periods, the revealing of the underlying state can only be justified in exceptional circumstances and when what is removed is of little interest and the material which is brought to light is of great historical, archaeological or aesthetic value, and its state of preservation good enough to justify the action. Evaluation of the importance of the elements involved and the decision as to what may be destroyed cannot rest solely on the individual in charge of the work.

'''Article 12.''' Replacements of missing parts must integrate harmoniously with the whole, but at the same time must be distinguishable from the original so that restoration does not falsify the artistic or historic evidence.

'''Article 13.''' Additions cannot be allowed except in so far as they do not detract from the interesting parts of the building, its traditional setting, the balance of its composition and its relation with its surroundings.

===Historic Sites===
'''Article 14.''' The sites of monuments must be the object of special care in order to safeguard their integrity and ensure that they are cleared and presented in a seemly manner. The work of conservation and restoration carried out in such places should be inspired by the principles set forth in the foregoing articles.

===Excavations===
'''Article 15.''' Excavations should be carried out in accordance with scientific standards and the recommendation defining international principles to be applied in the case of archaeological excavation adopted by UNESCO in 1956.
Ruins must be maintained and measures necessary for the permanent conservation and protection of architectural features and of objects discovered must be taken. Furthermore, every means must be taken to facilitate the understanding of the monument and to reveal it without ever distorting its meaning.

All reconstruction work should however be ruled out "a priori." Only anastylosis, that is to say, the reassembling of existing but dismembered parts can be permitted. The material used for integration should always be recognizable and its use should be the least that will ensure the conservation of a monument and the reinstatement of its form.

===Publication===
'''Article 16.''' In all works of preservation, restoration or excavation, there should always be precise documentation in the form of analytical and critical reports, illustrated with drawings and photographs. Every stage of the work of clearing, consolidation, rearrangement and integration, as well as technical and formal features identified during the course of the work, should be included. This record should be placed in the archives of a public institution and made available to research workers. It is recommended that the report should be published.

== Outcome ==
The Venice Charter is the most influential document on conservation since 1964. However the following aspects are not covered in the Venice Charter:&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;
* The concept of site which also applies to historic landscapes and gardens
* The concept of reversibility in restoration
* The social and financial issues

In the years after the publishing, the purpose of the charter a number of symposiums took place in order to improve common understandings and awareness of it by those involved in the conservation and restoration works of the historic buildings. How it was applied in different countries varied according to their social, economic and cultural conditions, as well as the technical qualifications of those applying it.&lt;ref name="Erder" /&gt; Translation mistakes and misunderstandings of the Charter also led to differences in its application.&lt;ref name="Erder" /&gt;

==Criticism==
The Venice Charter and its subsequent interpretations have attracted criticism, especially by those who perceive it was built upon the Modernist biases of its creators. Professor of architecture Samir Younés has written: "The Charter’s abhorrence of restoration and reconstruction – with its implicit fear of "false history" – reflects the Modernist theory of [[historical determinism]], rather than the idea of a living architectural tradition. Major advances over the last 40 years in traditional design fluency and building crafts skills have undercut and outmoded many of the assumptions implicit in the Venice Charter. As a result, many now believe that visual harmony, aesthetic balance and the essential character of a place are of greater importance than abstract Modernist theories."&lt;ref name="Revisit"&gt;Hardy, Matthew (Ed.) ''The Venice Charter Revisited: Modernism, Conservation and Tradition in the 21st Century'', foreword by HRH The Prince of Wales, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK; 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Issue is taken particularly with the words in Article 9: "Any extra work which is indispensable must be distinct from the architectural composition and ''must bear a contemporary stamp."''  This declaration has had a major impact on the management of historic buildings globally. In the U.S., for example, it shaped the Secretary of the Interior’s Standard #9 so it stated "...new work shall be differentiated from the old". It has been commonly interpreted to mean that interventions and additions have to be in Modernist styles, rather than being discreetly indicated by such devices as dated cornerstones and descriptive plaques. Many popular reconstructions now considered intrinsic to their locations, such as the 1912 rebuilding of the [[St Mark's Campanile|Campanile di San Marco]] in Venice, would violate the Venice Charter’s dictum: “All reconstruction work should however be ruled out "a priori".&lt;ref name="Revisit" /&gt;

Because of concern over the damage being to historic settings by the Venice Charter's misapplication, in 2006 another conference was held in Venice under the auspices of INTBAU (the [[International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture &amp; Urbanism]]). Its principal objective was to provide a theoretical framework that would enable new buildings and additions to be in greater harmony with their historic surroundings.&lt;ref name="Revisit" /&gt;

Critics of the Venice Charter point to the 2005 Charleston Charter as providing preferred guidelines for dealing with historic areas. It states: “New construction in historic settings, including alterations and additions to existing buildings, should not arbitrarily impose contrasting materials, scales, or design vocabularies, but clarify and extend the character of the place, seeking always continuity and wholeness in the built environment.”&lt;ref name="Revisit" /&gt;

==Revisions==

Beginning with the [[World Heritage Convention]] (1972), some of the limited explanations in the Venice Charter were revised. The understanding of cultural heritage, which was expressed as historic monuments, was categorized as monuments, groups of buildings and sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/|title=Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. (1972). 
|format=Web Page |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petzet" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/petzet.pdf|title= Petzet, M. .(2004). Principles of Preservation: An introduction to the International Charters for Conservation and Restoration 40 years after the Venice Charter.|format=Web Page |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on [http://whc.unesco.org/uploads/events/documents/event-833-3.pdf The Nara Document on Authenticity] (1992) carried out the responsibility to clarify the authenticity related issues which were expressed in the articles 6 and 7 of the Venice Charter.&lt;ref name="Petzet" /&gt;

In the Naples ICOMOS meeting on 7 November 1995; the question  [http://www.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/lemaire2.pdf ‘Should there be a review of the Venice Charter?’] was discussed with participation of Raymound Lemaire, the reporter of the Venice Charter in 1964. Thirty years after the Venice Charter, Lemaire declared that: "Charters are fashionable. They are considered to contribute to directing action. However they never contain more than the minimum on which the majority has agreed. Only exceptionally do they cover the whole of the issue which concerns them. This is the case with the Venice Charter."&lt;ref name="Lemaire"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/lemaire2.pdf|title= ICOMOS Scientific Journal: Raymond Lemaire: ICOMOS - un regard en arrière, un coup d'oeil en avant.

He pointed out the necessity of a new document, or an effective adaptation, with consideration of the need "to be addressed with caution and wisdom, with respect for all cultures and above all with ethical and intellectual discipline."&lt;ref name="Lemaire" /&gt;

The Venice Charter has itself become an historic document. While some of its guidelines are considered to have proven their worth by both its supporters and critics, there are now plans for it to be rewritten.&lt;ref name="Erder" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4175">'''World art studies''' is an expression used to define studies in the discipline of [[art history]], which focus on the [[history of art|history of visual arts worldwide]], its methodology, concepts and approach. The expression is also used within the academic curricula as title for specific art history courses and schools.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], and the courses at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are several expressions related to World art studies which are often used as interchangeable. Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme, ''World Art Studies''in ''Art History and Visual Studies'' in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks, eds. Matthew Rampley, Thierry Lenain, Hubert Locher, Brill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; provide some more specific definitions as following

* ''World art studies'' is a concept conceived by the art historian [[John Onians]] in the early Nineties as a new field of studies, global and with a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref&gt;John Onians, ''World Art Studies and the Need for a New Natural History of Art'' in "Art Bulletin, n. 78, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of World art studies differentiates them from ''world art history'' and ''global art history''. The expression ''World art studies'' was used by John Onians to rename the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]]. The concept of 'World art studies'' is similar to the concept of ''Bildwissenschaft'' or ''image-ology'' is equally multidisciplinary in its approach to analysis of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme make reference to the publication edited by Klaus Sachs-Hombach ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'', Surhkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Global art history'' refers to the study of art in present and recent past with a focus on the art worldwide and interrelated phenomena. This definition relies on the distinction operated by [[Bruce Mazlish]] between ''global history'' and ''world history''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mazlish, ''An Introduction to Glocal History'' in ''Conceptualizing Global History'', ed. Bruce Mazlish and Ralph Buultjens, Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''World art history'' refers to the study of art of the whole human history. A remark made to this expression is the use of the world ''history'' in singular (history and not histories); the use of the plural is preferred by [[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]], [[Real Spaces|Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism]], Phaidon Press, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], ''Stories of Art, Routledge, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
