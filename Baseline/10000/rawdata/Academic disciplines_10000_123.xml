      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3517">'''Agrometeorology''' is the study of weather and use of weather and [[climate]] information to enhance or expand [[Agriculture|agricultural]] [[crop]]s and/or to increase crop production. Agrometeorology mainly involves the interaction of [[Meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Hydrology|hydrological]] factors, on one hand and agriculture, which encompasses [[horticulture]], [[animal husbandry]], and [[forestry]].

[[File:Horta 150706 REFON.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Horticulture is strongly influenced by climatic variations, however small.]]

It is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]], [[Holism|holistic]] science forming a bridge between [[Outline of physical science|physical]] and [[Biology|biological]] sciences and beyond. It deals with a complex system involving soil, plant, atmosphere, agricultural management options, and others, which are interacting dynamically on various spatial and temporal scales. Specifically, the fully coupled soil-plant-atmosphere system has to be well understood in order to develop reasonable operational applications or recommendations for stakeholders. For these reasons, a comprehensive analysis of cause-effect relationships and principles that describe the influence of the state of the atmosphere, plants, and soil on different aspects of agricultural production, as well as the nature and importance of feedback between these elements of the system is necessary. Agrometeorological methods therefore use information and data from different key sciences such as soil [[soil physics|physics]] and [[soil chemistry|chemistry]], hydrology, meteorology, crop and animal [[physiology]] and [[phenology]], [[agronomy]], and others. Observed information is often combined in more or less complex models, focused on various components of system parts such as [[mass balance]]s (i.e. soil carbon, nutrients, and water), [[biomass]] production, crop growth and yield, and crop or pest phenology in order to detect sensitivities or potential responses of the soil-biosphere-atmosphere system. However, model applications still involve many uncertainties, which calls for further improvements of the description of system processes. A better quality of operational applications at various scales (monitoring, forecasting, warning, recommendations, etc.) is crucial for stakeholders. For example, new methods for spatial applications involve [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and [[Remote Sensing]] for spatial data presentation and generation. Further, tailor-made products and information transfer are critical to allow effective management decisions in the short and long term. These should cover sustainability and enhancement strategies (including risk management, mitigation and adaptation) considering climate variability and change. Papers are invited addressing these problems in the context of agrometeorological applications in “atmosphere” as an actual and important contribution to the state of the art.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weather.co.zw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=96&amp;Itemid=86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.com/journal/atmosphere/special_issues/agrometeorology|title=Special Issue "Agrometeorology: From Scientific Analysis to Operational Application"|publisher=mdpi.com|date=30 June 2013|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the earlier ''[[comédie en vaudeville]]'' and the later ''[[Singspiel]]'', its distinguishing characteristic is the use of tunes in a popular style (either pre-existing or newly composed) with spoken dialogue. These English plays were '[[opera]]s' mainly insofar as they satirized the conventions of the imported ''[[opera seria]]''.   Music critic [[Peter Gammond]] describes the ballad opera as "an important step in the emancipation of both the musical stage and the popular song."&lt;ref name="gammond"&gt;{{cite book| first1= Peter| last1= Gammond| year= 1991| title= The Oxford Companion to Popular Music| publisher= Oxford University Press| location= Oxford| pages=35–36 | isbn= 0-19-311323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earliest ballad operas==
Ballad opera has been called an "eighteenth-century protest against the Italian conquest of the London operatic scene."&lt;ref name=Lubbock&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962), pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of racy and often [[Satire|satirical]] spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short (mostly a single short stanza and refrain) to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story, which involves lower class, often criminal, characters, and typically shows a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period.

It is generally accepted that the first ballad opera, and the one that was to prove the most successful, was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' of 1728.&lt;ref&gt;J. Milling, P. Thomson, J. W. Donohue, eds, ''The Cambridge History of British Theatre: 1660 to 1895'' / edited by Joseph Donohue (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a libretto by [[John Gay]] and music arranged by [[Johann Christoph Pepusch]], both of whom probably experienced vaudeville theatre in [[Paris]], and may have been motivated to reproduce it in an English form.  They were also probably influenced by the burlesques and musical plays of [[Thomas D'Urfey]] (1653–1723) who had a reputation for [[parody music|fitting new words to existing songs]]; [[Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy|a popular anthology of these settings]] was published in 1700 and frequently re-issued.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "D'Urfey, Thomas".&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the tunes from this anthology were recycled in ''The Beggar's Opera''.

After the success of ''The Beggar's Opera'', many similar pieces were staged.  The actor [[Thomas Walker (actor)|Thomas Walker]], who played [[Macheath]] in the original production, wrote several ballad operas,&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt; and Gay produced further works in this style, including a much less successful sequel, ''Polly''.  [[Henry Fielding]], [[Colley Cibber]], [[Charles Coffey]], [[Thomas Arne]], [[Charles Dibdin]], Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity.&lt;ref name=Lubbock/&gt; By the middle of the century, however, the genre was already in decline.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WarwickWest1992&gt;J. Warwick and E. West, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they featured the lower reaches of society, the audiences for these works were typically the London bourgeois. As a reaction to serious opera (at this time almost invariably sung in Italian), the music, for these audiences, was as satirical in its way as the words of the play. The plays themselves contained references to contemporary politics—in ''The Beggar's Opera'' the character Peachum was a lampoon of Sir [[Robert Walpole]]. This satirical element meant that many of them risked censorship and banning—as was the case with Gay's successor to ''The Beggar's Opera'', ''Polly''.

The tunes of the original ballad operas were almost all pre-existing (somewhat in the manner of a modern "[[jukebox musical]]"): however they were taken from a wide variety of contemporary sources, including [[folk music|folk melodies]], popular airs by classical composers (such as [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]) and even children's [[nursery rhymes]]. A significant source from which the music was drawn was the fund of popular airs to which 18th century London [[broadside (music)|broadside ballad]]s are set. It is from this connection that the term "ballad opera" is drawn. This ragbag of [[Parody music|"pre-loved" music]] is a good test for distinguishing between the original type of ballad opera and its later forms.  Many ballad operas used the same tunes, such as "[[Lillibullero]]", and by about 1750 it had become clear that there was a need for new tunes to be written.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;  In 1762, Thomas Arne's ''[[Love in a Village]]'' presented a new form of ballad opera, with mainly new music and much less reliance on traditional tunes. It was followed in similar style by Charles Dibdin's ''Lionel and Clarissa'' in 1768.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;

''[[The Disappointment]]'' (1762) represents an early American attempt at such a ballad opera.

==Singspiel connection==
In 1736 the [[Prussia]]n ambassador in England commissioned an arrangement in German of a popular ballad opera, ''The Devil to Pay'', by [[Charles Coffey]]. This was successfully performed in [[Hamburg]], [[Leipzig]] and elsewhere in Germany in the 1740s. A new version was produced by C. F. Weisse and [[Johann Adam Hiller]] in 1766. The success of this version was the first of many by these collaborators, who have been called (according to [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove]]) "the fathers of the German Singspiel". (The storyline of ''The Devil to Pay'' was also adapted for [[Gluck]] for his 1759 French opera ''[[Le diable à quatre (opera)|Le diable à quatre]]'').

==Pastoral ballad opera ==
A later development, also often referred to as ballad opera, was a more "pastoral" form. In subject matter, especially, these "ballad operas" were antithetical to the more satirical variety. In place of the rag-bag of pre-existing music found in (for example) ''The Beggar's Opera'', the scores of these works consisted in the main of original music, although they not infrequently quoted folk melodies, or imitated them. Thomas Arne and [[Isaac Bickerstaffe]]'s ''Love in a Village'', and [[William Shield]]'s ''Rosina'' (1781) are typical examples. Many of these works were introduced as after-pieces to performances of Italian operas.

Later in the century broader comedies such as [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''The Duenna'' and the innumerable works of [[Charles Dibdin]] moved the balance back towards the original style, but there was little remaining of the impetus of the satirical ballad opera.

==19th century==
English 19th century opera is very heavily drawn from the "pastoral" form of the ballad opera, and traces even of the satiric kind can be found in the work of "serious" practitioners such as [[John Barnett]]. Much of the satiric spirit (albeit in a greatly refined form) of the original ballad opera can be found in [[W. S. Gilbert|Gilbert's]] contribution to the [[Savoy opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], and the more pastoral form of ballad opera is satirised in one of Gilbert and Sullivan's early works, ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walbrook|first=H. M.|year=1922|title=Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera, A History and a Comment|url=http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/index.html|location=|accessdate=24 June 2009|publisher=F. V. White &amp; Co. Ltd|chapter=IV|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043908/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/walbrook/index.html|archive-date=2008-05-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balfe's opera ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'' (1843) is one of the few British Ballad operas of the 20th century to gain international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Grout, Donald Jay, Hermine Weigel Williams [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xXZhKagLO4C&amp;pg=PA563 "National Traditions of Opera"], ''A Short History of Opera'', Columbia University Press (2013), p. 563 {{ISBN|0231507720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' of [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] (1928) is a reworking of ''The Beggar's Opera'', setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite. On the other hand, it uses just one tune from the original—all the other music being specially composed, and thus omits one of the most distinctive features of the original ballad opera.

In a completely different vein, ''[[Hugh the Drover]]'', an [[opera]] in two acts by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] first staged in 1924, is also sometimes referred to as a "ballad opera". It is plainly much closer to [[William Shield|Shield's]] ''Rosina'' than to ''The Beggar's Opera''.

In the twentieth century folk singers have produced musical plays with folk or folk-like songs called "ballad operas". [[Alan Lomax]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Burl Ives]], and others recorded ''The Martins and the Coys'' in 1944, and [[Peter Bellamy]] and others recorded ''The Transports'' in 1977. The first of these is in some ways connected to the "pastoral" form of the ballad opera, and the latter to the satiric ''Beggar's Opera'' type, but in all they represent yet further reinterpretations of the term.

Ironically, it is in the [[Musical theatre|musicals]] of [[Kander and Ebb]]—especially ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''—that the kind of satire embodied in ''The Beggar's Opera'' and its immediate successors is probably best preserved, although here, as in Weill's version, the music is specially composed, unlike the first ballad operas of the 18th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4136">'''Biotic Index''' (also called "Family Biotic Index") is a scale for showing the quality of an [[natural environment|environment]] by indicating the types of [[organism]]s present in it. It is often used to assess the [[water quality|quality of water]] in [[river]]s. It is measured from 1 to 10 and corresponds to the four basic water quality (Excellent, Good, Fair or Poor). The concept of the Biotic Index was developed by [[Cherie Stephens]] in an effort to provide a simple measurement of stream [[water pollution|pollution]] and its effects on the biology of the stream.

==Technique==
To assign a biotic index value to a specific water site, the tester first collects macro invertebrates from portions of the sample area of the stream, river or lake and separate them into groups of similar-looking organisms. More extensive testing can be done by looking for certain microscopic organisms.

Then an identification key is used to help determine which category or group the organism belongs in and allows a numerical value be assigned to that organism. A worksheet is then used to calculate the final value or score of all the organisms found. Depending upon the worksheet's equations, the score determines the condition of the water quality. 

==Usefulness of macro invertebrates==
Aquatic macro invertebrates have some general characteristics that make them very useful to assess stream health:
# They are abundant and found in water bodies throughout the world
# They are not extremely mobile  
# They carry out part or all of their life cycle within the stream or river.

Macro invertebrates limited mobility and extended presence in the water means that they are exposed on a continuous basis to water quality in that stream or river.  In particular, many of these organisms breath dissolved oxygen that is in the water. They are also easier to see at the time of sampling.

Not all the macro invertebrates found in samples are listed on the biotic index scoring sheets. This is because some do not rely on oxygen within the water for survival. Many are able to collect air from the atmosphere and hold a bubble alongside their body to use like a scuba diver uses a tank of oxygen. 

For those macro invertebrates that do rely on dissolved oxygen, some can only live in water that has a lot of oxygen.  Others can live in water that doesn't have much oxygen dissolved in it at all.  Generally, it is assumed that the more pollution there is in the water, the less oxygen.

==Classification==
The biotic index works by assigning different levels of tolerance to pollution to the different types of organisms. 
The types of macro invertebrates and other organisms found during sampling are broken into 4 groups:
# Pollution intolerant: These organisms are highly sensitive to pollution (Stonefly or Alderfly Larva)
# Semi-Pollution intolerant: These organisms are sensitive to pollution (Dragonfly Larva or Craw fish)
# Semi-Pollution tolerant: These organisms will be found in clean and slightly polluted waterways (Snails or Black Fly Larva)
# Pollution tolerant: These organisms will be found in polluted, as well as clean aquatic ecosystems (Leeches, Blood worms)

Some index worksheets combine groups 2 and 3 together, giving only 3 groups. Each group has a number assigned to it and is multiplied by the number of organisms found in that group. This is why identifying the type of organism is important.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9801">{{about|| the [[hyperpigmentation]] (skin discolouration) condition nicknamed "bronze disease" |Addison's disease}}

'''Bronze disease''' is the irreversible and nearly inexorable [[corrosion]] process occurring when [[chloride]]s come into contact with [[bronze]] or other copper-bearing alloys. It occurs as a dark [[green]] or a lighter fuzzy green coating on copper, bronze, and other copper-bearing alloys generally due either to contamination by salt water or after burial in dirt (as chloride salts are generally present in soil to some degree). If not treated, complete destruction of the affected artifact is possible. Transfer of chlorides from the contaminated artifact to other artifacts can spread the condition.

== Description ==
Bronze disease is the chloride corrosion of cupreous (copper based) artifacts. It was originally thought to be caused by bacteria. It is contagious in that the chlorides which cause it can spread the condition if they are brought into contact with another cupreous object. Despite its name bronze disease can affect any copper-bearing alloy, not just bronze. It is not reserved for antique objects but can affect contemporary metals like modern [[cupro-nickel]] coins.

Bronze disease ranges from vivid green to pastel green. It is commonly present in all colors in this range due to the series of reactions that cause it and there may also be tiny, possibly microscopic, blue crystals. Bronze disease typically affects isolated patches of the object in severe cases being a visibly and tactilely raised bloom of microscopic crystals as well as being associated with pitting. The patches of bronze disease can be scraped off the surface using a fingernail or a wooden pick. These properties are all in comparison with [[verdigris]], which is normally a duller shade, uniform across the whole of the affected object, and cannot be scratched off with wood or fingernails. Unlike bronze disease, verdigris serves to protect the metal.

As it relies upon the presence of chlorides, water, and oxygen, the absence of one of these three halts the progress, although any damage done is irreversible. Treatment for the condition typically involves physical removal of the chlorides (through scrubbing), chemical or electrochemical removal, and then isolating the object from oxygen, water, and future chloride contamination using an airtight container or a wax coating. These treatments may also remove any patina, loss of which is often seen as undesirable to collectors and conservators but is preferable to loss of the object.

Bronze disease is common or even ubiquitous on artifacts recovered from a marine environment due to the presence of chlorides in sea water. Coastal areas may also be hazardous due to salt carried in the atmosphere as well as the humidity. Absence of dissolved chlorides and oxygen in soil means buried objects may not be affected while interred (similarly, lack of soluble salts and oxygen means that buried metals may not develop a [[patina]] or that oxidation of the metal may be reversed). When an artifact is recovered, surface encrustations may hide and/or protect bronze disease.

Chlorides may occur in or on the metal due to contamination from soil, water (especially sea water), the atmosphere, human sweat, or be present as impurities when the object was created. In many cases chlorides may be present within the interior of the artifact; the disease may reoccur if not isolated from water and/or oxygen.

== Reaction ==
Initially copper is oxidized to the cuprous ion:

(1) Cu → Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The cuprous ion reacts with the chloride ion to form the insoluble white colored salt [[cuprous chloride]]:

(2) Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → CuCl

The cuprous chloride reacts with atmospheric moisture and oxygen to form a green [[cupric chloride]]/cupric hydroxide compound and [[hydrochloric acid]]:

(3) 4 CuCl + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·3 Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl

The remaining copper is oxidised by air to the cuprous ion:

(4) Cu → Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The cuprous ion reacts with the chloride ion in the hydrochloric acid to form the insoluble white colored salt [[cuprous chloride]]:

(5) Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → CuCl

The reaction then repeats from equation (3). It is the presence of two different white and green salts that lead to the fuzzy green appearance.

== Treatment and prevention ==
Initial treatment can involve placing the object in a desiccating environment. Deprived of water, the reaction cannot continue. However, re-exposure of the object to even atmospheric water can restart the process.

=== Surface treatment ===
[[File:Carbonate crystals forming on ancient bronze coin.ogg|thumb|Formation of harmless unidentified sodium carbonate crystals on ancient Roman bronze coin that has been treated in carbonate solution for bronze disease for four weeks and has been removed and rinsed several times. Video has been accelerated to ten times normal speed.]]

Removal of the chlorides is essential. In practice this first involves physical cleaning (with a wooden or even metal pick) to remove the bulk of the chlorides and then chemical treatment. One chemical treatment is soaking the object in a 5% [[sodium sesquicarbonate]] solution. This serves to neutralize the acid that attacks the metal as well as converting the reactive cuprous chloride to largely inert cuprous oxide. The oxide may coat the artifact with unsightly but harmless black spots or generally darken the metal.

The duration of soaking may be days to weeks or even a year for severely contaminated objects. The sesquicarbonate may remove copper from the artifact as it forms a [[complex ion]] with copper. Amateurs report that the patina may be stripped from the artifact but this is when the solution is boiled so that the carbonate rinse removes the chlorides in hours rather than the cool bath of long duration used by professional conservators.

Soaking in [[sodium carbonate]]—which does not form a complex ion with copper and is unlikely to affect the patina but is slower than the sesquicarbonate—or [[benzotriazole]] aqueous solutions may also be used. The carbonate is similar in effect to the sesquicarbonate. The benzotriazole does not remove the chlorides or neutralize the acid present but acts as a physical barrier to water, oxygen, and chlorides and so can be used as a final step in all cases but as a first or only step in only minor cases.

Use of tap water for initial carbonate rinses is fine as any chloride content in the water is low compared to the content found when the chlorides from the contaminated artifact have dissolved into the water. Later rinses should be with distilled water though it is to be noted that the chlorine of a chlorinated town water supply is likely to have evaporated from tap water inside 24 hours and therefore will not further contaminate the object.

[[File:Carbonate crystals formed on ancient bronze coin.png|thumb|Unidentified sodium carbonate crystals (white) formed on the same Roman coin treated for bronze disease. The green masses on the coin's reverse are a copper carbonate which formed in the region where the bronze disease was most prevalent. It will be physically removed to ensure that the chlorides have also been removed prior to further conservation efforts. The photos were taken some 20 minutes after rinsing and surface drying.]]

Instead of rinses, electrolysis may be used, often with sodium carbonate as the electrolyte and mild or stainless steel as the anode. This converts the cupreous ions to elemental copper. Elemental copper released from the chlorides may be redeposited on the artifact as a pinkish coating. A coin may take only hours, whereas a large artifact, such as a cannon, may take months.

Once treated, the specimen should be held in a dry environment and periodically inspected for recurrence of bronze disease as no long-term treatment has been confirmed.

=== Internal treatment ===
If chloride ions have penetrated beyond the surface more rigorous treatment is required.

This typically involves soaking in acetone to displace any water in the specimen. Then soaking in a [[benzotriazole]] (BTA)–[[ethanol]] solution to [[chelate]] the copper and make it unreactive. Pits and holes may be filled with zinc powder, which is then painted over with [[shellac]] coloured to look like the specimen.

=== Prevention ===
Waxes prepared with BTA are available commercially, the idea being that the BTA will prevent any reaction by chelating the surface copper and the wax acting as a physical barrier reducing exposure to water, oxygen, and chlorides. (However, coating an infected object with wax will not obviate the problem.) Storing the object in a completely dry or oxygen free environment will also prevent bronze disease as will isolation from contact with chlorides.

'''Climate change and gender''' is concerned with [[gender]] differences in the context of [[climate change]] and the complex and [[intersectionality|intersecting]] power relations arising from it.&lt;ref name="Olsson"&gt;Olsson, Lennart et al. [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap13_FINAL.pdf "Livelihoods and Poverty."] ''Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability. Part A: Global and Sectoral Aspects. Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.'' Ed. C. B. Field et al. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014. 793–832. Web.(accessed October 22, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; By altering the [[ecosystems]] of the planet, climate change, and more specifically [[global warming]], directly impacts the human race. These effects vary for different segments of the [[population]], specifically for people of different genders.&lt;ref name="Olsson"/&gt; In many cases, women are more [[vulnerability|vulnerable]] to the negative effects of climate change because of their lower social status in most countries. Many impoverished women, especially those in the developing world, are farmers and depend on the natural environment for subsistence and income. By further limiting their already constrained access to physical, social, political, and fiscal resources, climate change often burdens women more than men.&lt;ref name="Olsson"/&gt;

Locally and globally, both governments and [[non-governmental organizations]] respond to climate change. Some of these efforts focus on mitigating the effects of climate change while others aid societies in adapting their lifestyles to changes in their environment. Most policy responses in the late 20th and early 21st century either did not focus on the social effects of climate change or did not consider gender in these efforts.&lt;ref name="Roehr"&gt;Roehr, Ulrike. [http://www.unep.org/roa/Amcen/Projects_Programme/climate_change/PreCop15/Proceedings/Gender-and-climate-change/Roehr_Gender_climate.pdf "Gender , Climate Change and Adaptation. Introduction to the Gender Dimensions."] ''unpublished paper'' (2007): n. pag. Web.(accessed October 20, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of gender in climate change, however, not only means applying a binary male/female system of analysis on sets of quantitative data but also scrutinizing discursive constructions that shapes power relations connected to climate change.&lt;ref name="MacGregor"&gt;MacGregor, Sherilyn. [http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2010.01889.x "A Stranger Silence Still: The Need for Feminist Social Research on Climate Change."] ''The Sociological Review'' 57 (2010): 124–140. Web.(accessed October 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Climate change is a lasting variation in the global climate in response to natural and/or human factors.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;  Climate change, and more specifically global warming, can cause glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise, pushing saltwater into freshwater systems.&lt;ref name="Ecosystem Impacts"&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts-adaptation/ecosystems.html "Ecosystem Impacts &amp; Adaptation."] Last modified April 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Significant changes like the salinization of water push species to new locations, directly impacting global ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Ecosystem Impacts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective"&gt;Rodenberg, Birte. Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective: A Cross-cutting Analysis of Development-policy Instruments. German Development Institute, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Climatic changes affect weather patterns, increasing the frequency and intensity of floods, droughts, and extreme weather events.&lt;ref name="Climate change and extreme weather events"&gt;Mirza, M. Monirul Qader. "Climate change and extreme weather events: can developing countries adapt?." Climate Policy 3, no. 3 (2003): 233-248.&lt;/ref&gt; These types of conditions also result in natural disasters.&lt;ref name="Natural disasters and climate change"&gt;Helmer, Madeleen, and Dorothea Hilhorst. "Natural disasters and climate change." Disasters 30, no. 1 (2006): 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; While climate change is not solely destructive, the negative impacts of global warming on health and agriculture are greater than the benefits for the majority of the world and increase as global temperatures rise.&lt;ref name="Global Warming Positives and Negatives"&gt;Cook, John. Skeptical Science, [http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-positives-negatives-intermediate.htm "It's not bad."] Last modified January 13, 2012. (accessed April 22, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; A two-degree rise in [[temperature]] threatens 25 percent of all plant and animal species on the planet with [[extinction]].&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt; These climatic changes cause the most harm for the most vulnerable populations or those who lack the ability to cope with and adapt to climate change because of a lack of access to essential resources.&lt;ref name="Fighting climate change"&gt;United Nations Development Programme. [http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Complete.pdf "Fighting climate change: human solidarity in a divided world."] Human Development Report 2007/2008. (accessed March 18, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change is not gender-neutral"&gt;Dankelman, Irene. "Climate change is not gender-neutral: realities on the ground." Public Hearing on “Women and Climate Change”. (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Marginalized groups like women, children, the elderly, and the impoverished have less access to and control over [[resources]] and therefore are more negatively impacted by climate change.&lt;ref name="Climate change is not gender-neutral" /&gt;

==Gender differentiated vulnerability to climate change impacts==

Gender is the collective social differences between males and females, as determined by [[culture]].&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment"&gt;CARE. [http://www.careclimatechange.org/files/adaptation/CARE_Gender_Brief_Oct2010.pdf "Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment."] Care International Climate Change Brief. (2010). (accessed March 18, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Gender is one of many components of vulnerability to climatic change.&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa"&gt;Adeniji, Grace. "Adapting to climate change in Africa." Jotoafrika. no. 6 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the climate affect genders differently, magnifying existing gender inequality.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change"&gt;Aboud, Georgina. "Gender and Climate Change." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change is not gender-neutral" /&gt; Both women and men are affected by and vulnerable to climate change and global warming, but women often bear more of the burden.&lt;ref name="The Contribution of UNDP-GEF Adaptation Initiatives Towards MDG3"&gt;United Nations Development Programme. [http://www.gender-climate.org/Content/Docs/Publications/30_UNDP_GEF_MDGi2.pdf "The Contribution of UNDP-GEF Adaptation Initiatives Towards MDG3."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326164057/http://www.gender-climate.org/Content/Docs/Publications/30_UNDP_GEF_MDGi2.pdf |date=2014-03-26 }} Millennium Development Goals and Climate Change Adaptation. (2010). (accessed March 18, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; This higher vulnerability is mostly not due to biological or physical differences, but is formed by the social, institutional and legal context. Subsequently, Vulnerability is less an intrinsic feature of women and girls but rather a product of their [[marginalization]].&lt;ref name="Birkmann"&gt;Birkmann, Joern et al.[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter19.pdf "Emergent Risks and Key Vulnerabilities."] ''Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability. Part A: Global and Sectoral Aspects. Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.'' Ed. C. B. Field et al. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014. 1039–1099. Web. (accessed October 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, a study by the [[London School of Economics]] found that, in natural disasters in 141 countries, gender differences in deaths correlated to women’s economic and social rights in those countries.&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa" /&gt; Due to their social standing, women in developing countries are not generally taught [[survival skills]] like swimming or climbing, meaning they are more likely to die in a natural disaster.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr Virginie Le Masson and Lara Langston, [http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CDKN_Gender_DRR_PolicyBrief_Final_WEB.pdf Mind the gap: new disasters agreement must be more proactive on gender]&lt;/ref&gt; When women have fewer rights and less power in society, more of them die due to climate change, but when there are equal rights for all groups, death rates are more equally matched.&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa" /&gt;

===Agriculture===
[[File:Projected impact of climate change on agricultural yields by the 2080s, compared to 2003 levels (Cline, 2007).png|thumb|Projected impact of climate change on agricultural yields by the 2080s, compared to 2003 levels (Cline, 2007)]]
The poor and impoverished are dependent on the environment and its natural resources for [[subsistence]] and income; poverty research reveals that many of the poor are women because, as a group, they have less social power.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt;
Many women in [[developing countries]] are farmers, but women as a group have trouble obtaining education, income, land, livestock, and technology, meaning climate change may negatively impact female farmers more than male farmers by further limiting their resources.&lt;ref name="Women in Agriculture"&gt;FAO. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i2050e/i2050e.pdf "Women in Agriculture: Closing the gender gap for development."] The State of Food and Agriculture. (2011) (accessed March 18, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, women produced between 60 and 80 percent of all food in the developing world, yet they owned ten percent of all agricultural land and approximately two percent of land rights.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt;

As the planet warms and access to water changes, the crop yields tend to decrease.&lt;ref name="Climate change and food supply"&gt;Rosenzweig, Cynthia, and Martin L. Parry. "Potential impact of climate change on world food supply." Nature 367, no. 6459 (1994): 133-138.&lt;/ref&gt; These effects are not uniform, and they have the largest impact on areas of the world where the economy depends on agriculture and the climate is sensitive to change.&lt;ref name="Climate change and food supply" /&gt; In developing countries, women are often in charge of obtaining water, firewood, and other resources for their families, but these resources are directly impacted by climate change, meaning women must travel further and work longer to access them during crisis.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt; Climate change increases burdens placed on women by society and further limits their access to education and employment.&lt;ref name="The Contribution of UNDP-GEF Adaptation Initiatives Towards MDG3" /&gt;

===Sexual abuse and disease transmission===
Natural disasters disrupt daily routines and complicate gender and family roles, which can cause victims of natural disasters to feel powerless and frustrated.&lt;ref name="Abuse and natural disasters"&gt;Curtis, Thom, Brent C. Miller, and E. Helen Berry. "Changes in reports and incidence of child abuse following natural disasters." Child abuse &amp; neglect 24, no. 9 (2000): 1151-1162.&lt;/ref&gt; These feelings often result in aggression against less powerful groups.&lt;ref name="Abuse and natural disasters" /&gt; Women and children in developed and developing countries are at higher risk of [[sexual abuse]] during and after natural disasters than before.&lt;ref name="Building gendered approaches"&gt;Lane, Ruth, and Rebecca McNaught. "Building gendered approaches to adaptation in the Pacific." Gender &amp; Development. 17. no. 1 (2009): 67 - 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Condom use during disasters is also lower than at other times, because of decreased access to condoms.&lt;ref name="Building gendered approaches" /&gt; Combined with the accelerated spread of diseases and infections in developing countries, the breakdown of the social order and the malnourishment that sometimes accompanies climate change have led to higher rates of dengue fever, malaria, [[HIV]], and STI transmission, especially for women.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Building gendered approaches" /&gt; Elderly women are also particularly at risk during natural disasters and times of crisis because they are more susceptible to climatically-induced health risks like disease and because they are often isolated from social support to which men and some younger women have access.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt;

===Increased inequalities through climate change===
Not only the impacts of  The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] concludes that there is ‘robust evidence’ for an increase of gender inequalities as a result of weather events as well as for the perpetuation of differential vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="Olsson" /&gt; The increase of inequalities due to climate change can have several reasons. For example, girls often face more serious risks than boys due to unequal distribution of scarce resources within the household. This effect is amplified by climate change induced resource scarcity.&lt;ref name="Demetriades"&gt;Demetriades, Justina, and Emily Esplen. [http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1759-5436.2008.tb00473.x "The Gender Dimensions of Poverty and Climate Change Adaptation."] ''IDS Bulletin'' 39.4 (2009): 24–31. Web.(accessed October 26, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, Climate change often results in an increase of out-migration of men. This leaves women with an increased work-load at home, resulting in a ''feminization of responsibilities''.&lt;ref name="Olsson" /&gt; Climate change is predicted to increase frequency and magnitude of natural hazards such as extreme heat.&lt;ref name="Birkmann" /&gt; During and after these hazards especially women are burdened with increased care work for children, the sick and old, adding furthermore to already significant amount of household duties.&lt;ref name="Olsson" /&gt;

==Climate change policy==
Some scholars believe that climate change policy that does not address gender is not effective.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt; Much of the climate change policy created before the 21st century focused on economic rather than social effects of climatic change and global warming.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change is not gender-neutral" /&gt; Climate change research and policy began to look at gender in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt; The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW), the [[Millennium Development Goals]], and the [[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing Platform for Action]] are all gender-aware initiatives that may affect climate change policy.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt; While women in rural areas depend on the environment heavily, they are not usually represented in climate change decision-making processes, whether those processes are adaptative or mitigative.&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa" /&gt;

Some of the international responses to climate change that do not address gender or employ gender-sensitive approaches include Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the [[Kyoto Protocol]], the [[Bali Action Plan]], and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt; As of 2009, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) is the only international climate change response to have incorporated gender dimensions.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt;

===Mitigation and adaptation efforts===
[[Climate change mitigation|Mitigative policy]] attempts to moderate the intensity of global warming’s effects through measures like reducing [[greenhouse gases]] and enhancing sinks.&lt;ref name="Annex I: glossary"&gt;Verbruggen, A. "Annex I: glossary." Climate Change (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; According to research, men and women use their knowledge of their environments to mitigate disasters, transferring this knowledge through informal education.&lt;ref name="Building gendered approaches" /&gt; Some of this knowledge includes food preservation processes, methods of construction, and understanding of natural resources in the area.&lt;ref name="Building gendered approaches" /&gt; Examples of mitigative efforts include [[carbon emissions trading]].&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt; Mitigative efforts largely ignore gender.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;

[[Adaptation to global warming|Adaptive policy]] involves spontaneous or planned efforts to tolerate the negative effects of climate change and take advantage of the beneficial effects.&lt;ref name="Glossary of climate change acronyms"&gt;United Nations. [http://unfccc.int/essential_background/glossary/items/3666.php "Glossary of climate change acronyms."] United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. (2012). (accessed March 18, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women respond differently to climate change&lt;ref name="Hardee"&gt;Hardee, Karen. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19923153 "Population, Gender, and Climate Change."] ''BMJ (Clinical research ed.)'' 339.7731 (2009): 1157-1158. Web.(accessed October 20, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and  subsequently also to adaptation measures, which can affect men and women unequally, when the gender perspective is ignored in the policy.&lt;ref name="Roehr"/&gt; For example, the IPCC report AR5 points out that adaptation measures in agriculture can in some cases lead to increased gender inequalities.&lt;ref name="Cramer"&gt;Cramer, Wolfgang et al. [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap18_FINAL.pdf "Detection and Attribution of Observed Impacts."] ''Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability. Part A: Global and Sectoral Aspects. Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.'' Ed. C. B. Field et al. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014. 979–1037. Web.(accessed October 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Women can be important players in climate change policy because they have gendered knowledge about things like managing water resources.&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Change and Gender Justice"&gt;Terry, Geraldine. Climate Change and Gender Justice. Oxfam GB, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; CARE’s research shows that, when women are in control of the family income, it is more likely to be spent on human development.&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment" /&gt; Women are also generally more risk averse than men and make safer decisions.&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment" /&gt; Yet, in 2008, the EU Commission and Council on adaptation policy did not address gender at all.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt; Furthermore, gender roles and subsequent institutional and social pressures can pose constraints to adaptive capacities.&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;Klein, Richard J.T. et al.  [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap16_FINAL.pdf "Adaptation Opportunities, Constraints, and Limits."] ''Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability. Part A: Global and Sectoral Aspects. Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.'' Ed. C. B. Field et al. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014. 899–943. Web.(accessed October 22, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; One research by Jabeen&lt;ref name="Jabeen"&gt;Jabeen, H. [http://eau.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0956247813517851 "Adapting the Built Environment: The Role of Gender in Shaping Vulnerability and Resilience to Climate Extremes in Dhaka."] ''Environment and Urbanization'' 26.1 (2014): 147–165.(accessed September 3, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; points out the impact of spatial practices that manifest power relations and marginalise women. This decreases the ability of women to make decisions and subsequently their adaptive capacity. Some feminist scholars therefore maintain that fundamental patriarchal structures are mainly responsible for the inability to adapt to and mitigate climate change.&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;Boyd, Emily. [https://archive.is/20141027174654/http://practicalaction.metapress.com/content/j61l8q/?genre=issue&amp;id=doi:10.3362/9781780440088 "The Noel Kempff Project in Bolivia: Gender, Power, and Decision-Making in Climate Mitigation."] ''Climate Change and Gender Justice. Ed. Geraldine Terry and Caroline Sweetman.'' Warwickshire: Practical Action Publishing, Oxfam GB, 2009. 101–110. Web.(accessed October 24, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy recommendations===
Some scholars recommend incorporating gender dimensions into research and using human-rights approaches like the Millennium Development Goals and CEDAW as frameworks for climate change responses.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Terry"&gt;Terry, Geraldine. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13552070802696839 "No Climate Justice without Gender Justice: An Overview of the Issues."] ''Gender &amp; Development'' 17.1 (2009): 5–18. Web.(accessed October 23, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Several organizations believe that linking mitigation and adaptation approaches, equally funding both types of efforts, and integrating gender into mitigative and adaptive policies will better address the consequences of climate change.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa" /&gt; The UNDP mandates [[gender mainstreaming]] in all adaptation measures, meaning adaptive responses to climate change must consider gender and gender equality from their inception and cannot incorporate a gender component late in their development or only in certain areas.&lt;ref name="The Contribution of UNDP-GEF Adaptation Initiatives Towards MDG3" /&gt; Others believe that imposing mainstreaming agendas on communities can make gender-sensitive policy less effective and may even be counter-productive, emphasizing gender differences and isolating gender issues from other areas affected by climate change.&lt;ref name="Building gendered approaches" /&gt;  Most scholars and organizations working to address climate change agree that policy-makers must work with both women and men and take them into consideration at all levels.&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment" /&gt;

In 2009, a forest-protection mechanism called [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] (REDD) was agreed upon by attendees of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt; Many development organizations praise the REDD mechanism, but others criticize its function as a market-based instrument and its impact on local communities.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt;

Gender inequalities do not only emerge in context of climate change as a physical reality, but also within discourses of and negotiations over climate change.&lt;ref name="MacGregor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuana"&gt;Tuana, Nancy. [https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-94-007-5518-5 "Gendering Climate Knowledge for Justice: Catalyzing a New Research Agenda."] ''Research, Action and Policy: Addressing the Gendered Impacts of Climate Change.'' Ed. Margaret Alston and Kerri Whittenbury. Dordrecht: Springer Netherlands, 2013. 17–31. Web.(accessed October 21, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the fact that men are dominant in all levels of climate change debate&lt;ref name="Boyd" /&gt; – from the science to policy, from the local to the global level.&lt;ref name="MacGregor" /&gt; 
This has an effect on climate change policies. Roehr&lt;ref name="Roehr" /&gt; notes that, while the United Nations officially committed to gender mainstreaming, in practice gender equality is not reached in the context of climate change. Little data and research results in insufficient gender awareness in enacted gender policies.&lt;ref name="Roehr" /&gt;

===Gender Differentiated Contribution to and perception of climate change===
[[File:Wangari_Maathai_in_Nairobi.jpg|thumbnail|right|“Women hold the key to Climate’s Future” - Wangari Maathai]]
Contribution to climate change is correlated to gender.&lt;ref name="Boyd" /&gt; A study on car use in Sweden for example found that men are more likely to use the car more, for longer distances and alone compared to women, thereby exhausting more CO2 than women.&lt;ref name="Polk"&gt;Polk, Merritt. [http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1361920902000342 "Are Women Potentially More Accommodating than Men to a Sustainable Transportation System in Sweden?"] ''Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment'' 8.2 (2003): 75–95. Web. (accessed October 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; A study of young people in Finland shows that concern over climate change has a higher impact on climate friendly consumption in women compared to men.&lt;ref name="Korkala"&gt;orkala, Essi a E, Timo T Hugg, and Jouni J K Jaakkola. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=4019576&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract "Awareness of Climate Change and the Dietary Choices of Young Adults in Finland: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study."] ''PLoS ONE'' 9.5 (2014): 1-9. Web.(accessed October 20, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
This may be incidental to differences in perception of climate change.&lt;ref name="McCright2010"&gt;McCright, Aaron M. [https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11111-010-0113-1 "The Effects of Gender on Climate Change Knowledge and Concern in the American Public."] ''Population and Environment'' 32.1 (2010): 66–87. Web.(accessed October 8, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Women tend to agree with the scientific opinion that anthropogenic pollution is mainly responsible for climate change (m: 56%, f: 64%) and are more concerned about its effects: 29% of men and 35% of women in the US "worry about global warming a great deal".&lt;ref name="McCright2010" /&gt;
Women furthermore possess unique skills and knowledge, which are important in building equal and sustainable responses to climate change.&lt;ref name="Habtezion"&gt;Habtezion, Zerisenay. [http://www.gender-climate.org/Content/Docs/Publications/UNDP_Policy-Brief-Overview-of-linkages-between-gender-and-climate-change.pdf "Overview of Linkages between Gender and Climate Change."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106111318/http://www.gender-climate.org/Content/Docs/Publications/UNDP_Policy-Brief-Overview-of-linkages-between-gender-and-climate-change.pdf |date=2014-11-06 }} Ed. Lance W. Garmer. New York: United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 2012. Web.(accessed October 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The UNFPA report State of world population 2009 - Facing a changing world: women, population and climate identifies women as important actors in mobilizing against climate change.&lt;ref name="Engelmann"&gt;Engelmann, Robert, and Richard Kollodge. [http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2009/state_of_world_population_2009.pdf "UNFPA State of world population 2009 - Facing a changing world: women, population and climate"] New York: N. p., 2009. Web.(accessed October 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  The report quotes Wangari Maathai that “Women hold the key to Climate’s Future”; “when we talk about reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation, we need to focus on women […]”&lt;ref name="Engelmann" /&gt;

===Gender in Climate Science===
According to a survey conducted IPCC WGI Co-Chairs and Technical Support Unit (TSU) on April 25, 2014, many of the polled authors stated that they saw the need for a better gender balance.&lt;ref name="WGI Questionnaire"&gt;IPCC.

[http://www.climatechange2013.org/contributors/ "AR5 Contributors, WGI."] N. p., 2014. Web.(accessed October 27, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies to other organisation, as for example only 7% of leadership positions in the offices of National Weather Services are women.&lt;ref name="Smyth"&gt;Smyth, Ines. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27752121 "Gender in Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction, Manila, October 2008."] ''Development in Practice'' 19.6 (2009): 799–802. Web.(accessed October 20, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; On a similar note, a study conducted by the University of Oxford in cooperation with the Nielsen Company found that 18 of the 22 ‘most influential spokespeople on climate change’ are male.&lt;ref name="Nielsen Company"&gt;Nielsen Company. [http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/publications/downloads/070709nielsen-celeb-report.pdf "Climate Change &amp; Influential Spokespeople Global - a Global Nielsen Online Survey."] ''The Nielsen Company and the Oxford University Environmental Change Institute'', 2007.

Some feminist scholars hold that the debate on climate change is not only dominated by men but also primarily shaped in ‘masculine’ principles, which limits discussions about climate change to a perspective that focuses on technical solutions.&lt;ref name="Tuana" /&gt; This perception of climate change hides subjectivity and power relations that actually condition climate change policy and science, leading to a phenomenon that Tuana&lt;ref name="Tuana"/&gt; terms ‘epistemic injustice’.
Similarly, MacGregor&lt;ref name="MacGregor"/&gt; criticizes the scientific discourse from a less quantitative perspective but focusses on discursive aspects. She attests that by framing climate change as an issue of ‘hard’ natural scientific conduct and natural security, it is kept within the traditional domains of hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name="MacGregor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt;

Rather it will ensure the stability of a patriarchal capitalism and subsequently the continuity of power for those who are powerful today.&lt;ref name="Seager"/&gt;

==Case studies==

===Bangladesh===
[[Bangladesh]] is prone to flooding and waterlogging because of its location as a [[river delta]].&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change and migration"&gt;Kartiki, Katha. "Climate change and migration: a case study from rural Bangladesh." Gender &amp; Development. 19. no. 1 (2011): 23 - 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh"&gt;WEDO. [http://www.wedo.org/wp-content/uploads/bangladesh-case-study.pdf "Climate Change in Bangladesh."] Gender, Climate Change and Human Security. (2008). (accessed March 18, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it was labeled a [[Least Developed Country]] by the [[United Nations]], with high rates of poverty and weak government, meaning it is especially vulnerable to natural disasters.&lt;ref name="Climate change and migration" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; It is densely populated and about 63 percent of its population was working in the agriculture, forestry, or fishing sectors in 2010.&lt;ref name="Climate change and migration" /&gt; Slightly less than half of Bangladesh’s population is women and, in 2001, 80 percent of women lived in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; Bangladeshi women are particularly vulnerable to climate change because they have limited [[Social mobility|mobility]] and power in society.&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment" /&gt; Research shows that, after the cyclone and flooding of 1991, Bangladeshi women aged 20–44 had a much higher death rate than men of the same age: 71 per 1000, compared to 15 per 1000 for men.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; Even if a cyclone warning is issued, many women die because they must wait at home for their relatives to return before they can seek shelter.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt;

[[File:Flooded village after 1991 cyclone.jpg|thumb|Flooded village after 1991 cyclone]]

As climate change progresses, access to and [[Salinity|salinization]] of water sources are becoming problems in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; When there is a lack of drinking water, women are responsible for procuring it regardless of the distance they must travel or the terrain they must cover.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; During natural disasters, [[male unemployment]] rises.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; When men become unemployed, women's responsibilities increase because they must secure and manage income and resources on top of feeding the family and caring for children and the elderly.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; As the number of men at home without income or occupation rises, more women report mental and physical abuse by their male relatives.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; To cope with climatic change, women store matches, food for the family, fodder for the livestock, medicine, and fuel sources in safe places in case of disaster.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; They also teach their children skills such as swimming to prepare them for crisis.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; The global relief agency [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] believes that climate-resilient jobs such as duck rearing can help increase Bangladeshi women’s resilience to climate change.&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment" /&gt;

Since the disasters of 1991, Bangladeshi women are more involved in disaster response decision-making, through local committees and community organizations established by the government and NGOs.&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; As part of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]'s National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), Bangladesh published a Poverty Reduction Strategy paper in 2005 that incorporated gender mainstreaming into its climate change adaptation plan, but as of 2008 those goals and policies were not fully implemented.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt;

===South Africa===
In 2010, [[South Africa]] was the region with the largest economy in [[Africa]], yet more than half of the population lived in poverty and many were unemployed.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study"&gt;Babugura, Agnes. [http://www.americalatinagenera.org/es/documentos/2010/cop16/cambio-climatico-sudafrica.pdf "Gender and Climate Change: South Africa Case Study."] Heinrich Böll Foundation. (2010). (accessed March 30, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Impoverished populations of South Africa depend heavily on agriculture and natural resources to live.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Coal and metal ore mining were also significant contributing sectors of the economy, but are decreasing in the 21st century due to climate change and [[globalization]].&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; In 2007, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) predicted that Africa would warm due to climate change 1.5 times more than the rest of the world and that South Africa, specifically, would be 3 - 4&amp;nbsp;°C warmer by 2100.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Water, agriculture, mining, and forestry would all be affected by these changes in temperature and weather.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; The [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|Human Sciences Research Council]] found in 2004 that 57% of South Africa's poor were at risk for negative climate change effects because they depended on rain-fed agriculture and climate change in Africa was expected to cause longer and more intense periods of [[drought]] over time.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Many of the rural poor in South Africa are women who have only limited access to property, income, credit, resources, and social power.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt;

In South Africa, men traditionally look after the livestock while women look over the garden, but in extended periods of drought, many households lose their livestock.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; In response to this loss and to increasing unemployment, men are turning to alcohol to deal with the [[psychological stress]].&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Some are also increasing their number of sexual partners, increasing their risk of contracting or spreading HIV.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; In response to these changes, more women are entering the workforce, either formally or informally. Some are now working in traditionally male occupations like mining and construction. Others are making and selling goods locally.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Social grants from the South African government further support households affected by the changing climate.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; These grants include pensions, disability payments, and child support.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; In some cases, when men are responsible for the distribution of social grants in the household instead of women, they use the money to purchase alcohol.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; In response, the government tends to give grant money to women, which can cause domestic disputes within households.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt;

Understanding of climate change in South Africa is based mainly on experience and local knowledge, which is communicated orally.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Women tend to hold more of this knowledge than men do because of their experience with farming and gardening.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; In response to drought, some women plant crops near [[wetlands]] or other water sources.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; They also preserve food for periods of drought or crop failure.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Despite their knowledge of climate change, many responses in South Africa (like the South African Country Study on Climate Change Vulnerability &amp; Adaptation Assessment) do not address gender.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; While women in South Africa are represented in the government on a provincial level, there are not many women in government at a municipal level.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt;

===India===
The [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]] commissioned a film to be made on the impact of climate change women in India. Directed by Krishnendu Bose, the film looks at the way in which women, who make up two thirds of the farming workforce, are poorly represented in agricultural policy. It depicts the challenges faced by rural women working in agriculture where drought and flooding is harming their livelihoods and ability to farm vegetables and fish. It shows isolated stories of success where resourceful techniques are integrated into farming despite challenges from climate change and poverty, such as Rita Kamila, who feeds her chickens over her flooded fields in order to grow the number of fish that now live in her fields. She is able to earn money from the growing fish stock. The film calls upon policy makers to support local initiatives like Rita's to bolster the resilience to climate change and to enhance the work that the women are already doing to protect communities against its risks. Currently only land owning farmers are entitled to government schemes, but only 10% of land owning farmers are women, thus it is critical to scale up women's access to government schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdkn.org/resource/missing-the-forgotten-women-indias-climate-plans/?loclang=en_gb Missing: The forgotten women in India’s climate plans]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5237">'''Computational magnetohydrodynamics (CMHD)''' is a rapidly developing branch of [[magnetohydrodynamics]] that uses [[numerical method]]s and algorithms to solve and analyze problems that involve electrically conducting fluids. Most of the methods used in CMHD are borrowed from the well established techniques employed in [[Computational fluid dynamics]]. The complexity mainly arises due to the presence of a [[magnetic field]] and its coupling with the fluid. One of the important issues is to numerically maintain the &lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot {\mathbf B} = 0&lt;/math&gt; (conservation of [[magnetic flux]]) condition, from [[Maxwell's equations]], to avoid any unphysical effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5198">In [[linguistics]], '''critical language awareness''' ('''CLA''') refers to an understanding of social, political, and ideological aspects of language, linguistic variation, and discourse. It functions as a pedagogical application of a [[critical discourse analysis]] (CDA), which is a research approach that regards language as a social practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosley Wetzel|first=Melissa|last2=Rogers|first2=Rebecca|date=2015-12-01|title=Constructing racial literacy through critical language awareness: A case study of a beginning literacy teacher|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898589815000352|journal=Linguistics and Education|series=Special Issue on Critical Language Awareness Approaches in the Americas: theoretical principles, pedagogical practices and distribution of intellectual labor|volume=32, Part A|pages=27–40|doi=10.1016/j.linged.2015.03.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical language awareness as a part of language education teaches students how to analyze the language that they and others use. More specifically, critical language awareness is a consideration of how features of language such as words, grammar, and discourse choices reproduce, reinforce, or challenge certain ideologies and struggles for power and dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luke|first=Allan|date=2012-01-06|title=Critical Literacy: Foundational Notes|journal=Theory into Practice|volume=51|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1080/00405841.2012.636324|issn=0040-5841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding linguistic variation, Fairclough argued that it is insufficient to teach students to use "appropriate" language without considering why that language is preferred and who makes that decision (as well as the implications for speakers who do not use "appropriate language").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Global capitalism and critical awareness of language|url=http://www.schools.ash.org.au/litweb/norman1.html|first=Norman|last=Fairclough|accessdate=2009-07-29|publisher=Schools on the Web|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909092406/http://www.schools.ash.org.au/litweb/norman1.html|archivedate=2012-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLA generally includes consideration of how a person may be marginalized by speaking a particular way, especially if that way of speaking serves as an index of their [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[social status]], etc.

Because power is reproduced through language, CLA is "a prerequisite for effective [[democracy|democratic]] [[citizenship]], and should therefore be seen as an entitlement for citizens, especially children developing towards citizenship in the educational system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clark, Romy|year=1990|title=Critical Language Awareness Part I: A Critical Review of Three Current Approaches to Language Awareness.|journal=Language and Education: An International Journal|volume=4|issue=4|pages=249–60|issn=0950-0782|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ437787&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ437787|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reginald Mpho Monareng|first= Rakwena |title=The Critical Language Awareness Perspective within the English Second Language Teacher Development|journal=The International Journal of the Humanities|volume=5|issue=1|pages=67–74|url=http://ijh.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.26/prod.968|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author2=Deborah Mehl|author3=Shirley Pendlebury |year=1991|title=Grey areas and open minds: critical language awareness for student teachers |journal=Journal of Curriculum Studies|volume=23|issue=5|pages=435–448|issn=1366-5839|doi=10.1080/0022027910230506|author=Mehl, Deborah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2633">The '''Doktoringenieur''' (acronym '''Dr.-Ing.''', also ''Doktor der Ingenieurwissenschaften'') is the [[Germany|German]]  [[engineering]] [[doctorate]] degree, comparable to the [[Doctor of Engineering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dict.cc/german-english/Doktoringenieur.html |title=English-German translation for: Doktoringenieur |publisher=dict.cc|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Engineering Doctorate]], [[Doctor of Science|Doctor of Science (Engineering)]], [[Doctor of Science|Doctor of Science (Technology)]] or a [[PhD]] in Engineering or Architecture.

It was first introduced in 1899, in the context of the centenary of the [[Technical University of Berlin]], at the [[Prussia]]n [[Technische Hochschule|Institutes of Technology]]. The other German states adopted it in the following years. In contrast to the other historic doctoral degrees (e.g. ''Dr. phil.'', ''Dr. jur.'' or ''Dr. med.''), the Doktoringenieur was not titled in Latin but German, and therefore written with dash (Dr.-Ing.).

In the field of mathematics, computer science and natural sciences, some universities offer the choice between ''Dr.-Ing.'' and ''Dr. rer. nat.'' based on the primary focus of the dissertation. If the contributions focus slightly more on applied scientific engineering a ''Dr.-Ing.'' is given, while a ''Dr. rer. nat.'' is preferred if the dissertation contains more theoretical scientific contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mathematik.rwth-aachen.de/global/show_document.asp?id=aaaaaaaaaeebmw |title=Promotionsordnung für die Fakultät für Mathematik, Informatik und Naturwissenschaften der Rheinisch-Westfälischen Technischen Hochschule Aachen vom 27.09.2010|publisher=RWTH Aachen|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be worth noting that a [[Doctorate#Germany|German doctorate]] is usually a research doctorate and is awarded in the context of the so-called promotion that also requires a dissertation.

It should not be confused with a [[List of academic ranks#Netherlands|Dutch]] double title ''dr. ing.'', indicating one holds a [[Doctor (title)|doctorate]] (Dr.) as well an [[Engineer's degree#The Netherlands|engineer's degree]] (Ing.) from a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] polytechnic (i.e. [[Hogeschool]]).&lt;ref name="onzetaal.nl"&gt;{{cite web|author=Aleid Fokma |url=http://www.onzetaal.nl/advies/titulatuur3.php |title=Bachelor-mastertitulatuur: titels combineren |publisher=Onzetaal.nl |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''drabble''' is a short work of fiction of one hundred words in length.&lt;ref name="WRR"&gt;[http://www.therecord.com/print/article/602546 "Winners named in WLU drabble competition"], ''[[Waterloo Region Record]]'', October 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Flash fiction: 'Intense, urgent and a little explosive'", ''[[The Irish Times]]'', October 26, 2011, copy available [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-29941178.html here] from [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Womer, [https://archive.is/20130210041029/http://www.yumasun.com/news/story-75397-place-staff.html "AWC professor impressed by short story entries"], ''[[Yuma Sun]]'', December 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Flash Fiction |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/flash_fiction |encyclopedia=[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |date=21 December 2011|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the drabble is brevity, testing the author's ability to express interesting and meaningful ideas in a confined space.

==History==
The concept is said to have originated in [[United Kingdom|UK]] science fiction fandom in the 1980s; the 100-word format was established by the [[Birmingham University]] SF Society, taking a term from [[Monty Python]]'s 1971 ''[[Monty Python's Big Red Book|Big Red Book]]''.&lt;ref name="WRR"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; In the book, "Drabble" was described as a word game where the first participant to write a [[novel]] was the winner. In order to make the game possible in the real world, it was agreed that 100 words would suffice. 
 
In drabble contests, participants are given a [[Theme (literary)|theme]] and a certain amount of time to write.  (For example, [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] conducted a "100 Words Centennial Drabble Contest" in commemoration of its 100th anniversary in 2011, in which contestants were asked to write about "inspiration, leadership or purpose".&lt;ref name="WRR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liz Smith, [http://thecord.ca/articles/47813 "Laurier launches literary competition to commemorate Centennial year"]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Cord Weekly]]'', September 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) Drabble contests, and drabbles in general, are popular in [[science fiction fandom]] and in [[fan fiction]].  Beccon Publications published three volumes, ''The Drabble Project'' (1988) and ''Drabble II: Double Century'' (1990), both edited by Rob Meades and David Wake, and ''Drabble Who'' (1993), edited by [[David J. Howe]] and David Wake.

==Examples==
Published science fiction writers who have written drabbles include [[Brian Aldiss]] and [[Gene Wolfe]] (both of whom contributed to ''The Drabble Project''),&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; [[Lois McMaster Bujold]] (whose novel ''[[Cryoburn]]'' finishes with a sequence of five drabbles, each told from the point of view of a different character),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2011/09/review_cryoburn_a_miles_vorkosigan_novel_by_lois_mcmaster_bujold/ |title=REVIEW: ‘Cryoburn (A Miles Vorkosigan Novel)’ by Lois McMaster Bujold |author=T K Kenyon |date=22 September  2011 |publisher=SF Signal |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Science fiction books |author=Fred Cleaver |url=http://www.denverpost.com/rss/ci_16651750 |newspaper=[[Denver Post]] |date=21 November 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jake Bible]] (whose novel ''Dead Mech'' was written entirely in drabble format).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jakebible.com/whats-a-drabble/|title=What’s A Drabble?|date=2010-01-10|work=Jake Bible Fiction|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''100 Word Story'' is an online literary journal that was co-founded in 2011 by [[Grant Faulkner]] and Lynn Mundell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thereviewreview.net/interviews/flash-fiction|title=Flash! Fiction!  - The Review Review|website=www.thereviewreview.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes stories that are exactly 100 words long.

The web has also enabled a rapid spread of the genre, with publishers such as [[The Third Word Press]] using the web to collect drabble stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.third-word.com/|title=The Third Word Press |access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==55 Fiction==
One example of drabble is 55 Fiction, which is a form of [[microfiction]] that refers to the works of fiction that are either limited to a maximum of 55 words or have a requirement of exactly 55 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ron Wiggins|title=PAPER CHALLENGES WRITERS TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PBPB&amp;p_theme=pbpb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EF3F22AEE950D98&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Palm Beach Post|date=October 11, 2001}} {{Paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of ''55 Fiction'' can be traced to a short story writing contest organized by ''New Times'', an independent alternative weekly in [[San Luis Obispo, California]], in 1987.&lt;ref name=fff&gt;{{cite news|title=Mini- és maxiregények|url=http://www.nyest.hu/hirek/mini-es-maxiregenyek|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Nyelv és Tudomány|date=June 27, 2011|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was proposed by ''New Times'' founder and publisher [[Steve Moss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NEW TIMES PUBLISHER DIED OF EPILEPSY|newspaper=The Tribune|date=May 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria===
A literary work will be considered ''55 Fiction''{{cn|date=November 2015}} if it has:
# 55 words or fewer, however some publishers actually require exactly 55 words – no more and no less;
# A setting;
# One or more characters;
# Some conflict; and
# A resolution. (''Not limited to the moral of the story'')
The title of the story is not part of the overall word count, but cannot exceed seven words.

'''''EASE Guidelines for Authors and Translators of Scientific Articles to be Published in English''''' (often shortened to '''''EASE Guidelines for Authors and Translators''''' or '''''EASE Guidelines''''') were first published by the [[European Association of Science Editors]] (EASE) in 2010.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;Ufnalska S. 2010. [http://alpsp.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/content/alpsp/lp/2010/00000023/00000004/art00009 Multilingual EASE Guidelines for Authors and Translators]. PDF (0.01 MB) ''Learned Publishing'' 23(4): 331-332.&lt;/ref&gt; Updated versions are periodically released at the EASE Guidelines page of the EASE website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ease.org.uk/publications/author-guidelines Latest edition of EASE Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; ''EASE Guidelines'' summarize the most important editorial recommendations, aiming to make international scientific communication more efficient and to aid in preventing [[scientific misconduct]]. They also support the global initiative [[Healthcare Information For All by 2015]] by advising authors to make [[abstract (summary)|abstracts]] of their papers highly informative, reliable, and easily understandable. The document has been translated into many languages ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Bengali language|Bangla]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[English language|English]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ([[Brazil]]ian), [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]), to facilitate its popularization worldwide and help scientists from non-[[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries.&lt;ref name=CSE&gt; Ufnalska S.B. 2011.

== History ==
''EASE Guidelines'' are a result of long discussions on the electronic [[European Association of Science Editors|EASE]] Forum and during the [[European_Association_of_Science_Editors#2009 conference: Integrity in Science Communication|2009 EASE conference in Pisa]], as well as subsequent consultations within the EASE Council.&lt;ref&gt;Ufnalska S. 2010. 
{{cite web|url= http://www.ease.org.uk/pdfese/ESE_may10.pdf |title=Major editorial guidelines need to be translated and popularized. }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|( 1.1 MB
)}} ''European Science Editing'' 36(2): 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==

The document includes a succinct set of practical guidelines explaining how to write complete, concise and clear manuscripts (see a [http://www.ease.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Sylwia-Ufnalska-EASE-2016.pdf short presentation]). It is supplemented with a list for further reading as well as several short appendices (Abstracts; Ambiguity; Cohesion; Ethics; Plurals; Simplicity; Spelling; Text-tables) that present selected issues in greater detail or provide more examples.

''EASE Guidelines'' emphasize the need for proper structuring of the [[Academic paper#Scholarly paper|article]] (e.g. making the tested hypothesis clear in the Introduction), making the [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] highly informative (including most important [[data]] and conclusions), and writing understandably, so that the readers are not discouraged or confused. Ethical issues are also taken into account, e.g. authorship criteria, [[plagiarism]], redundant publications, and other types of [[scientific misconduct]]. The 2013 edition of the publication ethics checklist ([https://web.archive.org/web/20140810105700/http://www.ease.org.uk/sites/default/files/ease_guidelines-june2014-ethics.pdf Appendix: Ethics], page 10 of ''EASE Guidelines'') was presented at the 3rd World Conference on Research Integrity in Montreal in May 2013. It can be used routinely during submission, as one short form instead of many separate forms to be filled by authors.

== Perspectives ==

The [[European Association of Science Editors|EASE]] Council plans to add more appendices on specific subjects and more translations (made mostly by volunteers), as well as to review ''EASE Guidelines'' annually.&lt;ref name=LP /&gt;

Non-commercial [[printing]] of the document is allowed, so it can be used as a [[handout]], e.g. for [[postgraduate education|courses]] in [[scientific literature|scientific writing]] and [[scientific misconduct|publication ethics]].&lt;ref name="CSE" /&gt;

      <comment>/* Is there an EAC between US corps and unified command? */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4418">'''Echelons above corps''' (EAC), in US and NATO practice, refer to higher headquarters, of purpose-built organization, which involve a greater number of troops than would be in an [[army corps]]. They may be standing organizations with a regional responsibility, or may be established for a particular operational purpose. While EAC most commonly refer to ground combat forces, they may refer to joint commands. They may also be administrative headquarters with responsibility for preparing combat forces.

While there were a significant number of EAC in [[World War II]], with increasing power of smaller organizations, it may not be required to have a ground force of the size of:

:*[[Field army]], made up of two or more [[corps]] plus units under the direct control of the army commander
:*[[Army group]], composed of two or more [[field army| field armies]] plus units subordinated to the army group commander
:*[[Theater (warfare)|Theater]], composed of all land, sea, and air forces in a geographic area

Even in World War II, while the Western Allies used these terms, they were not universal. A Soviet army was roughly equivalent to a US or Commonwealth corps, with a front roughly equivalent to an army group.  Japanese armies were also equivalent to US or Commonwealth corps, an area army to a western field army, and a general army to a theater.

==Current US concepts of EAC==
The US Army divides types of troops into combat arms (infantry, armor, artillery, aviation, special forces), combat support (intelligence, communications, engineer, military police) and combat service support (supply, maintenance, medical, transportation, chaplain, finance and administration).

===Combat support===
Military police, in the current environment, often are in a combat role. Doctrine is catching up with reality, as in Panama, and most recently in Iraq, with the [[Raven 42]] patrol led by Staff Sergeant [[Timothy Nein]] and Sergeant [[Leigh Ann Hester]], where a woman, for the first time, received the [[Silver Star]] medal, and qualified for the [[Combat Action Badge]]. Raven 42, a unit of the 617th Military Police Company of the Kentucky National Guard, was on a convoy escort mission where combat was reasonable to expect, as opposed to the rear area MP units guarding prisons and POWs.

=== Combat service support ===
Thomas J. Newman, a Quartermaster Corps major in 1993, analyzes the roles of combat service support at EAC. It must be remembered that US Army doctrine was in flux as his monograph was being developed, analyzing the lessons learned from [[Operation Desert Storm]], but the Army not yet gone to the major restructuring into units of action/brigade combat teams and units of employment.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{citation
 | title = Combat Service Support at Echelons Above Corps: The Doctrinal Challenge
 | first = Thomas J. | last = Newman
 | publisher = School of Advanced Military Studies, US Army Command and General Staff College
 | year = 1993
 |url = http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/p4013coll3&amp;CISOPTR=1482&amp;filename=1483.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[from the abstract] &lt;blockquote&gt;Army concepts for supporting operations involving multiple corps were called into question by actions taken during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Non-doctrinal organizations provided support to U.S. forces deployed on these operations, despite the fact that doctrinally correct organizations existed. The monograph examines existing doctrine for support of multi-corps operations, and also doctrine for Army theater command and control architecture. It then summarizes support operations during the Gulf
War Emerging logistics doctrine is then compared with both previous doctrine and with lessons learned in the Gulf. The monograph concludes that existing doctrine for support at echelons above corps requires revision, that-emerging doctrine is on the right track, and that a key requirement will be for the Army to identify a way to test new doctrine in a realistic manner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Existence of EAC's between US corps and unified commands==
Still in use in US forces are [[Unified Combatant Command]]s, roughly equivalent to a [[theater]].  [[Multinational Force Iraq]] (MNF-I) is a level of command comparable to a reinforced field army.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

'''Ecopath with Ecosim''' ('''EwE''') is a free [[ecosystem]] modelling [[software suite]], initially started at [[NOAA]] by Jeffrey Polovina, but has since primarily been developed at the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] of the [[University of British Columbia]]. In 2007, it was named as one of the ten biggest scientific breakthroughs in NOAA's 200-year history. The NOAA citation states that Ecopath "revolutionized scientists' ability worldwide to understand complex marine ecosystems".&lt;ref&gt;NOAA, 2007. ECOPATH Modeling: Precursor to an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management [WWW Document]. URL http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/ecopath/welcome.html (accessed 8.26.12).&lt;/ref&gt; Behind this lie more than two decades of development work in association with [[Villy Christensen]], [[Carl Walters]], [[Daniel Pauly]], and other [[fisheries scientist]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Smikle, S.G., V. Christensen and K.A. Aiken (2010). "A review of caribbean ecosystems and fishery resources using ECOPATH models". Revue Etudes Caribéennes, n°15, https://etudescaribeennes.revues.org/4529&lt;/ref&gt; followed with the provision of user support, training and co-development collaborations. Per January 2012 there are 6000+ registered users in 150+ countries.

In 2015, 251 million tubes of [[toothpaste]] were sold in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;FoodIndustryMagazine. (n.d.). Toothpaste unit sales in U.S. supermarkets in 2014 and 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; A single tube holds roughly 170 grams of toothpaste, so approximately 43 kilotonnes of toothpaste get washed into the water systems annually.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Brar S, Verma M, Tyagi R, Surampalli R (2009). Engineered Nanoparticles in Wastewater and Wastewater Sludge - Evidence and Impacts. Waste Management, 30: 504-520.&lt;/ref&gt; Toothpaste contains [[silver nanoparticle|silver nanoparticle&lt;nowiki/&gt;s]], also known as nanosilver or AgNPs, among other compounds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Each tube of toothpaste contains approximately 91&amp;nbsp;mg of silver nanoparticles, with approximately 3.9 tonnes of silver nanoparticles entering the environment annually.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Silver nanoparticles are not entirely cleared from the water during the wastewater treatment process, possibly leading to detrimental environmental effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Silver nanoparticles in toothpaste ==
[[Silver nanoparticle]]s are used for catalyzing chemical reactions, Raman imaging, and antimicrobial sterilization.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Choi, O., Deng, K. K., Kim, N. J., Ross, L., Jr., Surampalli, R. Y., &amp; Hu, Z. (2008). The inhibitory effects of silver nanoparticles, silver ions, and silver chloride colloids on microbial growth. Water Res, 42(12), 3066-3074.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with its antimicrobial properties, its low mammalian cell toxicity makes these particles a common addition to consumer products.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Washing textiles embedded with silver nanoparticles results in the oxidation and transformation of metallic Ag into [[Silver chloride|AgCl]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Silver nanoparticles have different physicochemical characteristics from the free silver ion, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and possess increased optical, electromagnetic, and catalytic properties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Particles with one dimension of 100&amp;nbsp;nm or less can generate reactive oxygen species. Smaller particles less than 10&amp;nbsp;nm may pass through cellular membranes and accumulate within the cell.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Silver nanoparticles were also found to attach to cellular membranes, eventually dissipating the proton motive force, leading to cell death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Silver nanoparticles that are larger than the openings of membrane [[Ion channel|channel proteins]] can easily clog channels, leading to the disruption of membrane permeability and transport.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the antimicrobial effectiveness of silver nanoparticles has been shown to decrease when dissolved in liquid media.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The free silver ion are potentially toxic to bacteria and planktonic species in the water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The positively charged silver ion can also attach to the negatively charged cell walls of bacteria, leading to deactivation of cellular enzymes, disruption of membrane permeability, and eventually, cell lysis and death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, its toxicity to microorganisms is not overtly observed since the free silver ion is found in low concentrations in wastewater treatment systems and the natural environment due to its complexation with ligands such as [[chloride]], [[sulfide]], and [[thiosulfate]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Wastewater treatment ===
A majority of silver nanoparticles in consumer products go down the drain and are eventually released into sewer systems and reach wastewater treatment plants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kaegi, R., Voegelin, A., Sinnet, B., Zuleeg, S., Hagendorfer, H., Burkhardt, M., &amp; Siegrist, H. (2011).		Behavior of metallic silver nanoparticles in a pilot wastewater treatment plant. Environmental

Science Technology, 45(9), 3902-3908. doi:10.1021/es1041892.&lt;/ref&gt; Primary screening and grit removal in [[wastewater treatment]] does not completely filter out [[silver nanoparticle]]s, and coagulation treatment may lead to further condensation into wastewater sludge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The secondary wastewater treatment process involves suspended growth systems which allow bacteria to decompose organic matter within the water.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Any [[silver nanoparticle]]s still suspended in the water may collect on these microbes, potentially killing them due to their antimicrobial effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After passing through both treatment processes, the silver nanoparticles are eventually deposited into the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A majority of the submerged portions of wastewater treatment plants are anoxic and rich in sulfur.&lt;ref name=":19"/&gt; During the wastewater treatment process, silver nanoparticles either remain the same, are converted into free silver ions, complex with ligands, or agglomerate.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hou, L., Li, K., Ding, Y., Li, Y., Chen, J., Wu, X., &amp; Li, X. (2012). Removal of silver nanoparticles in simulated wastewater treatment processes and its impact on COD and NH4 reduction. Chemosphere, 87(3), 248-252. doi:&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.12.042&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver nanoparticles can also attach to wastewater [[biosolids]] found in both the sludge and the effluent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Silver ions in wastewater are removed efficiently because of their strong complexation with chloride or sulfide.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Brown, J. (2017). Impact of Silver Nanoparticles on Wastewater Treatment. Nanotechnologies for Environmental Remediation: Applications and Implications (pp. 255-267). Cham: Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A majority of the silver found in wastewater treatment plant [[Effluent sewer|effluent]] is associated with reduced sulfur as organic [[Thiol|thiol groups]] and inorganic sulfides.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Silver nanoparticles also tend to accumulate in [[activated sludge]], and the dominant form of the silver found in sewage sludge is [[Silver sulfide|Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Therefore, most of the silver found in wastewater treatment plants is in the form of silver nanoparticles or silver precipitates such as [[Silver sulfide|Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] and [[Silver chloride|AgCl]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The amount of silver precipitate formed depends on silver ion release, which increases with increasing [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] concentration and decreasing pH.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Hou, L., Li, K., Ding, Y., Li, Y., Chen, J., Wu, X., &amp; Li, X. (2012). Removal of silver nanoparticles in simulated wastewater treatment processes and its impact on COD and NH4 reduction. Chemosphere, 87(3), 248-252. doi:&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.12.042&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver ions account for approximately 1% of total silver after silver nanoparticles are suspended in aerated water.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In anoxic wastewater treatment environments, silver ion release is therefore often negligible, and most of the silver nanoparticles in wastewater remain in the original silver nanoparticle form.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The presence of natural organic matter can also decrease oxidative dissolution rates and therefore the release rate of free silver ions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The slow oxidation of silver nanoparticles may enable new pathways for its transfer into the environment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Transformation in the environment ===
The silver nanoparticles that pass through wastewater treatment plants undergo transformations in the environment through changes in [[Particle aggregation|aggregation]] state, [[Redox|oxidation]] state, [[precipitation]] of secondary phases, or [[sorption]] of organic species.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Laglera L, Tovar-Sanchez A (2012). Direct recognition and quantification by volammetry of thiol/thioamide mixes in seawater. Talanta, 89: 496-504.&lt;/ref&gt; These transformations can result in the formation of [[Colloid|colloidal solutions]]. Each of these new species potentially have toxic effects which have yet to be fully examined.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Most silver nanoparticles in products have an organic shell structure around a core of Ag&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This shell is often created with carboxylic acids functional groups, usually using citrate, leading to stabilization through adsorption or covalent attachment of organic compounds.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In seawater, [[glutathione]] reacts with [[Citric acid|citrate]]&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; to form a [[thioester]] via [[ester]]ification.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Sidenius U, Skonberg C, Olsen J, Hansen S (2003). In vitro reactivity of carboxylic acid-CoA thioesters with glutathione. Chemical Research in Toxicology, 17: 75-81.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Citrate_and_glutathione_reaction.png|thumb|Esterification reaction of citrate and glutathione]]

Thioesters exhibit electrosteric repulsive forces due to [[amine]] functional groups and their size, which prevents aggregation. These electrostatic repulsive forces are weakened by [[counterion]]s in solution, such as [[Ca²⁺|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] found in seawater. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are naturally found in seawater due to the weathering of [[Calcareous|calcareous rocks]], and allow for [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of the oxide-coated particle at low [[electrolyte]] concentrations.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Li X, Lenhart J, Walker H (2010). Dissolution-Accompanied Aggregation Kinetics of Silver Nanoparticles. Langmuir, 26 (22): 16690-16698.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This leads to the aggregation of silver nanoparticles onto thioesters in seawater.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; When aggregation occurs, the silver nanoparticles lose microbial toxicity, but have greater exposure in the environment for larger organisms.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; These effects have not been completely identified, but may be hazardous to an organism’s health via biological magnification.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

|}Silver nanoparticles are thermodynamically unstable in oxic environments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In seawater, silver oxide is not thermodynamically favored when chloride and sulfur are present. On the surface where O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is present in much greater quantities than chloride or sulfur, silver reacts to form a silver oxide surface layer.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Choi O, Cleunger T, Deng B, Surampalli R, Ross L, Hu Z (2009). Role of sulfide and ligand strength in controlling nanosilver toxicity. Water Research 43 (7): 1879-1886.&lt;/ref&gt; This oxidation has been shown to occur in nanoparticles as well, despite their shell.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dissolution of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in Water:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2Ag&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The nano-size of the particles aids in oxidation since their smaller surface area increases their redox potential.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Johnston H, Cuta F, Garrett A (1933).

Initial oxidation of silver surfaces by S2- and S+4 species. Corrosion Science 50 (4): 1112-1121.&lt;/ref&gt; Free Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions will react with [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] in the water to form the precipitate Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;u&gt;Silver and Sulfur Reaction in Seawater:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2Ag&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; → Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Adams N, Kramer J (1999). Silver speciation in wastewater effluent, surface waters and pore waters. Environmental Toxicology Chemistry 18 (12): 2667-2673.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is not the only source of sulfur that Ag will readily bind to. [[Organosulfur compounds]], which are produced by aquatic organisms, form extremely stable sulfide complexes with silver.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Silver outcompetes other metals for the available sulfide, leading to an overall decrease in bioavailable sulfur in the community.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Thus, the formation of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S limits the amount of bioavailable sulfur and contributes to a reduction in toxicity of silver nanoparticles to [[nitrifying bacteria]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Effect on bacteria ====
Silver nanoparticles are experimentally shown to inhibit [[autotroph]]ic nitrifying bacterial growth (86±3%) more than Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (42±7%) or AgCl [[colloid]]s (46±4%).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Silver nanoparticle-inhibited [[heterotroph]]ic growth (55±8%) in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' is best observed at lower concentrations, between 1.0 uM and 4.2 uM.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is less than Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (~100%), but greater than AgCl colloids (66±6%).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The actual cause of these results is undetermined as growth conditions and cell properties differ between nitrifying bacteria and [[heterotroph]]ic ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Within toothpaste, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions have been shown to have a stronger effect on [[gram-negative bacteria]] than on [[gram-positive bacteria]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Junevičius J, Žilinskas J, Česaitis K, Česaitienė G, Gleiznys D, Maželienė D (2015). Antimicrobial activity of silver and gold in toothpastes: A comparative analysis. Stomatologija, Baltic Dental and Maxillofacial Journal, 17 (1): 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to other nanoparticles, such as gold, silver tends to have a broader antimicrobial effect, which is another reason why it is incorporated into so many products.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is less effective on gram-positive bacteria due to the thick layer of peptidoglycan around them that gram-negative species lack.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Approximately half of the [[peptidoglycan]] wall is composed of [[teichoic acid]]s linked by [[phosphodiester bond]]s, which results in an overall negative charge in the peptidoglycan layer.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Vollmer W, Blanot D, Pedro M (2007). Peptidoglycan structure and architecture. Federation of European Microbiological Societies, 32: 149-167.&lt;/ref&gt; This negative charge may trap the positive Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and prevent them from entering the cell and disrupting the flow of electrons.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==== Toxicology in aquatic environments ====
The most environmentally relevant species of these nanoparticles are silver chloride within marine ecosystems and organic thiols within terrestrial ecosystems. Once Ag&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; enters the environment, it is oxidized to Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Su-juan Y, Yong-guang Y, Jing-fu L (2013).

Environmental Science, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the potential species formed in seawater, such as Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and [[Silver carbonate|Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], AgCl is the most thermodynamically favored due to its stability, solubility, and the abundance of Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; in seawater.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Research has shown that partially oxidized nanoparticles may be more toxic than those that are freshly prepared.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

It was also found that Ag dissolutes more in solution when the pH is low and [[bleaching]] has occurred.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; This effect, coupled with [[ocean acidification]] and increasing coral reef bleaching events, leads to a compounding effect of Ag accumulation in the global marine ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; These free formed Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions can accumulate and block the regulation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion exchange within the gills of fish, leading to blood [[acidosis]] which is fatal if left unchecked. Additionally, fish can accumulate Ag through their diet.

In linguistics, according to J. Richard et al., (2002), an '''error''' is the use of a word, speech act or grammatical items in such a way it seems imperfect and significant of an incomplete learning (184). It is considered by Norrish (1983, p.&amp;nbsp;7) as a systematic deviation that happens when a learner has not learnt something, and consistently gets it wrong. However, the attempts made to put the error into context have always gone hand in hand with either Language Learning and Second Language acquisition processes, Hendrickson (1987:357) mentioned that errors are ‘Signal’ that indicate an actual Learning process taking place and that the learner has not yet mastered or shown a well-structured competence in the target language.

All the definitions seemed to stress either on the systematic deviations triggered in the language learning process, or its indications of the actual situation of the language learner themselves which will later help the monitor be it an applied linguist or particularly the language teacher to solve the problem respecting one of the approaches argued in the Error Analysis (Anefnaf 2017), the occurrence of errors doesn’t only indicate that the learner has not learned something yet, but also it gives the linguist the idea of whether the teaching method applied was effective or it needs to be changed.

According to Corder (1976) errors are significant of three things, first to the teacher, in that they tell him, if he or she undertakes a systematic analysis,  how far towards that goal the learner has progressed and, consequently, what remains for him to learn. Second, they provide the researcher with evidence of how language is learned or acquired, and what strategies or procedures the learner is employing in his discovery of the language. Third (and in a sense this is their most important aspect) they are indispensable to the learner himself, because we can regard the making of errors as a device the learner uses in order to learn (p.&amp;nbsp;167). The occurrence of errors is merely signs of ‘’the present inadequacy of our teaching methods’’ (Corder 1976, p. 163).

There have been two schools of thought when it comes to errors analysis and philosophy, the first one, according to Corder (1967) linked the errors commitment with the teaching method arguing that if the teaching method was adequate, the errors would not be committed, the second school believed that we live in an imperfect world and that errors correction is something real and the applied linguist cannot do without it no matter what teaching approach they may use.

== Errors vs. mistakes ==
Chomsky (1965) made a distinguishing explanation of competence and performance on which, later on, the identification of Mistakes and Errors will be possible, Chomsky stated that ‘’We thus make a fundamental distinction between competence (the speaker-hearer's knowledge of his language) and performance (the actual use of language in concrete situations)’’ ( 1956, p. 4). In other words, errors are thought of as indications of an incomplete learning, and that the speaker or hearer has not yet accumulated a satisfied language knowledge which can enable them to avoid linguistics misuse. Relating knowledge with competence was significant enough to represent that the competence of the speaker is judged by means of errors that concern the amount of linguistic data he or she has been exposed to, however, performance which is the actual use of language does not represent the language knowledge that the speaker has. According to J. Richard et al (2002)  people may have the competence to produce an infinitely long sentence but when they actually attempt to use this knowledge (to “perform”) there are many reasons why they restrict the number of adjectives, adverbs, and clauses in any one sentence (2002, 392).

The actual state of the speaker somehow involves and influences the speaker’s performance by either causing a good performance or mistakes. Thus, it is quite obvious that there are some kind of interrelationship between competence and performance; somehow, a speaker can perform well if he or she has had already a satisfied linguistics knowledge. As a support to this, Corder (1967) mentioned that Mistakes are of no significance to ‘’the process of language learning’’ (P. 167).

==Error analysis approach==
Before the rise of Error Analysis approach, Contrastive Analysis had been the dominant approach used in dealing and conceptualizing the learners’ errors in the 1950s, this approach had often gone hand in hand with concept of L1 Interference and precisely the Interlingual effect (Anefnaf Z. 2017), it claimed that the main cause of committing errors in the process of second language learning is the L1, in other words, the linguistic background of the language learners badly affects the production in the target language.

X. Fang and J. Xue-mei (2007) pointed out that Contrastive analysis hypothesis claimed that the principal barrier to second language acquisition is the interference of the first language system with the second language system and that a scientific, structural comparison of the two languages in question would enable people to predict and describe which are problems and which are not. Error Analysis approach overwhelmed and announced the decline of the Contrastive Analysis which was only effective in phonology. and According to J. Richard et al. (2002) EA developed as a branch of Linguistics in the 1960s and it came to light to argue that the mother tongue was not the main and the only source of the errors committed by the learners. In addition, Hashim, A. (1999) mentioned that the language effect is more complex and these errors can be caused even by the target language itself and by the applied communicative strategies as well as the type and quality of the second language instructions.

The aim of EA according to J. Richard et al. (2002) is, first, to identify strategies which learners use in language learning, in terms of the approaches and strategies used in both of teaching and learning. Second, to try to identify the causes of learners’ errors, that is, investigating the motives behind committing such errors as the first attempt to eradicate them. Third, to obtain information on common difficulties in Language Learning, as an aid to teaching or in the preparation of the teaching materials,

The two major causes of error, coined by the Error Analysis approach, are the Interlingual error which is an error made by the Learner’s Linguistic background and Native language interference, and the Intralingual error which is the error committed by the learners when they misuse some Target Language rules, considering that the error cause lies within and between the target language itself and the Learners false application of certain target language rules.

Error analysis in SLA was established in the 1960s by [[S. P. Corder|Corder]] and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Corder | first1 = S. P. | year = 1967 | title = The significance of learners' errors | url = | journal = International Review of Applied Linguistics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 160–170 | doi=10.1515/iral.1967.5.1-4.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Error analysis (EA) was an alternative to [[contrastive analysis]], an approach influenced by [[behaviorism]] through which applied linguists sought to use the formal distinctions between the learners' first and second languages to predict errors. Error analysis showed that contrastive analysis was unable to predict a great majority of errors, although its more valuable aspects have been incorporated into the study of [[#Language transfer|language transfer]]. A key finding of error analysis has been that many learner errors are produced by learners making faulty inferences about the [[wiktionary:rule|rules]] of the new language.

Error analysts distinguish between errors, which are systematic, and mistakes, which are not. They often seek to develop a [[wikt:typology|typology]] of errors. Error can be classified according to basic type:  omissive, additive, substitutive or related to [[word order]]. They can be classified by how apparent they are: ''overt'' errors such as "I angry" are obvious even out of context, whereas ''covert'' errors are evident only in context. Closely related to this is the classification according to ''domain'', the breadth of context which the analyst must examine, and ''extent'', the breadth of the utterance which must be changed in order to fix the error. Errors may also be classified according to the level of language: [[phonology|phonological]] errors, [[vocabulary]] or [[lexicon|lexical]] errors, [[syntax|syntactic]] errors, and so on. They may be assessed according to the degree to which they interfere with [[communication]]: ''global'' errors make an utterance difficult to understand, while ''local'' errors do not. In the above example, "I angry" would be a local error, since the meaning is apparent.

From the beginning, error analysis  was beset with [[methodology|methodological]] problems. In particular, the above typologies are problematic: from linguistic data alone, it is often impossible to reliably determine what kind of error a learner is making. Also, error analysis can deal effectively only with learner production ([[Speech communication|speaking]] and [[writing]]) and not with learner reception ([[listening]] and [[reading (activity)|reading]]). Furthermore, it cannot account for learner use of [[communicative strategies]] such as [[avoidance coping|avoidance]], in which learners simply do not use a form with which they are uncomfortable. For these reasons, although error analysis is still used to investigate specific questions in SLA, the quest for an overarching [[theory]] of learner errors has largely been abandoned. In the mid-1970s, Corder and others moved on to a more wide-ranging approach to learner language, known as [[#Interlanguage|interlanguage]].

Error analysis is closely related to the study of [[Error treatment (linguistics)|error treatment in language teaching]]. Today, the study of errors is particularly relevant for [[focus on form]] teaching methodology.

In [[second language acquisition]], '''error analysis''' studies the types and causes of [[speech error|language errors]]. Errors are classified&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bussmann, Hadumod (1996), ''Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics'', London: Routledge, s.v. error analysis. A comprehensive bibliography was published by Bernd Spillner (1991), ''Error Analysis'', Amsterdam/Philadelphia: Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; according to:
* modality (i.e., level of proficiency in speaking, [[writing]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[listening]])
* linguistic levels (i.e., [[pronunciation]], [[grammar]], [[vocabulary]], [[style (fiction)|style]])
* form (e.g., omission, insertion, substitution)
* type (systematic errors/errors in competence vs. occasional errors/errors in performance)
* cause (e.g., [[language transfer|interference]], [[interlanguage]])
* norm vs. system

== Errors Types  ==
Linguists have always been attempting to describe the types of errors committed by the language learners, and that is exactly the best way to start with, as it helps out the applied linguist to identify where the problem lies. According to Dulay et al. (1982) errors take place when the learner change the surface structure in a particularly systematic manner (p.&amp;nbsp;150), thus, the error, no matter what form and type it is, represent a damage at the level of the target language production.

Errors have been classified by J. Richard et al. (2002) into two categories. The Interlingual Error and the Intralingual Error, those two elements refer respectively to the negative influence of both the speaker’s native language, and the target language itself.

Interlingual error is caused by the interference of the native language L1 (also known as interference, linguistic interference, and crosslinguistic influence), whereby the learner tends to use their linguistic knowledge of L1 on some Linguistic features in the target language, however, it often leads to making errors. The example, provided by J. Richard et al. (2002) ‘’ the incorrect French sentence Elle regarde les (“She sees them”), produced according to the word order of English, instead of the correct French sentence Elle les regarde (Literally, “She them sees”). (P. 267) shows the type of errors aroused by the negative effect of the native language interference.

Intralingual error is an error that takes place due to a particular misuse of a particular rule of the target language, it is, in fact, quite the opposite of Interlingual error, it puts the target language into focus, the target language in this perspective is thought of as an error cause. Furthermore, J. Richard, et al. (2002) consider it as one which results from ‘’faulty or partial’’ learning of the target language. (p.267) thus the intralingual error is classified as follow:

'''''Overgenerations:''''' in Linguistic, overgeneralizations error occur when the speaker applies a grammatical rule in cases where it doesn’t apply. Richard et al, (2002) mentioned that they are caused ‘’by extension of target language rules to inappropriate context.’’ (P.185). this kind of errors have been committed while dealing with regular and irregular verbs, as well as the application of plural forms. E.g. (Tooth == Tooths rather than teeth) and (he goes == he goed rather than went).

'''''Simplifications:''''' they are resulting from learners producing simpler linguistic forms than those found in the target language, in other words, learners attempt to be linguistically creative and produce their own poetic sentences/utterances, they may actually be successful in doing it, but it is not necessary the case, Corder (as cited in Mahmoud 2014:276) mentioned that learners do not have the complex system which they could simplify. This kind of errors is committed through both of Omission and addition of some linguistic elements at the level of either the Spelling or grammar. A. Mahmoud (2014) provided examples based on a research conducted on written English of Arabic-speaking second year University students:

# Spelling: omission of silent letters:
#* no (= know) * dout (= doubt) * weit (weight)
# Grammar:
## Omission:
##* We wait ^ the bus all the time.
##* He was ^ clever and has ^ understanding father.
## Addition:
##* Students are do their researches every semester.
##* Both the boys and the girls they can study together.

'''''Developmental Errors:''''' this kind of errors is somehow part of the Overgeneralizations, (this later is subtitled into Natural and developmental learning stage errors), D.E are results of normal pattern of development, such as (come = comed) and (break = breaked), D.E indicates that the learner has started developing their linguistic knowledge and fail to reproduce the rules they have lately been exposed to in target language learning.

'''''Induced errors:''''' as known as Transfer of Training, errors caused by misleading teaching examples, teachers, sometimes, unconditionally, explain a rule without highlighting the exceptions or the intended message they would want to convey. J. Richard et al. (2002) provided an example that occurs at the level of teaching prepositions and particularly ‘’ at ‘’ where the teacher may hold up a box and say ‘’ ''I am looking at the box ‘’,'' the students may understand that ‘’ ''at ‘’'' means ''‘’ under ‘’,'' they may later utter ‘’ the cat is at the table ‘’ instead of the cat is under the table.

'''''Errors of avoidance:''''' these errors occur when the learner fail to apply certain target language rules just because they are thought of to be too difficult.

'''''Errors of overproduction:''''' in the early stages of language learning, learners are supposed to have not yet acquired and accumulated a satisfied linguistic knowledge which can enable them to use the finite rules of the target language in order to produce infinite structures, most of the time, beginners overproduce, in such a way, they frequently repeat a particular structure.

== Error analysis experiments ( Morocco as a case of study )  ==

=== Difficulties of learning English in Morocco ===
As we have mentioned before in our theoretical part that the four basic skills of a language are the speaking/writing/reading/listening, these skills are usually used to test the learning development. Moreover, we decided to make this question for the sake of knowing where the Moroccans’ English learning difficulties at the very beginning of the process lie. However, and for the first time, we gave the participants to cross more than one choice because we were sure that, beginners find difficulties at many levels, and the results were:

The results indicate that 54 participants have encountered difficulties at the level speaking, and 44 found writing skill difficult to develop, and the difficulties at the level of listening were encountered by 33 of the participants, and lastly, 13 goes to the reading skill.&lt;ref name=Morocco_results&gt;https://www.academia.edu/33999467/English_Learning_in_Morocco_Linguistic_Flaws&lt;/ref&gt;

These results enable us to conclude that Moroccans have problems at the level of the production in the process of English Learning, we can apparently notice that speaking/writing are the most frequent problem that a huge number of the participants have had, so that applied linguists along with teachers should innovate new techniques that primarily focus on improving the production of the English Learners in Morocco.

=== The cause of Errors in Morocco ===
The question was thoroughly chosen as it will either approve or deny the approach of Error Analysis in our community, Morocco, however, Error Analysis claims that the causes of the Errors commitment do not only lie in the target language, we tended to ask the participants indirectly about what was the causes of their committing errors, whether it was the L1, L2 or Both and the results were as follow:

The results have shown that 43% of the participants thought that both of the L1 and L2 are the causes of the results of the errors they have made, and after that comes the native language alone as the source of the errors according to the perspective of 37% of the participants, and, lastly, the target language is considered by 20% of them as the only source of errors.&lt;ref name=Morocco_results/&gt;

The results, somehow, go hand in hand with the approach of error analysis, they indicate that the errors analysis approach is actually applicable to the Moroccan Community, thus, while trying to reduce and get rid of the problems predicted through the systematic comparison between L1 and L2, the applied Linguists should also focus on the complexity and the false application of the linguistic elements within and between the target language as well.

=== Preferred Correction time ===
After identifying the error and its cause, the major part, which is correcting it, takes place. However, this question has to do with the error correction time preferred by the learners themselves, whether immediate or delayed ones. The results were as follow:

the results indicate 72% of the participants prefer being corrected immediately corrected, yet only 28% see that delayed ones would be better.&lt;ref name=Morocco_results/&gt;

Immediate corrections can annoy the learners whose personality is not strong enough to perceive corrections as tools which enable them to improve and develop either the accuracy or fluency. However, the fact that Moroccans, through our survey, seemed to prefer immediate corrections which may be thought of as indication of several interpretations. First of all, Moroccans’ personality while learning English is probably strong enough to handle the interruptions. Second of all, Moroccans, maybe, do not feel ashamed of making errors in English, which is actually just the second foreign language in Morocco, and, finally, Moroccans may view that immediate corrections simply more effective than delayed ones.

=== Preferred correction manner ===
This question has to do with the second part of the correction situation which is the correction manner, we tended to know how the participants would like to be corrected and how they would like to fix the errors. However, we provided the participants with three choices; Self-correction correction, peer correction and teacher correction. And the results were as follow:

The results might have been anticipated, 53% of English Learners prefer teacher correction, 26% of them prefer Self-correction, and 21% prefer Peer Corrections.&lt;ref name=Morocco_results/&gt;

These results can only show that students trust more their teacher than both of their classmates and themselves, and since that Self-correction is considered to be the most effective one as we have mentioned in our theoretical part. Consequently, teachers should first teach their students how to properly correct their errors and mistakes, and, in the meanwhile, building up trust between the students. However, all the three kind of corrections should be set together in order to eradicate and get rid of the errors

== Steps ==
According to linguist Corder, the following are the steps in any typical EA research:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ellis | first = Rod | title = The Study of Second Language Acquisition | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=3KglibyrZ5sC&amp;pg=PA48 |year = 1994  | pages = 48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# collecting samples of learner language
# identifying the errors
# describing the errors
# explaining the errors
# evaluating/correcting the errors
collection of errors:
the nature and quantity of errors is likely to vary depending on whether the data consist of natural, spontaneous language use or careful, elicited language use.

Corder (1973) distinguished two kinds of elicitation:''clinical'' and ''experimental'' elicitation.
clinical  elicitation involves getting the informant to produce data of any sort, for example by means of general interview or writing a composition.
experimental elicitation involves the use of special instrument to elicit data containing the linguistic features such as a series of pictures which had been designed to elicit specific features.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12965">Before ForDisc, many anthropologists based their studies off of museum skeletal collections such as the [[Hamann-Todd Collection|Hamann-Todd collection]] that is housed at Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio, and the [[Terry Collection|Terry collection]] housed at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, DC. These museum collections house skeletal remains that were amassed from 50 to 100 years ago. Due to the age of these collections, their use in a medico-legal context did not produce accurate determination of the biological profile. ForDisc was forensic anthropologists solution to this problem, and allowed for classification when some measurements are not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Book review: FORDISC 2.0: PERSONAL COMPUTER FORENSIC DISCRIMINANT FUNCTIONS.|last = Ubelaker|first = Douglas H.|date = 1998|journal = International Journal of Osteoarchaeology

Using ForDisc, a decedent’s biological profile can be created based on measurements from various areas of bones, along with information about the person's age, height, race, and illnesses. For ancestry ForDisc uses standard anthropometric measurements including maximum length, maximum breadth, bi-zygomatic breadth, orbital breadth and height, maximum alveolar breadth and width, minimum frontal breadth, basion-bregma, basion-prosthion, cranial base length, bi-auricular breadth, upper facial height and breadth, foramen magnum breadth and length, frontal chord, parietal chord, occipital chord, nasal height and breadth, bi-orbital breadth, inter orbital breadth, and mastoid length.

The data behind this software largely originated from the Forensic Data Bank, which is contributed to by the [[University of Tennessee]] and other contributing institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1371408.html|title=Couple Fleshes Out Skeletons' Past|last=Kelly|first=John|date=14 September 2006|work=Washington Post {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forensic Data Bank was created in 1986, through the use of a National Institute of Justice grant, and has gathered over 3400 cases.The Forensic Data Bank is a currently ongoing effort to record information about modern populations, primarily from forensic cases.

ForDisc's creators have also integrated  [[William W. Howells|W. W. Howells]] worldwide cranial data in to the program, for the use of archaeological remains. Howell's craniometric data set consist of 2500 crania from 28 different populations around the world dating to the later Holocene, in which around 82 cranial measurements were obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Who’s Who in Skulls.

== Uses ==
This software is able to estimate the sex, ancestry, and stature from a skeleton of unknown identity. This software also can be used for international hearings of war crime and investigations of human rights.&lt;ref name="OJ2005" /&gt; This method is also used by the FBI, in different types of criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;Application of Forensic Discriminant Functions to a Spanish Cranial Sample, by Douglas H. Ubelaker, Ann H. Ross, Sally M. Graver ''Forensic Science Communications'' July 2002 — Volume 4 — Number 3 [http://www2.fbi.gov/hq/lab/fsc/backissu/july2002/ubelaker1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this program was created for forensic anthropology use, many physical anthropologists are still using the program to determine the biological profile of skeletal remains that are considered archaeological in origin, but the use of this program on archaeological remains has produced misclassifications in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Century of Skeletal Biology and Paleopathology: Contrasts, Contradictions, and Conflicts|last = Armelagos|first = George J.|date = 2003|journal = American Anthropologist Vol. 105, No. 1, Special Issue: Biological Anthropology: Historical Perspectives on Current Issues, Disciplinary Connections, and Future Directions pp. 53-64|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of William W. Howell’s craniometric data set, which is published online, has made ForDisc 2.0 more appealing to many physical anthropologists concerned with archaeological remains.

== Updates ==
This program is continually updated. New and updated versions are created and added as more knowledge is acquired. The new features of ForDisc 2.0 are improved pictorial guide to measurements, and improved file management and printer control; larger number of variables, including post cranial variables; larger numbers of groups, including Howells' worldwide cranial data. The newest version, ForDisc 3.0 is an interactive forensic software that runs under the Windows system.

==Criticism==
According to the authors of the program, there are limitations that should be taken into account when using this program. Some of these limitations include the fact that ForDisc will classify any unknown into the ‘closest’ group, this means that even if an individuals ethnic group or race is not represented in the database, the program will classify it to the ‘closest’ group. Another limitation involves classification using hybrid individuals and groups. The authors state that genetic exchange between groups can cause misclassifications due to gene overlap that can consist of two ancestral populations. Another limitation deal with the classification of individuals under the age of 18, this is due to the nature of physical anthropologists ability to assess age in subadults. However, the authors state that there are differences between subadults in different groups, but these differences tend to not correspond to differences seen in adults. Another limitation that the authors believe researchers should take into account is the fact that this program is based on measurements that are affected by "disease, disuse, treatment, or trauma." The measurement of affected bone(s) may produce values that are inaccurate, and therefore he classification will not reflect the correct population affinity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ousley, Stephen, and Jantz, Richard. "Fordisc Help File, Version 1.35." Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute.   http://math.mercyhurst.edu/~sousley/Fordisc/Help/Fordisc3_Help.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The last limitation deals with archaeological populations. This limitation is due to the fact that most of the measurements in the data set that the classifications are based on in the program are from remains that are from the 20th century, and should not be used for classification of archaeological remains. This is because documented population differences and secular changes that have occurred throughout history. However, the inclusion of W. W. Howells craniometric data set has allowed researchers to classify archaeological remains due to the fact that much of the data set comes from individuals from the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2009 study found that FORDISC 3.0 "is only likely to be useful when an unidentified specimen is more or less complete and belongs to one of the populations represented in its reference samples", and even in such "favorable circumstances it can be expected to classify no more than 1 per cent of specimens with confidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2012 research was presented at the 81st Annual Meeting of the [[American Association of Physical Anthropologists]], which concluded ForDisc ancestry determination was not always consistent, and the programs' recommended acceptance criteria did not separate correct and incorrect determinations. The authors concluded that the program does not perform to expectations and should be used with caution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Poster: Elliott and Collard 2012 Going head to head: FORDISC vs CRANID in the determination of ancestry from craniometric data|url = http://meeting.physanth.org/program/2012/session08/elliott-2012-going-head-to-head-fordisc-vs-cranid-in-the-determination-of-ancestry-from-craniometric-data.html|website = meeting.physanth.org|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">'''Fassinger's model of gay and lesbian identity development''' is an attempt to model [[Sexual identity|gay and lesbian identity]] development, taking into account cultural and contextual influences. First presented by Ruth E. Fassinger in 1996 as a model of [[lesbian]] identity development, it was validated for men the following year.

== Research ==
In 1991, Susan R. McCarn, a colleague of Fassinger's, studied [[Identity (social science)|identity development]] among a group of thirty-eight lesbians diversifying in age, education, race, ethnicity, and occupation.&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarn|first=S. R.|title=Validation of a model of sexual minority (lesbian) identity development|journal=Unpublished master's thesis.|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of the results of this study lead to the establishment of two processes and four phases, in 1996.&lt;ref name=processes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fassinger|first=R. E.|author2=McCarn, S. R.|title=Revisioning sexual minority identity formation: A new model of lesbian identity and its implications for counseling and research|journal=Counseling Psychologist|volume=24|pages=508–534|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/thomas2e/study/articles/section6/Article107.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Fassinger and Brett A. Miller explored a similarly diverse group of gay men, validating the theory for men.&lt;ref name=validation&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fassinger|first=R. E.|author2=McCarn, S. R.|title=Validation of an inclusive model of homosexual identity formation in a sample of gay men|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|year=1997|volume=32|issue=2|pages=53–78|doi=10.1300/j082v32n02_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Fassinger proposed two processes of identity development: Individual sexual identity relating to one's internal awareness and acceptance of self, and group membership identity relating to one's role in the gay/lesbian community.&lt;ref name=difference&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fassinger|first=R. E.|title=Lesbian, gay, and bisexual identity and student development theory|journal=Working with lesbian, gay bisexual, and transgender college students: A handbook for faculty and administrators|year=1998|pages=13–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both processes consist of four sequential phases, in which an individual can reside in a different phase for each process:
# Awareness: perceiving oneself as different from other people
# Exploration: investigating feelings of attraction for individuals of the same sex
# Deepening/Commitment: internalizing the sense of self as a gay or lesbian person
# Internalization/Synthesis: incorporating one's sexual identity into one's overall identity

Individuals can repeat phases as new environmental contexts occur, and development in one process can influence development in the other.

For the group membership identity process, Fassinger offers specific markers for the demonstration of each phase:
# Awareness of the existence of people with different sexual orientations
# Exploration of one's relationship to the gay and/or lesbian community
# Commitment to the gay and lesbian community, including an acceptance of the potentially negative consequences
# Internalizing the minority group identity across contexts

{{Update|date=November 2018|reason=Much of the information on this article is old (not out of date). There have been many other studies, critiques, etc. of gender bias on Wikipedia and the article must be updated to reflect that.}}
[[File:LE15_Gender_overall_in_2018.png|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Pie chart for gender of Wikipedia editors: 90% male, 9% female, and 1% transsexual or transgender|Wikipedia editors surveyed by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] in 2018 were predominantly male.]]

'''Gender bias on Wikipedia''' reflects the fact that a dominant majority of volunteer Wikipedia editors, particularly on the [[English Wikipedia|English-language site]], are male. This has led to Wikipedia having fewer and less extensive articles about women or topics important to women.

It figures among the most frequent [[criticism of Wikipedia|criticisms of Wikipedia]], and part of a more general criticism about [[systemic bias in Wikipedia]]. The [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which runs Wikipedia, agrees with these criticisms and has made an ongoing attempt to increase female editorship of Wikipedia. [[Edit-a-thon]]s have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.

''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed out that Wikipedia's female participation rate may be in line with other "public thought-leadership forums".&lt;ref name=Cohen110130 /&gt; In 2009, a Wikimedia Foundation survey revealed that 6% of editors who made more than 500 edits were female, with the average male editor having twice as many edits.&lt;ref name=Clubhouse&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~lam/papers/wp-gender-wikisym2011.pdf |title = WP:Clubhouse?

In the English Wikipedia and five other language editions that were studied by researchers, the ratio of articles about women to articles about men was higher than in three other databases. However, analysis with computational linguistics concluded that the way women and men are described in articles demonstrates bias, with articles about women more likely to overuse words relating to gender and family. The researchers believe that this is a sign Wikipedia editors consider male the "null gender" (in other words, that "male" is assumed unless otherwise specified).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.technologyreview.com/s/534616/computational-linguistics-reveals-how-wikipedia-articles-are-biased-against-women/ |title = Computational Linguistics Reveals How Wikipedia Articles Are Biased Against Women |last = arXiv |first = Emerging Technology from the |work = MIT Technology Review |access-date = 21 August 2017 |language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critique of Wikipedia's approach, from a 2014 ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial, is that it has difficulty making judgments about "what matters". To illustrate this point they noted that [[List of pornographic actresses by decade|the page listing pornographic actresses]] was better organized than [[List of women writers|the page listing women writers]].&lt;ref name=GuardianAugust2014&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'' 2014 (London) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/07/guardian-view-wikipedia-evolving-truth The Guardian view on Wikipedia: evolving truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112212758/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/07/guardian-view-wikipedia-evolving-truth |date=November 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[United Nations University]] and [[UNU-MERIT]] jointly presented an overview of the results of a global Wikipedia survey.&lt;ref name=WPSurvey2010&gt;{{cite web |title = Wikipedia Survey: Overview Results |url = http://www.wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf |last1 = Glott |first1 = Ruediger |last2 = Schmidt |first2 = Philipp |last3 = Ghosh |first3 = Rishab |date = March 2010 |website =  |publisher =  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100414165445/http://wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf |archivedate = 14 April 2010 |accessdate = 11 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 30 January 2011, ''New York Times'' article cited this [[Wikimedia Foundation]] collaboration, which indicated that fewer than 13% of contributors to Wikipedia are women.  [[Sue Gardner]], then executive director of the foundation, said that increasing diversity was about making the encyclopedia "as good as it could be." Factors the article cited as possibly discouraging women from editing included the "obsessive fact-loving realm", associations with the "hard-driving hacker crowd," and the necessity to be "open to very difficult, high-conflict people, even misogynists”.&lt;ref name=Cohen110130&gt;{{cite news |last = Cohen |first = Noam |date = 30 January 2011 |title = Define Gender Gap?

She said that the often contentious nature of Wikipedia article "talk" pages, where article content is discussed, is unappealing to many women, "if not outright intimidating."&lt;ref name=Herring110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Herring |first = Susan C. |date = 4 February 2011 |title = Communication Styles Make a Difference |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/communication-styles-make-a-difference |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 11 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140724050237/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/communication-styles-make-a-difference |archivedate = 24 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Reagle|Joseph M. Reagle]] reacted similarly, saying that the combination of a "culture of hacker elitism," combined with the disproportionate effect of high-conflict members (a minority) on the community atmosphere, can make it unappealing. He said, "the ideology and rhetoric of freedom and openness can then be used (a) to suppress concerns about inappropriate or offensive speech as "censorship" and (b) to rationalize low female participation as simply a matter of their personal preference and choice."&lt;ref name=Reagle110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Reagle |first = Joseph M. |date = 4 February 2011 |title = 'Open' Doesn't Include Everyone |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/open-doesnt-include-everyone |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 11 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140715113229/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/open-doesnt-include-everyone |archivedate = 15 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justine Cassell]] said that although women are as knowledgeable as men, and as able to defend their point of view, "it is still the case in American society that debate, contention, and vigorous defense of one’s position is often still seen as a male stance, and women’s use of these speech styles can call forth negative evaluations."&lt;ref name=Cassell110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Cassell |first = Justine |date = 4 February 2011 |title = Editing Wars Behind the Scenes |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/a-culture-of-editing-wars |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170227113525/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/a-culture-of-editing-wars |archivedate = 27 February 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[International Journal of Communication]]'' published research by Reagle and Lauren Rhue that examined the coverage, gender representation, and article length of thousands of biographical subjects on the English-language Wikipedia and the online ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. They concluded that Wikipedia provided better coverage and longer articles in general, that Wikipedia typically has more articles on women than ''Britannica'' in absolute terms, but Wikipedia articles on women were more likely to be missing than articles on men relative to ''Britannica''. That is, Wikipedia dominated ''Britannica'' in biographical coverage, but more so when it comes to men. Similarly, one might say that ''Britannica'' is more balanced in whom it neglects to cover than Wikipedia. For both reference works, article length did not consistently differ by gender.&lt;ref name="Reagle-Rhue"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Reagle |first1 = Joseph |last2 = Rhue |first2 = Lauren |title = Gender Bias in Wikipedia and ''Britannica'' |url = http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631 |year = 2011 |journal = International Journal of Communication |volume = 5 |publisher = Joseph Reagle &amp; Lauren Rhue |pages = 1138–1158 |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160322081809/http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631 |archivedate = 22 March 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the Wikimedia Foundation conducted its first semi-annual Wikipedia survey. It suggested that 9% of Wikipedia editors are women. It also reported, "Contrary to the perception of some, our data shows that very few women editors feel like they have been harassed, and very few feel Wikipedia is a sexualized environment."&lt;ref name=WES2011&gt;{{cite web |url = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Editor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf |title = Wikipedia Editors Study: Results From ''The Editor Survey, April 2011'' |date = April 2011 |website = [[Wikipedia]] |accessdate = 18 May 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141226041321/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Editor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf |archivedate = 26 December 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an October 2011 paper at the [[WikiSym|International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration]] found evidence that suggested that Wikipedia may have "a culture that may be resistant to female participation".&lt;ref name=WPClubhouse&gt;{{cite conference |last1 = Lam |first1 = Shyong K. |last2 = Uduwage |first2 = Anuradha |last3 = Dong |first3 = Zhenhua |last4 = Sen |first4 = Shilad |last5 = Musicant |first5 = David R. |last6 = Terveen |first6 = Loren |last7 = Reidl |first7 = John |date = October 2011 |title = WP:Clubhouse?

A study published in 2014 found that there is also an "Internet skills gap" with regard to Wikipedia editors. The authors found that the most likely Wikipedia contributors are high-skilled men and that there is no gender gap among low-skilled editors, and concluded that the "skills gap" exacerbates the gender gap among editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Hargittai |first1 = Eszter |last2 = Shaw |first2 = Aaron |title = Mind the skills gap: the role of Internet know-how and gender in differentiated contributions to Wikipedia |journal = Information, Communication &amp; Society |date = 4 November 2014 |pages = 1–19 |doi = 10.1080/1369118X.2014.957711 |volume = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2010–14, women made up 61% of participants of the college courses arranged by the Wiki Education Foundation program that included editing Wikipedia as part of the curriculum. Their contributions were found to shift the Wikipedia content from pop-culture and [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] towards social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sacbee.com/2014/09/23/6727564/bruce-maiman-wikipedia-grows-up.html |title = Wikipedia grows up on college campuses |author = Bruce Maiman |date = 23 September 2014 |website = [[The Sacramento Bee]] |accessdate = 23 September 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140923224639/http://www.sacbee.com/2014/09/23/6727564/bruce-maiman-wikipedia-grows-up.html |archivedate = 23 September 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Wagner et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Wagner |first1 = Claudia |last2 = Graells-Garrido |first2 = Eduardo |last3 = Garcia, |first3 = David |last4 = Menczer |first4 = Filippo |title = Women through the glass ceiling: gender asymmetries in Wikipedia |journal = EPJ Data Science |date = 1 March 2016 |doi = 10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0066-4 |volume = 5 |number = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; found linguistic gender bias manifest in family-, gender-, and relationship-related topics being more present in biographies about women, and in positive terms being more frequent in the biographies of men and negative terms more frequent in the biographies of women. The authors also found structural differences in terms of meta-data and hyperlinks, which have consequences for information-seeking activities.

A 2017 study found that women participating in an experiment by editing a Wikipedia-like site tended to view other editors as male, and to view their responses as more critical than if the other editor was [[gender-neutral]]. The study concluded that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Shane-Simpson |first1=Christina |last2=Gillespie-Lynch |first2=Kristen |title=Examining potential mechanisms underlying the Wikipedia gender gap through a collaborative editing task |journal=[[Computers in Human Behavior]] |date=January 2017 |volume=66 |pages=312–328 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.043|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01612306/document }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote |text = ...visible female editors on Wikipedia and broader encouragement of the use of constructive feedback may begin to alleviate the Wikipedia gender gap. Furthermore, the relatively high proportion of anonymous editors may exacerbate the Wikipedia gender gap, as anonymity may often be perceived as male and more critical.}}

A study by Ford and Wajcman observes that research on the gender bias continues to frame the problem as a deficit in women. In contrast, their central argument states that infrastructure studies in [[feminist technoscience]] allows the gender analysis to be taken to a further level. It looks at three issues within the infrastructure: content policies, software and the legalistic framework of operation. It suggests that progress can be made through altering that culture of [[knowledge production]] through encouraging alternate knowledge, reducing the technical barriers to editing, and addressing the complexity of Wikipedia policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Ford |first1 = Heather |last2 = Wajcman |first2 = Judy |title = 'Anyone can edit', not everyone does: Wikipedia and the gender gap |journal = Social Studies of Science |date = 2017 |url = http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/ |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161228081909/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/ |archivedate = 28 December 2016 |df = dmy-all | doi = 10.1177/0306312717692172 |volume=47 |pages=511–527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, mathematician [[Marie A. Vitulli]] wrote in ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The percentage of women editors on Wikipedia remains dismally low."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201803/rnoti-p330.pdf|title=Writing Women in Mathematics into Wikipedia 65 (3). pp. 331–332. doi:10.1090/noti1650|last=Vitulli|first=Marie A.|date=March 2018|publisher=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|access-date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, when [[Donna Strickland]] won a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], numerous write-ups mentioned that she did not previously have a Wikipedia page. A draft had been submitted, but was rejected for not demonstrating "significant coverage (not just passing mentions) about the subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel prize winning scientist who wasn’t famous enough for Wikipedia |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/the-nobel-prize-winning-scientist-who-wasn-t-famous-enough-for-wikipedia-1.3650212 |website=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=3 October 2018 |date=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2018/oct/02/nobel-prize-in-physics-2018-live&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leyland Cecco|title=Female Nobel prize winner deemed not important enough for Wikipedia entry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/03/donna-strickland-nobel-physics-prize-wikipedia-denied|work=The Guardian|date=2018-10-03|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several causes for this gender disparity have been suggested.

Lam ''et al''. suggest that there may be a culture which is non-inclusive of women on Wikipedia, which may be due to a disparity in male-to-female centric topics represented and edited, the tendency for female users to be more active in the [[Community of Wikipedia|social and community aspects of Wikipedia]], an increased likelihood that edits by new female editors are reverted, and/or that articles with high proportions of female editors are more contentious.&lt;ref name=WPClubhouse /&gt;

In July 2014, the [[National Science Foundation]] announced that it would spend $200,000 to study systemic gender bias on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freebeacon.com/issues/government-funded-study-why-is-wikipedia-sexist/ |title=Government-Funded Study: Why Is Wikipedia Sexist? |work=[[Washington Free Beacon]] |date=30 July 2014 |author= Elizabeth Harrington |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801062009/http://freebeacon.com/issues/government-funded-study-why-is-wikipedia-sexist/ |archivedate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article by Julia Adams and Hannah Brückner that was supported by the funding was published in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Julia |last1=Adams |first2=Hannah |last2=Brückner |title=Wikipedia, sociology, and the promise and pitfalls of Big Data |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951715614332|journal=Big Data &amp; Society |date=27 December 2015 |issn=2053-9517 |volume=2 |issue=2 |doi=10.1177/2053951715614332}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|reason=Please tell us what the report's findings were.

== Reactions ==

The Wikimedia Foundation has officially held, since at least 2011 when Gardner was executive director, that gender bias exists in the project. It has made some attempts to address it but Gardner has expressed frustration with the degree of success achieved. She has also noted that "in the very limited leisure time women had, they tended to be more involved in social activities instead of editing Wikipedia. 'Women see technology more as a tool they use to accomplish tasks, rather than something fun in itself.{{'"}}&lt;ref name=Huang130811&gt;{{cite news |last = Huang |first = Keira |date = 11 August 2013 |title = Wikipedia fails to bridge gender gap |url = http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1295872/wikipedia-fails-bridge-gender-gap |newspaper = South China Morning Post |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160115195821/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1295872/wikipedia-fails-bridge-gender-gap |archivedate = 15 January 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wikistorm2013&gt;{{cite web |url = http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/wikistorming/ |title = Wikistorming |date = Fall 2013 |website = FemTechNet |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150717034630/http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/wikistorming/ |archivedate = 17 July 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Foundation set a target of having 25 percent of its contributors identifying as female by 2015.&lt;ref name=Cohen110130 /&gt; In August 2013, Gardner said, "I didn't solve it. We didn't solve it. The Wikimedia Foundation didn't solve it. The solution won't come from the Wikimedia Foundation."&lt;ref name=Huang130811 /&gt;

Writing for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' in 2011, [[Heather Mac Donald]] called Wikipedia's gender imbalance a "non-problem in search of a misguided solution." Mac Donald asserted, "The most straightforward explanation for the differing rates of participation in Wikipedia—and the one that conforms to everyday experience—is  that, on average, males and females have different interests and preferred ways of spending their free time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Mac Donald |first = Heather |url = http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/02/wikipedia_is_maledominated_that_doesnt_mean_its_sexist.html |title = Wikipedia Is Male-Dominated.

In August 2014, Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] announced in a BBC interview the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]'s plans for "doubling down" on the gender content gap at Wikipedia. Wales said the Foundation would be open to more outreach and more software changes.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28701772 Wikipedia 'completely failed' to fix gender imbalance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229004148/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28701772 |date=29 December 2016 }}, [[BBC]] interview with [[Jimmy Wales]], 8 August 2014; starting at 45 seconds.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts to increase female editorship ==

[[File:Giants in the field of Women in the Arts 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Attendees at the 2013 Women in the Arts edit-a-thon in Washington, DC]]

Dedicated [[edit-a-thon]]s have been organized to increase the coverage of women's topics in Wikipedia and to encourage more women to edit Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/closing-wikipedias-gender-gap-reluctantly.html |title = Closing Wikipedia’s Gender Gap — Reluctantly |work = [[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date = 11 February 2014 |accessdate = 27 August 2014 |author = Stoeffel |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140902160836/http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/closing-wikipedias-gender-gap-reluctantly.html |archivedate = 2 September 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These events are supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, which sometimes provides mentors and technology to help guide newer editors through the process.

The [[Wikipedia:Teahouse/About|Wikipedia Teahouse]] project was launched with the goal to provide a user-friendly environment for newcomers, with a particular goal of boosting women's participation in Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://dub.washington.edu/pubs/364 |title = Tea &amp; Sympathy: Crafting Positive New User Experiences on Wikipedia |website = washington.edu |publisher = Proc.

An early-2015 initiative to create a "women-only" space for Wikipedia editors was strongly opposed by Wikipedians.&lt;ref&gt;Paling, Emma, "[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/how-wikipedia-is-hostile-to-women/411619/ How Wikipedia Is Hostile to Women] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021174625/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/how-wikipedia-is-hostile-to-women/411619/ |date=21 October 2015 }}", ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 21 October 2015 {{Subscription or advertising}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9265">'''Gender mainstreaming in teacher education policy''' refers to efforts to examine and change processes of policy formulation and implementation across all areas and at all levels from a gender perspective so as to address and correct existing and emerging disparities between men and women. It is a strategy to change the process of policy design, implementation and evaluation by taking into consideration the gender specific and often diverse needs, priorities, interests and values of differently positioned men and women.&lt;ref&gt;True, J. 2003. Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy. ''International Feminist Journal of Politics'', Vol. 5, No. 3, pp. 368–396.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, [[gender mainstreaming]] is about awareness of the existence of gender disparities and their causes and implications, and ensures that they are addressed at each phase of the policy cycle or policy analyses and revision.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context and process ==
There are two situations in which [[Teacher Education Institutes]] (TEIs) can find themselves. One is that they may not have a policy at all, and the other is that they might have a policy but that the policy may not have addressed gender issues or mainstreamed gender. In the  first instance, TEIs need to develop a gender-responsive policy for their institutions, and in the second they need to review their policy from gender perspectives. In this part of the module we will look at mainstreaming gender in the different phases of the policy cycle: Problem Definition, Agenda Setting, Policy Formulation, Policy Legitimation and Policy Evaluation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Problem definition ===
Problem definition explains the nature, scope and significance of the problem within the context of the current policy environment (international, regional and national legal and policy commitments). During this stage, a problem is identified and examined, and possible solutions are explored through research and discussion. It requires that the delineation of the policy problem is as clear as possible in order to help identify problems of [[teacher education]], as well as gender issues that are relevant at the national level and that can be addressed by formulating policy in their applicable institutions. Whatever the problem identified, the TEI must be seen from the perspective of [[gender equality]]. In order to do this, the first step is to investigate gender disparities in different areas and levels among students, teaching staff and administration. In this regard, some of the following areas are analyzed:
* Number of male and female teaching staff
* Number of male and female teaching staff by qualification
* Number of male and female staff holding key administrative positions
* Number of male and female trainees
* Number of male and female trainees by academic performance&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Agenda setting ===
Once a problem is identified, a decision has to be reached as to whether it requires a policy intervention. If so, efforts will be made to bring the matter and its possible solutions to the attention of relevant staff and decision-makers to make it a policy-requiring issue. Already existing policies, strategies, programmes or offices may address some of the problems. The institute may need to review the policies, programmes or office structures, and also introduce a gender equality perspective to strengthen them further and address the problems more effectively. If there are gender-responsive policies available, TEIs may need to come up with a more concrete implementation plan, while other problems may require a policy initiative. In such a situation, the problem could be presented as a policy agenda to the relevant authority for consideration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Defining goals and outputs ===
After defining the problem, and once the problem is considered as requiring policy intervention, goals are identified in order to address the problem. In the context of TEIs, the goals could range from increasing enrolment, addressing quality, acquiring resources, and mitigating high staff turnover to narrowing gender disparities. Policy goals need to state gender concerns specifically and visibly. Different performance indicators and sex-disaggregated data need to be considered to capture the gender dimensions. The stated goals need to take into consideration the different gender related barriers women and men face to benefit equally and equitably.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Status of Women Canada. 1998. ''Gender-based analysis. A guide for policy-making''. Ottawa, Status of Women Canada. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.paci&lt;/nowiki&gt; cwater.org/user les/ le/IWRM/Toolboxes/gender/gender_based_analysis. pdf (Accessed 3 July 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy formulation ===
Policy formulation has two basic stages: determining the policy options and selecting the preferred option. This process may involve debate over alternative policy choices, which takes into account both the benefits and costs of each policy option. The policy alternatives are derived from a research process that investigates the problem in an in-depth manner using either primary or secondary sources of data or both. In collecting information all data, all relevant individuals and organizations have to be consulted, and all numerical data have to be disaggregated by sex. This stage may also entail analysis of existing policies. Based on the information gathered, the preferred policy options are presented, which will enable the policy objective to be effectively and efficiently reached.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Policy legitimation ===
For a policy to obtain a legal status, it has to be approved as an official policy document by relevant authorities in the TEI, as well as the ministry or relevant divisions within the ministry, depending on the structures and the practices of that specific country. This is an important step as it gives the policy legitimacy. Once it is approved, a policy also serves as an advocacy instrument, as well as a document that could be used to raise funds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Policy implementation ===
Implementation refers to the actual practical activities that need to be carried out to realize the policy goals and objectives. A number of critical decisions are made at this stage: decisions about regulations, structures, budget and partnerships, all of which are necessary to implement the policy. Policy implementation requires a commitment. As observed from experience, many countries and organizations have very good policy instruments, but most of the time they remain on paper. After going through the process of policy development, which is very resource intensive, its implementation requires serious consideration. The first inquiry should determine the changes needed to implement the policy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Policy evaluation ===
Evaluation is monitoring and assessing the process and impact of policy implementation. Policy research and analysis are used as strategies to evaluate whether the policy goals were reached, and if there were any unanticipated positive or negative outcomes. The evaluation process also attempts to see the various types of impacts: direct versus indirect, and short term versus long term. The information gathered from the evaluation will be used as inputs in the next policy cycle or process. Policy monitoring and evaluation is usually a challenging step as it requires consistent follow up, information collection, and efforts to compare policy goals with the outcome of activities carried out to implement the policy. The policy goals serve as a framework for any instrument that is designed to collect and compile information for the evaluation. The instruments that are designed should ensure that gender is included as a category of analysis and that issues concerning both men and women are included in the questions. Specific women's issues, as identified in the policy problem, should be covered, and during the data collection process both men and women should be included as sources of data. In the context of TEIs the data to be gathered on enrolment, performance and achievement, in-service training, promotion, leadership and administration are to be disaggregated by sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Guizhou University''' ({{zh|c=贵州大学}};  [[Pinyin]]: Guìzhōu Dàxué), known as '''Guida''' (贵大 Guì Dà, English abbreviation '''GZU'''), is a provincial research university located in suburban [[Guiyang]], capital of [[Guizhou]], [[China]]. Founded in 1902, it is the flagship institution of higher learning in Guizhou province. With over 30,000 students, Guida is one of the largest universities in southwest China.

The university was selected to participate in [[Project 211]], a government initiative which provided significant funding to elevate the research standards and faculty hiring resources of rising universities across China. In 2017, the university was recognized by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Education]] as a [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class University]], with Double First Class status in certain disciplines which the government seeks to elevate to "world-class" status.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The predecessor of the modern Guizhou University was known as the Guizhou Institute of Higher Learning (贵州大学堂), which was founded in 1902. The institute evolved into the Provincial Guizhou University (省立贵州大学), National Guizhou College of Agriculture and Engineering (国立贵州农工学院), and finally National Guizhou University (国立贵州大学).

In 1997, the Guizhou Agricultural College, Guizhou Institute of Arts, and Guizhou Agricultural Cadre-Training School were merged into NGU to form Guizhou University.

In 2004, the Guizhou University of Technology merged into Guizhou University to complete the current Guizhou University. In 2005, the University was invited as a member of [[Project 211]] by the Ministry of Education.

Guizhou University established a sister school relationship with the Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina; the latter offers a Chinese language program for the fifteen American students every year.

== Disciplines==
The university consists of 39 colleges and offers programs of study in 11 academic divisions leading to associate, baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral degrees. These include:
*Agriculture
*Administration 
*Economics
*Education
*Engineering
*History
*Law
*Liberal arts
*Medicine 
*Philosophy
*Sciences

==International cooperation and Peace Corps involvement==
In 1989 Guizhou Agricultural College, then a separate university, began hosting VSO teachers in the Foreign Language Department. The following year, Guizhou University began hosting foreign teachers from the AISH programme in Australia and visiting teacher programmes in both New Zealand and the University of Alabama. Simultaneously, VSO teachers from the UK and the Netherlands were recruited to work in other Guiyang institutes of higher education including the school of fashion and the catering college, both experiencing booms concurrent with Guiyang's emergence from relative obscurity. These teachers taught in both the undergraduate and post-graduate programmes at each institution. 

In 2005, eight years after Gui Nong (Guizhou Agricultural College) was merged with Gui Da (Guizhou University), Guizhou University began hosting [[Peace Corps|United States Peace Corps]] Volunteers. The volunteers teach at both the undergraduate and graduate level in the School of Foreign Languages.

==Tales and myths of impalement==

===Europe===

====Vampires and other undead====
The idea that the vampire "can ''only'' be slain with a stake driven through its heart" has been pervasive in European fiction. Examples such as Bram Stoker's [[Dracula]] and the more recent [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy The Vampire Slayer]] and [[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]] series' all incorporate that idea.&lt;ref&gt;For popularity claim and example:[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2155602/Vampire-skeletons-impaled-iron-stakes-say-arent-just-film-fantasy.html Thought vampires were just film fantasy? Skeletons impaled on iron stakes say otherwise]&lt;/ref&gt; In classic European folklore, it was believed that one method, ''among several'', to "kill" a [[vampire]], or prevent a corpse from rising as a vampire, was to drive a wooden stake through the heart before interment.&lt;ref&gt;''Barber'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In one story, an [[Istria]]n peasant named [[Jure Grando]] died and was buried in 1656. It was believed that he returned as a vampire, and at least one villager tried to drive a stake through his heart, but failed in the attempt. Finally, in 1672, the corpse was [[decapitation|decapitated]], and the vampire terror was put to rest.&lt;ref&gt;''Caron'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Eastern European, in particular Slavic (but also Roumanian), conception of the vampire as an undead creature in which impaling it was central to either destroying it, or at least immobilizing it, is the most well-known European tradition, such traditions can also be found elsewhere in Europe. In Greece, the troublesome undead were usually called a [[vrykolakas]]. The archaeologist Susan-Marie Cronkite&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elementshealthspace.com/masthead/ Bio on Cronkite]&lt;/ref&gt; describes an odd grave found at [[Mytilene]], at [[Lesbos]], a find the archeologists connected with the vrykolakas superstition.&lt;ref&gt;''Cronkite''(2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norse [[draugr]], or haugbui (mound-dweller), was a type of undead typically (but not exclusively) associated with those put (supposedly) to rest in burial mounds/[[tumulus|tumuli]]. The approved methods of killing a draugr are "to sever his head from his body and set the same beneath his rump, or impale his body with a stake or burn it to ashes".&lt;ref&gt;''Andrews'' (1913), p.603. Several examples in the essay on grave robbery and encounters with draugr there and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in modern vampiric lore, the stake is regarded as a very effective tool against the undead, people in pre-modern Europe could have their doubts. [[Edward Payson Evans]] tells the following story, from the city [[Kadaň]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Evans'' (1906), [https://books.google.com/books?id=delFlcGFniYC&amp;pg=PA196 p.196]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|In 1337, a herdsman near the town of Cadan came forth from his grave every night, visiting the villages, terrifying the inhabitants, conversing affably with some and murdering others. Every person, with whom he associated, was doomed to die within eight days and to wander as a vampire after death. In order to keep him in his grave, a stake was driven through his body, but he only laughed at this clumsy attempt to impale a ghost, saying: "You have really rendered me a great service by providing me with a staff, with which to ward off dogs when I go out to walk"}}

====Literary treatment of impalement====
A graphic description of the vertical impalement of a Serbian rebel by Ottoman authorities can be found in [[Ivo Andrić]]'s novel ''[[The Bridge on the Drina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of impalement in book can be accessed here: [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Bridge+on+the+Drina+%28excerpts%29.-a0165021314 The Bridge on the Drina]&lt;/ref&gt; Andrić was later awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] for the whole of his literary contribution, though this novel was the ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;On status as Nobel Laureate, predominantly on basis of Bridge, see: [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/books/a-reader-s-guide-to-the-balkans.html A Reader's Guide to the Balkans]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anecdotes of the impaled====
Some anecdotes of the behavior and fates of the impaled remain which, if true, would be unique in the history of impalement. The first was narrated as a proof of the efficacy of praying to [[Saint Barbara]]. In the woods of Bohemia around 1552, there was a robber band roaming, plundering and murdering innocent travelers. A manhunt was organized, and the robber chief was apprehended and sentenced to be impaled. While one of his associates, likewise impaled, swiftly expired, the chief was not so lucky.
All day long, he writhed on his stake, begging to be killed, but all in vain. That night, in his despair, he prayed to St. Barbara that he was truly sorry for all his evil doings in life and that all he hoped for was to reconcile with God and to be graced with a good death. Seemingly in response, the man's stake broke, and with great effort and pain, he managed to ''de-impale'' himself. Crawling along, he came to a house, and his cries of help were heard. He was helped into a bed, and a priest was sent for. The former robber chief then gave his death bed confession, grieving over his misspent life, but properly grateful to God and St. Barbara. He then died in peace, his hands folded over his chest.&lt;ref&gt;''Vierholz'' (1737) [https://books.google.com/books?id=jrY_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA493 p.&amp;nbsp;493–95]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident, which was, allegedly, partially witnessed by the editor of a "Ladies' Journal", is said to have occurred in Wallachia in the 1770s. He had been present in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] when 27 robbers had been impaled. It was strictly forbidden to give the impaled persons any water, but one woman took mercy on one of the robbers, and fetched water for him in a kettle. As she was glancing anxiously about to check if anyone took notice of her forbidden act of mercy, the robber smashed her head in with the kettle, killing her on the spot. The editor avers he was present when the robber was asked why he had done such a thing, and he merely replied he had done it on a whim, and just had felt like killing her then and there.&lt;ref&gt;''Damengesellschaft'' (1785) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3pMSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 p.&amp;nbsp;95–97]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
In [[British Columbia]], a folk tale from the [[Lillooet people|Lillooet People]] is preserved in which impalement occurs as a central element. A man became suspicious of his wife because she went out each day to gather roots and cedar-bark but hardly ever brought anything home. One day, he spied on her, and discovered that she was cavorting with Lynx, rather than doing her wifely duties. The next day, he asked to accompany her, and they went out in the forest, and came at last to a very tall tree. The man climbed to the top of it, the wife following. The jealous man then sharpened the top of the tree with his knife, and impaled his wife on it. On his way down, he removed the bark of the tree, so it became slick. The woman cried out her pain and her brothers heard her. They and animals they called to help them tried to rescue her, but the stem was too slick for them to climb up to reach her. Then Snail offered to help her, and slowly crawled up the tree. But alas, Snail moved too slowly, and by the time it took him to reach the top of the tree, the woman was dead.&lt;ref&gt;The brothers later on revenged themselves on the husband, through a clever ruse. ''Teit'' (1912), p. 339–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Among tribes living around the [[Titicaca]], tales circulated in the sixteenth century that prior to the [[Incas]], a mysterious group of white men lived there, and their banishment was somehow connected with the birth of the Sun. A sixteenth century tale collected by a Spanish missionary tells of such an individual, called Tanupa or Taapac, who was impaled by other Indians around the Titicaca, and a shrine was set up there to commemorate the events.&lt;ref&gt;''Bandelier'' (1904), impalement incident at p.224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martyrdom of al-Hallaj===
The renowned Sufi mystic was in AD 922 to be impaled for blasphemy in Baghdad, for having said such things as "I am God". However, the executioners were unable to do so, because al-Hallaj floated in the air just above their reach. Then, al-Hallaj's spirit ascended to Heaven, and conversed with Muhammed, the Prophet of Islam, and al-Hallaj asked the Prophet if he should let himself be impaled. The Prophet acknowledged that al-Hallaj's spiritual state was so heightened that his utterance "I am God" was both just and true, but that for the sake of ordinary people, he should let himself be impaled, because their spiritual state was such that they would be mislead from practical religion if they were to believe in such sayings like "I am God". And thus, for the sake of preserving the religion of ordinary people, al-Hallaj let himself be impaled at last.&lt;ref&gt;Lit.Soc. Bombay (1819), [https://books.google.com/books?id=12soAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 p. 111–113]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism===
Tales and anecdotes concerning how dreadfully swift and harsh Ottoman justice was for comparatively trivial offenses abound. [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], a Moldavian noble living in Constantinople at the end of the 17th century, and often engaged in pleas of cases towards Ottoman authorities, narrates a tale from the building of a great mosque there in 1461. The Greek architect was amply rewarded by the sultan, so that a whole street was privileged to the Greek populace in recognition of his efforts. However, some asked the architect if he could even build a greater and more beautiful mosque than the one completed. Incautiously, the architect said sure enough, if I were given the materials. The sultan, upon hearing this, was so fearful that his successors might create an even more beautiful mosque than his own, that just in case, he chose to impale the architect to deprive successors of that genius, commemorating the event by erecting a huge iron spike in the middle of the mosque. Not even bothering to refute this tale of impalement, Cantemir says that he ''does'', however, believe in the grand gift of the street, because he had used the original charter from the sultan to protect the Greek interest when somebody wanted to deprive the Greeks of the privilege. Cantemir won his case.&lt;ref&gt;''Cantemir'' (1734), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q3NUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 p.109]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1632, under [[Murad IV]] (r.1623–40), a hapless interpreter in a fierce dispute between the French ambassador and Ottoman authorities was impaled alive for faithfully translating the insolent words of the ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;The French had been accused of bringing a Muslim woman on board a ship, ''Browne'' (1751) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=248&amp;id=XjYLAAAAYAAJ p.248]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Murad IV sought to ban the use of tobacco, and reportedly impaled alive a man and a woman for breaking the law, the one for selling tobacco, the other for using it.&lt;ref&gt;''Sherwood, Jones'' (1825) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=722&amp;id=8esTAAAAIAAJ p.722]&lt;/ref&gt; Another such anecdote, is said to have occurred in 1695 under [[Mustafa II]]: The Grand Vizier prevented access to the sultan to a poor shoemaker who had a petition for his sovereign. Once the sultan learnt of it, he promptly ordered the Grand Vizier to be impaled, although the Grand Vizier was the son of the sultan's favourite concubine.&lt;ref&gt;''Percy'' (1825), [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0k4AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA147 p.147]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian sub-continent===
In the Hindu [[Draupadi]] cult, impalement of animals, demons, and humans is a recurring motif within legends and symbolic re-enactments during holidays/festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=diPh4qYtjPUC The Cult of Draupadi]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Shaivite]] story from India, under the old [[Pandyan Dynasty]], ruling from 500 BC-1500 CE, the 7th century King [[Koon Pandiyan]] had 8000 [[Jainism|Jains]] [[Impalement of the Jains in Madurai|impaled in Madurai]]. Some historians regard the story as a legend rather than historically accurate, and that it might have been created by the Shaivites to prove their superiority over the Jains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sastri|1976|p=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Roy|1984|loc=chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act, legendary or not, is still commemorated in "lurid mural representations" in several Hindu temples in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Paul Dundas|Dundas]]'' (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ialKAbIyV4C p.127] The author mentions as an example the temple to the war god [[Murugan]] in [[Kalugumalai]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such depictions in temples can be found in the [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] in [[Madurai]], around the holy tank enclosure to the shrine of [[Meenakshi]]. There, a long line of impaled Jaines are depicted, with dogs at their feet, licking up the blood, and crows flying around to pick out their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;''AES'' (1904), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ybyzrkuQaUEC&amp;pg=PA52 p.52]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Representations of impaled members of a different religion than Hinduism seems not to be confined to the Jains, but also to Buddhists. In a temple at Trivatur, not far from Madras (present name [[Chennai]]), for example, the walls "are covered with sculptures representing the execution of Buddhists by the most horrible tortures, the martyrs being impaled alive and left to be devoured by dogs and birds of prey." ''Elliot'' (1869), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NRISAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 p.109] This presumably commemorates an alleged persecution of Buddhists in the 2nd century BC under Hindu King [[Pushyamitra Shunga]], as narrated, for example, in 2nd century AD text [[Ashokavadana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bengal, tales existed about a foolish king in the [[Pala Empire]], Bhava Chandra, and his equally foolish minister. They are a pair not unlike the [[Wise Men of Gotham]], bereft of common sense as a result of a curse laid upon them. In their last judgment, they had condemned two robbers to be impaled, but when the robbers began quarreling about who should get impaled on the longest pole, Bhava Chandra and his minister became deeply intrigued. The robbers told them that whoever died on the longest pole would be reincarnated as the ruler of the Earth, while the other would become his minister. Thinking it unseemly that two mere robbers should gain such a high position in their next life, Bhava Chandra chose to impale himself on the longest pole, while his minister happily chose to die on the shorter.&lt;ref&gt;''[[William Wilson Hunter|Hunter]]'' (1875) [https://archive.org/details/astatisticalacc00unkngoog p.313]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of persons impaled have, occasionally, been thought imbued with certain magical properties. For example, the [[Arthashastra]] states that if one wishes to make a fire at one place, and prevent any other fire to be lit there, one could make that fire "by the friction of a black-and-white bamboo stick on the rib bone of the left side of a man who has been slain with a sword, or impaled". Virginia Saunders also mentions from the same text how to become invisible:&lt;ref&gt;''Saunders'' (1922), p.422&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Or if invisibility is desired, having fasted three nights one should, on the day of the star Pushya, sprinkle with the milk of goats and sheep, barley planted in soil placed in the skull of a man who has been killed by a sword or has been impaled.}}
The [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[Mandavya]], when he was five years old, had amused himself with sticking a reed into a living locust. Lord [[Yama]], the god of death, bided his time to exact what he thought was a proper punishment. As an old man, Mandavya was sitting outside his cave in deep meditation, oblivious to some thieves placing their stolen goods there. Wrongfully believing Mandavya had stolen the goods, the authorities placed Mandavya on trial. He could not answer the judge on how the goods had come to be in his hermitage, so the king declared he was to be impaled. Mandavya seemed unperturbed by the whole affair, and when he was still alive, in deep contemplation, on the stake after 4 years, the king declared Mandavya had to be innocent, and ordered him pulled down. However, the stake broke inside Mandavya's body, and the excruciating pain destroyed Mandavya's trance. In deep bitterness, he asked the gods how he had deserved such a fate, and Yama answered it was because of the locust he had tortured as a young boy. Mandavya became infuriated at Yama and pointed out how disproportionate the punishment had been. He then cursed Yama to be born as a human being, namely as [[Vidura]], the son of a mere serving maid.&lt;ref&gt;Combined from two slightly variant accounts, ''Ward'' (1824), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlIqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA294 p. 294–95] and ''Garbe'' (1913), p. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt;

A tale from [[Kashmir]] of reincarnation after death on the stake concerns the sage Samdhimati. Samdhimati was minister under King Jayendra, when a mysterious prophecy spread through the populace: "To Samdhimati will belong the kingdom". Jayendra, on hearing of this, threw Samdhimati in prison for 10 years. When the king was on his death bed, he was unwilling to let Samdhimati have the prophecy fulfilled, so he ordered Samdhimati impaled. When Samdhimati's guru Isana heard of this, he went to the cemetery where Samhimati was impaled in order to perform the proper funeral rites. The wolves had devoured all the flesh of the body, and Isana was amazed that the prophecy was inscribed on Samdhimati's skull that he was to inherit the kingdom. Keeping watch, one night Isana saw the graveyard was filled with [[Yogini]]s (female mystics/witches). The Yoginis were drunk and "lustful for a man", and provided the skeleton with flesh (not the least, a penis) from their own bodies. They then captured Samdhimati's spirit, which was still hovering around, within the fleshed skeleton, and "spent the rest of the night sporting with him". As dawn approached, Isana, afraid that Samdhimati's new body should be dissolved by the witches, rushed out from his hiding place, and chased them away. In his new body and life, Samdhimati became known as [[Aryaraja]], and was, indeed, crowned as King of Kashmir, thereby fulfilling the prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;''Brown'' (1919), p. 425–26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Asia===
In the Buddhist conception of the eight Hells, as [[John Bowring]] relates from [[Siam]], those consigned for the Sixth Hell are impaled on spits and roasted. When well roasted, enormous dogs with iron teeth devour them. But, the damned are reborn, and must relive this punishment for 16000 years, over and over again&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;''Bowring'' (1857) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=306&amp;id=7tTzwqKN9RIC p.306]&lt;/ref&gt; Another tale popular in Siam was about [[Devadatta]], a wily antagonist to [[Buddha]] seeking to undermine [[Gautama]]'s position among his followers. For this crime, Devadatta was sent off into the very deepest Hell, the [[Avici]], being impaled on three great iron spears in a sea of flames.&lt;ref&gt;''Bowring'' (1857) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=313&amp;id=7tTzwqKN9RIC p.313] For rather similar, vivid depictions of the sufferings in Hell from Buddhist temples in [[Cambodia]], see ''Vincent Jr.'' (1878), p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illusions of impalement==
The 1980 Italian film, ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', directed by [[Ruggero Deodato]], graphically depicts impalement.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]]; [[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |location=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |work=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows a rescue party searching for a missing documentary film crew in the [[Amazon Rainforest]].&lt;ref name=sergio&gt;{{cite video | people = D'Offizi, Sergio (interviewee) |date = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's depiction of indigenous tribes, death of animals on set, and the graphic violence (notably the impalement scene) brought on a great deal of controversy, legal investigations, boycotts and protests by concerned social groups, bans in many countries (some of which are still in effect), and heavy censorship in countries where it has not been banned.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.refused-classification.com/Films_C.htm#cannibalholocaust | title=Films C | publisher=Refused-Classification.com | accessdate=2007-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impalement scene was so realistic, that Deodato was charged with murder at one point. Deodato had to produce evidence that the "impaled" actress was alive in the aftermath of the scene, and had to further explain how the [[special effect]] was done: the actress sat on a [[bicycle seat]] mounted to a pole while she looked up and held a short stake of [[balsa]] wood in her mouth. The charges were dropped.&lt;ref name=sergio/&gt;

In stage magic, the ''[[Impaled (illusion)|illusion of impalement]]'' is a popular feat of magic that appears to be an act of impalement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [http://www.wellingtonent.com/products/impaled.html Impaled]&lt;/ref&gt; Impaling tricks are not, however, a modern European invention, and some [[dervish]] orders performed such acts already in the 18th century. [[Carsten Niebuhr]], traveling the Middle East 1761–67 on a Danish funded expedition, saw such a display at [[Basra]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Pinkerton'' (1811), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HWEOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA172 p.172]&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|"The scene was in the open air, and in the court of the mosque, which was illuminated with only three lamps. Several Mullahs and dervises began with singing some passages out of the Koran. They continued to sing, with the accompaniment of some drums; and, during the music, the other dervises arose, took the sharp pointed irons, and did as if they were piercing their bodies, and even driving the irons with mallets into their flesh. Next appeared the principal actor, who, assuming an air of inspiration, directed the music to proceed, and to be raised to higher animation, in, order to assist his enthusiasm, or rather to stun the ears of the spectators. In his extacy, he threw up his turban in the air, loosened his hair; for this order of dervises wear their hair; and pierced his body with five lances: then mounting upon a low building, upon which a pole, sixteen feet long, and shod with a sharp iron point, had been set up, he impaled himself upon the pole, and was carried in this condition through the square. It was an affecting sight, to see a lean man, with a long beard, and dishevelled hair, wounded all over with spikes, and then carried about spitted upon a pole. I said, as I went away, to a Mullah of my acquaintance, that the dervise performed his tricks by means of a broad belt which he carried in his long wide drawers. The Mullah replied, that he had suspected some such art, but avoided mentioning his suspicions, lest he might draw upon himself the enmity of the order of [[Sheikh Bedreddin|Bed-reddin]]; for that one of his brethren had experienced great persecution from those dervises, in consequence of presuming to hint his doubts of the reality of their miracles."}}

'''Incest''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|n|s|ɛ|s|t|}} is [[human sexual activity]]&lt;!--NOTE: Using the term "sexual activity" is more accurate because the term "incest" does not only refer to sexual penetration, while the term "sexual intercourse" usually does imply sexual penetration.--&gt; between family members or close [[kinship|relatives]].&lt;ref name="Incest1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Incest|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2013|accessdate=August 27, 2013|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/incest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Incest2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Incest|publisher=[[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] (RAINN)|year=2009|accessdate=August 27, 2013|url=http://www.rainn.org/get-information/types-of-sexual-assault/incest}}&lt;/ref&gt; This typically includes sexual activity between people in [[consanguinity]] (blood relations), and sometimes those related by [[Affinity (law)|affinity]] ([[marriage]] or [[stepfamily]]), [[adoption]], [[clan]], or [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]].

Ludman - 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Children of incestuous relationships have been regarded as [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]], and are still so regarded in some societies today. In most cases, the parents did not have the option to marry to remove that status, as incestuous marriages were, and are, normally also prohibited.

A common justification for prohibiting incest is avoiding [[inbreeding]]: a collection of [[inbreeding#Genetic disorders|genetic disorders]] suffered by the children of parents with a close [[Coefficient of relationship|genetic relationship]].&lt;ref name=WolfDurham2005 /&gt; Such children are at greater risk for congenital disorders, death, and developmental and physical disability, and that risk is proportional to their parents' [[coefficient of relationship]]—a measure of how closely the parents are related genetically.&lt;ref name=WolfDurham2005&gt;{{cite book |title=Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century |first=Arthur P. |last=Wolf |first2=William H. |last2=Durham |year=2004 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OW1nuQxcIQgC&amp;pg=PA3 |isbn=0-8047-5141-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Afzal&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fareed |first1=M |last2=Afzal |first2=M |year=2014 |title=Estimating the inbreeding depression on cognitive behavior: A population based study of child cohort |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=9 |issue=10 |page=e109585 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0109585 |pmid=25313490 |pmc=4196914}}&lt;/ref&gt; But cultural anthropologists have noted that inbreeding avoidance cannot form the sole basis for the incest taboo because the boundaries of the incest prohibition vary widely between cultures, and not necessarily in ways that maximize the avoidance of inbreeding.&lt;ref name=WolfDurham2005 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, D.

In some societies, such as those of [[Ancient Egypt]], brother–sister, father–daughter, mother–son, cousin–cousin, aunt–nephew, uncle–niece, and other combinations of relations within a [[royal family]] were married as a means of perpetuating the royal lineage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Godelier]], Métamorphoses de la parenté, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592 |title=New Left Review - Jack Goody: The Labyrinth of Kinship |accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some societies, such as the [[Balinese people|Balinese]]&lt;ref name= Bateson&gt;{{cite book |title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology |last=Bateson |first=Gregory |author-link=Gregory Bateson |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |pages= |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-226-03905-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Inuit]] tribes,&lt;ref name=JBriggs&gt;{{cite book |title=Never in Anger: Portrait of an Eskimo Family |last=Briggs |first=Jean |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages= |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-674-60828-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; have different views about what constitutes illegal and immoral incest.

[[File:Table of Consanguinity showing degrees of relationship.svg|upright=1.3|right|thumb|The number next to each box indicates the degree of relationship relative to the given person.]]
The English word ''[[wikt:incest|incest]]'' is derived from the Latin ''incestus'', which has a general meaning of "impure, unchaste".
It was introduced into [[Middle English]], both in the generic Latin sense (preserved throughout the Middle English period&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] [[Ancrene Riwle]] (c. 1225) has ''Incest‥is bituȝe sibbe fleschliche'', where either the generic or the narrow sense may be intended. See also [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=incest&amp;searchmode=none inetymonline.comest]&lt;/ref&gt;) and in the narrow modern sense.
The derived adjective ''incestuous'' appears in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Etymology'', T. F. Hoad (ed.) (1996), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;
Before the Latin term came in, incest was known in [[Old English]] as ''sib-leger'' (from ''sibb'' 'kinship' + ''leger'' 'to lie') or ''mǣġhǣmed'' (from ''mǣġ'' 'kin, parent' + ''hǣmed'' 'sexual intercourse') but in time, both words fell out of use.

===Antiquity===
In [[ancient China]], first cousins with the same surnames (i.e., those born to the father's brothers) were not permitted to marry, while those with different surnames (i.e., maternal cousins and paternal cousins born to the father's sisters) were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gulik |first=Robert Hans van |title=Sexual Life in Ancient China: a Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from ca. 1500 B.C. till 1644 A.D. |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year=1974 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9MUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA19 |isbn=90-04-03917-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]]s married their siblings and had several children with them. For example, [[Tutankhamun]] married his half-sister [[Ankhesenamun]], and was himself the child of an incestuous union between [[Akhenaten]] and an unidentified sister-wife. It is now generally accepted that sibling marriages were widespread among all classes in Egypt during the Graeco-Roman period. Numerous [[papyrus|papyri]] and the Roman census declarations attest to many husbands and wives being brother and sister, of the same father and mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=N. |title=Life in Egypt under Roman Rule |isbn=0-19-814848-8 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frier |first=Bruce W. |last2=Bagnall |first2=Roger S. |author2-link=Roger S.

The fable of ''[[Oedipus]]'', with a theme of inadvertent incest between a mother and son, ends in disaster and shows ancient taboos against incest as Oedipus is punished for incestuous actions by blinding himself. In the "sequel" to Oedipus, ''[[Antigone]]'', his four children are also punished for their parents' incestuousness. Incest appears in the commonly accepted version of the birth of [[Adonis]], when his mother, [[Myrrha]] has sex with her father [[Cinyras]] during a festival, disguised as a prostitute.

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Sparta|Spartan King]] [[Leonidas I]], hero of the legendary [[Battle of Thermopylae]], was married to his [[niece]] [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Gorgo]], daughter of his half-brother [[Cleomenes I]]. Greek law allowed marriage between a brother and sister if they had different mothers. For example, some accounts say that [[Elpinice]] was for a time married to her half-brother [[Cimon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/Elpinice.html |title=Elpinice |last=Lahanas |first=Michael |year=2006 |work=Hellenic World encyclopaedia |publisher=Hellenica |accessdate=2009-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921025414/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/Elpinice.html |archivedate=2009-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incest is mentioned and condemned in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' Book VI:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_vergil_aeneid_latin_6.htm Vergil Aeneid Book VI in Latin: The descent to the Underworld].

Roman civil laws prohibited any marriage between parents and children, either in the ascending or descending line [[:wikt:ad infinitum|''ad infinitum'']].&lt;ref name="SRCL514"/&gt; Adoption was considered the same as affinity in that an adoptive father could not marry an [[:wikt:unemancipated|unemancipated]] daughter or granddaughter even if the adoption had been dissolved.&lt;ref name="SRCL514"/&gt; Incestuous unions were discouraged and considered ''[[nefas]]'' (against the laws of gods and man) in [[ancient Rome]]. In AD 295 incest was explicitly forbidden by an imperial edict, which divided the concept of ''incestus'' into two categories of unequal gravity: the ''incestus iuris gentium,'' which was applied to both Romans and non-Romans in the Empire, and the ''incestus iuris civilis,'' which concerned only Roman citizens. Therefore, for example, an Egyptian could marry an aunt, but a Roman could not. Despite the act of incest being unacceptable within the Roman Empire, Roman Emperor [[Caligula]] is rumored to have had sexual relationships with all three of his sisters ([[Julia Livilla]], [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]], and [[Agrippina the Younger]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Potter2007|Potter]], 2007, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Claudius]], after executing his previous wife, married his brother's daughter Agrippina the Younger, and changed the law to allow an otherwise illegal union.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 2007, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibiting marrying a sister's daughter remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Judith Evans |last=Grubbs |title=Women and the Law in the Roman Empire: a Sourcebook on Marriage, Divorce and Widowhood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X8HXDwMHawC&amp;pg=PA137 |accessdate=7 November 2011 |year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-15240-2 |pages=137–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taboo against incest in Ancient Rome is demonstrated by the fact that politicians would use charges of incest (often false charges) as insults and means of political disenfranchisement.

In [[Norse mythology]], there are themes of brother-sister marriage, a prominent example being between [[Njörðr]] and his [[Sister-wife of Njörðr|unnamed sister]] (perhaps [[Nerthus]]), parents of [[Freyja]] and [[Freyr]]. [[Loki]] in turn also accuses Freyja and Freyr of having a sexual relationship.

===From the Middle Ages onward===
[[File:Rey_Carlos_II.jpg|thumb|[[Charles II of Spain]] was born mentally and physically disabled due to centuries of inbreeding in the [[House of Habsburg]]]]
Many European monarchs were related due to political marriages, sometimes resulting in distant cousins (and even first cousins) being married. This was especially true in the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]], [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]], [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] royal houses. However, relations between siblings, which may have been tolerated in other cultures, were considered abhorrent. For example, the accusation that [[Anne Boleyn]] and her brother [[George Boleyn, 2nd Viscount Rochford|George Boleyn]] had committed incest was one of the reasons that both siblings were executed in May 1536.

Incestuous marriages were also seen in the royal houses of ancient [[Japan]] and Korea,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, George Patrick (1998).

A study of victims of father–daughter incest in the 1970s showed that there were "common features" within families before the occurrence of incest: estrangement between the mother and the daughter, extreme paternal dominance, and reassignment of some of the mother's traditional major family responsibility to the daughter. Oldest and only daughters were more likely to be the victims of incest. It was also stated that the incest experience was psychologically harmful to the woman in later life, frequently leading to feelings of low self-esteem, very unhealthy sexual activity, contempt for other women, and other emotional problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.2307/3961672| jstor=3961672|title = Emotional Inheritance: A Dubious Legacy|journal = Science News| volume=111| issue=21| pages=326|year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2009}}

In Japan, there is a popular misconception that mother-son incestuous contact is common, due to the manner in which it is depicted in the press and popular media.

While incest between adults and children generally involves the adult as the perpetrator of abuse, there are rare instances of sons sexually assaulting their mothers. These sons are typically mid adolescent to young adult, and, unlike parent-initiated incest, the incidents involve some kind of physical force. Although the mothers may be accused of being seductive with their sons and inviting the sexual contact, this is contrary to evidence.&lt;ref name="Courtois 2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Courtois |first=Christine  |title=Healing the Incest Wound: Adult Survivors in Therapy |year=2010 |publisher=W.

In some cases, mother-son incest is best classified as [[acquaintance rape]] of the mother by the adolescent son.&lt;ref name="Courtois 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt;

===Between childhood siblings===
Childhood [[Sibling incest|sibling–sibling incest]] is considered to be widespread but rarely reported.&lt;ref name=Turner /&gt; Sibling–sibling incest becomes [[child-on-child sexual abuse]] when it occurs without consent, without equality, or as a result of [[coercion]]. In this form, it is believed to be the most common form of intrafamilial abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kalogerakis |first=Michael G. |author2=American Psychiatric Association.

Sibling abusive incest is most prevalent in families where one or both parents are often absent or emotionally unavailable, with the abusive siblings using incest as a way to assert their power over a weaker sibling.&lt;ref name=leder&gt;{{cite news|last=Leder |first=Jane Mersky |title=Adult Sibling Rivalry: Sibling rivalry often lingers through adulthood |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/199301/adult-sibling-rivalry |work=Psychology Today |volume=January/February 93 |publisher=Sussex Publishers |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Absence of the father in particular has been found to be a significant element of most cases of sexual abuse of female children by a brother.&lt;ref name=rudd&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudd |first=Jane M. |last2=Herzberger |first2=Sharon D. |title=Brother-sister incest—father-daughter incest: a comparison of characteristics and consequences |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=23 |issue=9 |date=September 1999 |pages=915–928 |doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(99)00058-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damaging effects on both childhood development and adult symptoms resulting from brother–sister sexual abuse are similar to the effects of father–daughter, including substance abuse, depression, suicidality, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=rudd /&gt;&lt;ref name=cyr&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cyr |first=Mireille |last2=Wrighta |first2=S John |last3=McDuffa |first3=Pierre |last4=Perron |first4=Alain |title=Intrafamilial sexual abuse: brother–sister incest does not differ from father–daughter and stepfather–stepdaughter incest |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=26 |issue=9 |date=September 2002 |pages=957–973 |doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(02)00365-4 |pmid=12433139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between consenting adults===
Sexual activity between adult close relatives is sometimes ascribed to [[genetic sexual attraction]].&lt;ref name="guardian2002"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hari |first=Johann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4331603,00.html |title=Forbidden love |date=2002-01-09 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of incest has not been widely reported, but evidence has indicated that this behavior does take place, possibly more often than many people realize.&lt;ref name="guardian2002" /&gt; Internet [[chatroom]]s and topical websites exist that provide support for incestuous couples.&lt;ref name="guardian2002" /&gt;

Proponents of incest between consenting adults draw clear boundaries between the behavior of consenting adults and rape, child molestation, and abusive incest.&lt;ref name="guardian2002" /&gt; However, even consensual relationships such as these are still legally classified as incest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202053600/http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-02-02 |author=Roffee, James |year=2015 |title=When Yes Actually Means Yes |pages=72–91 |doi=10.1057/9781137476159.0009 |journal=Rape Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criminalized in almost all jurisdictions {{crossref| (see [[Laws regarding incest]] for exceptions)}}.

According to one incest participant who was quoted for an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'':

{{bq|1=You can't help who you fall in love with, it just happens. I fell in love with my sister and I'm not ashamed ... I only feel sorry for my mom and dad, I wish they could be happy for us. We love each other. It's nothing like some old man who tries to fuck his three-year-old, that's evil and disgusting ... Of course we're consenting, that's the most important thing. We're not fucking perverts. What we have is the most beautiful thing in the world.&lt;ref name="guardian2002"/&gt;}}

In ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', [[William Saletan]] drew a legal connection between gay sex and incest between consenting adults.&lt;ref name="slate2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2081904/ |title=Incest Repellent? If gay sex is private, why isn't incest? |last=Saletan |first=William |authorlink=William Saletan |date=2003-04-23 |publisher=''[[Slate Magazine]]'' |accessdate=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he described in his article, in 2003, U.S. Senator [[Rick Santorum]] commented on a pending U.S. Supreme Court case involving sodomy laws (primarily as a matter of [[Civil and political rights|constitutional rights]] to [[Right to privacy#United States|privacy]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection under the law]]):

{{bq|1="If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery."&lt;ref name="slate2003" /&gt;}}

Saletan argued that, legally and morally, there is essentially no difference between the two, and went on to support incest between consenting adults being covered by a legal right to privacy.&lt;ref name="slate2003" /&gt; [[UCLA School of Law|UCLA]] law professor [[Eugene Volokh]] has made similar arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volokh.com/2010/12/12/incest/ |title=Incest |last=Volokh |first=Eugene |date=December 12, 2010 |work=[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent article, Saletan said that incest is wrong because it introduces the possibility of irreparably damaging family units by introducing "a notoriously incendiary dynamic—sexual tension—into the mix".&lt;ref name="slt10"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2010/12/incest_is_cancer.2.html |title=Incest Is Cancer |last=Saletan |first=William |date=Dec 14, 2010 |work=Slate |accessdate=30 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430151843/http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2010/12/incest_is_cancer.2.html |archive-date=30 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aunts, uncles, nieces or nephews====
{{see also|Avunculate marriage}}
In the [[Netherlands]], marrying one's nephew or niece is legal, but only with the explicit permission of the Dutch Government, due to the possible risk of [[genetic defects]] among the offspring. Nephew-niece marriages predominantly occur among foreign immigrants. In November 2008, the Christian Democratic (CDA) party's Scientific Institute announced that it wanted a ban on marriages between nephews and nieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2008/11/gates-of-vienna-news-feed-11262008.html|title=Gates of Vienna News Feed 11/26/2008|first=Baron|last=Bodissey|date=26 November 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consensual sex between adults (persons of 18 years and older) is always lawful in the Netherlands and Belgium, even among closely related family members. Sexual acts between an adult family member and a minor are illegal, though they are not classified as incest, but as abuse of the authority such an adult has over a minor, comparable to that of a teacher, coach or priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfri.be/incest-strafbaar |title=is incest strafbaar ? &amp;#124; Goede raad is goud waard - Advocatenkantoor Elfri De Neve |publisher=Elfri.be |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2013-07-30|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florida, consensual adult sexual intercourse with someone known to be your aunt, uncle, niece or nephew constitutes a felony of the third degree.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law - Page 200, John M. Scheb - 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other states also commonly prohibit marriages between such kin.&lt;ref&gt;Family Law in the USA - Page 207, Lynn Dennis Wardle, Laurence C.

In the United Kingdom, incest includes only sexual intercourse with a parent, grandparent, child or sibling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incest by a man.|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/4-5/69/part/I/crossheading/incest|work=Sexual Offences Act 1956|publisher=National Archives UK|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the more recently introduced offence of "sex with an adult relative" extends also as far as half-siblings, uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/64|work=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives of United Kingdom|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term 'incest' however remains widely used in popular culture to describe any form of sexual activity with a relative.

====Between adult siblings====
{{main|Sibling incest}}
The most public case of consensual adult sibling incest in recent years is the case of a brother-sister couple from Germany, [[Patrick Stübing]] and Susan Karolewski. Because of violent behavior on the part of his father, Patrick was taken in at the age of 3 by foster parents, who adopted him later. At the age of 23 he learned about his biological parents, contacted his mother, and met her and his then 16-year-old sister Susan for the first time. The now-adult Patrick moved in with his birth family shortly thereafter. After their mother died suddenly six months later, the siblings became intimately close, and had their first child together in 2001. By 2004, they had four children together: Eric, Sarah, Nancy, and Sofia. The public nature of their relationship, and the repeated [[prosecution]]s and even jail time they have served as a result, has caused some in Germany to question whether incest between consenting adults should be punished at all. An article about them in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' states that the couple are happy together. According to court records, the first three children have mental and physical disabilities, and have been placed in foster care.&lt;ref name="spiegel" /&gt; In April 2012, at the [[European Court of Human Rights]], Patrick Stübing lost his case that the conviction violated his right to a private and family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/13/world/europe/germany-incest-court/index.html?hpt=hp_bn2|title=German incest couple lose European court case - CNN|first=By the CNN Wire|last=Staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECtHR judgment"&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=905957&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Judgment] on the ''Stübing vs. Germany'' case.

Some societies differentiate between full sibling and half sibling relations. In ancient societies, full sibling and half sibling marriages occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Bagnall, Bruce W. Frier, ''The Demography of Roman Egypt'', 2006, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Porter]], [[Mikuláš Teich]], ''Sexual Knowledge, Sexual Science: The History of Attitudes to Sexuality'', 1994, p.239&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some cultures in Asia which stigmatize cousin marriage, in some instances even marriages between second cousins or more remotely related people. This is notably true in the culture of [[Korea]]. In South Korea, before 1997, anyone with the same last name and clan were prohibited from marriage. In light of this law being held unconstitutional, South Korea now only prohibits up to third cousins (see [[Article 809 of the Korean Civil Code]]). [[Hmong people|Hmong]] culture prohibits the marriage of anyone with the same last name – to do so would result in being shunned by the entire community, and they are usually stripped of their last name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kgaGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=Hmong+culture+prohibits+the+marriage+of+anyone+with+the+same+last+name&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e8m1_KU0qe&amp;sig=vXdn3cHbipJu-ldp-4b7PmtLh0k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLrOnUo-TdAhXm6oMKHcdSAEsQ6AEwB3oECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hmong%20culture%20prohibits%20the%20marriage%20of%20anyone%20with%20the%20same%20last%20name&amp;f=false|title=Hmong Refugees in the New World: Culture, Community and Opportunity|last=Vang|first=Christopher Thao|date=2016-05-16|publisher=McFarland|year=|isbn=9781476622620|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Hindu]] communities in India prohibit cousin marriages.

In a review of 48 studies on the children parented by cousins, the rate of birth defects was twice that of non-related couples: 4% for cousin couples as opposed to 2% for the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Towie |first=Narelle |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/kissing-cousins-ok/story-fna7dq6e-1111116504749 |title=Most babies born to first-cousins are healthy |publisher=Perth Now |date=2008-05-31 |accessdate=2012-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202060753/http://www.perthnow.com.au/kissing-cousins-ok/story-fna7dq6e-1111116504749 |archive-date=2012-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Defined through marriage====
Some cultures include relatives by marriage in incest prohibitions; these relationships are called [[Affinity (law)|affinity]] rather than [[consanguinity]]. For example, the question of the legality and morality of a widower who wished to marry his [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907|deceased wife's sister]] was the subject of long and fierce debate in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 19th century, involving, among others, [[Matthew Boulton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollak |first=Ellen |title=Incest and the English Novel, 1684–1814 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore MD |year=2003 |page=38 |isbn=0-8018-7204-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tann |first=Jennifer |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |date=May 2007 |chapter=Boulton, Matthew (1728–1809)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles La Trobe]]. The marriages were entered into in Scotland and Switzerland respectively, where they were legal. In medieval Europe, standing as a [[godparent]] to a child also created a bond of affinity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} But in other societies, a deceased spouse's sibling was considered the ideal person to marry. The Hebrew Bible forbids a man from marrying his brother's widow with the exception that, if his brother died childless, the man is instead required to marry his brother's widow so as to "raise up seed to him" (per {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|25:5–6|HE}}).  Some societies have long practiced [[sororal polygyny]], a form of [[polygamy]] in which a man marries multiple wives who are sisters to each other (though not closely related to him).

In Islamic law, marriage among close blood relations like parents, stepparent, parents in-law, siblings, stepsiblings, the children of siblings, aunts and uncles is prohibited, while first or second cousins may marry. Marrying the widow of a brother, or the sister of deceased or divorced wife is also allowed.

==Inbreeding==
{{Main|Inbreeding}}
Offspring of biologically related parents are subject to the possible impact of inbreeding. Such offspring have a higher possibility of [[Congenital disorder|congenital birth defects]] (see [[Coefficient of relationship]]) because it increases the proportion of zygotes that are [[homozygous]] for deleterious [[recessive allele]]s that produce such disorders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Livingstone |first=F. B. |year=1969 |title=Genetics, Ecology, and the Origins of Incest and Exogamy |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=10 |pages=45–62 |doi=10.1086/201009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Inbreeding depression]]). Because most such [[allele]]s are rare in populations, it is unlikely that two unrelated marriage partners will both be heterozygous carriers. However, because close relatives [[Coefficient of relationship|share a large fraction of their alleles]], the probability that any such rare deleterious allele present in the common ancestor will be inherited from both related parents is increased dramatically with respect to non-inbred couples. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes. This has two contrary effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thornhill |first=Nancy Wilmsen |title=The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |year=1993 |isbn=0-226-79854-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZFXYeHxwD10C&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the short term, because incestuous reproduction increases [[zygosity]], deleterious recessive alleles will express themselves more frequently, leading to increases in spontaneous abortions of zygotes, perinatal deaths, and postnatal offspring with birth defects.
* In the long run, however, because of this increased exposure of deleterious recessive alleles to [[natural selection]], their frequency decreases more rapidly in inbred population, leading to a "healthier" population (with fewer deleterious recessive alleles).
The closer two persons are related, the higher the zygosity, and thus the more severe the biological costs of inbreeding. This fact likely explains why inbreeding between close relatives, such as siblings, is less common than inbreeding between cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Antfolk |first1=Jan |last2=Lieberman |first2=Debra |last3=Santtila |first3=Pekka |title=Fitness Costs Predict Inbreeding Aversion Irrespective of Self-Involvement: Support for Hypotheses Derived from Evolutionary Theory |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=11 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613 |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613 |pages=e50613 |pmid=23209792 |pmc=3509093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may also be other deleterious effects besides those caused by recessive diseases.

==Laws==
{{Main|Laws regarding incest}}

Laws regarding sexual activity between close relatives vary considerably between jurisdictions, and depend on the type of sexual activity and the nature of the family relationship of the parties involved, as well as the age and sex of the parties. Prohibition of incest laws may extend to restrictions on marriage rights, which also vary between jurisdictions. Most jurisdictions prohibit parent-child and sibling marriages, while others also prohibit first-cousin and uncle-niece and aunt-nephew marriages. In most places, incest is illegal, regardless of the ages of the two partners. In other countries, incestuous relationships between consenting adults (with the age varying by location) are permitted, including in the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Spain]]. [[Sweden]] is the only country that allows marriage between half-siblings and they must seek government counseling before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6424337.stm Incest: an age-old taboo]. BBC. 12 March 2007. retrieved 22 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While the legality of consensual incest varies by country, sexual assault committed against a relative is usually seen as a very serious crime. In some legal systems, the fact of a perpetrator being a close relative to the victim constitutes an [[aggravating circumstance]] in the case of sexual crimes such as [[rape]] and [[child sexual abuse|sexual conduct with a minor]] – this is the case in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;See Articles 218-221 of the [[Penal Code of Romania#The Penal Code of 2014|Romanian Penal Code]] [http://www.avocatura.com/ll491-noul-cod-penal.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==

===Jewish===

According to the Torah, per [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0318.htm Leviticus 18], "the children of Israel"—Israelite men and women alike—are forbidden from sexual relations between people who are "near of kin" (cf. verse 6), who are defined as:

# Parents and children (cf. verse 7)
# Siblings and half siblings (cf. verses 9 and 11). Relationships between these are particularly singled out for a curse in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0527.htm Deuteronomy 27], and they are of the only two kinds incestuous relationships that are among the particularly-singled-out relationships—with the other particularly-singled-out relationships being ones of non-incestuous family betrayal (cf. verse 20) and bestiality (cf. verse 21)
# Grandparents and grandchildren (cf. verse 10)
# Aunts and nephews, uncles and nieces, etc. (cf. verses 12–14).&lt;ref&gt;Also see  the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]]' [https://ccarnet.org/responsa/142-marriage-mothers-sister-or-half-sister-aunt-or/ Responsum 142].&lt;/ref&gt; Relationships between these are the second kind of relationships that are particularly singled out for a curse in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0527.htm Deuteronomy 27], and the explicit examples of children-in-law and mothers-in-law (cf. verse 23) serves to remind the Israelites that [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0436.htm the parents-in-law are also (or at least should be also) the children-in-laws' aunts and uncles]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying: 'The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right. This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded concerning the daughters of [[Zelophehad]], saying: Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave each one to its own inheritance.' Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Incestuous relationships are considered so severe among [[Chillul Hashem|''chillulim HaShem'']], acts which bring shame to the name of God, as to be, along with the other forbidden relationships that are mentioned in Leviticus 18, punishable by death as specified in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0320.htm Leviticus 20].

In the 4th century BCE, the [[Soferim]] (''scribes'') declared that there were relationships within which marriage constituted incest, in addition to those mentioned by the Torah. These additional relationships were termed ''seconds'' (Hebrew: ''sheniyyot''), and included the wives of a man's grandfather and grandson.&lt;ref name="TosYeb23"&gt;''Yebamot' ([[Tosefta]]) 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; The classical rabbis prohibited marriage between a man and any of these ''seconds'' of his, on the basis that doing so would act as a ''safeguard'' against infringing the biblical incest rules,&lt;ref name="Yeb21a"&gt;Yebamot 21a&lt;/ref&gt; although there was inconclusive debate about exactly what the limits should be for the definition of ''seconds''.&lt;ref name="JewEncInce"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=incest|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=126&amp;letter=I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriages that are forbidden in the Torah (with the exception of uncle-niece marriages) were regarded by the rabbis of the Middle Ages as invalid – as if they had never occurred;&lt;ref name="EbenezerSA"&gt;''[[Shulchan Aruch|Shulchan 'Aruk]]'', ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 16, 1&lt;/ref&gt; any children born to such a couple were regarded as [[mamzer|bastards under Jewish law]],&lt;ref name="EbenezerSA" /&gt; and the relatives of the spouse were not regarded as forbidden relations for a further marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Yebamot 94b&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, those relationships which were prohibited due to qualifying as ''seconds'', and so forth, were regarded as wicked, but still valid;&lt;ref name="EbenezerSA" /&gt; while they might have pressured such a couple to divorce, any children of the union were still seen as legitimate.&lt;ref name="EbenezerSA" /&gt;

===Christian===
The [[Catholic Church]] does not generally permit the marriage if a doubt exists on whether the potential spouses are related by blood relations in any degree of the direct line or in the second degree of the collateral line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P3Y.HTM Code of Canon Law]. Can. 1091&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions of incest varied throughout history.  The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] held in 1215 attempted to codify that marriage was forbidden up to and including third cousins, though permissible beyond this for fourth cousins, third cousins once removed, etc.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], marriages are banned between second cousins or closer and between second uncles / aunts and second nieces / nephews (between first cousins once removed) or closer. Marrying one's godparent or deceased spouse's sibling is also prohibited, although marrying one's stepchild is not – e.g. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] exercised his right to marry his stepdaughter after her mother's (his first wife's) death.

The [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Anglican Communion]] allows marriages up to and including first cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/|year=1962|place=Canada|title=Book of Common Prayer|chapter=A Table of Kindred and Affinity|chapterurl=http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/kindred-and-affinity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s book ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', a 5th Century AD book of Christian philosophy, he claimed that the children of Adam and Eve must have married each other in order to produce offspring.

===Islamic===

===Hindu===
[[Rigveda]] regard incest to be "evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Flaherty |first=Wendy Doniger |title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology |page=7 |publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinduism]] speaks of incest in abhorrent terms. Hindus believe there are both [[karmic]] and practical bad effects of incest and thus practice strict rules of both [[endogamy]] and [[exogamy]], in relation to the family tree (''[[gotra]]'') or bloodline (''[[Pravaras|Pravara]]'').
Marriage within the ''gotra'' (''swagotra'' marriages) are banned under the rule of exogamy in the traditional matrimonial system.&lt;ref&gt;"There can be no matrimony between the sects of Gehlawat and Kadiyan as they have a 'brotherhood' akin to consanguinity."[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/haryana-panchayat-takes-on-govt-over-samegotra-marriage/491548/ "Haryana panchayat takes on govt over same-gotra marriage"]. ''Indian Express''. July 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; People within the ''gotra'' are regarded as kin and marrying such a person would be thought of as incest. Marriage with paternal cousins (a form of [[Parallel and cross cousins|parallel-cousin]] relationship) is strictly prohibited. 

Although generally marriages between persons having the same ''gotra'' are prohibited,&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z'', James G. Lochtefeld, Rosen Publishing Group, 2002; p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt; how this is defined may vary regionally.
Depending on culture and [[Indian caste system|caste]] of the population in the region, marriage may be restricted up to seven generations of ''gotra'' of father, mother, and grandmother.  In a few rural areas, marriage is banned within same local community is only allowed with those from outside of the community, as they consider a small village to be like brothers and sisters of one large family. These rules are strictly enforced and a couple breaking them is violently punished sometimes. &lt;ref&gt;"In India these rules are reproduced in the form of that one must not marry within the Gotra, but not without the caste" [http://www.sanathanadharma.com/samskaras/marriage/mar3.htm#Limitations "Limitations of Marriage"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103062452/http://www.sanathanadharma.com/samskaras/marriage/mar3.htm |date=2010-11-03 }}. sanathanadharma.com&lt;/ref&gt; The seven-generation prohibition in some areas is only applied to paternal descent, with ''gotra'' is transferred down the male lineage; in these areas, the ''gotra'' of a female changes upon marriage (i.e., upon marriage a woman would belong to her husband's lineage).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', one of the two great [[Hindu Epics]], [[Arjuna]] took as his fourth wife his first and [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross cousin]] [[Subhadra]], the sister of [[Krishna]]. Arjuna had gone into exile alone after having disturbed [[Yudhishthira]] and [[Draupadi]] in their private quarters. It was during the last part of his exile, while staying at the Dvaraka residence of his cousins, that he fell in love with Subhadra. While eating at the home of [[Balarama]], Arjuna was struck with Subhadra's beauty and decided he would obtain her as his wife. Subhadra and Arjuna's son was the tragic hero [[Abhimanyu]]. According to Andhra Pradesh oral tradition, Abhimanyu himself married his first cross cousin Shashirekha, the daughter of Subhadra's brother [[Balarama]]. Cross-cousin marriages are evident from Arjuna's marriage with Subhadra, [[Pradyumna]]'s (Eldest son of Krishna) marriage with Rukmi's (brother of [[Rukmini]]) daughter. Also, Krishna married his cross cousin [[Mitravinda]] (daughter of [[Vasudeva]]'s sister Rajadhi who was queen of Avanti) and Bhadra (daughter of Vasudeva's sister Shrutakirti who was the queen of Kekaya Kingdom.)

The following is a list of '''semiotics terms'''; that is, those words used in discussion, classification, criticism, and analysis of the study of sign processes ([[semiosis]]), analogy, metaphor, signification and communication, [[sign (semiotics)|signs]] and [[symbols]]. Note: in order to help the reader this page also includes terms which are not part of semiotic theory per se but which are commonly found alongside their semiotic brethren - these terms come from linguistics, literary theory and narratology.

{{Ecological economics|People}}
The '''International Society for Ecological Economics''' ('''ISEE''') was founded in 1989, based heavily on the work of [[Herman Daly]] to promote [[Ecological Economics|ecological economics]] and assist ecological economists and related societies.  The society publishes a monthly journal ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'', books and other materials, and holds periodic meetings and conferences to facilitate a voice for ecological economists.

The ISEE was initially presided over by [[Robert Costanza]] who was also the first editor of the journal. Subsequent presidents have been [[Richard B. Norgaard]], John Proops, Charles Perrings, [[Joan Martinez Alier]], Peter May, John Gowdy, [[Bina Agarwal]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isecoeco.org/about/ About The ISEE], accessed February 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and Marina Fischer-Kowalski, an Austrian sociologist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isecoeco.org/about/presidents-letter/ President's Letter], accessed February 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/socec/downloads/CVMFK_cv_update20140402.pdf CV] of Marina Fischer-Kowalski, accessed February 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The current president is Sabine O'Hara, Dean of the College of Agriculture, Urban Sustainability &amp; Environmental Sciences at the University of the District of Columbia.[http://www.udc.edu/faculty/faculty_researchers_dr_sabine_ohara]  [http://cloviscavalcanti.blogspot.co.uk/p/biografia.html Clóvis Cavalcanti] is the President Elect of the ISEE, his term as president commencing in January 2018.  The journal is currently edited by Richard B. Howarth.&lt;ref name=Newsletter&gt;ISEE Newsletter Spring 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Right Livelihood Award]] was awarded to [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] "for defining a path of ecological economics that integrates the key elements of ethics, quality of life, environment and community." He was honored as one of the key figures in the foundation of ISEE, that was considered to be "the major forum that links economists and ecologists, and academics and environmental activists."&lt;ref&gt;Right Livelihood Award: ''[http://www.rightlivelihood.org/daly.html 1996 – Herman Daly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708053433/http://www.rightlivelihood.org/daly.html |date=8 July 2009 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;   Dr. Daly was also awarded the [http://steadystate.org/news-on-blue-planet-prize/ 2014 Japanese Blue Planet Award].

The ISEE is divided into regional societies.  There are currently ten regional societies:
* Africa (ASEE)
* Argentina and Uruguay (ASAUEE)
* Australia and New Zealand (ANZSEE)
* Brazil (Eco-Eco),
* Canada (CANSEE)
* European Union (ESEE)
* Mesoamerica ([[Mesoamerican Society for Ecological Economics|SMEE]])
* India (INSEE)
* Russia ([[RSEE]])
* United States ([[United States Society for Ecological Economics|USSEE]])

There is also a [[Chinese Ecological Economics Society]] which is not affiliated to the ISEE and an Iberoamerican Network, REDIBEC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redibec.org/ REDIBEC]&lt;/ref&gt;

ISEE holds biennial conferences in different locations:
* 11th Biennial ISEE Conference, entitled "Advancing Sustainability in a Time of Crises", 22–25 August 2010, in Oldenburg and Bremen, Germany.&lt;ref name=Newsletter /&gt;

'''John Ruskin''' (8 February 1819&amp;nbsp;– 20 January 1900) was the leading English [[art critic]] of the [[Victorian era]], as well as an art patron, [[Drawing|draughtsman]], [[watercolor|watercolourist]], a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects as varied as [[geology]], [[architecture]], myth, [[ornithology]], [[literature]], [[education]], [[botany]] and [[political economy]].

His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. He penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, and architectural structures and ornamentation.

The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art gave way in time to plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society.

He was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century and up to the [[First World War]]. After a period of relative decline, his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work. Today, his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in environmentalism, sustainability and craft.

Ruskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), an extended essay in defence of the work of [[J.M.W. Turner]] in which he argued that the principal role of the artist is "truth to nature". From the 1850s, he championed the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] who were influenced by his ideas. His work increasingly focused on social and political issues. ''[[Unto This Last]]'' (1860, 1862) marked the shift in emphasis. In 1869, Ruskin became the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at the [[Oxford University|University of Oxford]], where he established the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art|Ruskin School of Drawing]]. In 1871, he began his monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain", published under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–1884). In the course of this complex and deeply personal work, he developed the principles underlying his ideal society. As a result, he founded the [[Guild of St George]], an organisation that endures today.

==Early life (1819–1846)==

===Genealogy===
Ruskin was the only child of first cousins.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Robert |last=Hewison| id=24291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, John James Ruskin, (1785–1864), was a sherry and wine importer,&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; founding partner and ''de facto'' business manager of Ruskin, Telford and Domecq (see [[Allied Domecq]]). John James was born and brought up in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, to a mother from [[Glenluce]] and a father originally from [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gill Viljoen, ''Ruskin's Scottish Heritage: A Prelude'' (University of Illinois Press, 1956) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Margaret Cox, née Cock (1781–1871), was the daughter of an aunt on the English side of the family and a publican in [[Croydon]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; She had joined the Ruskin household when she became companion to John James's mother, Catherine.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;

John James had hoped to practice law, and was articled as a clerk in London.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; His father, John Thomas Ruskin, described as a grocer (but apparently an ambitious wholesale merchant), was an incompetent businessman. To save the family from bankruptcy, John James, whose prudence and success were in stark contrast to his father, took on all debts, settling the last of them in 1832.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; John James and Margaret were engaged in 1809, but opposition to the union from John Thomas, and the issuance of the debt, delayed their wedding which was finally conducted without celebration in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gill Viljoen, ''Ruskin's Scottish Heritage'' (University of Illinois Press, 1956) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; John James died on 3 March 1864 and is buried in the churchyard of St John the Evangelist, Shirley, Croydon.

[[File:JJ Rusking grave inscription.jpg|thumb|Inscription on John James Ruskin's memorial]]

===Childhood and education===
[[File:John Ruskin by James Northcote.jpg|thumb|Ruskin as a young child, painted by [[James Northcote (painter)|James Northcote]].]]
Ruskin was born at 54 Hunter Street, [[Brunswick Square]], London (demolished 1969), south of [[St Pancras railway station]].&lt;ref name="Childhood"&gt;''ODNB''  (2004) "Childhood and education"&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood was characterised by the contrasting influences of his father and mother, both fiercely ambitious for him. John James Ruskin helped to develop his son's [[Romanticism]]. They shared a passion for the works of [[Byron]], [[Shakespeare]] and especially [[Walter Scott]]. They visited Scott's home, [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]], in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031012/ai_n12585843/] {{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Ruskin, an [[Low church|Evangelical]]{{clarify|date=April 2018}} Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the [[King James Bible]] from beginning to end, and then to start all over again, committing large portions to memory. Its language, imagery and stories had a profound and lasting effect on his writing.

Ruskin's childhood was spent from 1823 at 28 [[Herne Hill]] (demolished c. 1912), near the village of [[Camberwell]] in [[South London]].&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Dearden, John Ruskin's Camberwell (Brentham Press for Guild of St George, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the friendless and toyless experience he later claimed in his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89).&lt;ref name="Childhood"/&gt; He was educated at home by his parents and private tutors, and from 1834 to 1835 attended the school in [[Peckham]] run by the progressive Evangelical, Thomas Dale (1797–1870).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/articles/individuals/dale_thomas.htm |title=UCL Bloomsbury Project |website=Ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin heard Dale lecture in 1836 at [[King's College London|King's College, London]], where Dale was the first Professor of English Literature.&lt;ref name="Childhood"/&gt; Ruskin went on to enroll and complete his studies at [[King's College London|King's College]], where he prepared for [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] under Dale's tutelage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/famouspeople/johnkeats.aspx |title=King's College London - John Keats |website=Kcl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pookpress.co.uk/project/john-ruskin-biography/ |title=John Ruskin Biography &gt;&gt; Classic Stories |website=Pookpress.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
[[File:Rose Terrace, Perth.JPG|thumb|upright|10 Rose Terrace, Perth (on the right), where Ruskin spent boyhood holidays with Scottish relatives]]
Ruskin was greatly influenced by the extensive and privileged travels he enjoyed in his childhood. Travel helped establish his taste and augmented his education. His father visited business clients in Britain's country houses, exposing him to English landscapes, architecture and paintings. Tours took them to the [[Lake District]] (his first long poem, ''Iteriad'', was an account of his 1830 tour)&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''Iteriad, or Three Weeks Among the Lakes'', ed. James S. Dearden (Frank Graham, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to relations in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland. As early as 1825, the family visited France and Belgium. Their continental tours became increasingly ambitious in scope, so that in 1833 they visited [[Strasbourg]], [[Schaffhausen]], Milan, [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]], places to which Ruskin frequently returned. He developed his lifelong love of the [[Alps]], and in 1835 he first visited [[Venice]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hewison]], ''Ruskin and Venice: The Paradise of Cities'' (Yale University Press, 2009) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that 'Paradise of cities' that formed both the symbolism and subject of much of his later work.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.453n2}}

The tours provided Ruskin with the opportunity to observe and to record his impressions of nature. He composed elegant if largely conventional poetry, some of which was published in ''Friendship's Offering''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=Introduction}} His early notebooks and sketchbooks are full of visually sophisticated and technically accomplished drawings of maps, landscapes and buildings, remarkable for a boy of his age. He was profoundly affected by a copy of [[Samuel Rogers]]'s poem, ''Italy'' (1830), which was given to him as a 13th birthday present. In particular, he admired deeply the accompanying illustrations by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and much of his art in the 1830s was in imitation of Turner, and [[Samuel Prout]] whose ''Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany'' (1833) he also admired. His artistic skills were refined under the tutelage of Charles Runciman, [[Copley Fielding]] and [[James Duffield Harding]].

===First publications of Ruskin===
Ruskin's journeys also provided inspiration for writing. His first publication was the poem "On Skiddaw and Derwent Water" (originally entitled "Lines written at the Lakes in Cumberland: Derwentwater" and published in the ''Spiritual Times'') (August 1829).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=2.265-8}} In 1834, three short articles for [[John Claudius Loudon|Loudon]]'s ''Magazine of Natural History'' were published. They show early signs of his skill as a close "scientific" observer of nature, especially its geology.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.191-6}}

From September 1837 to December 1838, Ruskin's ''The Poetry of Architecture'' was serialised in Loudon's ''Architectural Magazine'', under the pen name "Kata Physin" (Greek for "According to Nature").{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.4-188}} It was a study of cottages, villas, and other dwellings which centred on a Wordsworthian argument that buildings should be sympathetic to their immediate environment and use local materials, and anticipated key themes in his later writings. In 1839, Ruskin's 'Remarks on the Present State of Meteorological Science' was published in ''Transactions of the Meteorological Society''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.206-10}}

===Oxford===
In [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]] 1836, Ruskin [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of Oxford]], taking up residence at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] in January of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&amp;name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017013829/http://artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&amp;name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |archivedate=17 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enrolled as a [[gentleman-commoner]], he enjoyed equal status with his aristocratic peers.  Ruskin was generally uninspired by Oxford and suffered bouts of illness. Perhaps the keenest advantage of his time in residence was found in the few, close friendships he made. His tutor, the Rev Walter Lucas Brown, was always encouraging, as was a young senior tutor, [[Henry Liddell]] (later the father of [[Alice Liddell]]) and a private tutor, the Rev [[Osborne Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Gamble, ''John Ruskin, Henry James and the Shropshire Lads'' (New European Publications, 2008) chapters 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He became close to the geologist and natural theologian, [[William Buckland]]. Among Ruskin's fellow undergraduates, the most important friends were [[Charles Thomas Newton]] and [[Henry Acland]].

His biggest success came in 1839 when at the third attempt he won the prestigious [[Newdigate Prize]] for poetry ([[Arthur Hugh Clough]] came second).&lt;ref&gt;For his winning poem, "Salsette and Elephanata", Cook and Wedderburn 2.90–100.&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[William Wordsworth]], who was receiving an honorary degree, at the ceremony. But Ruskin never achieved independence at Oxford. His mother lodged on High Street and his father joined them at weekends. His health was poor and he was devastated to hear his first love, Adèle Domecq, second daughter of his father's business partner, was engaged to a French nobleman. In the midst of exam revision, in April 1840, he coughed blood, raising fears of consumption, and leading to a long break from Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he returned, he answered a challenge set down by [[Effie Gray]], whom he later married. The twelve-year-old Effie had asked him to write a fairy story. During a six-week break at [[Leamington Spa]] to undergo Dr. Jephson's (1798–1878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fairy tale, ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' (published in December 1850 (but imprinted 1851) with illustrations by [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.VI.305-54}} A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and knew so well. It remains the most translated of all his works.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Dearden, "The King of the Golden River: A Bio-Bibliographival Study" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik, ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 32–59.&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford, he sat for a pass degree in 1842, and was awarded with an uncommon honorary double fourth-class degree in recognition of his achievements.

===''Modern Painters I'' (1843)===
[[File:Portrait of John Ruskin (4671937).jpg|thumb|Engraving of John Ruskin by Henry Sigismund Uhlrich]]
Much of the period, from late 1840 to autumn 1842, Ruskin spent abroad with his parents, principally in Italy. His studies of Italian art were chiefly guided by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], to whom the Ruskins were introduced by [[Joseph Severn]], a friend of [[Keats]] (whose son, Arthur Severn, married Ruskin's cousin, Joan). He was galvanised into writing a defence of J. M. W. Turner when he read an attack on several of Turner's pictures exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]]. It recalled an attack by critic, Rev [[John Eagles]], in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1836, which had prompted Ruskin to write a long essay. John James had sent the piece to Turner who did not wish it to be published. It finally appeared in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dinah Birch]] (ed.) ''Ruskin on Turner'' (Cassell, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Ruskin began ''[[Modern Painters]]'', John James Ruskin had begun collecting watercolours, including works by [[Samuel Prout]] and, from 1839, Turner. Both painters were among occasional guests of the Ruskins at Herne Hill, and 163 [[Denmark Hill]] (demolished 1947) to which the family moved in 1842.

What became the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), published by [[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]] under the anonymous but authoritative title, "A Graduate of Oxford," was Ruskin's response to [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]]'s critics. An electronic edition is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/index.htm |title=the electronic edition of John Ruskin's "Modern Painters" Volume I |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=28 June 2002 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin controversially argued that modern landscape painters—and in particular Turner—were superior to the so-called "[[Old Masters]]" of the post-[[Renaissance]] period. Ruskin maintained that Old Masters such as [[Gaspard Dughet]] (Gaspar Poussin), [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]], and [[Salvator Rosa]], unlike Turner, favoured pictorial convention, and not "truth to nature". He explained that he meant "moral as well as material truth".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=3.104}} The job of the artist is to observe the reality of nature and not to invent it in a studio—to render what he has seen and understood imaginatively on canvas, free of any rules of composition. For Ruskin, modern landscapists demonstrated superior understanding of the "truths" of water, air, clouds, stones, and vegetation, a profound appreciation of which Ruskin demonstrated in his own prose. He described works he had seen at the [[National Gallery]] and [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] with extraordinary verbal felicity.

Although critics were slow to react and reviews were mixed, many notable literary and artistic figures were impressed with the young man's work, notably [[Charlotte Brontë]] and [[Elizabeth Gaskell]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Early Years'' (Yale University Press, 1985) p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Suddenly Ruskin had found his métier, and in one leap helped redefine the genre of art criticism, mixing a discourse of polemic with aesthetics, scientific observation and ethics. It cemented Ruskin's relationship with Turner. After the artist died in 1851, Ruskin catalogued the nearly 20,000 sketches Turner gave to the British nation.

===1845 tour and ''Modern Painters II'' (1846)===
Ruskin toured the continent again with his parents in 1844, visiting [[Chamonix]] and Paris, studying the geology of the Alps and the paintings of [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Perugino]] among others at the [[Louvre]]. In 1845, at the age of 26, he undertook to travel without his parents for the first time. It provided him with an opportunity to study medieval art and architecture in France, Switzerland and especially Italy. In [[Lucca]] he saw the Tomb of Ilaria del Carretto by [[Jacopo della Quercia]] which Ruskin considered the exemplar of Christian sculpture (he later associated it with the object of his love, [[Rose La Touche]]). He drew inspiration from what he saw at the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]] in [[Pisa]], and in [[Florence]]. He was particularly impressed by the works of [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Giotto]] in [[San Marco]], and [[Tintoretto]] in the [[Scuola di San Rocco]] but was alarmed by the combined effects of decay and modernisation on [[Venice]]: "Venice is lost to me," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Q. in Harold I. Shapiro (ed.), ''Ruskin in Italy: Letters to His Parents 1845'' (Clarendon Press, 1972), pp.200–01.&lt;/ref&gt; It crystallised his lifelong conviction that to restore was to destroy, and that the only true course was preservation and conservation.

Drawing on his travels, he wrote the second volume of ''Modern Painters'' (published April 1846).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.25-218}} The volume concentrated more on Renaissance and pre-Renaissance artists than on Turner. It was a more theoretical work than its predecessor. Ruskin explicitly linked the aesthetic and the divine, arguing that truth, beauty and religion are inextricably bound together: "the Beautiful as a gift of God".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.47 (''Modern Painters II'')}}  In defining categories of beauty and imagination, Ruskin argued all great artists must perceive beauty and, with their imagination, communicate it creatively through symbols. Generally, critics gave this second volume a warmer reception although many found the attack on the aesthetic orthodoxy associated with [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] difficult to take.&lt;ref&gt;See J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1984),  pp. 88–95.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer, Ruskin was abroad again with his father who still hoped his son might become a poet, even [[poet laureate]] just one among many factors increasing the tension between them.

==Middle life (1847–1869)==
[[File:Euphemia ('Effie') Chalmers (née Gray), Lady Millais by Thomas Richmond.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Effie Gray painted by [[Thomas Richmond]]. She thought the portrait made her look like "a graceful Doll".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?LinkID=mp07473&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=art |title=NPG 5160; Effie Gray (Lady Millais) – Portrait |publisher= National Portrait Gallery |website=Npg.org.uk |date=26 December 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Marriage to Effie Gray===
During 1847, Ruskin became closer to [[Effie Gray]], the daughter of family friends. It was for Effie that Ruskin had written ''[[The King of the Golden River]]''. The couple were engaged in October. They married on 10 April 1848 at her home, Bowerswell, in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], once the residence of the Ruskin family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthshirediary.com/html/day0507.html |title=May 7th 1828 |publisher=Perthshire Diary |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the site of the suicide of John Thomas Ruskin (Ruskin's grandfather). Largely owing to this association, Ruskin's parents did not attend. The European [[Revolutions of 1848]] meant that the newlyweds' earliest travelling together was limited, but they were able to visit [[Normandy]], where Ruskin admired the [[Gothic architecture]].

Their early life together was spent at 31 Park Street, [[Mayfair]] (later addresses included nearby 6 Charles Street, and 30 Herne Hill) secured for them by Ruskin's father. Effie was too ill to undertake the European tour of 1849, so Ruskin visited the [[Alps]] with his parents, gathering material for the third and fourth volumes of ''[[Modern Painters]]''. He was struck by the contrast between the Alpine beauty and the poverty of Alpine peasants, stirring the social conscience that became increasingly sensitive.

The marriage, not consummated, later dissolved under discord and eventual annulment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Phyllis |year=2010 |title=Parallel lives five Victorian marriages |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=0307761509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
Ruskin's developing interest in architecture, and particularly in the [[Gothic revival]], led to the first work to bear his name, ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' (1849).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=8.3-274}} It contained 14 plates etched by the author. The title refers to seven moral categories that Ruskin considered vital to and inseparable from all architecture: sacrifice, truth, power, beauty, life, memory and obedience. All would provide recurring themes in his work.

''Seven Lamps'' promoted the virtues of a secular and Protestant form of Gothic. It was a challenge to the Catholic influence of [[A. W. N. Pugin]].

In August 1850 Ruskin and Effie were at [[Wenlock Abbey]] where Ruskin sketched some of the arcading in the Norman [[Chapter House]], which was used in ''The Stones of Venice''.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Cynthia, October 2013, Ruskin Lost in Shades of Gray, Shropshire Magazine, pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Stones of Venice''===
In November 1849, Effie and John Ruskin visited [[Venice]], staying at the Hotel Danieli.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Effie in Venice'' (John Murray, 1965); reprinted as ''Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice: Unpublished Letters of Mrs. John Ruskin written from Venice, between 1849–1852'' (Vanguard Press, 1967; new edition: Pallas Athene, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Their different personalities are thrown into sharp relief by their contrasting priorities. For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise, while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the [[Ca' d'Oro]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace, or Palazzo Ducale]], because he feared they would be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of these troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, made friends with Effie, apparently with no objection from Ruskin. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.

Meanwhile, Ruskin was making the extensive sketches and notes that he used for his three-volume work, [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] (1851–53).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/ruskinlib/eSoV/index.html |title=Ruskin's Venetian Notebooks 1849–50 |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=20 March 2008 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] see Cook and Wedderburn vols. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing from a technical history of Venetian architecture, from the Romanesque to the Renaissance, into a broad cultural history, ''Stones'' also reflected Ruskin's view of contemporary England. It acted as a warning about the moral and spiritual health of society. Ruskin argued that Venice had slowly deteriorated. Its cultural achievements had been compromised, and its society corrupted, by the decline of true Christian faith. Instead of revering the divine, Renaissance artists honoured themselves, arrogantly celebrating human sensuousness.

The chapter, 'The Nature of Gothic' appeared in the second volume of ''Stones''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=10.180–269}} Praising Gothic ornament, Ruskin argued that it was an expression of the artisan's joy in free, creative work. The worker must be allowed to think and to express his own personality and ideas, ideally using his own hands, not machinery.

{{Quote|text=We want one man to be always thinking, and another to be always working, and we call one a gentleman, and the other an operative; whereas the workman ought often to be thinking, and the thinker often to be working, and both should be gentlemen, in the best sense. As it is, we make both ungentle, the one envying, the other despising, his brother; and the mass of society is made up of morbid thinkers and miserable workers. Now it is only by labour that thought can be made healthy, and only by thought that labour can be made happy, and the two cannot be separated with impunity.|author=John Ruskin|source=Cook and Wedderburn 10.201.}}

This was both an aesthetic attack on, and a social critique of the [[division of labour]] in particular, and [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]] in general. This chapter had a profound impact, and was reprinted both by the [[Christian socialist]] founders of the [[Working Men's College]] and later by the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] pioneer and socialist, [[William Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiona MacCarthy, ''William Morris'' (Faber and Faber, 1994) pp. 69–70, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pre-Raphaelites===
[[File:Millais Ruskin.jpg|thumb|''[[John Ruskin (painting)|John Ruskin]]'' painted by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[John Everett Millais]] standing at [[Glenfinlas]], Scotland, (1853–54).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/886970 Ruskin and Millais at Glenfinlas], ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 138, No. 1117, pp. 228–34, April 1996. (Accessed via [[JSTOR]], UK.)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] had established the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in 1848. The Pre-Raphaelite commitment to 'naturalism'&amp;nbsp;– "paint[ing] from nature only",{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=12.357n}} depicting nature in fine detail, had been influenced by Ruskin.

Ruskin came into contact with Millais after the artists approached him through their mutual friend [[Coventry Patmore]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 137–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Ruskin had not been impressed by Millais's ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' (1849–50), a painting that was considered blasphemous at the time, but Ruskin wrote letters defending the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to ''[[The Times]]'' in May 1851.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=12.319–335}} Providing Millais with artistic patronage and encouragement, in the summer of 1853 the artist (and his brother) travelled to Scotland with Ruskin and Effie where, at [[Glenfinlas]], he painted the closely observed landscape background of [[gneiss]] rock to which, as had always been intended, he later added Ruskin's [[John Ruskin (painting)|portrait]].

Millais had painted Effie for ''[[The Order of Release|The Order of Release, 1746]]'', exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1852. Suffering increasingly from physical illness and acute mental anxiety, Effie was arguing fiercely with her husband and his intense and overly protective parents, and seeking solace with her own parents in Scotland. The Ruskin marriage was already fatally undermined as she and Millais fell in love, and Effie left Ruskin, causing a public scandal.

In April 1854, Effie filed her [[annulment|suit of nullity]], on grounds of "non-consummation" owing to his "incurable [[impotence|impotency]],"&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir William James, ''The Order of Release, the story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais'', 1946, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; a charge Ruskin later disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Rose, ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'', 1983, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin wrote, "I can prove my virility at once."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The annulment was granted in July. Ruskin did not even mention it in his diary. Effie married Millais the following year. The complex reasons for the non-consummation and ultimate failure of the Ruskin marriage are a matter of continued speculation and debate.

Ruskin continued to support [[William Holman Hunt|Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]]. He also provided an annuity of £150 in 1855–57 to [[Elizabeth Siddal]], Rossetti's wife, to encourage her art (and paid for the services of [[Henry Acland]] for her medical care).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''ODNB'': "Critic of Contemporary Art".&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites also received both critical and financial support from Ruskin, including [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], [[John William Inchbold]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] who became a good friend (he called him "Brother Ned").&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Collingwood, ''Life and Work of John Ruskin'' (Methuen, 1900) p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; His father's disapproval of such friends was a further cause of considerable tension between them.

During this period Ruskin wrote regular reviews of the annual exhibitions at the [[Royal Academy]] under the title ''Academy Notes'' (1855–59, 1875).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=vol. 14}} They were highly influential, capable of making and breaking reputations. The satirical magazine, ''[[punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', for example, published the lines (24 May 1856), "I paints and paints,/hears no complaints/And sells before I'm dry,/Till savage Ruskin/He sticks his tusk in/Then nobody will buy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=udKymsQhKMEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20paints%20and%20paints%2C%2Fhears%20no%20complaints%2FAnd%20sells%20before%20I%E2%80%99m%20dry%2C%2FTill%20savage%20Ruskin%20sticks%20his%20tusk%20in%2FThen%20nobody%20will%20buy ] {{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin was an art-philanthropist: in March 1861 he gave 48 [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] drawings to the [[Ashmolean]] in [[Oxford]], and a further 25 to the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], [[Cambridge]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |title=Fitzwilliam Museum Collections Explorer |website=Fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903031532/http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's own work was very distinctive, and he occasionally exhibited his watercolours: in the United States in 1857–58 and 1879, for example; and in England, at the Fine Art Society in 1878, and at the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolour (of which he was an honorary member) in 1879. He created many careful studies of natural forms, based on his detailed botanical, geological and architectural observations.&lt;ref&gt;The relation between Ruskin, his art and criticism, was explored in the exhibition Ruskin, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites (Tate Britain, 2000), curated by Robert Hewison, Stephen Wildman and Ian Warrell.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of his work include a painted, floral pilaster decoration in the central room of [[Wallington Hall]] in Northumberland, home of his friend [[Pauline Trevelyan]]. The [[Stained glass|stained glass window]] in the ''Little Church of St Francis'' Funtley, [[Fareham, Hampshire]] is reputed to have been designed by him. Originally placed in the ''St. Peter's Church'' Duntisbourne Abbots near [[Cirencester]], the window depicts the Ascension and the Nativity.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Low &amp; Julie Graham, ''The stained glass window of the Little Church of St. Francis'', private publication August 2002 &amp; April 2006, for viewing Fareham Library reference Section or the [[Westbury Manor Museum]] Ref: section Fareham, hants; [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/m.low1/funtley/funtleychurch.htm The stained glass window of the Church of St. Francis.

Ruskin's theories also inspired some architects to adapt the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. Such buildings created what has been called a distinctive "Ruskinian Gothic".&lt;ref&gt;J. Mordaunt Crook, "Ruskinian Gothic" in ''The Ruskin Polygon: Essays on the Imagination of John Ruskin'' ed. John Dixon Hunt and Faith M. Holland (Manchester University Press, 1982), pp. 65–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his friendship with [[Sir Henry Acland]], from 1854 Ruskin supported attempts to establish what became the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] (designed by [[Benjamin Woodward]]) which is the closest thing to a model of this style, but still failed completely to satisfy Ruskin. The many twists and turns in the Museum's development, not least its increasing cost, and the University authorities' less than enthusiastic attitude towards it, proved increasingly frustrating for Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brooks, ''John Ruskin and Victorian Architecture'' (Thames and Hudson, 1991), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruskin and education===
The [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History|Museum]] was part of a wider plan to improve science provision at Oxford, something the University initially resisted. The mid-1850s saw Ruskin's first direct involvement in education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/john_ruskin.htm |title=John Ruskin on education |website=Infed.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he taught drawing classes (assisted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]) at the [[Working Men's College]], established by the [[Christian socialists]], [[Frederick James Furnivall]] and [[Frederick Denison Maurice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805231329/http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |archivedate=5 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not share the founders' politics, he strongly supported the idea that through education workers could achieve a crucially important sense of (self-)fulfilment.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.553}} One result of this involvement was Ruskin's ''Elements of Drawing'' (1857).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=15.23-232}} He had taught several women drawing by letter, and his book was both a response and a challenge to contemporary drawing manuals.&lt;ref&gt;''ODNB''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a useful recruiting ground for assistants, on some of whom Ruskin would later come to rely, such as his future publisher, [[George Allen (publisher)|George Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1859 until 1868, Ruskin was involved with the progressive school for girls at [[Winnington Hall]] in Cheshire. A frequent visitor, letter-writer, and donor of pictures and geological specimens, Ruskin approved of the mixture of sports, handicrafts, music and dancing embraced by its principal, Miss Bell.&lt;ref&gt;''The Winnington Letters: John Ruskin's correspondence with Margaret Alexis Bell and the children at Winnington Hall'' ed. Van Akin Burd (Harvard University Press, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association led to Ruskin's sub-Socratic work, ''The Ethics of the Dust'' (published December 1865, imprinted 1866), an imagined conversation with Winnington girls in which he cast himself as the "Old Lecturer".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.197–372}} On the surface a discourse on crystallography, it represents a metaphorical exploration of social and political ideals. In the 1880s, Ruskin became involved with another educational institution, [[Whitelands College]], a training college for teachers, where he instituted a [[May Queen]] festival that endures today.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Cole, ''"Be Like Daisies": John Ruskin and the Cultivation of Beauty at Whitelands College (Guild of St George Ruskin Lecture 1992)'' (Brentham Press for The Guild of St George, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; (It was also replicated in the 19th century at the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] High School for Girls.) Ruskin also bestowed books and gemstones upon [[Somerville College]], one of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s first two [[women's college]]s, which he visited regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manuel|first1=Anne|title=Breaking New Ground: A History of Somerville College as seen through its Buildings|page=12|date=2013|publisher=Somerville College|location=Oxford|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also donated many of his books to the [[Somerville College Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108093838/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |archivedate=8 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Modern Painters III'' and ''IV''===
Both volumes III and IV of ''Modern Painters'' were published in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Respectively, Cook and Wedderburn vols. 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''MP'' III Ruskin argued that all great art is "the expression of the spirits of great men".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.69}} Only the morally and spiritually healthy are capable of admiring the noble and the beautiful, and transforming them into great art by imaginatively penetrating their essence. ''MP'' IV presents the geology of the Alps in terms of landscape painting, and its moral and spiritual influence on those living nearby. The contrasting final chapters, "The Mountain Glory" and "The Mountain Gloom"&lt;ref&gt;Francis O'Gorman, "Ruskin's Mountain Gloom" in Rachel Dickinson and Keith Hanley (eds), ''Ruskin's Struggle for Coherence: Self-Representation through Art, Place and Society'' (Cambridge Scholars Press, 2006), pp. 76–89.&lt;/ref&gt; provide an early example of Ruskin's social analysis, highlighting the poverty of the peasants living in the lower Alps.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.385–417, 418–68}}&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davis, "Ruskin‟s Dialectic: Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory" in ''Ruskin Programme Bulletin'', no. 25 (January 2001), pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public lecturer===
In addition to his more formal teaching classes, Ruskin became an increasingly popular public lecturer in the 1850s. His first were in Edinburgh, in November 1853, on architecture and painting. Lectures at the [[Art Treasures Exhibition]], Manchester in 1857, were collected as ''The Political Economy of Art'' and later under [[Keats]]'s phrase, ''A Joy For Ever''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.9-174}} He spoke about how to acquire, and how to use art, arguing that England had forgotten that true wealth is virtue, and that art is an index of a nation's well-being. Individuals have a responsibility to consume wisely, stimulating beneficent demand. The increasingly critical tone and political nature of Ruskin's intervention outraged his father and the [[Manchester School of economics|"Manchester School" of economists]], as represented by a hostile review in the ''[[Manchester Examiner and Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 202–05.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ruskin scholar, Helen Gill Viljoen, notes Ruskin was increasingly critical of his father, especially in letters written by Ruskin directly to him, many of them still unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Most of Viljoen's work remains unpublished, but has been explored by Van Akin Burd and James L. Spates.

Ruskin gave the inaugural address at the Cambridge School of Art in 1858, an institution from which the modern-day [[Anglia Ruskin University]] has grown.&lt;ref&gt;For the address itself, see Cook and Wedderburn 16.177–206, and for the wider context: Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and Cambridge" in ''The Companion'' (Newsletter of The Guild of St. George) no.7 (2007), pp.8–10. [Revised version of inaugural Ruskin Lecture, Anglia Ruskin University, 11 October 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Two Paths'' (1859), five lectures given in London, [[Manchester]], [[Bradford]] and [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge]]{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.251–426}} Ruskin argued that a 'vital law' underpins art and architecture, drawing on the [[labour theory of value]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.251}} (For other addresses and letters, Cook and Wedderburn, vol. 16, pp.&amp;nbsp;427–87.) The year 1859 also marked his last tour of Europe with his ageing parents, to Germany and [[Switzerland]].

===Turner Bequest===
Ruskin had been in Venice when he heard about [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner's]] death in 1851. Being named an executor to Turner's will was an honour that Ruskin respectfully declined, but later took up. In 1856, Ruskin's book in celebration of the sea, ''The Harbours of England'', revolving around Turner's drawings, was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.9–80}} In January 1857, Ruskin's ''Notes on the Turner Gallery at Marlborough House, 1856'' was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.95–186}} He persuaded the [[National Gallery]] to allow him to work on the Turner Bequest of nearly 20,000 individual artworks left to the nation by the artist. This involved Ruskin in an enormous amount of work, completed in May 1858: cataloguing, framing and conserving.&lt;ref&gt;For the catalogues, Cook and Wedderburn 19.187–230 and 351–538. For letters, see 13.329-50 and further notes, 539–646.&lt;/ref&gt; 400 watercolours were displayed in cabinets of Ruskin's design.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Recent scholarship has argued that Ruskin did not, as previously thought, collude in the destruction of Turner's erotic drawings,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol. IV, no. 1 (Spring 2003), pp. 15–46.&lt;/ref&gt; but his work on the Bequest did modify his attitude towards Turner.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davis, "Misinterpreting Ruskin: New light on the "dark clue‟ in the basement of the National Gallery, 1857–58" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 35–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (See below, [[John Ruskin#Turner's erotic drawings|Controversies: Turner's Erotic Drawings]])

===Religious "unconversion"===
In 1858, Ruskin was again travelling in Europe. The tour took him from [[Switzerland]] to [[Turin]] where he saw [[Paolo Veronese]]'s ''Presentation of the Queen of Sheba''. He would later claim (in April 1877) that the discovery of this painting, contrasting starkly with a particularly dull sermon, led to his "unconversion" from [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christianity]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.89}} But in reality he had doubted his Evangelical Christian faith for some time, threatened by Biblical and geological scholarship that had undermined the literal truth and absolute authority of the Bible:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wheeler, ''Ruskin's God'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "those dreadful hammers!" he wrote to [[Henry Acland]], "I hear the chink of them at the end of every cadence of the Bible verses."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.115}} This "loss of faith" precipitated a considerable crisis. His confidence undermined, he believed that much of his writing to date had been founded on a bed of lies and half-truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/4.2.html |title=Chapter Four, Section II. Loss of Belief |website=Victorianweb.org |date=25 July 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later returned to Christianity.&lt;ref name="victorianweb.org"&gt;http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/4.3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social critic and reformer: ''Unto This Last''===
{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=Whenever I look or travel in England or abroad, I see that men, wherever they can reach, destroy all beauty. |source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 7.V.422–3 (1860).&lt;/small&gt; }}

Although Ruskin said in 1877 that in 1860, "I gave up my art work and wrote ''[[Unto This Last]]'' ... the central work of my life" the break was not so dramatic or final.&lt;ref&gt;E. T. Cook, ''The Life of John Ruskin'' (2 vols., 2nd edn., George Allen, 1912), vol. 2, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his crisis of faith, and influenced in part by his friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (whom he had first met in 1850), Ruskin's emphasis shifted from art towards social issues from the end of the 1850s. Nevertheless, he continued to lecture on and write about a dazzlingly wide range of subjects including art and, among many others, geology (in June 1863 he lectured on the Alps), art practice and judgement (''The Cestus of Aglaia''), botany and mythology (''Proserpina'', ''The Queen of the Air''). He continued to draw and paint in watercolours, and to travel widely across Europe with servants and friends. In 1868, his tour took him to [[Abbeville]], and in the following year he was in [[Verona]] (studying tombs for the [[Arundel Society]]) and [[Venice]] (where he was joined by [[William Holman Hunt]]). Yet increasingly Ruskin concentrated his energies on fiercely attacking [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]], and the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] theories of [[political economy]] underpinning it. He repudiated his eloquent style, writing now in plainer, simpler language, to communicate his message straightforwardly.&lt;ref&gt;On the importance of words and language: Cook and Wedderburn  18.65, 18.64, and 20.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=There is no wealth but life. Life, including all its powers of love, of joy, and of admiration.

|source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 17.105&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's social view broadened from concerns about the dignity of labour to consider wider issues of citizenship, and notions of the ideal community. Just as he had questioned aesthetic orthodoxy in his earliest writings, he now dissected the orthodox political economy espoused by [[John Stuart Mill]], based on theories of [[laissez-faire]] and competition drawn from the work of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Malthus]]. In his four essays, ''[[Unto This Last]]'', Ruskin rejected the [[division of labour]] as dehumanising (separating labourer from his product), and argued that the "science" of [[political economy]] failed to consider the social affections that bind communities together. Ruskin articulated an extended metaphor of household and family, drawing on [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] to demonstrate the communal and sometimes sacrificial nature of true economics.&lt;ref&gt;For the sources of Ruskin's social and political analysis: James Clark Sherburne, ''John Ruskin or The Ambiguities of Abundance: A Study in Social and Economic Criticism'' (Harvard University Press, 1972 {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ruskin, all economies, and all societies are ideally underwritten by a politics of [[social justice]]. Ruskin's ideas influenced the concept of the "[[social economy]]" characterised by networks of charitable, co-operative and other [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]].

The essays were originally published in consecutive monthly instalments of the new ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' between August and November 1860 and was published in a single volume in 1862.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.15–118}} However, its editor, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], was forced to abandon the series by the outcry of its largely conservative readership and the fears of a nervous publisher ([[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]]). The press reaction was hostile, and Ruskin was, he claimed, "reprobated in a violent manner".&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 4.122n. For the press reaction: J. L. Bradley (ed.) ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 273–89.&lt;/ref&gt; His father also strongly disapproved.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.415}} Others were enthusiastic, including Ruskin's friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]], who wrote, "I have read your paper with exhilaration... such a thing flung suddenly into half a million dull British heads... will do a great deal of good."&lt;ref&gt;Q. in James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications Ltd., 2004), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin's political ideas, and ''[[Unto This Last]]'' in particular, later proved highly influential, praised and paraphrased in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] by [[Mohandas Gandhi]], a wide range of autodidacts, the economist [[John A. Hobson]] and many of the founders of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour party]].&lt;ref&gt;For the influence of Ruskin's social and political thought: Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (I.B. Tauris, 2007) and Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruskin believed in a hierarchical social structure. He wrote "I was, and my father was before me, a violent Tory of the old school."&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn  27.167 and 35.13.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed in duties and responsibilities to, and under, God, and while he sought to improve the conditions of the poor, he opposed attempts to level social differences and sought to resolve social inequalities by abandoning capitalism in favour of a co-operative structure of society based on obedience and benevolent philanthropy, rooted in the agricultural economy.

Ruskin's explorations of nature and aesthetics in the fifth and final volume of  ''[[Modern Painters]]'' focused on [[Giorgione]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Titian]] and [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]]. Ruskin asserted that the components of the greatest art are held together, like human communities, in quasi-organic unity. Competitive struggle is destructive. Uniting ''[[Modern Painters]]'' V and ''[[Unto This Last]]'' is Ruskin's "Law of Help":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/galib64.htm |title=Ruskin MP I Notes |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=6 July 2002 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Government and cooperation are in all things and eternally the laws of life. Anarchy and competition, eternally, and in all things, the laws of death. |source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 7.207 and 17.25.&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's next work on political economy, redefining some of the basic terms of the discipline, also ended prematurely, when ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'', under the editorship of [[James Anthony Froude]], cut short his ''Essays on Political Economy'' (1862–63) (later collected as ''Munera Pulveris'' (1872)).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.129–298}}  Ruskin explored further political themes in ''Time and Tide'' (1867),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.309–484}} his letters to Thomas Dixon, the cork-cutter in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear]] with a well-established interest in literary and artistic matters. In these letters, Ruskin promoted honesty in work and exchange, just relations in employment and the need for co-operation.

Ruskin's sense of politics was not confined to theory. On his father's death in 1864, Ruskin inherited a considerable fortune of between £120,000 and £157,000 (the exact figure is disputed).&lt;ref&gt;Francis O' Gorman gives the figure as £120,000, in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 62 as does James S. Dearden (who adds that property, including paintings, was valued at £3000), in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications Ltd., 2004), p. 37. Robert Hewison's ''Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' entry for Ruskin, however, states £157,000 plus £10,000 in pictures (section: "A Mid-Life Crisis").&lt;/ref&gt; This considerable inheritance from the father he described on his tombstone as "an entirely honest merchant"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.lxxvii}} gave him the means to engage in personal philanthropy and practical schemes of social amelioration. One of his first actions was to support the housing work of [[Octavia Hill]] (originally one of his art pupils), by buying property in [[Marylebone]] for her philanthropic housing scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Darley, ''Octavia Hill: A Life'' (Constable, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Ruskin's endeavours extended to a shop selling pure tea in any quantity desired at 29 Paddington Street, [[Paddington]] (giving employment to two former Ruskin family servants) and crossing-sweepings to keep the area around the [[British Museum]] clean and tidy. Modest as these practical schemes were, they represented a symbolic challenge to the existing state of society. Yet his greatest practical experiments would come in his later years.

===Lectures in the 1860s===
Ruskin lectured widely in the 1860s, giving the [[Rede lecture]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1867, for example.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=19.163-94}} He spoke at the [[British Institution]] on 'Modern Art', the Working Men's Institute, [[Camberwell]] on "Work" and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] on 'War'. Ruskin's widely admired lecture, ''Traffic'', on the relations of taste and morality, was delivered in April 1864 at [[Bradford]] Town Hall, to which he had been invited because of a local debate about the style of a new Exchange building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/block1.html |title=Moral Taste in Ruskin's "Traffic" |website=Victorianweb.org |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I do not care about this Exchange," Ruskin told his audience, "because ''you'' don't!"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.433}} These last three lectures were published in ''The Crown of Wild Olive'' (1866).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.383–533}}

[[File:Library Walk 29.JPG|thumb|"For all books are divisible into two classes: the books of the hour, and the books of all time" – ''Sesame and Lilies'']]
The lectures that comprised ''Sesame and Lilies'' (published 1865), delivered in December 1864 at the town halls at [[Rusholme]] and [[Manchester]], are essentially concerned with education and ideal conduct. "Of Kings' Treasuries" (in support of a library fund) explored issues of reading practice, literature (books of the hour vs. books of all time), cultural value and public education. "Of Queens' Gardens" (supporting a school fund) focused on the role of women, asserting their rights and duties in education, according them responsibility for the household and, by extension, for providing the human compassion that must balance a social order dominated by men. This book proved to be one of Ruskin's most popular books, and was regularly awarded as a [[Sunday School]] prize.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.19-187}} The book's reception over time, however, has been more mixed, and twentieth-century feminists have taken aim at "Of Queens' Gardens" particularly as an effort to "subvert the new heresy" of [[women's rights]] by confining women to the domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Millett, Sexual Politics.  New York: Doubleday and Co., 1970, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life (1869–1900)==

===Oxford's first Slade Professor of Fine Art===
[[File:Vanity Fair Caricature of Ruskin.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature by [[Adriano Cecioni]] published in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1872]]
Ruskin was unanimously appointed the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at [[Oxford University]] in August 1869, largely through the offices of his friend, [[Henry Acland]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 165–68.&lt;/ref&gt; He delivered his inaugural lecture on his 51st birthday in 1870, at the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] to a larger-than-expected audience. It was here that he said, "The art of any country is the exponent of its social and political virtues.". Thus, its effect on each man should be visible and moving.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:121)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecil Rhodes]] cherished a long-hand copy of the lecture, believing that it supported his own view of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Symonds, 'Oxford and the Empire', in [[M. G. Brock]] and M. C. Curthoys (eds.), ''The History of the University of Oxford, vol. VII: Nineteenth-Century Oxford, part 2'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 689–716, specifically p. 691.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, John Ruskin founded his own art school at [[Oxford]], [[The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/holdings/Ruskin%20School%20of%20Art%20RS.pdf |title=Oxford University Archives &amp;#124; Home |website=Oua.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally accommodated within the [[Ashmolean Museum]] but now occupies premises on "the High" (High Street). Ruskin endowed the drawing mastership with £5000 of his own money. He also established a large collection of drawings, watercolours and other materials (over 800 frames) with which to illustrate his lectures. The School challenged the orthodox, mechanical methodology of the government schools (the "South Kensington System").&lt;ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996"&gt;See Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His lectures were often so popular that they had to be given twice—once for the students, and again for the public. Most of them were eventually published (see Bibliography). He lectured on a wide range of subjects at Oxford, his interpretation of "Art" encompassing almost every conceivable area of study, including wood and metal engraving (''Ariadne Florentina''), the relation of science to art (''The Eagle's Nest'') and sculpture (''Aratra Pentelici''). His lectures ranged through myth, ornithology, geology, nature-study and literature. "The teaching of Art...," Ruskin wrote, "is the teaching of all things."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.86}} Ruskin was never careful about offending his employer. When he criticised [[Michelangelo]] in a lecture in June 1871 it was seen as an attack on the large collection of that artist's work in the [[Ashmolean Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis O' Gorman,  ''John Ruskin'' (Pocket Biographies) (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most controversial, from the point of view of the University authorities, spectators and the national press, was the digging scheme on [[Ferry Hinksey Road]] at [[North Hinksey]], near [[Oxford]], instigated by Ruskin in 1874, and continuing into 1875, which involved undergraduates in a road-mending scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/3780 |title=John Ruskin green plaque |publisher=Open Plaques |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was motivated in part by a desire to teach the virtues of wholesome manual labour. Some of the diggers, which included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Alfred Milner]] and Ruskin's future secretary and biographer, [[W. G. Collingwood]], were profoundly influenced by the experience: notably [[Arnold Toynbee]], Leonard Montefiore and [[Alexander Robertson MacEwen]]. It helped to foster a public service ethic that was later given expression in the [[settlement movement|university settlements]],&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 103–09.&lt;/ref&gt; and was keenly celebrated by the founders of [[Ruskin College|Ruskin Hall, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, "Ruskin the Worker: Hinksey and the Origins of Ruskin Hall, Oxford" in ''Ruskin Review and Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3 (Autumn 2008), pp. 19–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Ruskin resigned from Oxford, but resumed his Professorship in 1883, resigning again in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Latter Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 399–400, 509–10.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his reason as opposition to [[vivisection]],&lt;ref&gt;Jed Mayer, "Ruskin, Vivisection, and Scientific Knowledge" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 35, no. 1 (Spring 2008) (Guest Editor, Sharon Aronofsky Weltman), pp. 200–22.&lt;/ref&gt; but he had increasingly been in conflict with the University authorities, who refused to expand his [[Ruskin School of Drawing|Drawing School]].&lt;ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996"/&gt; He was also suffering increasingly poor health.

===''Fors Clavigera'' and the Whistler Libel Case===
In January 1871, the month before Ruskin started to lecture the wealthy undergraduates at [[Oxford University]], he began his (originally) monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–84). (The letters were published irregularly after the 87th instalment in March 1878.) These letters were personal, dealt with every subject in his [[Work of art|oeuvre]], and were written in a variety of styles, reflecting his mood and circumstances. From 1873, Ruskin had full control over all his publications, having established George Allen as his sole publisher (see [[Allen &amp; Unwin]]).

In the July 1877 letter of ''Fors Clavigera'', Ruskin launched a scathing attack on paintings by [[James McNeill Whistler]] exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]. He found particular fault with [[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket|''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket'']], and accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.160}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 Linda Merrill, ''A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin''. – book review, ''Art in America'', January 1993, by Wendy Steiner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827175109/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 |date=27 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler filed a libel suit against Ruskin. Whistler won the case, which went to trial in Ruskin's absence in 1878 (he was ill), but the jury awarded damages of only one [[British farthing coin|farthing]] to the artist. Court costs were split between the two parties. Ruskin's were paid by public subscription, but Whistler was bankrupted within six months. The episode tarnished Ruskin's reputation, however, and may have accelerated his mental decline.&lt;ref&gt;For an exploration of Ruskin's rejection of dominant artistic trends in his later life, see Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and the Challenge of Modernity" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 13–34.&lt;/ref&gt; It did nothing to mitigate Ruskin's consistently exaggerated sense of failure in persuading his readers to share in his own keenly felt priorities.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 29.469, the passage in ''Sesame and Lilies'' printed in "blood-red".&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Guild of St George===
Ruskin founded his utopian society, the [[Guild of St George]], in 1871 (although originally it was called St George's Fund, and then St George's Company, before becoming the Guild in 1878). Its aims and objectives were articulated in ''[[Fors Clavigera]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27–29}} A communitarian venture, it had a hierarchical structure, with Ruskin as its Master, and dedicated members called "Companions" whose first loyalty was nearly always to Ruskin personally.&lt;ref&gt;For the Guild's constitution and articles of association: Cook and Wedderburn  30.3–12&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin wished to show that contemporary life could still be enjoyed in the countryside, with land being farmed traditionally, with minimal mechanical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1940&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235259/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1940&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a tithe (or personal donation) of £7,000, Ruskin acquired some land and a remarkable collection of books, art and other precious and beautiful objects.&lt;ref&gt;On the origins of the Guild: Edith Hope Scott, ''Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Methuen, 1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin purchased land initially in [[Totley]], near [[Sheffield]], but the agricultural element of his scheme met with only moderate success after many difficulties. Donations of land from wealthy and committed Companions eventually placed land and properties in the Guild's care: [[Wyre Forest]], near [[Bewdley]], Worcestershire;&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Wardle and Cedric Quayle, ''Ruskin and Bewdley'' (Brentham Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barmouth]], in [[Gwynedd]], north-west [[Wales]]; [[Cloughton]], in [[North Yorkshire]]; and [[Westmill]] in Hertfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ruskinland.htm |title=Ruskinland |website=Utopia-britannica.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, Ruskin worked out a scheme for different grades of "Companion", wrote codes of practice, described styles of dress and even designed the Guild's own coins.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=28.417–38 and 28.13–29}} Ruskin wished to see St George's Schools established, and published various volumes to aid its teaching (his ''Bibliotheca Pastorum'' or ''Shepherd's Library''), but the schools themselves were never established.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Atwood, ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011), pp. 151–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (In the 1880s, in a venture loosely related to the ''Bibliotheca'', he supported [[Francesca Alexander]], publishing some of her tales of peasant life.) In reality, the Guild, which still exists today as a charitable organisation, has only ever operated on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;For a short, illustrated history of the Guild: James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Guild of St George, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin also wished to see traditional rural handicrafts revived. St. George's Mill was established at [[Laxey]], on the [[Isle of Man]] producing cloth goods. The Guild also encouraged independent, but allied, efforts in spinning and weaving at [[Langdale]], in other parts of the [[Lake District]] and elsewhere, producing linen and other goods exhibited by the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] and similar organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Sara E. Haslam, ''John Ruskin and the Lakeland Arts Revival, 1880–1920'' (Merton Priory Press Ltd., 2004) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sheffield]], in 1875, Ruskin established a museum for the working men of that city, and surrounding areas. Originally situated in [[Walkley]] and curated by Henry Swan, St. George's Museum housed a large collection of art works (original pencil sketches, architectural drawings, watercolours, copies of Old Masters and so on), minerals, geological specimens, manuscripts (many of them medieval in origin) and a multitude of other beautiful and precious items.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Barnes, ''Ruskin and Sheffield'' (Sheffield City Council, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin had written in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' III (1856) that, "the greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to ''see'' something, and to tell what it ''saw'' in a plain way."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.333}} Through the Museum, Ruskin aimed to bring to the eyes of the working man many of the sights and experiences otherwise confined to the wealthy who could afford to travel through Europe. The original Museum has been virtually recreated online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruskinatwalkley.org/ |title=Ruskin at Walkley |publisher=Ruskin at Walkley |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the Museum relocated to [[Meersbrook Park]]. The collection is currently (2011) on display at [[Sheffield]]'s [[Millennium Galleries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/collections/ruskin-collection |title=eMuseum |website=Museums-sheffield.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rose La Touche===
[[File:Portrait of Rose La Touche 1861 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''Rose La Touche'', as sketched by Ruskin]]
Ruskin had been introduced to the wealthy Irish La Touche family by [[Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford]]. Maria La Touche, a minor Irish poet and novelist, asked Ruskin to teach her daughters drawing and painting in 1858. [[Rose La Touche]] was ten, Ruskin nearly 39. Ruskin gradually fell in love with her. Their first meeting came at a time when Ruskin's own religious faith was under strain. This always caused difficulties for the staunchly Protestant La Touche family who at various times prevented the two from meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dunlop, ''Plantation of Renown: The Story of the La Touche Family of Harristown and the Baptist Church at Brannockstown in Co. Kildar''e [1970]. Revised and enlarged edition, 1982; "Ruskin‟s "Wild Rose of Kildare", pp. 29–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's love for Rose was a cause alternately of great joy and deep depression for him, and always a source of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;See Van Akin Burd, ''John Ruskin and Rose La Touche: Her unpublished Diaries of 1861 and 1867'' (Clarendon Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin proposed to her on or near her eighteenth birthday in 1867, but she asked him to wait three years for an answer, until she was 21. A chance meeting at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1869 was one of the few occasions they came into personal contact thereafter. She finally rejected him in 1872, but they still occasionally met, for the final time on 15 February 1875. After a long illness, she died on 25 May 1875, at the age of 27. These events plunged Ruskin into despair and led to increasingly severe bouts of mental illness involving a number of breakdowns and delirious visions. The first of these had occurred in 1871 at [[Matlock, Derbyshire]], a town and a county that he knew from his boyhood travels, whose flora, fauna, and minerals helped to form and reinforce his appreciation and understanding of nature. Ruskin turned to [[spiritualism]] and was by turns comforted and disturbed by what he believed was his ability to communicate with the dead Rose.

===Travel guides===
Ruskin continued to travel, studying the landscapes, buildings and art of Europe. In May 1870 and June 1872 he admired [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]]'s ''St Ursula'' in [[Venice]], a vision of which, associated with [[Rose La Touche]] would haunt him, described in the pages of ''[[Fors Clavigera|Fors]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27.344}} In 1874, on his tour of Italy, Ruskin visited [[Sicily]], the furthest he ever travelled.

Ruskin embraced the emerging literary forms, the travel guide (and gallery guide), writing new works, and adapting old ones "to give," he said, "what guidance I may to travallers..."&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 23.293. For further study, see Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Stones of Venice'' was revised, edited and issued in a new "Travellers' Edition" in 1879. Ruskin directed his readers, the would-be traveller, to look with his cultural gaze at the landscapes, buildings and art of France and Italy: ''Mornings in Florence'' (1875–77), ''The Bible of Amiens'' (1880–85) (a close study of its sculpture and a wider history), ''St Mark's Rest'' (1877–84) and ''A Guide to the Principal Pictures in ... Venice'' (1877).

===Return to belief===
In December 1875, Ruskin's desire for a meaningful universe and a life after death, both for himself and his loved ones, brought him back to Christianity. He never publicly related the date and cause of his return to belief, but his letters demonstrate that on 20 December 1875, a spiritualist seance at Broadlands convinced him that the ghost of Rose La Touche had appeared at his side.

While the direct link between Ruskin's faith and this event cannot be made, his subsequent writings demonstrate a return to Christianity. In ''Praeterita'' he affirms that [[Christ]] will return "and judge every man according to his work". These beliefs were often unquestioning, and even anti-intellectual. An example of this is a letter of 1876, in which he did "not think the question of the Trinity or Unity is one for Man to discuss."&lt;ref name="victorianweb.org"/&gt;

===Final writings===
[[File:John Ruskin, 1882.jpg|thumb|John Ruskin in 1882]]
In the 1880s, Ruskin returned to some literature and themes that had been among his favourites since childhood. He wrote about [[Walter Scott]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] in ''Fiction, Fair and Foul'' (1880){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.265–397}} and returned to meteorological observations in his lectures, ''The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth-Century'' (1884),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.7–80}} describing the apparent effects of industrialisation on weather patterns. Ruskin's ''Storm-Cloud'' has been seen as foreshadowing environmentalism and related concerns in the 20th and 21st centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wheeler (ed.), ''Ruskin and Environment: The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth Century'' (Manchester University Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's prophetic writings were also tied to his emotions, and his more general (ethical) dissatisfaction with the modern world with which he now felt almost completely out of sympathy.

His last great work was his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=35.5-562}} (meaning, 'Of Past Things'), a highly personalised, selective, eloquent but incomplete account of aspects of his life, the preface of which was written in his childhood nursery at [[Herne Hill]].

The period from the late 1880s was one of steady and inexorable decline. Gradually it became too difficult for him to travel to Europe. He suffered a complete collapse on his final tour, which included [[Beauvais]], [[Sallanches]] and [[Venice]], in 1888. The emergence and dominance of the [[Aesthetic movement]] and [[Impressionism]] distanced Ruskin from the modern art world, his ideas on the social utility of art contrasting with the "l'art pour l'art" or "art for art's sake" that was beginning to dominate. His later writings were increasingly seen as irrelevant, especially as he seemed to be more interested in book illustrators such as [[Kate Greenaway]] than in modern art. He also attacked [[Darwinism|Darwinian theory]] with increasing violence, although he knew and respected [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] personally.

===Brantwood===
[[File:John Ruskin's grave, and family plot - geograph.org.uk - 1231315.jpg|thumb|Grave of John Ruskin, in [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] churchyard]]
In August 1871, Ruskin purchased from [[W. J. Linton]] the then somewhat dilapidated [[Brantwood]], on the shores of [[Coniston Water]], in the English [[Lake District]], paying £1500. It remains open to visitors today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brantwood.org.uk/ |title=Museum, Arts Centre &amp; Self Catering Accommodation Coniston |website=Brantwood.org.uk |date=14 April 2017 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Ruskin's main home from 1872 until his death. His estate provided a site for more of his practical schemes and experiments: an ice house was built, the gardens were comprehensively rearranged, he oversaw the construction of a larger harbour (from where he rowed his boat, the ''Jumping Jenny''), and altered the house (adding a dining room, turret to his bedroom to give a panoramic view of the lake, and later expanding further to accommodate his relatives). He built a reservoir, and redirected the waterfall down the hills, adding a slate seat that faced the tumbling stream rather than the lake, so that he could closely observe the fauna and flora of the hillside.&lt;ref&gt;For an illustrated history of Brantwood, see James S. Dearden, ''Brantwood: The Story of John Ruskin's Coniston Home'' (Ruskin Foundation, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ruskin's 80th birthday was widely celebrated in 1899 (various Ruskin societies presenting him with a congratulatory address), Ruskin was scarcely aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1674&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235342/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1674&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Brantwood]] from influenza on 20 January 1900 at the age of 80. He was buried five days later in the churchyard at [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]], according to his wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lookandlearn.com/history-images/M076100/John-Ruskins-Grave-at-Coniston?img=163&amp;search=RANDOM&amp;cat=&amp;bool=and |title= Look and Learn History Picture Library |website=Lookandlearn.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he had grown weaker, suffering prolonged bouts of mental illness (thought in retrospect to have been [[CADASIL syndrome]]), he had been looked after by his second cousin, Joan(na) Severn (formerly "companion" to Ruskin's mother) and she inherited his estate. "Joanna's Care" was the eloquent final chapter of his memoir which he dedicated to her as a fitting tribute.&lt;ref&gt;For Ruskin's relationship with Joan Severn, see ''John Ruskin's Correspondence with Joan Severn: Sense and Nonsense Letters'' ed. Rachel Dickinson (Legenda, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan Severn, together with Ruskin's secretary, [[W. G. Collingwood]], and his eminent American friend, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], were executors to his Will. [[E. T. Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn edited the monumental 39-volume ''Library Edition'' of Ruskin's ''Works'', the last volume of which, an index, attempts to articulate the complex interconnectedness of Ruskin's thought. They all acted together to guard, and even control, Ruskin's public and personal reputation.&lt;ref&gt;James Spates has written about the effects of this, based on the research work of Helen Viljoen. See James L. Spates, 'John Ruskin‟s Dark Star: New Lights on His Life Based on the Unpublished Biographical Materials and Research of Helen Gill Viljoen', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'', vol. 82, no. 1, Spring 2000 [published 2001], 135–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centenary of Ruskin's birth was keenly celebrated in 1919, but his reputation was already in decline and sank further in the fifty years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 246–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of Ruskin's home were dispersed in a series of sales at auction, and [[Brantwood]] itself was bought in 1932 by the educationist and Ruskin enthusiast, collector and memorialist, [[John Howard Whitehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;See James S. Dearden, ''Ruskin, Bembridge and Brantwood: the Growth of the Whitehouse Collection'' (Ryburn, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, it was opened to the public as a permanent memorial to Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brantwood.org.uk/temp.../History%20of%20Brantwood%202pp.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal appearance===
In middle age, and at his prime as a lecturer, Ruskin was described as slim, perhaps a little short,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander MacEwen, who attended Ruskin's lectures at Oxford, reported that the papers described him thus. See David Smith Cairns, ''Life and times of Alexander Robertson MacEwen, D.D'' (Hodder and Stoughton, 1925), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; with an aquiline nose and brilliant, piercing blue eyes. Often sporting a double-breasted waistcoat, a high collar and, when necessary, a frock coat, he also wore his trademark blue neckcloth.&lt;ref&gt;See [[H. W. Nevinson]], ''Changes and Chances'' (James Nisbet, 1923), pp. 53–55 and [[J. A. Spender]], ''Life, Journalism and Politics'' (Cassell &amp; Co., 1927), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1878 he cultivated an increasingly long beard, and took on the appearance of an "Old Testament" prophet.

In 1884, the 17-year-old [[Beatrix Potter]] spotted Ruskin at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] exhibition. She wrote in her journal, "Mr Ruskin was one of the most ridiculous figures I have seen. A very old hat, much necktie and aged coat buttoned up on his neck, humpbacked, not particularly clean looking. He had on high boots, and one of his trousers was tucked up on the top of one. He became aware of this half way round the room, and stood on one leg to put it right, but in doing so hitched up the other trouser worse than the first one had been."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Linder, ed. (1966) ''The Journal of Beatrix Potter''. London: Frederick Warne &amp; Co. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===International===
Ruskin's influence reached across the world. [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] described him as "one of the most remarkable men not only of England and of our generation, but of all countries and times" and quoted extensively from him, rendering his words into Russian.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''Ruskin and Tolstoy'' (Guild of St George, 2010) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] not only admired Ruskin but helped translate his works into French.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia J. Gamble,  ''Proust as Interpreter of Ruskin. The Seven Lamps of Translation'' (Summa Publications, 2002) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] wrote of the "magic spell" cast on him by ''[[Unto This Last]]'' and paraphrased the work in Gujarati, calling it ''[[Sarvodaya]]'', "The Advancement of All".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In Japan, Ryuzo Mikimoto actively collaborated in Ruskin's translation. He commissioned sculptures and sundry commemorative items, and incorporated Ruskinian rose motifs in the jewellery produced by his pearl empire. He established the Ruskin Society of Tokyo and his children built a dedicated library to house his Ruskin collection.&lt;ref&gt;Masami Kimura, "Japanese Interest in Ruskin: Some Historical Trends" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik (eds.), ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 215–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/catalogue-of-the-ryuzo-mikimoto-collection-ruskin-library-tokyo-2004/oclc/56923207 |title=Catalogue of the Ryuzo Mikimoto Collection : Ruskin Library, Tokyo 2004 |website=WorldCat.org |date=1 April 2017 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ruskin Cannery.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cannery operation in the Ruskin Cooperative, 1896]]
A number of [[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialist]] [[Ruskin Colonies]] attempted to put his political ideals into practice. These communities included [[Ruskin, Florida]], [[Ruskin, British Columbia]] and the [[Ruskin Colony|Ruskin Commonwealth Association]], a colony which existed in [[Dickson County, Tennessee]] from 1894 to 1899.

Ruskin's work has been translated into numerous languages including, in addition to those already mentioned (Russian, French, Japanese): German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian, Polish, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Chinese, Welsh and even [[Esperanto]] and [[Gikuyu language|Gikuyu]].

===Art, architecture and literature===
Theorists and practitioners in a broad range of disciplines acknowledged their debt to Ruskin. Architects including [[Le Corbusier]], [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Walter Gropius]] incorporated Ruskin's ideas in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Daniels and Geoff Brandwood (ed.), ''Ruskin and Architecture'' (Spire Books, 2003) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers as diverse as [[Oscar Wilde]], [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Ezra Pound]] felt Ruskin's influence.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Collingwood, Life and Work of John Ruskin (Methuen, 1900) p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The American poet [[Marianne Moore]] was an enthusiastic Ruskin reader. Art historians and critics, among them [[Herbert Read]], [[Roger Fry]] and [[Wilhelm Worringer]] knew Ruskin's work well.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Cianci and Peter Nicholls (eds.)  ''Ruskin and Modernism'' (Palgrave, 2001) and Toni Cerutti (ed.) ''Ruskin and the Twentieth Century: the modernity of Ruskinism'' (Edizioni Mercurio, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Admirers ranged from the British-born American watercolourist and engraver, [[John William Hill]] to the sculptor-designer, printmaker and utopianist, [[Eric Gill]]. Aside from [[E. T. Cook]], Ruskin's editor and biographer, other leading British journalists influenced by Ruskin include [[J. A. Spender]], and the war correspondent, [[H. W. Nevinson]].

===Craft and conservation===
[[William Morris]] and [[C. R. Ashbee]] (the Guild of Handicraft) were keen disciples, and through them Ruskin's legacy can be traced in the [[arts and crafts movement]]. Ruskin's ideas on preservation of open spaces and conservation of historic buildings and places inspired his friends, [[Octavia Hill]] and [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], to help found the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill Download Samuel Jones (ed.), ''The Enduring Relevance of Octavia Hill''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618093500/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill |date=18 June 2012 }} and see specifically, Robert Hewison, "'You are doing some of the work that I ought to do': Octavia Hill and Ruskinian values", pp. 57–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society and education===
Pioneers of [[urban planning|town planning]], such as [[Thomas Coglan Horsfall]] and [[Patrick Geddes]] called Ruskin an inspiration and invoked his ideas in their writings. The same is true for the founders of the [[garden city movement]], [[Ebenezer Howard]] and [[Raymond Unwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Lang ''Designing Utopia: John Ruskin's Urban Vision for Britain and America'' (Black Rose Books Ltd., 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Carpenter]]'s community in Millthorpe, Derbyshire was partly inspired by Ruskin, and John Kenworthy's colony at [[Purleigh]], briefly a refuge for the [[Doukhobor]]s, combined Ruskin's ideas and Tolstoy's.

The most prolific collector of Ruskiniana was [[John Howard Whitehouse]], who saved Ruskin's home, [[Brantwood]], and opened it as a permanent Ruskin memorial. Inspired by Ruskin's educational ideals, Whitehouse established [[Bembridge School]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], and ran it along Ruskinian lines. Educationists from William Jolly to [[Michael Ernest Sadler]] wrote about and appreciated Ruskin's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion of Ruskin and education, see Sara Atwood,  ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruskin College]], an educational establishment in Oxford originally intended for working men, was named after him by its American founders, Walter Vrooman and [[Charles A.

Ruskin's innovative publishing experiment, conducted by his one-time [[Working Men's College]] pupil, George Allen, whose business was eventually merged to become [[Allen &amp; Unwin]], anticipated the establishment of the [[Net Book Agreement]].

Ruskin's Drawing Collection, a collection of 1470 works of art which he gathered as learning aids for the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]] which he founded at Oxford, is still in the possession of the school, now the Ashmolean Museum.

===Politics and economics===
Ruskin was an inspiration for many [[Christian socialism|Christian socialists]], and his ideas informed the work of economists such as [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]] and [[J. A. Hobson]], and the positivist, [[Frederic Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (Tauris, 2007) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin was discussed in university extension classes, and in reading circles and societies formed in his name. He helped to inspire the [[settlement movement]] in Britain and the United States. Resident workers at [[Toynbee Hall]] such as the later civil servants Hubert Llewellyn Smith and [[William Beveridge]] (author of the [[Beveridge Report|Report ... on Social Insurance and Allied Services]]), and the future Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] acknowledged their debt to Ruskin as they helped to found the British [[welfare state]]. More of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]'s earliest members acknowledged his significance than mentioned [[Karl Marx]] or the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: the social and political legacies of a Victorian prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) and Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Oxford University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Ruskin's works have also influenced [[Phillip Blond]] and the [[Red Tory]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Tory intrigues and infuriates|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/30/phillip-blond-red-tory-respublica | work=The Guardian | first=Madeleine|last=Bunting|date=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many streets, buildings, organisations and institutions bear his name. [[The Priory Ruskin Academy]] in Grantham, Lincolnshire, [[Anglia Ruskin University]] in [[Chelmsford]] and [[Cambridge]] traces its origins to the Cambridge School of Art, at the foundation of which Ruskin spoke in 1858. [[John Ruskin College]], South Croydon, is named after him. The Ruskin Literary and Debating Society, (founded in 1900 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), the oldest surviving club of its type, still promoting the development of literary knowledge and public speaking today. The Ruskin Art Club is the oldest ladies club in Los Angeles. In addition, there is the [[Ruskin Pottery]], [[Ruskin House]], Croydon and [[Ruskin Hall]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

[[Ruskin, Florida]], United States—site of one of the short-lived American [[Ruskin Colleges]]—is named for John Ruskin. There is a mural of Ruskin titled, "Head, Heart And Hands" on a building across from the Ruskin Post Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5RcPIY4KU0 |title=Ruskin Community Mural |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, scholarly research has focused on aspects of Ruskin's legacy, including his impact on the sciences; [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] and [[Oliver Lodge]] admired him. Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and [[cultural tourism]] (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with [[Thomas Cook]]);&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Newey and Jeffrey Richards ''John Ruskin and the Victorian Theatre'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist and media theorist, [[David Gauntlett]], argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout [[Web 2.0]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gauntlett]] ''Making Is Connecting: the social meaning of creativity from DIY and knitting to YouTube and Web 2.0'' (Polity, 2011), pp. 25–36, 217–19; specifically on YouTube, see pp. 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, architectural theorist [[Lars Spuybroek]] has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens up a whole new way of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Spuybroek, ''The Sympathy of Things: Ruskin and the Ecology of Design'' (V2_NAI Publishers, 2011), pp. 65–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable modern-day Ruskin enthusiasts include the writers [[Geoffrey Hill]] and [[Charles Tomlinson]], and the politicians, [[Patrick Cormack]], [[Frank Judd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/frank-judd/26799 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012145610/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/frank-judd/26799 |archivedate=12 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]] spoke at the [[Art Workers Guild]] on Ruskin, 6 February 2010.

''There is no wealth but life: Ruskin in the 21st Century'' (Ruskin To-Day, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Glancey]] at ''[[The Guardian]]'' and Andrew Hill at the ''[[Financial Times]]'' have both written about Ruskin,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hill, ''Introduction'' in John Ruskin, ''Unto This Last'' (Pallas Athene, 2010), pp. 9–16.&lt;/ref&gt; as has the broadcaster [[Melvyn Bragg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Melvyn Bragg]], ''Foreword'' in John Ruskin, ''On Genius'' (Hesperus, 2011), pp. vii–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and criticism==

Ruskin wrote over 250 works, initially art criticism and history, but expanding to cover topics ranging over science, geology, ornithology, [[literary criticism]], the environmental effects of pollution, mythology, travel, political economy and social reform. After his death Ruskin's works were collected in the 39-volume "Library Edition", completed in 1912 by his friends [[Edward Tyas Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/hcookwed01.htm |title=Ruskin MP I Notes |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range and quantity of Ruskin's writing, and its complex, allusive and associative method of expression, causes certain difficulties. In 1898, [[John A. Hobson]] observed that in attempting to summarise Ruskin's thought, and by extracting passages from across his work, "the spell of his eloquence is broken".&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Hobson|J. A. Hobson]], ''John Ruskin: Social Reformer'' (J. Nisbet &amp; Co., 1898), p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clive Wilmer]] has written, further, that "the anthologizing of short purple passages, removed from their intended contexts" is "something which Ruskin himself detested and which has bedevilled his reputation from the start".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clive Wilmer]] (ed.), ''Unto This Last and Other Writings'' (Penguin, 1985; and Kindle), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some aspects of Ruskin's theory and criticism require further consideration.

===Art and design criticism===
Ruskin's early work defended the reputation of [[J. M. W. Turner]]. He believed that all great art should communicate an understanding and appreciation of nature. Accordingly, inherited artistic conventions should be rejected. Only by means of direct observation can an artist, through form and colour, represent nature in art. He advised artists in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' I to: "go to Nature in all singleness of heart... rejecting nothing, selecting nothing and scorning nothing."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=3.624}} By the 1850s. Ruskin was celebrating the Pre-Raphaelites whose members, he said, had formed "a new and noble school" of art that would provide a basis for a thoroughgoing reform of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/ruskin-turner-and-pre-raphaelites |title=Ruskin, Turner and The Pre-Raphaelites |website=Tate.org.uk |date=7 January 2000 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ruskin, art should communicate truth above all things. However, this could not be revealed by mere display of skill, and must be an expression of the artist's whole moral outlook. Ruskin rejected the work of [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] because he considered it to epitomise a reductive mechanisation of art.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Ruskin's strong rejection of [[Classicism|Classical tradition]] in ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' typifies the inextricable mix of aesthetics and morality in his thought: "Pagan in its origin, proud and unholy in its revival, paralysed in its old age... an architecture invented, as it seems, to make plagiarists of its architects, slaves of its workmen, and sybarites of its inhabitants; an architecture in which intellect is idle, invention impossible, but in which all luxury is gratified and all insolence fortified."&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin, ''The Stones of Venice'', iii, ch. iv, §35;  Cook and Wedderburn 11.227.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejection of mechanisation and standardisation informed Ruskin's theories of architecture, and his emphasis on the importance of the Medieval Gothic style. He praised the Gothic for what he saw as its reverence for nature and natural forms; the free, unfettered expression of artisans constructing and decorating buildings; and for the organic relationship he perceived between worker and guild, worker and community, worker and natural environment, and between worker and God. Attempts in the 19th century, to reproduce Gothic forms (such as pointed arches), attempts which he had helped to inspire, were not enough to make these buildings expressions of what Ruskin saw as true Gothic feeling, faith, and organicism.

For Ruskin, the Gothic style in architecture embodied the same moral truths he sought to promote in the visual arts. It expressed the 'meaning' of architecture—as a combination of the values of strength, solidity and aspiration—all written, as it were, in stone. For Ruskin, creating true Gothic architecture involved the whole community, and expressed the full range of human emotions, from the [[wikt:sublime|sublime]] effects of soaring spires to the comically ridiculous carved [[grotesque]]s and [[gargoyle]]s. Even its crude and "savage" aspects were proof of "the liberty of every workman who struck the stone; a freedom of thought, and rank in scale of being, such as no laws, no charters, no charities can secure."&lt;ref&gt;John Unrau, Ruskin, the Workman and the Savageness of Gothic, in New Approaches to Ruskin, ed [[Robert Hewison]], 1981, pp. 33–50&lt;/ref&gt; [[Classical architecture]], in contrast, expressed a morally vacuous and repressive standardisation. Ruskin associated Classical values with modern developments, in particular with the demoralising consequences of the [[industrial revolution]], resulting in buildings such as the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], which he criticised.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 12.417–32. Cynthia J. Gamble, "John Ruskin: conflicting responses to Crystal Palace" in Françoise Dassy and Catherine Hajdenko-Marshall (eds.), ''Sociétés et conflit: enjeux et représentation'' (L‟Harmattan et l‟Université de Cergy-Pontoise, 2006), pp. 135–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ruskin wrote about architecture in many works over the course of his career, his much-anthologised essay "The Nature of Gothic" from the second volume of ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' (1853) is widely considered to be one of his most important and evocative discussions of his central argument.

Ruskin's theories indirectly encouraged a revival of Gothic styles, but Ruskin himself was often dissatisfied with the results. He objected that forms of mass-produced ''faux'' Gothic did not exemplify his principles, but showed disregard for the true meaning of the style. Even the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], a building designed with Ruskin's collaboration, met with his disapproval. The [[O'Shea and Whelan|O'Shea brothers]], freehand stone carvers chosen to revive the creative "freedom of thought" of Gothic craftsmen, disappointed him by their lack of reverence for the task.

Ruskin's distaste for oppressive standardisation led to later works attacking ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' capitalism which he considered to be at the root of it. His ideas provided inspiration for the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], the founders of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], the [[National Art Collections Fund]], and the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]].

Ruskin's views on art, wrote [[Kenneth Clark]], "cannot be made to form a [[logical system]], and perhaps owe to this fact a part of their value."  Ruskin's accounts of art are descriptions of a superior type that conjure images vividly in the mind's eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Clark neatly summarises the key features of Ruskin's writing on art and architecture:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Art is not a matter of taste, but involves the whole man. Whether in making or perceiving a work of art, we bring to bear on it feeling, intellect, morals, knowledge, memory, and every other human capacity, all focused in a flash on a single point. Aesthetic man is a concept as false and dehumanising as economic man.
# Even the most superior mind and the most powerful imagination must found itself on facts, which must be recognised for what they are. The imagination will often reshape them in a way which the prosaic mind cannot understand; but this recreation will be based on facts, not on formulas or illusions.
# These facts must be perceived by the senses, or felt; not learnt.
# The greatest artists and schools of art have believed it their duty to impart vital truths, not only about the facts of vision, but about religion and the conduct of life.
# Beauty of form is revealed in organisms which have developed perfectly according to their laws of growth, and so give, in his own words, 'the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function.'
# This fulfilment of function depends on all parts of an organism cohering and co-operating. This was what he called the 'Law of Help,' one of Ruskin's fundamental beliefs, extending from nature and art to society.
# Good art is done with enjoyment. The artist must feel that, within certain reasonable limits, he is free, that he is wanted by society, and that the ideas he is asked to express are true and important.
# Great art is the expression of epochs where people are united by a common faith and a common purpose, accept their laws, believe in their leaders, and take a serious view of human destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clark, "A Note on Ruskin's Writings on Art and Architecture," in idem, ''Ruskin Today'' (John Murray, 1964) (reissued as ''Selected Writings'', Penguin, 1991), pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Historic preservation===
Ruskin's belief in preservation of ancient buildings had a significant influence on later thinking about the distinction between conservation and restoration. Ruskin was a strong proponent of the former, while his contemporary, [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], promoted the latter. In ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]],'' (1849) Ruskin wrote:

{{Quote|text=Neither by the public, nor by those who have the care of public monuments, is the true meaning of the word ''restoration'' understood. It means the most total destruction which a building can suffer: a destruction out of which no remnants can be gathered: a destruction accompanied with false description of the thing destroyed. Do not let us deceive ourselves in this important matter; it is ''impossible'', as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture.|source=&lt;small&gt;''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.242.&lt;/small&gt;}}

This abhorrence of restoration is in marked contrast to Viollet-le-Duc, who wrote that restoration is a "means to reestablish [a building] to a finished state, which may in fact never have actually existed at any given time."&lt;ref&gt;Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. ([1854] 1990). ''The foundations of architecture''. New York: George Braziller. p. 195. (Translated by Kenneth D. Whitehead from the original French.)&lt;/ref&gt;

For Ruskin, the "age" of a building was crucially significant as an aspect in its preservation: "For, indeed, the greatest glory of a building is not in its stones, not in its gold. Its glory is in its Age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of stern watching, of mysterious sympathy, nay, even of approval or condemnation, which we feel in walls that have long been washed by the passing waves of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.233–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social theory===
Ruskin attacked orthodox, 19th-century [[political economy]] principally on the grounds that it failed to acknowledge complexities of human desires and motivations (broadly, "social affections"). He began to express such ideas in ''The Stones of Venice'', and increasingly in works of the later 1850s, such as ''The Political Economy of Art'' (''A Joy For Ever''), but he gave them full expression in the influential essays, ''Unto This Last''.

{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=Nay, but I choose my physician and my clergyman, thus indicating my sense of the quality of their work. By all means, also, choose your bricklayer; that is the proper reward of the good workman, to be "chosen." The natural and right system respecting all labour is, that it should be paid at a fixed rate, but the good workman employed, and the bad workman unemployed. The false, unnatural, and destructive system is when the bad workman is allowed to offer his work at half-price, and either take the place of the good, or force him by his competition to work for an inadequate sum.|source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 17.V.34 (1860).&lt;/small&gt; }}

At the root of his theory, was Ruskin's dissatisfaction with the role and position of the worker, and especially the artisan or craftsman, in modern [[capitalism|industrial capitalist]] society. Ruskin believed that the economic theories of [[Adam Smith]], expressed in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' had led, through the [[division of labour]] to the alienation of the worker not merely from the process of work itself, but from his fellow workmen and other classes, causing increasing resentment. (See section, "Stones of Venice", above.)

He argued that one remedy would be to pay work at a fixed rate of wages, because human need is consistent and a given quantity of work justly demands a certain return. The best workmen would remain in employment because of the quality of their work (a focus on quality growing out of his writings on art and architecture). The best workmen could not, in a fixed-wage economy, be undercut by an inferior worker or product.

In the preface to ''Unto This Last'' (1862), Ruskin recommended that the state should underwrite standards of service and production to guarantee social justice. This included the recommendation of government youth-training schools promoting employment, health, and 'gentleness and justice'; government manufactories and workshops; government schools for the employment at fixed wages of the unemployed, with idlers compelled to toil; and pensions provided for the elderly and the destitute, as a matter of right, received honourably and not in shame.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=17.17–24}} Many of these ideas were later incorporated into the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Jose Harris, "Ruskin and Social Reform" in Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Clarendon Press, 1999), pp. 7–33, specifically p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Turner's erotic drawings===
Until 2005, biographies of both [[J. M. W. Turner]] and Ruskin had claimed that in 1858 Ruskin burned bundles of erotic paintings and drawings by Turner to protect Turner's posthumous reputation. Ruskin's friend [[Ralph Nicholson Wornum]], who was Keeper of the [[National Gallery]], was said to have colluded in the alleged destruction of Turner's works. In 2005, these works, which form part of the Turner Bequest held at [[Tate Britain]], were re-appraised by Turner Curator Ian Warrell, who concluded that Ruskin and Wornum had not destroyed them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1381143,00.html ''The Guardian'' report on the discovery of Turner's drawings.] Also see Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol. IV, no. 1, Spring 2003, pp. 15–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyall |first=Sarah |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E4DB1738F930A25752C0A9639C8B63 |title=A Censorship Story Goes Up in Smoke – No Bonfire Devoured J.M.W. Turner's Erotica  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 January 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===
Ruskin's sexuality has led to much speculation and critical comment. His one marriage, to [[Effie Gray]], was annulled after six years because of non-consummation. Effie, in a letter to her parents, claimed that he found her "person" repugnant.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He alleged various reasons, hatred of children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening 10th April [1848].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin confirmed this in his statement to his lawyer during the annulment proceedings.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cause of Ruskin's "disgust" has led to much speculation. Ruskin's biographer, [[Mary Lutyens]], suggested that he rejected Effie because he was horrified by the sight of her pubic hair. Lutyens argued that Ruskin must have known the female form only through Greek statues and paintings of the nude lacking pubic hair and found the reality shocking.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, M., ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Peter Fuller]] in his book ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' writes, "It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife's pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'', Chatto &amp; Windus, 1988, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also take the view that menstruation is the more likely explanation, though Batchelor also suggests that body-odour may have been the problem. Debate cannot currently resolve this issue; [[William Ewart Gladstone]] said to his daughter, Mary, "should you ever hear anyone blame Millais or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin, remember that there is no fault; there was misfortune, even tragedy. All three were perfectly blameless.".&lt;ref&gt;Q. in J. Howard Whitehouse, Vindication of Ruskin (George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1950), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin's later relationship with [[Rose La Touche]] has led to claims that he was a [[paedophile]], on the grounds that he stated that he fell in love with her when he met her at the age of nine.&lt;ref&gt;Current evidence suggests that she was ten when they met, but Ruskin states in his autobiography that she was only nine. Hewison, R, John Ruskin, ''The Argument of the Eye'', p.160; [http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,132930,00.html#article_continue The Guardian, review of Batchelor, J., John Ruskin: ''No Wealth but Life'', 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he did not approach her as a suitor until on or near her eighteenth birthday. She asked him to wait for her until she was 21. Receiving no answer, he repeated his proposal. Ruskin is not known to have had any sexually intimate relationships. During an episode of mental derangement after Rose died, he wrote a letter in which he insisted that Rose's spirit had instructed him to marry a girl who was visiting him at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, T. ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'', p. 553, "absolutely under her [Rose's] orders I have asked Tenny Watson to marry me and come abroad with her father."&lt;/ref&gt; It is also true that in letters from Ruskin to [[Kate Greenaway]] he asked her to draw her "girlies" (as he called her child figures) without clothing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Will you – (it's all for your own good – !) make her stand up and then draw her for me without a cap – and, without her shoes, – (because of the heels) and without her mittens, and without her – frock and frills?  And let me see exactly how tall she is – and – how – round. It will be so good of and for you – And to and for me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lurie |first=Alison |authorlink=Alison Lurie |title=Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: The Subversive Power of Children's Literature |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3WROewAACAAJ |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]] |date=20 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a letter to his physician John Simon on 15 May 1886, Ruskin wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I like my girls from ten to sixteen—allowing of 17 or 18 as long as they're not in love with anybody but me.—I've got some darlings of 8—12—14—just now, and my Pigwiggina here—12—who fetches my wood and is learning to play my bells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3362/is_4_86/ai_n31641126/ ]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Philological Quarterly'', Fall, 2007 by Van Akin Burd&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pigwiggina is a nickname Ruskin used for the girl as she looked after (lambs and) piglets; c.f. {{cite book |title=Letters to M. G. and H. G. |url=https://archive.org/stream/letterstomgandhg00rusk/letterstomgandhg00rusk_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin's biographers disagree about the allegation of "paedophilia". Tim Hilton, in his two-volume biography, boldly asserts that Ruskin "was a paedophile" but leaves the claim unexplained, while John Batchelor argues that the term is inappropriate because Ruskin's behaviour does not "fit the profile".&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, T., ''John Ruskin: A Life'', vol. 1, pp. 253–54; Batchelor, J, ''John Ruskin: No Wealth but Life'', p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Abse concluded that "the older girls became, the more their attractions diminished in his eyes. He liked them best, as he was to tell his friend Lady Naesmith two years later, when they were 'just in the very rose of dawn'".&lt;ref&gt;Joan Abse, ''John Ruskin – The Passionate Moralist'', Quarter Books, London, 1980, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Others also point to a definite pattern of "[[Nympholepsy|nympholeptic]]" behaviour with regard to his interactions with girls at a [[Winnington Hall|Winnington school]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Kemp and Jan Van Heurck, ''The Desire of My Eyes: The Life &amp; Work of John Ruskin '', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that Ruskin ever engaged in any sexual activity with anyone. According to one interpretation, what Ruskin valued most in pre-pubescent girls was (supposedly in common with his contemporary, [[Lewis Carroll]]) their innocence; the fact that they were not (yet) fully developed sexual beings is what attracted him.&lt;ref&gt;''John Ruskin. The Last Visionary'', tx. 13 March 2000 (BBC1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law of business balance===
Ruskin is frequently identified as the originator of the "[[common law of business balance]]"—a statement about the relationships of price and quality as they pertain to manufactured goods, and often summarised as:  "The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot." This is the core of a longer statement usually attributed to Ruskin, although Ruskin's authorship is disputed among Ruskin scholars. Shapiro maintains that the statement does not appear anywhere in Ruskin's works,&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Fred R. Shapiro]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ck6bXqt5shkC&amp;pg=PA657 |title=The Yale Book of Quotations|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=657 |isbn=9780300107982 |accessdate = 7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Landow is likewise sceptical of the claim of Ruskin's authorship.&lt;ref name=Landow2007&gt;{{cite web |last=Landow |first=George P. |title=A Ruskin Quotation? |publisher=VictorianWeb.org |date=27 July 2007 |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/quotation.html |accessdate=7 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a posting of the ''Ruskin Library News'', a blog associated with the [[Ruskin Library]] (a major collection of Ruskiniana located at [[Lancaster University]]), an anonymous library staff member briefly mentions the statement and its widespread use, saying that, "This is one of many quotations ascribed to Ruskin, without there being any trace of them in his writings – although someone, somewhere, thought they sounded like Ruskin."&lt;ref name="Ruskin Library"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruskinlibrary.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/on-the-present-economic-situation/|title=On the present economic situation:|last=Ruskin Library|publisher=Ruskin Library|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruskin Library"/&gt; The signs listed Ruskin as the author of the statement, but the signs gave no information on where or when Ruskin was supposed to have written, spoken, or published the statement. Due to the statement's widespread use as a promotional slogan, and despite questions of Ruskin's authorship, it is likely that many people who are otherwise unfamiliar with Ruskin now associate him with this statement.

==Definitions==
[[File:John Ruskin 1850s 2.jpg|thumb|upright|John Ruskin in the 1850s, photo from the [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]].]]
* [[Pathetic fallacy]]: Ruskin coined this term in ''Modern Painters'' III (1856) to describe the ascription of human emotions to inanimate objects and impersonal natural forces, as in "Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy" (Charlotte Brontë, ''Jane Eyre'').&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Painter''s III (see Part VI, "Of Many Things", c. XII, "Of the Paethetic Fallacy") see ''Works'' 5.201–220.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fors Clavigera]]: Ruskin gave this title to a series of letters he wrote "to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" (1871–84). The name was intended to signify three great powers which go to fashion human destiny, as Ruskin explained at length in Letter 2 (February 1871). These were: ''Force'', symbolised by the club (''clava'') of [[Hercules]]; ''For''titude, symbolised by the key (''clavis'') of Ulysses; and ''For''tune, symbolised by the nail (''clavus'') of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. These three powers (the "fors") together represent human talents and abilities to choose the right moment and then to strike with energy. The concept is derived from [[Shakespeare]]'s phrase "There is a tide in the affairs of men/ Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune" (Brutus in ''Julius Caesar''). Ruskin believed that the letters were inspired by the Third Fors: striking out at the right moment.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Works'' 27.27–44 and 28.106–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full and concise introduction to the work, see Dinah Birch, "Introduction", in John Ruskin, ''Fors Clavigera'', ed. Dinah Birch (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), pp. xxxiii–xlix.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theoria: Ruskin's 'theoretic' faculty – theoretic, as opposed to aesthetic – enables a vision of the beautiful as intimating a reality deeper than the everyday, at least in terms of the kind of transcendence generally seen as immanent in things of this world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2011/04/ruskin-crown/ |title=The Fortnightly Review › Ruskin and the distinction between Aesthesis and Theoria |website=Fortnightlyreview.co.uk |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an example of the influence of Ruskin's concept of theoria, see [[Peter Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' (Chatto and Windus, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modern Atheism: Ruskin applied this label to ''the unfortunate persistence of the clergy in teaching children what they cannot understand, and in employing young consecrate persons to assert in pulpits what they do not know.''
* [[Illth]]: Used by Ruskin as the antithesis of wealth, which he defined as life itself; broadly, where wealth is 'well-being', illth is "ill-being".
* Excrescence: Ruskin defined an "excrescence" as an outgrowth of the main body of a building that does not harmonise well with the main body. He originally used the term to describe certain [[gothic revival]] features&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 210}}&lt;/ref&gt; also for later additions to cathedrals and various other public buildings, especially from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Journal of Biblical Literature''''' ('''''JBL''''') is one of three [[academic journals]] published by the [[Society of Biblical Literature]] (SBL).
First published in 1881, ''JBL'' is the flagship journal of the field. ''JBL'' is published quarterly and includes scholarly articles, critical notes, and book reviews by members of the Society. 
''JBL'' is available on line as well as in print:

''JBL'' has a moving window of Open Access. Aside from the current issue, the past three years of ''JBL'' are freely available to the public in PDF form, after registering on the SBL website. Previous issues, back to 1881, are available in the JSTOR Arts and Sciences III collection."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Kinbar, [http://sblonline.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=580 'Open Access and the SBL',] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014152635/http://www.sblonline.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=580 |date=2006-10-14 }} ''[[SBL Forum]]'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The journal was originally published under the title ''Journal of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis''. The current name was adopted with volume 9 (1890).

At the fourth meeting, on 29 December 1881, the SBL council voted to print 500 copies of a journal, including the full text of papers read at the society's annual June meetings.&lt;ref&gt;
''JBL'' '''50''' (1931): xxiv-xlix.&lt;/ref&gt;

''JBL'' was, at first, an annual serial, from 1882 to 1905 (though two serials appeared in each of 1886 and 1887). ''JBL'' became semiannual from 1906 to 1911, and has been quarterly since 1912 (with a hiatus in 1915 and exceptional years with only two serials).&lt;ref name="Scriptures" /&gt;

In 1916, the SBL secretary passed on to the members a communication, from the Third Assistant Postmaster General of the United States, refusing to give the ''JBL'' the second-class rate discount for scholarly journals, "on the ground that it was not scientific."&lt;ref name=Scriptures&gt;Saunders, Ernest W., 'Journal', in chapter 8, [http://www.sbl-site.org/SSchapter8.aspx 'Of the Making of Books'], of ''Searching the Scriptures: A History of the Society of Biblical Literature, 1880-1980'', (Chico: Scholars' Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Journal of the Society for Biblical Literature in the United States was published in Leipzig through World War I down to the Nazi period—yet for the most part this feature showed up only when it became a problem for delivery after Germany began to be devastated after 1916."&lt;ref&gt;
Martin E. Marty, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3260316 Review of ''Searching the Scriptures'',] ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' '''103''' (1984): 85-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Sharpe (scholar)|Samuel Sharpe]], an English [[Minister (Christianity)|ordained minister]] and [[Egyptology|egyptologist]] was editor of a journal also called ''Journal of Bibilical Literature'', published from London prior to the establishment of SBL and its journal.

'''Learning about Forests''' (LEAF) is one of the five programs run by the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]] (FEE), a [[non-governmental organization]] located in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. LEAF aims to encourage school classes and teachers to use [[forests]] for educational activities. The ''vision'' is to see an increased level of awareness and knowledge the key role the forest plays on our planet. The program's ''mission'' is to spread [[environmental education]] concerning forests and all their values among school children all around the world.

==Member organizations==
In August 2013, LEAF was composed of twenty-one organizations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEAF Member Organi[z]ations|url=http://www.leaf-international.org/Side.cfm?ID_kanal=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18368">A '''mental representation''' (or '''cognitive representation'''), in [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]], is a hypothetical internal cognitive [[symbol]] that represents external reality,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://philpapers.org/archive/MORRGM.pdf|title = Representations Gone Mental|last = Morgan|first = Alex|date = 2014|journal = Synthese |volume=191 |issue=2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 213–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; or else a [[mental process]] that makes use of such a symbol:  "a formal system for making explicit certain entities or types of information, together with a specification of how the system does this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marr|first=David|year=2010|isbn=978-0262514620|title=Vision. A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental representation is the mental imagery of things that are not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mckellar|first1=Peter|title=Imagination and thinking: A psychological analysis|date=1957|publisher=Oxford, England|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1958-00258-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], specifically in fields of [[metaphysics]] such as [[philosophy of mind]] and [[ontology]], a mental representation is one of the prevailing ways of [[explanation|explaining]] and [[description|describing]] the nature of [[idea]]s and [[concept]]s.

Mental representations (or mental imagery) enable representing things that have never been experienced as well as things that do not exist.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009"&gt;{{cite book|author = Robert J. Sternberg|url = https://books.google.com/?id=la6mSK9vyIgC|title = Cognitive Psychology|year = 2009|isbn = 9780495506294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Think of yourself traveling to a place you have never visited before, or having a third arm. These things have either never happened or are impossible and do not exist, yet our brain and mental imagery allows us to imagine them. Although visual imagery is more likely to be recalled, mental imagery may involve representations in any of the sensory modalities, such as hearing, smell, or taste. [[Stephen Kosslyn]] proposes that images are used to help solve certain types of problems. We are able to visualize the objects in question and mentally represent the images to solve it.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009" /&gt;

Mental representations also allow people to experience things right in front of them—though the process of how the brain interprets the [[Mental content|representational content]] is debated.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Representational theories of mind ==

[[Representationalism]] (also known as [[Direct and indirect realism|indirect realism]]) is the view that representations are the main way we access external reality. Another major prevailing [[philosophical theory]] posits that concepts are entirely [[abstract object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ontology of Concepts—Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?|url=http://philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/papers/OntologyofConcepts.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Margolis|first1=Eric|last2=Laurence|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen Laurence|journal=Noûs|volume=41|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=561–593|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representational theory of mind attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[idea]]s, [[concept]]s and other [[mental content]] in [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]] and [[experimental psychology]]. In contrast to theories of naive or [[direct realism]], the representational theory of mind postulates the actual existence of mental representations which act as intermediaries between the [[observation|observing]] subject and the [[object (philosophy)|objects]], processes or other entities observed in the external world. These intermediaries stand for or represent to the mind the objects of that world.

For example, when someone arrives at the belief that his or her floor needs sweeping, the representational theory of mind states that he or she forms a mental representation that represents the floor and its state of cleanliness.

The original or "classical" representational theory probably can be traced back to [[Thomas Hobbes]] and was a dominant theme in classical [[empiricism]] in general. According to this version of the theory, the mental representations were images (often called "ideas") of the objects or states of affairs represented. For modern adherents, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and many others, the representational system consists rather of an internal [[Language of thought hypothesis|language of thought]] (i.e., mentalese). The contents of thoughts are represented in symbolic structures (the formulas of Mentalese) which, analogously to natural languages but on a much more abstract level, possess a [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] very much like those of natural languages. For the Spanish logician and cognitive scientist Luis M. Augusto, at this abstract, formal level, the syntax of thought is the set of symbol rules (i.e., operations, processes, etc. on and with symbol structures) and the semantics of thought is the set of symbol structures (concepts and propositions). Content (i.e., thought) emerges from the meaningful co-occurrence of both sets of symbols. For instance, "8 x 9" is a meaningful co-occurrence, whereas "CAT x §" is not; "x" is a symbol rule called for by symbol structures such as "8" and "9", but not by "CAT" and "§".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Unconscious representations 2: Towards an integrated cognitive architecture.|last = Augusto|first = Luis M.|date = 2014|journal = Axiomathes |volume=24|pages=19–43|doi = 10.1007/s10516-012-9207-y|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strong vs weak, restricted vs unrestricted ===
There are two types of representationalism, strong and weak. Strong representationalism attempts to reduce phenomenal character to intentional content. On the other hand, weak representationalism claims only that phenomenal character supervenes on intentional content. Strong representationalism aims to provide a theory about the nature of phenomenal character, and offers a solution to the hard problem of consciousness. In contrast to this, weak representationalism does not aim to provide a theory of consciousness, nor does it offer a solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

Strong representationalism can be further broken down into restricted and unrestricted versions. The restricted version deals only with certain kinds of phenomenal states e.g. visual perception. Most representationalists endorse an unrestricted version of representationalism. According to the unrestricted version, for any state with phenomenal character that state’s phenomenal character reduces to its intentional content. Only this unrestricted version of representationalism is able to provide a general theory about the nature of phenomenal character, as well as offer a potential solution to the hard problem of consciousness. The successful reduction of the phenomenal character of a state to its intentional content would provide a solution to the hard problem of consciousness once a physicalist account of intentionality is worked out.

=== Problems for the unrestricted version ===
When arguing against the unrestricted version of representationalism people will often bring up phenomenal mental states that appear to lack intentional content. The unrestricted version seeks to account for all phenomenal states. Thus, for it to be true, all states with phenomenal character must have intentional content to which that character is reduced. Phenomenal states without intentional content therefore serve as a counterexample to the unrestricted version. If the state has no intentional content its phenomenal character will not be reducible to that state’s intentional content, for it has none to begin with.

A common example of this kind of state are moods. Moods are states with phenomenal character that are generally thought to not be directed at anything in particular. Moods are thought to lack directedness, unlike emotions, which are typically thought to be directed at particular things e.g. you are mad ''at'' your sibling, you are afraid ''of'' a dangerous animal. People conclude that because moods are undirected they are also nonintentional i.e. they lack intentionality or aboutness. Because they are not directed at anything they are not about anything. Because they lack intentionality they will lack any intentional content. Lacking intentional content their phenomenal character will not be reducible to intentional content, refuting the representational doctrine.

Though emotions are typically considered as having directedness and intentionality this idea has also been called into question. One might point to emotions a person all of a sudden experiences that do not appear to be directed at or about anything in particular. Emotions elicited by listening to music are another potential example of undirected, nonintentional emotions. Emotions aroused in this way do not seem to necessarily be about anything, including the music that arouses them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kind|first = Amy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses&lt;!--'Directedness' redirects here--&gt; ===
In response to this objection a proponent of representationalism might reject the undirected nonintentionality of moods, and attempt to identify some intentional content they might plausibly be thought to possess. The proponent of representationalism might also reject the narrow conception of intentionality as being directed at a particular thing, arguing instead for a broader kind of intentionality.

There are three alternative kinds of '''directedness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;/[[intentionality]] one might posit for moods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Outward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content.
* Inward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
* Hybrid directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have both a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content and a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
In the case of outward directedness moods might be directed at either the world as a whole, a changing series of objects in the world, or unbound emotion properties projected by people onto things in the world. In the case of inward directedness moods are directed at the overall state of a person’s body. In the case of hybrid directedness moods are directed at some combination of inward and outward things.

=== Further objections ===
Even if one can identify some possible intentional content for moods we might still question whether that content is able to sufficiently capture the phenomenal character of the mood states they are a part of. Amy Kind contends that in the case of all the previously mentioned kinds of directedness (outward, inward, and hybrid) the intentional content supplied to the mood state is not capable of sufficiently capturing the phenomenal aspects of the mood states.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the case of inward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood does not seem tied to the state of one’s body, and even if one’s mood is reflected by the overall state of one’s body that person will not necessarily be aware of it, demonstrating the insufficiency of the intentional content to adequately capture the phenomenal aspects of the mood. In the case of outward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood and its intentional content do not seem to share the corresponding relation they should given that the phenomenal character is supposed to reduce to the intentional content. Hybrid directedness, if it can even get off the ground, faces the same objection.

== Philosophers ==
There is a wide debate on what kinds of representations exist. There are several philosophers who bring about different aspects of the debate. Such philosophers include Alex Morgan, Gualtiero Piccinini, and Uriah Kriegel—though this is not an exhaustive list.

=== Alex Morgan ===

There are "job description" representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is representations that (1) represent something—have [[intentionality]], (2) have a special relation—the represented object does not need to exist, and (3) content plays a causal role in what gets represented:  e.g. saying "hello" to a friend, giving a glare to an enemy.

Structural representations are also important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations are basically mental maps that we have in our minds that correspond exactly to those objects in the world (the intentional content). According to Morgan, structural representations are not the same as mental representations—there is nothing mental about them:  plants can have structural representations.

There are also internal representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations include those that involve future decisions, episodic memories, or any type of projection into the future.

=== Gualtiero Piccinini ===

In [[Gualtiero Piccinini]]'s forthcoming work, he discusses topics on natural and nonnatural mental representations. He relies on the natural definition of mental representations given by Grice (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Meaning|last = Grice|first = H.P.|date = 1957|journal = Philosophical Review |volume=66|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''P entails that P''. e.g. Those spots mean measles, entails that the patient has measles. Then there are nonnatural representations:  ''P does not entail P''. e.g. The 3 rings on the bell of a bus mean the bus is full—the rings on the bell are independent of the fullness of the bus—we could have assigned something else (just as arbitrary) to signify that the bus is full.

=== Uriah Kriegel ===

There are also objective and subjective mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kriegel|first = Uriah|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 161–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective representations are closest to tracking theories—where the brain simply tracks what is in the environment. If there is a blue bird outside my window, the objective representation is that of the blue bird. Subjective representations can vary person-to-person. For example, if I am colorblind, that blue bird outside my window will not ''appear'' blue to me since I cannot represent the blueness of blue (i.e. I cannot see the color blue). The relationship between these two types of representation can vary.

&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective varies, but the subjective does not:  e.g. brain-in-a-vat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective varies, but the objective does not:  e.g. color-inverted world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in objective and none in the subjective:  e.g. thermometer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in subjective and none in the objective:  e.g. an agent that experiences in a void.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Eliminativists think that subjective representations don't exist. Reductivists think subjective representations are reducible to objective. Non-reductivists think that subjective representations are real and distinct.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Fungi have been proven to be a very cheap, effective and environmentally sound way for helping to remove a wide array of toxins from damaged environments or [[wastewater]].

Mycoremediation is one of the cheaper solutions to remediation, and it doesn't usually require expensive equipment. For this reasons it is often used also in small scale applications, such as [[mycofiltration]] of domestic [[wastewater]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molla|first1=Abul Hossain|last2=Fakhru'l-Razi|first2=Ahmadun|title=Mycoremediation--a prospective environmental friendly technique of bioseparation and dewatering of domestic wastewater sludge|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research International|date=2012|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1612–1619|doi=10.1007/s11356-011-0676-0|language=en|issn=1614-7499|quote=Within 2-3 days of treatment application, encouraging results were achieved in total dry solids (TDS), total suspended solid (TSS), turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), specific resistance to filtration (SRF), and pH due to fungal treatment in recognition of bioseparation and dewaterability of wastewater sludge compared to control.|pmid=22134862}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to help with the decomposition process of a [[compost toilet]].

=== Metals ===
Pollution from metals is very common, as they are used in many industrial processes such as [[electroplating]], [[paint]] and [[leather]]. The wastewater from these industries is often used for agricultural purposes, so besides the immediate damage to the ecosystem it is spilled into, the metals can enter far away creatures and humans through the food chain. Mycoremediation is one of the cheapest, most effective and environmental-friendly solutions to this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshi|first1=P.

Many fungi are [[hyperaccumulators]], that means they are able to concentrate toxins in their fruiting bodies for later removal. This is usually true for [[populations]] that have been exposed to contaminants for long time, and have developed a high tolerance, and happens via [[biosorption]] on the cellular surface, which means that the metals enter the mycelium in a passive way with very little intracellular uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gazem|first1=MufedaA.H.|last2=Nazareth|first2=Sarita|title=Sorption of lead and copper from an aqueous phase system by marine-derived Aspergillus species|journal=Annals of Microbiology|date=1 June 2013|volume=63|issue=2|pages=503–511|doi=10.1007/s13213-012-0495-7|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13213-012-0495-7|accessdate=25 September 2017|language=English|issn=1590-4261|quote=The sequestration of the metal occurred mainly by sorption to the cell-surface with very little intracellular uptake.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all the individuals of a species are effective in the same way in the accumulation of toxins. The single individuals are usually selected from an old-time polluted environment, such as [[sludge]] or wastewater, where they had time to adapt to the circumstances, and the selection is carried on in the laboratory.

The capacity of certain fungi to extract metals from the ground also can be useful for [[bioindicator]] purposes, and can be a problem when the mushroom is an edible one. For example, the shaggy ink cap (''[[Coprinus comatus]]''), a common edible north-hemisphere mushroom, can be a very good bioindicator of mercury, and accumulate it in its body, which can also be toxic to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Falandysz|first1=Jerzy|title=Mercury bio-extraction by fungus Coprinus comatus: a possible bioindicator and mycoremediator of polluted soils?|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research International|date=2016|volume=23|issue=8|pages=7444–7451|doi=10.1007/s11356-015-5971-8|language=en|issn=1614-7499|quote=Eating them when foraged from the urban places can provide to a consumer Hg at relatively high dose, while unresolved question is absorption rate of Hg compounds contained in ingested mushroom meal.|pmid=26705753|pmc=4846694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capacity of metals uptake of mushroom has also been used to recover precious metals from medium.

===Organic pollutants===
Fungi are amongst the primary [[saprotrophic]] organisms in an [[ecosystem]], as they are efficient in the [[decomposition]] of matter.
[[Wood-decay fungus|Wood-decay fungi]], especially [[Wood-decay fungus#White rot|white rot]], secretes [[Fungal extracellular enzyme activity|extracellular enzymes]] and [[acid]]s that break down [[lignin]] and [[cellulose]], the two main building blocks of plant fiber.

=== Dyes ===

[[Dye]]s are used in many industries, like paper printing or textile. They are often recalcitant to degradation and in some cases, like some [[azo dyes]], [[cancerogenic]] or otherwise toxic.

The mechanism the fungi degrade this dyes is their lignolytic enzymes, especially laccase, so white rot mushrooms are the most commonly used.

Mycoremediation has proven to be a cheap and effective remediation technology for dyes such as [[malachite green]], [[nigrosin]] and [[basic fuchsin]] with ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' and ''[[Phanerochaete chrysosporium]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rani|first1=Babita|last2=Kumar|first2=Vivek|last3=Singh|first3=Jagvijay|last4=Bisht|first4=Sandeep|last5=Teotia|first5=Priyanku|last6=Sharma|first6=Shivesh|last7=Kela|first7=Ritu|title=Bioremediation of dyes by fungi isolated from contaminated dye effluent sites for bio-usability|journal=Brazilian Journal of Microbiology|date=9 October 2014|volume=45|issue=3|pages=1055–1063|language=en|issn=1517-8382|quote=Aspergillus niger recorded maximum decolorization of the dye Basic fuchsin (81.85%) followed by Nigrosin (77.47%), Malachite green (72.77%) and dye mixture (33.08%) under shaking condition.

== Synergy with phytoremediation ==

[[Phytoremediation]] is the use of plant-based technologies to decontamination an area. Most of the plants can form a symbiosis with fungi, from which both the organisms get an advantage. This relationship is called [[mycorrhiza]].

Mycorrhizal fungi, especially [[arbuscular mycorrhiza|arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi]] (AMF), can greatly improve the phytoremediation capacity of some plants. This is mostly because the stress the plants suffer because of the pollutants is greatly reduced in presence of AMF, so they can grow more and produce more biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabie|first1=Gamal H.|title=Role of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in Phytoremediation of Soil Rhizosphere Spiked with Poly Aromatic Hydrocarbons|journal=Mycobiology|date=2005|volume=33|issue=1|pages=41–50|doi=10.4489/MYCO.2005.33.1.041|language=en|issn=1229-8093|quote=As consequence of the treatment with Am [Arbuscolar mycorrhize], the plants provide a greater sink for the contaminants since they are better able to survive and grow.|pmc=3774856|pmid=24049473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fungi also provide more nutrition, especially [[phosphorus]], and promotes the overall health of the plant. The mycelium quick expansion also can greatly extend the rhizosphere influenze zone ([[hyphosphere]]), providing the plant with access to more nutrients and contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rajtor|first1=Monika|last2=Piotrowska-Seget|first2=Zofia|title=Prospects for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to assist in phytoremediation of soil hydrocarbon contaminants|journal=Chemosphere|date=2016|volume=162|pages=105–116|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.071|issn=1879-1298|quote=AMF have been considered to be a tool to enhance phytoremediation, as their mycelium create a widespread underground network that acts as a bridge between plant roots, soil and rhizosphere microorganisms. Abundant extramatrical hyphae extend the rhizosphere thus creating the hyphosphere, which significantly increases the area of a plant's access to nutrients and contaminants.|pmid=27487095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the rhizosphere overall health also means a rise in the bacteria population, which can also contribute to the bioremediation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabie|first1=Gamal H.|title=Role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in phytoremediation of soil rhizosphere spiked with poly aromatic hydrocarbons|journal=Mycobiology|date=2005|volume=33|issue=1|pages=41–50|doi=10.4489/MYCO.2005.33.1.041|issn=1229-8093|quote=Highly significant positive correlations were shown between of arbuscular formation in root segments (A)) and plant water content, root lipids, peroxidase, catalase polyphenol oxidase and total microbial count in soil rhizosphere as well as PAH dissipation in spiked soil.|pmid=24049473|pmc=3774856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ecosystems and geological structures.

Heritage is that which is ''inherited'' from past generations, maintained in the present, and bestowed to future generations.&lt;ref&gt; Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; The term "natural heritage", derived from "natural inheritance", pre-dates the term "[[biodiversity]]." It is a less scientific term and more easily comprehended in some ways by the wider audience interested in [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]]. 

The term was used in this context in the United States when [[Jimmy Carter]] set up the Georgia Heritage Trust &lt;ref&gt;http://maps.csc.noaa.gov/RoisDatabaseEntry/lawDetails.jsp?lawID=107{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The creation of the Heritage Trust Commission, Georgia Heritage Trust Act, Official Code of Georgia (O.C.G.A.)

 By James F. Cook, {{ISBN|0-86554-954-0}}, 2005 Mercer University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that Carter picked the term up from [[Lyndon Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-11-lady-bird-obit_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Lady Bird Johnson dies at 94 | first=Kathy | last=Kiely | date=2009-01-22 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used it in a 1966 Message to [[United States Congress|Congress]].  (He may have gotten the term from his wife [[Lady Bird Johnson]] who was personally interested in conservation.)  President Johnson signed the [[Wilderness Act|Wilderness Act of 1964]]. 

The term "Natural Heritage" was picked up by the Science Division of [[The Nature Conservancy]] (TNC) when, under Robert E. Jenkins, Jr., it launched in 1974 what ultimately became the network of state natural heritage programs -- one in each state, all using the same [[methodology]] and all supported permanently by state governments because they scientifically document conservation priorities and facilitate science-based environmental reviews. When this network was extended outside the United States, the term "Conservation Data Center (or Centre)" was suggested by Guillermo Mann and came to be preferred for programs outside the US{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}.  Despite the name difference, these programs, too, use the same core methodology as the 50 state natural heritage programs. In 1994 The network of natural heritage programs formed a membership association to work together on projects of common interest: the Association for Biodiversity Information (ABI). In 1999, Through an agreement with The Nature Conservancy, ABI expanded and assumed responsibility for the scientific databases, information, and tools developed by TNC in support of the network of natural heritage programs. In 2001, ABI changed its name to [[NatureServe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureserve.org/about-us/our-history NatureServe History], The history of the Virginia-based conservation non-profit NatureServe.&lt;/ref&gt; NatureServe continues to serve as the hub of the NatureServe Network, a collaboration of 86 governmental and non-governmental programs including natural heritage programs and conservation data centers located in the United States, Canada, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureserve.org/natureserve-network About the NatureServe Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==

An important site of natural heritage or [[cultural heritage]] can be listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by the [[World Heritage Committee]] of [[UNESCO]].  The UNESCO programme, catalogues, names, and conserves sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humanity.  As of March 2012, there are 936 World Heritage Sites: 725 cultural, 183 natural, and 28 mixed properties, in 153 countries.

The 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention established that biological resources, such as plants, were the [[common heritage of mankind]] or as was expressed in the preamble: "need to be preserved as part of the world heritage of mankind as a whole.". These rules probably inspired the creation of great public banks of genetic resources, located outside the source-countries.

New global agreements (e.g., the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]), now give sovereign national rights over biological resources (not property). The idea of static  conservation of biodiversity is disappearing and being replaced by the idea of dynamic conservation, through the notion of resource and  innovation.

The new agreements commit countries to conserve biodiversity, develop resources for sustainability and share the benefits resulting from their use. Under new rules, it is expected  that [[bioprospecting]] or collection of natural products has to be allowed by  the biodiversity-rich country, in exchange for a share of the  benefits.

In 2005, the [[World Heritage Marine Programme]] was established to protect marine areas with Outstanding Universal Values.

{{Humanism}}
'''Neohumanism''' is a [[Holism|holistic]] [[philosophical theory]] proposed by [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]] to promote [[individual]] and [[collective]] progress. In this philosophy [[universalism]] plays a central role. It claims to elevate humanism to level of universalism.&lt;ref name=dis1&gt;''When the underlying spirit of humanism is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this universe – I have designated this as "neohumanism". This neohumanism will elevate humanism to universalism, the cult of love for all created beings of this universe.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Devotional Sentiment and Neohumanism (Discourse 1)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It claims not to have any grouping intention.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==History==
Sarkar detailed Neohumanism in his 1982 book ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''.{{r|dis1}}

In 1987, Sarkar published ''Neohumanism in a Nutshell'' (parts 1 and 2). They contain more discourses on Neohumanism, from various times that he discussed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=33&amp;mode=addtocart|title=Neo- Humanism in a Nutshell - 1|publisher=Ananda Marga|accessdate=15 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093145/http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=33&amp;mode=addtocart|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=34|title=Neo- Humanism in a Nutshell - 2|publisher=Ananda Marga|accessdate=15 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101630/http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=34|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Neohumanism has three stages of development.&lt;ref name="Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan 1982"&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Neohumanism Is the Ultimate Shelter (Discourse 11)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first stage of Neohumanism is spiritual practice to enhance the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of the practitioner. The stage of spiritual practice indirectly benefits society through the social service that is part of spiritual practice.
* The second stage of Neohumanism is spiritual principle (or essence). Its impact is mainly in the mental and spiritual realms, both individual and collective. According to Neohumanism, practice of [[#Rationality|rationality]] and adherence to the [[#Social equality|principle of social equality]] (especially when combined with [[#Protopsychospirituality|protospiritualistic mentality]]) will not only strengthen individual minds but also the collective human mind to the point that humanity as a whole can withstand the destructive impact of [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiment]] and the ruthless exploiters who capitalize on those sentiments.
* {{anchor|stage3}}The third and final stage of Neohumanism is spiritual mission. According to Neohumanism, when an individual's existential nucleus (soul) merges with the "Cosmic Existential Nucleus", she/he attains the consummation of her/his existence. Neohumanism asserts that this supreme status ensures the future of not only the human world but also of the animal and plant worlds as well.

== Concepts ==
List of Neohumanism's key concepts in alphabetical order.

=== Devotion ===
According to neohumanism, love for the Supreme (devotion) is the highest and most valuable treasure of humanity. It automatically results in [[#Universalism|universalism]]. However, neohumanism deems devotion to be a very tender inner asset, frequently assailed by materialism and other onslaughts from the external world. To preserve this treasure, Sarkar submits neohumanism as a practical philosophy that provides a protective fence for devotion by (1) establishing harmony between the spiritual and material worlds (2) providing perennial inspiration for the onward march of society.{{r|dis1}}

=== Dogma ===
Neohumanism defines [[dogma]] as a mental prison. In other words, a dogma is any concept (belief) that one is expected to accept without question. Neohumanism perceives such conduct as fundamentally contrary to [[#Humanity|human nature]], which includes a constant quest for mental expansion. Hence, the position of neohumanism on dogma is that all dogma must be eradicated.&lt;ref name=dis2&gt;''The snares of dogma will have to be shattered to pieces; the iron prison gates of dogma will have to be crushed to dust.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Bondages and Solutions (Discourse 2)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exploitation ===
Neohumanism discourages both [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiment]], because both tend to be injurious to society. However, neohumanism observes that, of the two, sociosentiment is more pernicious. Under the influence of sociosentiment, one group of people are driven to exploit a second group of people, that second group of people are driven to exploit a third group of people, and so on.&lt;ref name=dis7&gt;''Now, in sociosentiment, it happens that a certain group exploits another, and that exploited group in turn exploits a third.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Neohumanism, there are many types of exploitation, but exploitation always tends to come down to the economic plane. Economic exploitation manifests itself in two forms:
* '''Politico-economic exploitation''' occurs when an [[Imperialism|imperialist]] nation or group engages in economic exploitation through the use of brute force to impose direct political control over another nation or group. For example, under the [[British Empire]], the United Kingdom variously ruled the nations it conquered through three political mechanisms: [[wikt:direct rule|direct rule]], [[viceroy]]s, and [[Governor-General|governor-generals]].
* {{anchor|psycho-economic_exploitation}}'''Psycho-economic exploitation''' occurs when direct political control is not or is no longer feasible (often due to [[military logistics]]). At such times, the imperialist nation or group engages in economic exploitation by injecting fear and inferiority complexes in the minds of the people that they would [[Colonialism|colonize]].

A common name for psycho-economic exploitation is [[neocolonialism]]. However, Neohumanism observes that there is nothing new about psycho-economic exploitation. Wherever politico-economic exploitation takes place, it is invariably accompanied by psychic exploitation, the goal of which being to make the colonized people more docile. In other words, according to Neohumanism, in both politico-economic exploitation and psycho-economic exploitation, psychic exploitation is the foundation.{{r|dis7}} Neohumanism asserts that when politico-economic exploitation is combined with psycho-economic exploitation, the likely social devastation is much greater.{{r|dis7}}

==== Exploiters ====
In nature, there is a [[mainstream]], and there is also positive and negative deviation from the mainstream. This is true for all species of living beings. Neohumanism classifies this deviation for plants, animals, and humans. When a living being substantially deviates from the mainstream in a constructive fashion, neohumanism describes that being as ''remarkable'', ''good'', or ''blissful'' (depending on whether the structure of that being is of a plant, animal, or human respectively). Conversely, when a living being substantially deviates from the mainstream in a destructive fashion, neohumanism describes that being as ''notorious'', ''bad'', or ''demonic'' (depending on whether the structure of that being is of a plant, animal, or human respectively).{{r|dis10}} In respect to exploitation, our main concern is with human structures, specifically those human structures with [[genius]] that is exercised for destructive purpose, ''demons in human form/framework'' (DHFs).

DHFs are geniuses, and so they are exceptionally devious. They know how to pander to and play on the [[#Geosentiment|geosentiments]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiments]] of the common people, who rarely think deeply. But truth does not remain hidden forever. So whenever a particular abuse of geosentiment or sociosentiment is about to get exposed or that particular geosentiment or sociosentiment is likely to lose popularity, DHFs switch to a different sentiment. Neohumanism designates the adaptive art of conveniently switching sentiments as ''metamorphosed sentimental strategy''.{{r|dis10}}

According to neohumanism, DHFs wreak great havoc upon this world.{{r|dis10}} Because of their adeptness at metamorphosed sentimental strategy, Sarkar also sometimes refers to DHFs as ''human chameleons''. Like chameleons, DHFs are often very difficult to spot. Nevertheless, Sarkar insists that it is the duty of all neohumanists to identify the DHFs. Not only must neohumanists identify the DHFs, but they must also expose them.{{r|dis10}}

=== Humanism (general) ===
According to neohumanism, the radius of geosentiment and sociosentiment may be relatively short or long. In other words, they both have a minimal and maximal expression (geosentiment or sociosentiment ''minimitis'' and ''maximitis''). With respect to sociosentiment, its minimal expression (''sociosentiment minimitis'') is the attraction felt toward one's nuclear family. That minimal sociosentiment may be extended to embrace a larger community, for example, a city, a state, a nation, an ethnicity, a religious group, and so on. When sociosentiment extends beyond [[nationalism]] and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], theoretically embracing all human beings, that is ''sociosentiment maximitis''. According to Sarkar, general (or ordinary) humanism is essentially '''sociosentiment maximitis'''.&lt;ref name="Now 1982"&gt;''Now, this sociosentiment, in its stage of excellencio or in theory maximitis, is called "humanism." Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Pseudohumanism (Discourse 8)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pseudohumanism ====
Neohumanism is of the view that general or ordinary humanism is a distorted humanism that has done and is still doing harm in the world. According to neohumanism, in so far as humanism expanded sociosentiment, it was a positive trend; but in so far as it sets limits on the expansion of the underlying spirit of humanism, [[love]], it has been and continues to be counterproductive.

According to neohumanism, there is a tendency for general humanists to substitute [[pity]] for love. Sarkar said this type of '''pseudohumanism''' inevitably fosters '''intra-human conflict'''.

=== Humanity ===
Neohumanism rejects the classic definition of human being as "[[rational animal]]", which first appeared in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' insisting that human beings have characteristics distinct from [[animal]]s. It considers human [[life]] to be an [[Ideology|ideological]] flow,{{subst:technical language}} characterized by identification with and commitment to an ideology.&lt;ref name=glory&gt;Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, "The Glory of Human Dharma", 21 February 1979, Bhopal. Published in ''Ananda Vacanamrtam Part 8'', Ananda Marga Publications, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inspiration (motivation) ===
According to neohumanism, the impetus (inspiration or motivation) for human movement - human dynamism - may be either of two conflicting [[principle]]s: the principle of selfish pleasure (''átma-sukha tattva'') or the principle of social equality (''sama-samája tattva'').

==== Selfish pleasure ====
According to neohumanism, selfishness is a socially divisive mental ailment. Those who promote or accept the [[#Dogma|dogmas]] founded on the principle of selfish pleasure typically do so in order to secure their own vested interests.&lt;ref&gt;''All the social, economic and geographical forces that normally motivate human beings are guided by dogma; and this dogma in its turn is entirely based on átma-sukha tattva [the principle of selfish pleasure]. Human beings yield to this dogma with the sole intention of attaining selfish pleasures; even educated people knowingly submit to dogma.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Sama-Samája Tattva (Discourse 6)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social equality ====
The concept of [[egalitarianism]] has been in circulation for thousands of years. Over time, the concept has become broader and more sophisticated. Recently, various studies have been conducted with results that endorse the tremendous importance of having a more equitable society (see, for example, ''[[The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better]]'' by [[Richard G. Wilkinson]] and [[Kate Pickett]]). Neohumanism promotes egalitarianism by asserting the principle of social equality and rejecting all [[#Dogma|dogma]] and [[superstition]].&lt;ref&gt;''The endeavor to advance towards the ultimate reality by forming a society free from all inequalities, with everyone of the human race moving in unison, is called sama-samája tattva [the principle of social equality]... We must totally reject all those hypocritical ideas which are contrary to this sama-samája tattva, and we must welcome all those ideas which will help human beings to be established in it. All opposing theories must be removed mercilessly, just like thorns from our path. And in this process we must not give indulgence to any dogmas or supernatural ideas. This should be the task of today’s human beings; all people should combine their efforts and strive unitedly to accomplish that end.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Sama-Samája Tattva (Discourse 6)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to neohumanism, realization of the principle of social equality is a natural consequence of spiritual practice (especially meditation founded on yogic [[morality]], '''Yama-Niyama'''&lt;ref&gt;Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, ''A Guide to Human Conduct''. Fourth Paperback Edition, 2004, Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|9788172521035}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, realization of this principle is not the final stage of neohumanism, because application of a principle is somewhat mechanical. In the final stage of neohumanism, the human being's life is transformed into a blissful mission of love (see the [[#stage3|third stage of neohumanism]]).

=== Internationalism ===
Many general humanists support the concept of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]. Neohumanism observes that internationalism does not even rise to the standard of [[#Humanism (general)|ordinary humanism]]. Indeed, it poses the same sort of risk to global peace as nationalism. Sarkar explains the problem as follows:

{{Quote|''Suppose I was working for a particular nation, but now I am working for all nations. When I admit the existence of nations and say that I am working for all nations, then it is neither humanism nor universalism – it is merely internationalism. When I use the term "internationalism", I am admitting the existence of separate nations, and along with this I must naturally also think, within the nations, of the people's five fundamental requirements of life (food, clothes, education, shelter, and medical care). But when I discover that one nation is trying to thrive on the life-blood of another, I oppose it, and this opposition ultimately leads to world war. So internationalism is not the solution either.''&lt;ref name="Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan 1982"/&gt;}}

From the perspective of neohumanism, the [[League of Nations]] could not prevent [[World War II]], and the [[United Nations]] cannot prevent a World War III. Only a [[world government]] could ensure peace on this planet.

=== Mental illness ===
According to neohumanism, the major cause of mental disorder is a lack of harmony between the rhythm and speed of the inner world and the outer world. In modern times, humanity has made great progress in the intellectual sphere. But, for most people, the speed of that intellectual progress is not well reflected in the external world (for example, a rising standard of living). Similarly, the patterns of thought for most persons (their internal psychic rhythm) is quite different from the external rhythm of the objective world. These disparities naturally cause clash, and that clash is felt even more in the psychic realm than the physical realm. Neohumanism asserts that this is the reason why many human beings lose their mental balance.{{r|dis1}}

=== Mental modes ===
According to neohumanism, in addition to various activities like [[Thought|thinking]] and [[Recall (memory)|remembering]], mind has three modes of functioning: ''[[instinct]]'', ''sentiment'', and ''[[rationality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Geo-Sentiment (Discourse 3)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anopheles stephensi.jpeg|thumb|200px|Mosquitoes suck blood instinctively.]]
* '''Instinct''': The position of neohumanism on ''[[instinct]]'' is somewhat [[Convention (norm)|conventional]]. All living beings, developed and undeveloped, have innate instincts. Many if not most such instincts incite behavior that increases the likelihood of [[self-preservation]] of an organism or a species. So, for example, mosquitoes suck blood, and human babies drink their mother's milk. Neohumanism takes note of the fact that life feeds on life,&lt;ref&gt;''It is true that living creatures are the food for other living beings (jiivah jiivasya bhojanam); and indeed, the vegetables that we eat every day also have living cells in them.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Devotional Sentiment and Neohumanism (Discourse 1)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but insists that human beings must employ [[rationality]] in the selection of food.&lt;ref&gt;''Once I read in a certain book that a great saint used to live only on locusts dipped in honey. That saint did not seriously consider that those little locusts also had vital life force throbbing in them... This concern for the vital rhythm throbbing in other human creatures has driven people to the fold of humanism, has made them humanists. Now, if the same human sentiment is extended to include all creatures of this universe, then and only then can human existence be said to have attained its final consummation.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Devotional Sentiment and Neohumanism (Discourse 1)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, neohumanism recognizes the fact that human beings are motivated to some extent by instinct, but neohumanism expects human beings to rely more on rationality so that any needlessly destructive impact of instinct (and sentiment) is curtailed.
* {{anchor|sentiment}}'''Sentiment''': Regarding ''sentiment'', neohumanism broadens the perspective. According to neohumanism, undeveloped minds operate only on instinct; whereas, in more developed minds (including human minds), sentiment also functions and tends to exceed instinct. Goaded by sentiment, mind runs blindly after what it likes (or away from what it does not like). A sentimental being does not ask questions about propriety or even employ common sense. Accordingly, sentiment poses the risk that an irrational course of action may be adopted - a course of action that could destroy not just the sentimental individual but also an entire family or social group.
* '''Discrimination''': Discrimination occurs when a conscious decision is taken regarding the appropriate course of action. A tiger stalks its prey and attacks from a selected vantage point. This is discrimination. A robber enters a house and calculates which room to plunder first, based on most likely gain. This is discrimination. A reasoned decision regarding pros and cons is taken. When discrimination goes one step further, considering a choice between right and wrong (proper and improper), then conscience ([[viveka]]) is invoked. At that point, discrimination rises to the level of [[#Rationality|rationality]]. Compared to instinct and sentiment, discrimination is a slow process. It takes more time to exercise discrimination.

=== Protopsychospirituality ===
Protopsychospirituality (also known as ''protospiritualistic mentality'') is a type of thinking whereby one remembers that everything and everyone with whom one comes in contact is a manifestation of Supreme Consciousness (''Parama Brahma''). Before and after doing any action, if one remembers that all existential phenomena emanate from and return to the Supreme (Cosmic) Existential Nucleus, a benevolent mode of thinking naturally arises within the mind. In that state of mind, one cannot contemplate doing harm to others. Neohumanism asserts that a protospiritualistic mentality is essential for identifying some exceptionally devious [[#Exploiters|exploiters]]. Identification becomes possible when the person with a protospiritualistic mentality notes that her/his benevolent mode of thinking is not reflected in the actions of the exploiter.{{r|dis10}}

=== Pseudoculture ===
[[Culture]] generally refers to the refinements in human expressions. Everyone eats. However, to eat only after washing one's hands is commonly deemed to be part of the ''culture'' of eating. According to neohumanism, human culture is one, but there are variations in its expression. For example, humans, being social creatures, typically like to communicate; but, depending on locality, different languages are used. Neohumanism observes that whenever one group of people has sought to economically exploit another group of people, the former group simultaneously attempted to destroy the local cultural expressions of the latter group. This has been done through the imposition of ''pseudoculture''. Examples of the imposition of pseudoculture are the forced acceptance of an imperialist ruler's language, religious dogma, style of dress, style of eating, political forms, historical perspectives, and artistic expressions.

Pseudoculture is imposed by various means from brute force to the mass media to public education. Often, the standard of refinement in pseudoculture is less than that which it replaces. But regardless of the standard of refinement, the end result is that the cultural backbone of the colonized society is broken. Psychologically crippled, the colonized people lose the will and the power to protest against exploitation. Instead, they tend to deem it just and proper to hand over much of their national wealth to the exploiters.&lt;ref&gt;''This exploitation in the cultural sphere is accomplished by the propagation of pseudoculture. Every honest, virtuous, rational person must fight against this pseudoculture, and inspire others to do the same. If this is not done, the future of humanity will be sealed. It is proper for human beings to struggle for political freedom, for social emancipation; but if their cultural backbone is broken, then all their struggles will end in nothing – like offering ghee into a fire that has died out.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rationality ===
Philosophers have defined [[rationality]] in various ways. Some of those definitions could equally apply to animals or even plants. Neohumanism offers a new and precise definition of rationality that calls for a standard of mentality that is not discernible in any species other than human beings. According to neohumanism, rationality (also known as ''rationalistic mentality'') is a three-stage process of discrimination that begins with adequate study to assimilate all relevant facts, proceeds to analyze the pros and cons of an action, and ends with a decision in favor of only a ''blissful auxiliary'' (practical action that furthers the welfare of all).&lt;ref&gt;''In the first stage you study; in the second you analyze the positive and negative sides; and in the third stage you arrive at "blissful or non-blissful, auxiliary or non-auxiliary". When you complete this whole process of logical reasoning, the outcome is your "awakened conscience". This state of awakened conscience is what is called "rationalistic mentality".''

=== Religion ===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=''So in the sphere of religion also, if you look carefully, you will see that behind those who have been knowingly or unknowingly operating the machinery of exploitation, there are certain wealthy parties. Those parties want to create their satellites. In every sphere of life you will find such wealthy people in the background.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar}}
Throughout history, [[religion]] has had a domineering influence on the human mind. According to neohumanism, all religions are based on [[#Dogma|dogma]], and the propagation of that religious dogma has been instrumental in the creation of satellite groups. Some religious persons and priests propagate the damaging dogma of religion unwittingly. When such persons are made to understand their mistake, some admit their error and rectify themselves. Others, however, refuse to do so, fearing that the admission of error would injure their prestige. The latter group of persons thereby join the ranks of conscious agents of injustice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Sentiments ===
According to neohumanism, two types of sentiment are common to human beings (in both an individual and collective sense): [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Bondages and Solutions (Discourse 2)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both sentiments have a minimal and a maximal expression (geosentiment or sociosentiment ''minimitis'' and ''maximitis''). As with any [[#sentiment|sentiment]], both geosentiment and sociosentiment may have good uses, but there is also great risk of harm (harm to others and harm to oneself). Neohumanism observes that those who would exploit other human beings for their own selfish gain ([[#Exploiters|exploiters]]) typically employ these two types of sentiment, often shifting or transforming sentiments whenever convenient.

==== Geosentiment ====
Geosentiment is the attraction felt toward one's own home, city, or country. Its minimal expression (''geosentiment minimitis'') is love for one's home (house, homestead, or the like). The maximal expression of geosentiment (''geosentiment maximitis'') is love for one's country. In theory, one might feel love for the entire planet, but today such an expression of geosentiment would be very rare, possibly non-existent. In the future, when interplanetary travel becomes commonplace, geosentiment maximitis may expand.

Geosentiment presents in many forms: [[geopolitics]], [[geoeconomics]], geopatriotism, georeligion, and so on. For example, georeligion would associate a religion or a religious group with a specific territory. So, the belief that God has granted a particular territory to a particular group of people is an example of georeligion. Similarly, the belief that prayer must be carried out facing in a specific direction is another expression of georeligion. Such type of beliefs (geosentiments) may prove harmless or harmful, depending on circumstances. According to neohumanism, the potential for harm in geosentiment can be curbed through the cultivation of a [[#Rationality|rationalistic mentality]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Geosentiment (Discourse 3)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sociosentiment.jpg|thumb|Degrees of sociosentiment (simplified expansions)]]

==== Sociosentiment ====
Sociosentiment is the attraction felt toward one's own family, nation, or other social grouping (linguistic, religious, political, and so on). Its minimal expression (''sociosentiment minimitis'') is the attraction felt toward one's nuclear family. That minimal sociosentiment may be extended to embrace a larger community, for example, a city, a state, a nation, an ethnicity, a religious group, and so on. When sociosentiment extends beyond [[nationalism]] and [[#Internationalism|internationalism]], theoretically embracing all human beings, that is ''sociosentiment maximitis''. According to Sarkar, [[#Humanism (general)|general (or ordinary) humanism]] is essentially sociosentiment maximitis.&lt;ref name="Now 1982"/&gt;

Sociosentiment presents itself in many forms: [[Political sociology|sociopolitics]], [[socioeconomics]], [[Patriotism|sociopatriotism]], [[Sociology of religion|socioreligion]], and so on. For example, sociopatriotism might express itself as [[jingoism]] with declarations like "my country, right or wrong" or "my country over all others". Socioeconomics might express itself in the form of an imperialist attempt to create [[Colony|colonies]] or [[satellite states]].

Compared to [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]], sociosentiment has the capacity to do - and has done - much greater harm in the world. Sociosentiment can also be more difficult to recognize. As such, [[#Rationality|rationality]] might not be adequate to offset the dangers of sociosentiment. To overcome sociosentiment, neohumanism prescribes an additional tool, [[#Protopsychospirituality|protopsychospirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;''What is the way to counteract this sociosentiment? The only way to eliminate it is to develop protospiritualistic mentality. The basis of this protospiritualistic mentality is sama-samája tattva [the principle of social equality]. When people understand this principle from the core of their hearts, they spontaneously develop protospiritualistic mentality, protospiritualistic psychic structure.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Bondages and Solutions (Discourse 2)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social justice ===
Neohumanism extends the concept of ''society'' to include all living beings. Unlike most other theories, past or present, neohumanism distinguishes between [[human society]] and society (in its broadest or universal sense).

In respect to the universal society, the stance of neohumanism corresponds to the spirit of the third fundamental principle of [[Progressive Utilization Theory|PROUT]]. The physical, mental, and spiritual potential of each and every living being should be developed to the maximum. This means that humans should not only respect and protect the rights of the non-human creatures but also actively promote their welfare and happiness.

Regarding human society, neohumanism asserts that no one should be left to lag behind. In a healthy human society, no one should suffer from [[oppression]]. Every problem - big or small, individual or collective - should be taken as a problem of the entire humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''Spread out the sermons of amity amongst the humanity. Remind one and all that the establishment of human excellence does not lie in hypocrisy but in simplicity and sincerity. Make them all realize that every individual human problem, whether big or small, is the problem of universal humanity. Make them also understand that the origin as well as the finality of the entire humanity is one and the same.'' Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 1982 January 1. Ánanda Váńii Saḿgraha. Compilation from 1956-1990, Ananda Marga Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, neohumanism is claimed to oppose any form of [[social discrimination]] based on race or sex, and support women's rights. Neohumanism makes men responsible for acting in support of those rights.&lt;ref&gt;''In every sphere of life men have either substantially limited the rights of women, or made the ability of women to exercise their rights subject to the whims and caprices of men... The main point of the discussion is this: those who take advantage of people’s simplicity or ignorance are veritable demons in human form, and those who deceive people by exploiting their sentiments of sacrifice are even worse than demons... If at all a movement is required, it must be implemented by men themselves. Today men should consider the needs of women and gradually restore to women the rights which women once entrusted to men out of feelings of helplessness or in response to their heartfelt sentiments.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1959). ''Human Society Part 1''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-120-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concern of neohumanism for [[social justice]] extends even to relatively minor but intractable matters. So, for example, though it pertains only to grammar, the male bias of the English language should not continue. When the pronoun 'he' can mean 'he' or 'she' and when 'man' can mean 'man' or 'woman', should not the same be the case with 'she' and 'woman'? Either English must have neutral words or the meaning of existing words must change. Though such type of change generally takes a while to implement, neohumanism insists that it be done.

=== Social progress ===
As with [[Progressive Utilization Theory|PROUT]], neohumanism views social progress as a condition in which the welfare and happiness of the entire society is increased. Neohumanism considers the individual and the society to be an inalienable concomitance. Unlike other philosophical theories that would [[Satisficing|satisfice]] or allegedly optimize social well-being through principles like the [[lesser of two evils principle]] or the [[greatest good for the greatest number]], neohumanism measures progress on the basis of improvements in the poorest sectors of society. According to neohumanism, what is genuinely good for the individual is also good for the society; and what is genuinely good for the society is also good for the individual.

Neohumanism distinguishes two ways in which [[social progress]] may be effected: evolution and revolution.

* '''Evolution''' brings gradual and specific change.
* '''Revolution''' brings rapid and comprehensive change.

Of the two systems, neohumanism greatly prefers revolution.&lt;ref&gt;''Now, those who are courageous enough to speak out this truth in clear language – those who say, "Shatter this bondage of limitation!" – their path is called the path of revolution. And those who say, "Everything will be done gradually... why so much haste?" – their path is called the path of evolution. They can never accomplish any glorious task.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neohumanism distinguishes four types of people who take a stance on the subject of social change: [[Reactionary|reactionaries]], [[Reformism|reformists]], vocal revolutionaries, and [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]].

* '''Reactionaries''' openly oppose change. Neohumanism respects their honesty but deems such persons to be suffering from a fear complex.&lt;ref&gt;''There are still others who say straightforwardly, "No, no, how can I contradict the way followed by my ancestors – my father, my grandfather?" They are reactionaries. They suffer from a mental disease. They are afraid to accept the new; they suffer from fear complex. They utter high-sounding phrases, but their hearts are filled with fear complexes. Not that they are terribly reprehensible. They say outwardly: "We are just doing the same as our ancestors did." But their ancestors used to wear wooden sandals instead of shoes, and shawls instead of tailored shirts, eat guŕ [raw sugar] instead of refined sugar, and drink water from wells instead of from taps. Do they follow this also?'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reformists''' promote some miscellaneous fixes. According to neohumanism, such persons outwardly claim to want change, but their inner desire is to perpetuate the machinery of exploitation. The contradictory nature of [[reformism]] may manifest as a ''pseudoreformist strategy''.&lt;ref&gt;''The reformists say, "Let us go slowly on the path of reform." But actually they intend that the process of exploitation should continue without interruption. There were many reformists in the world, but in reality they did not want the welfare of the society; they only wanted to perpetuate the process of exploitation by bringing about some patchwork improvements.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vocal revolutionaries''' (also referred to as ''pseudorevolutionaries'') are similar to reformists but even less forthright. They pretend to want revolutionary change, but their tall talk is belied by their action.&lt;ref&gt;''I have branded these people as "vocal revolutionaries". They deliver long lectures against exploitation, but they do the opposite in practice.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{anchor|revolutionary}}'''Revolutionaries''' are forthright about their vision of a new society and unrelenting in their effort to materialize that vision.

According to neohumanism, revolutionaries are the true well-wishers of society. As such, neohumanism asserts that only the revolutionaries can effect significant social progress.

=== Universalism ===
Neohumanism's concept of [[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalism]] is non-religious. It is a type of love that extends to all beings of this universe, animate and even inanimate. From the perspective of Neohumanism, such a viewpoint is the ultimate outcome of the principle of 'social equality and 'protopsychospirituality'.&lt;ref name=dis10&gt;''Whenever people, after performing some activity, think of the Nucleus of the circum-rotarian universe, their minds become all-pervasive. Such people can never think of harming others; rather they will think only of universal welfare.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "An Ideology for a New Generation (Discourse 10)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Value systems ===
According to neohumanism, the human-centered [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach of general humanism is problematic in that it allows the possibility of cruelty to animals and plants. Such type of cruelty inevitably fosters inter-creature clash. Neohumanism extends this analysis by observing that cruelty has a tendency to become habitual. In other words, what a human does today to an animal, that same human may do tomorrow to another human being. Hence, according to neohumanism, general humanism may also foster intra-human clash. To offset the anthropic bias of general humanism and to reduce the potential for conflict, neohumanism posits two types of value: [[#Utility value|utility value]] and [[#Existential value|existential value]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Pseudohumanism (Discourse 8)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Existential value and utility value ====
According to neohumanism, until now, people have tended to think primarily in terms of [[#Utility value|utility value]], typically the [[utility]] that another entity has for oneself or one's nation. So, for example, when horses were a primary means of transportation, the utility value of horses to human beings was very great. Today, with more efficient and comfortable means of transportation, horses have lost most of their utility value for humans. Accordingly, Sarkar argues that the status of horses in modern society is much reduced. But neohumanism insists that horses also have ''existential value''. The existential value of a horse to itself is no less than the existential value of a human being to itself. In terms of the existential value one holds for one's own existence, all beings are said to be equal. Neohumanism would give greater importance to this existential value than to utility value.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Sarkar said: "Who says that those creatures who have lost their immediate utility value have no right to exist? No one has the moral right to say this.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Critiques ==
In a recent book,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James R. ''Violence and New Religious Movements''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2011. {{ISBN|0199735611}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Crovetto asserts that there is a "dramatic" number of correlations between [[Ananda Marga]] and [[Mark Juergensmeyer|Mark Juergensmeyer's]] "description of [[#Religion|religious]] groups inclined toward [[terrorism]]". Crovetto mentions here the imagery of "cosmic war" that appears in Sarkar's writings, and Crovetto repeatedly references language that seems to "satanize" opponents, for example, the term ''[[#Exploiters|demon in human form]]'' that is part of the terminology of neohumanism. After considerable analysis, Crovetto concludes that it is probably more appropriate to describe the followers of Sarkar as [[#revolutionary|''revolutionary'']] rather than ''terrorist''. As such, Crovetto classifies them as "revolutionary sociospiritual [[Utopia|''utopians'']]".

'''Neurotoxicity''' is a form of [[toxicity]] in which a biological, chemical, or physical agent produces an adverse effect on the structure or function of the [[central nervous system|central]] and/or [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Neurotoxicity review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cunha-Oliveira T, Rego AC, Oliveira CR | title = Cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the neurotoxicity of opioid and psychostimulant drugs | journal = Brain Research Reviews | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 192–208 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18440072 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.03.002 | quote = The Interagency Committee on Neurotoxicology defined neurotoxicity as a broad concept, including any adverse effect on the structure or function of the central and/or peripheral nervous system by a biological, chemical or physical agent. In this definition, neurotoxic effects may be permanent or reversible and result from direct or indirect actions on the nervous system (Erinoff, 1995).}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs when exposure to substance – specifically, a [[neurotoxin]] – alters the normal activity of the nervous system in such a way as to cause permanent or reversible damage to [[nervous tissue]].&lt;ref name="Neurotoxicity review" /&gt; This can eventually disrupt or even kill [[neuron]]s, which are cells that [[neurotransmission|transmit and process signals]] in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. Neurotoxicity can result from [[organ transplant]]s, [[radiation treatment]], certain [[drug therapy|drug therapies]] (e.g., substances used in [[chemotherapy]]), [[recreational drug use]], and exposure to [[heavy metals]], [[pesticide]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Neurotoxicity of pesticides. Keifer MC(1), Firestone J. Author information: (1)University of Washington, Department of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195-7234, USA., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan 1, 2008 - Neurotoxicity of pesticides: a brief review. Costa LG(1), Giordano G, Guizzetti M, Vitalone A. Author information: (1)Dept. of Environmental and ...&lt;/ref&gt; certain industrial cleaning [[solvent]]s, and certain naturally occurring substances.  Symptoms may appear immediately after exposure or be delayed. They may include limb weakness or numbness, loss of memory, vision, and/or intellect, uncontrollable obsessive and/or compulsive behaviors, delusions, headache, cognitive and behavioral problems and sexual dysfunction.

The term ''neurotoxicity'' implies the involvement of a neurotoxin; however, the term ''neurotoxic'' may be used more loosely to describe states that are known to cause physical [[brain damage]], but where no specific neurotoxin has been identified.

The presence of [[neurocognitive deficit]]s alone is not usually considered sufficient evidence of neurotoxicity, as many substances may impair [[neurocognitive]] performance without resulting in the death of neurons. This may be due to the direct action of the substance, with the impairment and neurocognitive deficits being temporary, and resolving when the substance is [[drug elimination|eliminated]] from the body. In some cases the level or exposure-time may be critical, with some substances only becoming neurotoxic in certain doses or time periods. Some of the most common naturally occurring brain toxins that lead to neurotoxicity as a result of excessive drug use are [[beta amyloid]] (Aβ), [[glutamate]], [[dopamine]], and [[oxygen radicals]]. When present in high concentrations, they can lead to neurotoxicity and death ([[apoptosis]]). Some of the symptoms that result from cell death include loss of motor control, cognitive deterioration and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Additionally, neurotoxicity has been found to be a major cause of [[neurodegenerative diseases]] such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD).

==Neurotoxic agents==

===Beta amyloid===
Aβ was found to cause neurotoxicity and cell death in the brain when present in high concentrations. Aβ results from a mutation that occurs when protein chains are cut at the wrong locations, resulting in chains of different lengths that are unusable. Thus they are left in the brain until they are broken down, but if enough accumulate, they form [[Senile plaques|plaques]] which are toxic to [[neurons]]. Aβ uses several routes in the [[central nervous system]] to cause cell death. An example is through the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] (nAchRs), which is a receptor commonly found along the surfaces of the cells that respond to nicotine stimulation, turning them on or off. Aβ was found manipulating the level of [[nicotine]] in the brain along with the [[MAP kinase]], another signaling receptor, to cause cell death. Another chemical in the brain that Aβ regulates is [[JNK]]; this chemical halts the [[extracellular signal-regulated kinases]] (ERK) pathway, which normally functions as memory control in the brain. As a result, this memory favoring pathway is stopped, and the brain loses essential memory function. The loss of memory is a symptom of [[neurodegenerative disease]], including AD. Another way Aβ causes cell death is through the phosphorylation of [[AKT]]; this occurs as the element phosphate is bound to several sites on the protein. This phosphorylation allows AKT to interact with [[Bcl-2-associated death promoter|BAD]], a protein known to cause cell death. Thus an increase in Aβ results in an increase of the AKT/BAD complex, in turn stopping the action of the anti-apoptotic protein [[Bcl-2]], which normally functions to stop cell death, causing accelerated neuron breakdown and the progression of AD.

===Glutamate===
[[Glutamate]] is a chemical found in the brain that poses a toxic threat to [[neuron]]s when found in high concentrations. This concentration equilibrium is extremely delicate and is usually found in millimolar amounts extracellularly. When disturbed, an accumulation of glutamate occurs as a result of a mutation in the [[glutamate transporters]], which act like pumps to drain glutamate from the brain. This causes glutamate concentration to be several times higher in the blood than in the brain; in turn, the body must act to maintain equilibrium between the two concentrations by pumping the glutamate out of the bloodstream and into the neurons of the brain. In the event of a mutation, the glutamate transporters are unable to pump the glutamate back into the cells; thus a higher concentration accumulates at the [[glutamate receptors]]. This opens the ion channels, allowing calcium to enter the cell causing excitotoxicity.  Glutamate results in cell death by turning on the [[N-methyl-D-aspartic acid]] receptors (NMDA); these receptors cause an increased release of calcium ions (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) into the cells. As a result, the increased concentration of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; directly increases the stress on [[mitochondria]], resulting in excessive [[oxidative phosphorylation]] and production of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) via the activation of [[nitric oxide synthase]], ultimately leading to cell death. Aβ was also found aiding this route to neurotoxicity by enhancing neuron vulnerability to glutamate.

===Oxygen radicals===
The formation of [[oxygen radicals]] in the brain is achieved through the [[nitric oxide synthase]] (NOS) pathway. This reaction occurs as a response to an increase in the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration inside a brain cell. This interaction between the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and NOS results in the formation of the cofactor [[tetrahydrobiopterin]] (BH4), which then moves from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. As a final step, NOS is dephosphorylated yielding [[nitric oxide]] (NO), which accumulates in the brain, increasing its [[oxidative stress]]. There are several ROS, including [[superoxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[hydroxyl]], all of which lead to neurotoxicity. Naturally, the body utilizes a defensive mechanism to diminish the fatal effects of the reactive species by employing certain enzymes to break down the ROS into small, benign molecules of simple oxygen and water. However, this breakdown of the ROS is not completely efficient; some reactive residues are left in the brain to accumulate, contributing to neurotoxicity and cell death. The brain is more vulnerable to oxidative stress than other organs, due to its low oxidative capacity. Because [[neuron]]s are characterized as [[postmitotic]] cells, meaning that they live with accumulated damage over the years, accumulation of ROS is fatal. Thus, increased levels of ROS age neurons, which leads to accelerated neurodegenerative processes and ultimately the advancement of AD.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis depends upon the length and degree of exposure and the severity of neurological injury. In some instances, exposure to neurotoxins can be fatal. In others, patients may survive but not fully recover. In other situations, many individuals recover completely after treatment.

The word ''neurotoxicity'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ʊər|oʊ-|t|ɒ|k|ˈ|s|ɪ|s|ᵻ|t|i}}) uses [[classical compound|combining forms]] of ''[[wikt:neuro-#Prefix|neuro-]]'' + ''[[wikt:tox-#Prefix|tox-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-icity#Suffix|-icity]]'', yielding "[[nervous tissue]] poisoning".

It is published by the [[Comité national de la gravure française]] and its office is at the prints department of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], which sponsors the journal. The journal is abstracted and indexed in the [[Bibliography of the History of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/bha/journals.pdf List of Journals in BHA]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bibliographie de l’histoire de France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhf.revues.org/index81.html Liste of Journals in the ''Bibliographie de l'histoire de France'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The journal was established in 1963 by [[Jean Adhémar]], then curator of the prints department of the National Library. At that time, it was not a journal but just a few sheets presenting news on prints.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to classical architecture:

'''[[Classical architecture]]''' &amp;ndash; architecture of [[classical antiquity]], that is, [[ancient Greek architecture]] and the [[ancient Roman architecture|architecture of ancient Rome]]. It also refers to the style or styles of architecture influenced by those.  For example, most of the styles originating in post-renaissance Europe can be described as classical architecture. This broad use of the term is employed by Sir John Summerson in ''The Classical Language of Architecture''.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== What ''type'' of thing is classical architecture? ==
Classical architecture can be described as all of the following:

* [[Architecture]] &amp;ndash; both the process and product of planning, designing and construction. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural and political symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.
** [[Architectural style]] &amp;ndash; classification of architecture in terms of the use of form, techniques, materials, time period, region and other stylistic influences.
* [[Art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity. The word "art" is therefore both a verb and a noun, as is the term "classical architecture".
** [[Work of art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic physical item or artistic creation.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; as an art form, classical architecture is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Classical architecture is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse.
*** A branch of the [[visual arts]] &amp;ndash; visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, architecture and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.
* Form of [[classicism]] &amp;ndash; high regard in the arts for classical antiquity, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate.
** [[Classicism#In architecture|Classicism in architecture]] &amp;ndash; places emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the architecture of Classical antiquity and in particular, the architecture of Ancient Rome, of which many examples remained.

== Classical architectural structures ==
* [[List of ancient architectural records]]

=== Ancient Greek architectural structures ===
* [[Ancient Greek architecture]] &amp;ndash; architecture produced by the Greek-speaking people (Hellenic people) whose culture flourished on the Greek mainland and Peloponnesus, the Aegean Islands, and in colonies in Asia Minor and Italy for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC.

* [[Ancient Roman architecture]] &amp;ndash;
** ''[[De architectura]]'' &amp;ndash; treatise on architecture written by the Roman architect Vitruvius and dedicated to his patron, the emperor Caesar Augustus, as a guide for building projects. The work is one of the most important sources of modern knowledge of Roman building methods, planning, and design.

== Classical architectural styles ==
* [[Byzantine architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Romanesque architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Gothic architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Renaissance architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Baroque architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Palladian architecture]] &amp;ndash; European style of architecture derived from the designs of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio (1508–1580). Palladio's work was strongly based on the symmetry, perspective and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans.
* [[Georgian architecture]] &amp;ndash; set of architectural styles current between 1720 and 1840.  In the mainstream of Georgian style were both Palladian architecture— and its whimsical alternatives, Gothic and Chinoiserie, which were the English-speaking world's equivalent of European Rococo.
* [[Neoclassical architecture]] &amp;ndash; architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century, manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament, and in its architectural formulas as an outgrowth of some classicizing features of Late Baroque. In its purest form it is a style principally derived from the architecture of Classical Greece and the architecture of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio.
** [[Empire style]] &amp;ndash; sometimes considered the second phase of Neoclassicism, is an early-19th-century design movement in architecture, furniture, other decorative arts, and the visual arts followed in Europe and America until around 1830, although in the U. S. it continued in popularity in conservative regions outside the major metropolitan centers well past the mid-19th century.
** [[Biedermeier#Architecture during the Biedermeier era|Biedermeier architecture]] &amp;ndash; neoclassical architecture in Central Europe between 1815 and 1848.
** [[Resort architecture]] (''Bäderarchitektur'') &amp;ndash; a specific neoclassical style that came up at the end of the 18th century in German [[seaside resort]]s and is widely used in the region until today.
** [[Federal architecture]] &amp;ndash; classicizing architecture built in the United States between c. 1780 and 1830, and particularly from 1785 to 1815. This style shares its name with its era, the Federal Period.
** [[Regency architecture]] &amp;ndash; buildings built in Britain during the period in the early 19th century when George IV was Prince Regent, and also to later buildings following the same style. The style corresponds to the Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, Federal style in the United States and to the French Empire style.
** [[Greek Revival architecture]] &amp;ndash; architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States. A product of Hellenism, it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture.
** [[Neoclassical architecture in Poland]]
* [[Nordic Classicism]] &amp;ndash; style of architecture that briefly blossomed in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland) between 1910 and 1930.
* [[New Classical Architecture]] &amp;ndash; Architectural movement to revive, and embrace classical architecture as a legitimate form of architecture for the 20th and 21st Centuries.  Beginning first with [[Postmodern architecture]]'s criticism of modernist architectural movements like [[International style (architecture)|International Style]], New Classical architecture seeks to be an alternative to the ongoing dominance of [[Modern architecture|modernist architecture]].

{{Wiktionary|philandry}}

'''Philandry''' is fondness, love, or admiration towards [[men]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t140.e58312 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title=Philandry |edition=2nd revised |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=philandry |title=Philandry |work=[[WordNet]] |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[antonym]] is ''[[misandry]]''. Philandry is not to be confused with [[androphilia]], which is [[sexual attraction]] to men or [[masculinity]] (and whose antonym is ''[[androphobia]]'').

== Etymology ==
''Philandry'' comes from ''philo-'' (loving) and Greek ''andro'' (man). The parallel [[Greek language|Greek]]-based terms with respect to women (females) are [[philogyny]] for "fondness towards women" and [[misogyny]] for "hatred of women". Parallel terms for humanity in general are [[philanthropy]] and [[misanthropy]].

A '''plot device''', or '''plot mechanism''', {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} is any [[narrative technique|technique]] in a [[narrative]] used to move the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Pfeil|title=Another Tale to Tell: Politics and Narrative in Postmodern Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18mRgWs-ptEC&amp;pg=PA267|accessdate=27 July 2013|year=1990|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-992-6|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the [[suspension of disbelief]]. However a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.

== Examples of stories using plot devices ==
Many stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great power. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the [[Indiana Jones]] film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', he is trying to retrieve the [[Ark of the Covenant]]; in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Jones is on a search for the [[Holy Grail]]. This plot device is also used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale of "[[The City of Brass]]," in which a group of travelers on an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] expedition journeys across the [[Sahara]] to find a brass vessel that [[Solomon]] once used to trap a [[Genie|jinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=148–9 &amp; 217–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9–19 [9]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several books in the [[Harry Potter]] series orient around a certain object. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry believes there is a magical stone in [[Hogwarts]] with special powers. [[Lord Voldemort]] needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return.

The [[One Ring]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]] puts it: "Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa."&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

== Examples ==

=== The MacGuffin ===
{{main|MacGuffin}}
A MacGuffin is a term, popularized by [[film director]] [[Alfred Hitchcock]], referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VP_DGfInVBcC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=MacGuffin+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=MacGuffin%20definition&amp;f=false | title = A Year of Hitchcock: 52 Weeks with the Master of Suspense | isbn = 9780810863897 | last1 = McDevitt | first1 = Jim | last2 = Juan | first2 = Eric San | date = 2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, "In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/MacGuffin
 |title=The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki
 |accessdate=2018-06-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring (from [[The Lord of the Rings]]), whose very nature is essential to the entire story.

MacGuffins are sometimes referred to as ''plot coupons'' (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to "collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a [[dénouement]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Mark | edition = illustrated | year = 2007 | title = Designing character-based console games | publisher = | page = 69 | isbn = 1584505214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]].&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]]|title=The Well-tempered Plot Device|url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html}}''In normal usage, when people talk of a plot device they mean something in the story that's just a little bit too obviously functional to be taken seriously.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deus ex machina ===
{{main|Deus ex machina}}
The term ''deus ex machina'' is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina |title=deus ex machina |work=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase "[[deus]] ex machina" has its origins in the conventions of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] tragedy, and refers to situations in which a [[mechane]] (crane) was used to lower actors playing a [[god]] or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.

The Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]] is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, she imposes upon him a series of extreme promises. Admetus is torn between choosing death or choosing to obey these unreasonable restrictions.{{which | date = July 2013}} In the end, though, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the promises. Another example of a ''deus ex machina'' is [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D7eOal3UhFcC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=%22Deus+ex+machina%22+gandalf+the+hobbit | title = Tolkien's Art: A Mythology for England | isbn = 0813138094 | last1 = Chance | first1 = Jane | date = 2001-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/classics/resources/poetics/poettran.htm
 |title=Aristotle's Poetics, adapted from the translation by S.H. Butcher
 |accessdate=2007-10-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shoulder angel ===
{{main|Shoulder angel}}
A shoulder angel is a plot device&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iyYGbs_QLioC&amp;pg=PT47&amp;dq=%22Shoulder+angel%22+fiction | title = Hatch's Plotbank | date = 2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see [[Left-handedness#Negative associations of language|Negative associations of left-handedness in language]]). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the [[id, ego and super-ego]] in [[Psychoanalysis]], with the person in the center of the dispute being the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] between the [[super-ego]] Angel and the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]] Devil.

=== Red herring ===
{{main|Red herring}}
The function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in [[whodunit]]s, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character.

=== Plot voucher ===
{{See also|Chekhov's gun}}

A ''plot voucher'', as defined by Nick Lowe,&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.

'''Safe sex''' is [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] using methods or devices (such as [[condoms]]) to reduce the risk of transmitting or acquiring [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs), especially [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/safesex?view=uk Compact Oxford English Dictionary], Oxford University Press, 2009, Accessed 23 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; "Safe sex" is also sometimes referred to as '''safer sex''' or '''protected sex''' to indicate that some safe sex practices do not completely eliminate STI risks. It is also sometimes used to describe methods aimed at preventing pregnancy.

The concept of safe sex emerged in the 1980s as a response to the global [[AIDS epidemic]]. Promoting safe sex is now one of the aims of [[sex education]] and STI prevention, especially reducing new HIV infections. Safe sex is regarded as a [[harm reduction]] strategy aimed at reducing risks of STI transmission.&lt;ref name="Who"&gt;{{cite web| title = Global strategy for the prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections: 2006–2015.

Although some safe sex practices (like condoms) can also be used as [[birth control]] (contraception), most forms of contraception do not protect against STIs. Likewise, some safe sex practices, like partner selection and low-risk sex behavior, may not be effective forms of contraception.

==History==
{{Citations missing|section|date=March 2018}}
Although strategies for avoiding STIs like syphilis and gonorrhea have existed for centuries and the term 'safe sex' existed in English as early as the 1930s, the use of the term to refer to STI-risk reduction dates to the mid-1980s in the United States. It emerged in response to the HIV/AIDS crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stephey |first1=M. J. |title=A Brief History of Safe Sex |url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1866044,00.html |website=TIME Magazine |accessdate=14 September 2018 |language=English |date=11 December 2008 |quote=In the 1540s, an Italian doctor named Gabriele Fallopius — the same man who discovered and subsequently named the Fallopian tubes of the female anatomy — wrote about syphilis, advocating the use of layered linen during intercourse for more "adventurous" (read: promiscuous) men. Legendary lover Casanova wrote about his pitfalls with medieval condoms made of dried sheep gut, referring to them as "dead skins" in his memoir. Even so, condoms made of animal intestine — known as "French letters" in England and la capote anglaise (English riding coats) in France — remained popular for centuries, though always expensive and never easy to obtain, meaning the devices were often reused.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Safe sex |url=https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/309375.html |website=The Phrase Finder |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year before the HIV virus was isolated and named, the San Francisco chapter of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence published a small pamphlet titled ''Play Fair!'' out of concern over widespread STIs among the city's gay male population. It specifically named illnesses (Kaposi's sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia) that would later be understood as symptoms of advanced HIV disease (or [[AIDS]]). The pamphlet advocated a range of safe-sex practices, including abstinence, condoms, personal hygiene, use of personal lubricants, and STI testing/treatment. It took a casual, sex-positive approach while also emphasizing personal and social responsibility. In May 1983--the same month HIV was isolated and named in France--the New York City-based HIV/AIDS activists Richard Berkowitz and Michael Callen published similar advice in their booklet, ''[[How to Have Sex in an Epidemic: One Approach]]''. Neither publication used the term "safe sex" but both included recommendations that are now standard advice for reducing STI (including HIV) risks. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Joseph |first1=Sonnabend |title=How to have sex in an epidemic: 30th anniversary |url=https://www.poz.com/blog/how-to-have-sex-in-a |website=POZ |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herson |first1=Michael |title=The history and challenge of HIV prevention |journal=The Lancet |date=2008 |volume=372 |issue=9637 |pages=475-488 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60884-3 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)60884-3 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkowitz 2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berkowitz |first1=Richard |title=Stayin' Alive: The Invention of Safe Sex |date=2003 |publisher=WestView |location=Boulder, CO |isbn=9780813340920|accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safe sex as a form of STI risk reduction appeared in journalism as early as 1984, in the British publication 'The Intelligencer': ""The goal is to reach about 50 million people with messages about safe sex and AIDS education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Safe sex |url=https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/309375.html |website=The Phrase Finder |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''safe sex'' is used by individuals to refer to protection against both [[pregnancy]] and HIV/AIDS or other STI transmissions, the term was born in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is believed that the term ''safe sex'' was used in the professional literature in 1984, in the content of a paper on the psychological effect that HIV/AIDS may have on [[homosexual]] men. The term was related with the need to develop educational programs for the group considered at risk, homosexual men.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} 

A year later, the same term appeared in an article in ''[[The New York Times]].'' This article emphasized that most specialists advised their AIDS patients to practice safe sex. The concept included limiting the number of sexual partners, using prophylactics, avoiding bodily fluid exchange, and resisting the use of [[drug]]s that reduced inhibitions for high-risk sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csuchico.edu/cjhp/4/1/109-118-moskowitz.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812073450/http://www.csuchico.edu/cjhp/4/1/109-118-moskowitz.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 August 2006|title=How Do Californians Define Safe Sex?|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in 1985, the first safe sex guidelines were established by the 'Coalition for Sexual Responsibilities'.{{Who|date=August 2010}} According to these guidelines, safe sex was practiced by using [[condom]]s also when engaging in [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[oral sex]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Although the term ''safe sex'' was primarily used in reference to the sexual activity of homosexual men, in 1986 the concept was spread to the general population. Various programs were developed with the aim of promoting safe sex practices among college students. These programs were focused on promoting the use of the condom, a better knowledge about the partner's sexual history and limiting the number of [[sexual partner]]s. The first book on this subject appeared in the same year. The book was entitled "Safe Sex in the Age of AIDS", it had 88 pages and it described both positive and negative approaches to sexual life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Sexual behavior could be either safe ([[kiss]]ing, [[hug]]ging, [[massage]], [[Non-penetrative sex|body-to-body rubbing]], [[mutual masturbation]], [[exhibitionism]], [[phone sex]], and use of separate [[sex toy]]s); possibly safe (use of condoms); and unsafe.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

In 1997, specialists in this matter promoted the use of condoms as the most accessible safe sex method (besides abstinence) and they called for [[TV commercials]] featuring condoms. During the same year, the [[Catholic Church]] in the United States issued their own "safer sex" guidelines on which condoms were listed, though two years later the [[Holy See|Vatican]] urged [[chastity]] and [[heterosexual]] marriage, attacking the American Catholic bishops' guidelines.

A study carried out in 2006 by Californian specialists showed that the most common definitions of safe sex are condom use (68% of the interviewed subjects), abstinence (31.1% of the interviewed subjects), monogamy (28.4% of the interviewed subjects) and safe partner (18.7% of the interviewed subjects).&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

The term ''safer sex'' in Canada and the United States has gained greater use by health workers, reflecting that risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections in various [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] is a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]. The term ''safe sex'' is still in common use in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} 

"Safer sex" is thought to be a more aggressive term which may make it more obvious to individuals that any type of sexual activity carries a certain degree of [[risk]].

The term ''safe love'' has also been used, notably by the French [[Sidaction]] in the promotion of men's underpants incorporating a condom pocket and including the red ribbon symbol in the design, which were sold to support the charity.

==Practices==
[[Image:Kunisada surimono.jpg|thumb|right|A ''[[Shunga (art)|shunga]]'' print by [[Kunisada]] depicting female mutual or partnered masturbation.]]
A range of safe-sex practices are commonly recommended by sexual health educators and public health agencies. Many of these practices can reduce (but not completely eliminate risk of transmitting or acquiring STIs.

===Phone sex/cybersex/sexting===
Sexual activities, such as [[phone sex]], [[cybersex]], and [[sexting]], that do not include direct contact with the skin or bodily fluids of sexual partners, carry no STI risks and, thus, are forms of safe sex.&lt;ref name=plannedparenthood&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/stds-hiv-safer-sex/safer-sex-4263.htm | title = Safer Sex ("Safe Sex") | accessdate = 23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-penetrative sex===

{{Main article|Non-penetrative sex}}
A range of sex acts called "non-penetrative sex" or "outercourse" can significantly reduce STI risks. Non-penetrative sex includes practices such as kissing, mutual masturbation, rubbing or stroking.&lt;ref name="LaRosa"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Judith LaRosa, Helaine Bader, Susan Garfield| title = New Dimensions In Women's Health| publisher =[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]]|year = 2009|page=91|accessdate = August 31, 2013| isbn = 0763765929 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=2X03PXd4JSoC&amp;pg=PA91|quote=Outercourse is the sharing of sexual intimacy with behaviors such as kissing, petting, and mutual masturbation.

However, non-penetrative sex may not protect against infections that can be transmitted via skin-to-skin contact, such as [[herpes]] and [[HPV|human papilloma virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases)|url=http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/handouts/sexually_transmitted_infections.html|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual or partnered masturbation carries some STI risk, especially if there is skin contact or shared bodily fluids with sexual partners, although the risks are significantly lower than many other sexual activities.&lt;ref name=plannedparenthood&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/stds-hiv-safer-sex/safer-sex-4263.htm | title = Safer Sex ("Safe Sex") | accessdate = 23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condoms, dental dams, gloves===
Barriers, such as condoms, dental dams, and medical gloves can prevent contact with body fluids (such as [[blood]], [[vaginal fluid]], [[semen]], rectal mucus), and other means of transmitting STIs (like skin, hair and shared objects) during sexual activity.

[[File:How To Put on a Condom graphic.png|thumb|How to put on an external condom]]
*External [[condom]]s can be used to cover the penis, hands, fingers, or other body parts during sexual penetration or stimulation.&lt;ref name="Corinna" /&gt; They are most frequently made of [[latex]], and can also be made out of synthetic materials including [[polyurethane]] and [[polyisoprene]].
*Internal condoms (also called [[female condom]]s) are inserted into the [[vagina]] or [[anus]] prior to sexual penetration. These condoms are made of either [[polyurethane]] or [[nitrile]]. If external and internal condoms are used at the same time, they may break due to friction between the materials during sexual activity.
*A [[dental dam]] (originally used in dentistry) is a sheet of latex used for protection when engaging in [[oral sex]]. It is typically used as a barrier between the mouth and the [[vulva]] during [[cunnilingus]] or between the mouth and the anus during [[anal–oral sex]].
*[[Medical glove]]s made out of latex, vinyl, [[nitrile rubber|nitrile]], or polyurethane may be used as a makeshift dental dam during oral sex, or can cover hands, fingers, or other body parts during penetration or sexual stimulation, such as [[masturbation]]. &lt;ref name="Corinna"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corinna |first1=Heather |title=S.E.X.: The All-You-Need-to-Know Sexuality Guide to Get You Through Your Teens and Twenties |date=2016 |publisher=Da Capo Lifelong Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0738218847 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moon"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moon |first1=Allison |title=Girl Sex 101 |date=2018 |publisher=Lunatic Ink |isbn=978-0983830900 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Condoms, dental dams, and gloves can also be used to cover [[sex toys]] such as [[dildo]]s during sexual stimulation or penetration.&lt;ref name="Corinna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moon" /&gt; If a sex toy is to be used in more than one orifice or partner, a condom/dental dam/glove can be used over it and changed when the toy is moved.

Oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubrication]] can break down the structure of latex condoms, dental dams or gloves, reducing their effectiveness for STI protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corinna |first1=Heather |title=S.E.X.: The All-You-Need-to-Know Sexuality Guide to Get You Through Your Teens and Twenties |date=2016 |publisher=Da Capo Lifelong Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0738218847 |page=294 |edition=second |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While use of external condoms can reduce STI risks during sexual activity, they are not 100% effective. One study has suggested condoms might reduce HIV transmission by 85% to 95%; effectiveness beyond 95% was deemed unlikely because of slippage, breakage, and incorrect use.&lt;ref name="Varghese"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Varghese |first1=B |last2=Maher |first2=JE |last3=Peterman |first3=TA |last4=Branson |first4=BM |last5=Steketee |first5=RW | year = 2002 | title = Reducing the risk of sexual HIV transmission: quantifying the per-act risk for HIV on the basis of choice of partner, sex act, and condom use | url = http://ww2.aegis.org/files/AskDoc_refs/varghese2002-29-1.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Sex Transm Dis | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–43 | doi = 10.1097/00007435-200201000-00007 | pmid = 11773877 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724224853/http://ww2.aegis.org/files/AskDoc_refs/varghese2002-29-1.pdf | archivedate = 24 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also said, "In practice, inconsistent use may reduce the overall effectiveness of condoms to as low as 60–70%".&lt;ref name="Varghese"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/sup&gt;

===Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)===
{{Main article|Pre-exposure prophylaxis}}
[[Pre-exposure prophylaxis]] (often abbreviated as ''PrEP'') is the use of prescription drugs by those who do not have HIV to prevent HIV infection. PrEP drugs are taken ''prior'' to HIV exposure to prevent the transmission of the virus, usually between sexual partners. PrEP drugs do not prevent other STI infections or pregnancy.

As of 2018, the most-widely approved form of ''PrEP'' combines two drugs (tenofovir and emtricitabine) in one pill. That drug combination is sold under the brand name Truvada by Gilead Sciences. It is also sold in generic formulations worldwide. Other drugs are also being studied for use as PrEP. 

Different countries have approved different protocols for using the tenofovir/emtricitabine-combination drug as ''PrEP''. That two-drug combination has been shown to prevent HIV infection in different populations when taken daily, intermittently, and on demand. Numerous studies have found the tenofovir/emtricitabine combination to be over 90% effective at preventing HIV transmission between sexual partners. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/ |title=Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) |date=19 September 2016 |website= |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment as prevention ===
{{Main article|Treatment as prevention}}
Treatment as Prevention (often abbreviated as ''TasP'') is the practice of testing for and treating HIV infection as a way to prevent further spread of the virus. Those having knowledge of their HIV-positive status can use safe-sex practices to protect themselves and their partners (such as using condoms, sero-sorting partners, or choosing less-risky sexual activities). And, because HIV-positive people with durably suppressed or undetectable amounts of HIV in their blood ''cannot transmit HIV to sexual partners'', sexual activity with HIV-positive partners on effective treatment is a form of safe sex (to prevent HIV infection). This fact has given rise to the concept of "U=U" ("Undetectable = Untransmittable"). &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.preventionaccess.org/ |title=U=U|date=2017|website= |publisher=Prevention Access Campaign|access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other forms of safe sex===
Other methods proven effective at reducing STI risks during sexual activity are:
* [[Immunization]] against certain sexually-transmitted viruses. The most common vaccines protect against [[Hepatitis B vaccine|Hepatitis B]] and [[HPV vaccine|Human papilloma virus (HPV)]], which can cause [[cervical cancer]], [[penile cancer]], [[oral cancer]], and [[genital warts]]. Immunization before initiation of sexual activity increases effectiveness of these vaccines.
* Limiting numbers of sexual partners, particularly casual sexual partners, or restricting sexual activity to those who know and share their STI status, can also reduce STI risks. [[Monogamy]] or [[polyfidelity]], practiced faithfully, is very safe (as far as STIs are concerned) when all partners are non-infected. However, many monogamous people have been infected with sexually transmitted diseases by partners who are [[Adultery|sexually unfaithful]], have used injection drugs, or were infected by previous sexual partners. The same risks apply to polyfidelitous people, who face higher risks depending on how many people are in the polyfidelitous group.
* [[Communication]] with sexual partners about sexual history and STI status, preferred safe sex practices, and acceptable risks for partnered sexual activities.
* Engaging in less-risky sexual activities. In general, solo sexual activities are less risky than partnered activities. Sexual penetration of orifices (mouth, vagina, anus) and sharing body fluids (such as semen, blood, vaginal fluids, and rectal mucus) between sexual partners carry the most risk for STIs. 
* Regular STI testing and treatment, especially by those who are sexually active with more than one casual sexual partner.&lt;ref name=Kahn&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kahn | first = J.

==Ineffective methods==
===General===
Most methods of contraception are not effective at preventing the spread of [[Sexually transmitted disease|STI]]s. This includes [[birth control pills]], [[vasectomy]], [[tubal ligation]], [[Fertility awareness|periodic abstinence]], [[IUD]]s and many non-barrier methods of pregnancy prevention. However, condoms are highly effective for birth control and STI prevention.

The [[spermicide]] [[Nonoxynol-9]] has been claimed to reduce the likelihood of STI transmission. However, a technical report&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/68510/1/WHO_RHR_03.08.pdf|title=Technical Consultation on Nonoxynol-9|last=|first=|date=October 2001|website=WHO|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[World Health Organization]]  has shown that Nonoxynol-9 is an irritant and can produce tiny tears in mucous membranes, which may increase the risk of transmission by offering [[pathogen]]s more easy points of entry into the system. They reported that Nonoxynol-9 lubricant do not have enough spermicide to increase contraceptive effectiveness cautioned they should not be promoted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use of a [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] or [[contraceptive sponge]] provides some women with better protection against certain sexually transmitted diseases,&lt;ref name="TechInd"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n19_v141/ai_12248743/ |title=Diaphragm and sponge protect against STDs - sexually transmitted diseases |accessdate=5 April 2010 |work=Science News |first=Kathy A. |last=Fackelmann |year=1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404015828/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n19_v141/ai_12248743/ |archivedate=4 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are not effective for all STIs.

Hormonal methods of preventing pregnancy (such as oral contraceptives [i.e. 'The pill'], depoprogesterone, hormonal IUDs, the vaginal ring, and the patch) offer no protection against STIs. The copper intrauterine device and the hormonal intrauterine device provide an up to 99% protection against pregnancies but no protection against STIs. Women with copper intrauterine device ''may'' be subject to greater risk of infection from bacterial infectious such as [[gonorrhea]] or [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], although this is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hubacher|first=David|date=November 2014|title=Intrauterine devices &amp; infection: Review of the literature |journal=The Indian Journal of Medical Research|volume=140|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S53–S57|pmc=4345753|pmid=25673543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coitus interruptus]] (or "pulling out"), in which the penis is removed from the vagina, [[anus]], or [[mouth]] before [[ejaculation]], may reduce transmission of STIs but still carries significant risk. This is because [[pre-ejaculate]], a fluid that oozes from the penile [[urethra]] before ejaculation, may contain STI pathogens. Additionally, the microbes responsible for some diseases, including [[genital wart]]s and [[syphilis]], can be transmitted through skin-to-skin or mucous membrane contact.

===Anal sex===
Unprotected [[anal sex|anal penetration]] is considered a high-risk sexual activity because the thin tissues of the anus and [[rectum]] can be easily damaged.&lt;ref name="Dean and Delvin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anal sex|first= John |last=Dean |first2=David |last2=Delvin|publisher=Netdoctor.co.uk|accessdate=29 April 2010| url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sexandrelationships/analsex.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Voeller B.

This includes penetration of the anus by fingers, hands, or sex [[Sex toy|toys]] such as [[dildo]]s. Also, condoms may be more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex, increasing the risk of STI transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Can I get HIV from anal sex? | url = http://aids.about.com/od/technicalquestions/f/oral.htm | accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main risk which individuals are exposed to when performing anal sex is the transmission of [[HIV]]. Other possible infections include [[Hepatitis A]], [[Hepatitis B|B]] and [[Hepatitis C|C]]; [[Intestinal parasite infection|intestinal parasite infections]] like ''[[Giardia]]''; and bacterial infections such as ''[[Escherichia coli]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/analsex.html|title=Anal Sex|last=|first=|date=|website=CDC|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anal sex should be avoided by couples in which one of the partners has been diagnosed with an STI until the treatment has proven to be effective.

In order to make anal sex safer, the couple must ensure that the anal area is clean and the bowel empty and the partner on whom anal penetration occurs should be able to relax.  Regardless of whether anal penetration occurs by using a finger or the penis, the condom is the best barrier method to prevent transmission of STI. [[Enema|Enemas]] should be not be used as they can increase the risk of HIV infection&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carballo-Diéguez|first=Alex|last2=Bauermeister|first2=José A.|last3=Ventuneac|first3=Ana|last4=Dolezal|first4=Curtis|last5=Balan|first5=Ivan|last6=Remien|first6=Robert H.|date=2008-11-01|title=The Use of Rectal Douches among HIV-uninfected and Infected Men who Have Unprotected Receptive Anal Intercourse: Implications for Rectal Microbicides|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-007-9301-0|journal=AIDS and Behavior|language=en|volume=12|issue=6|pages=860–866|doi=10.1007/s10461-007-9301-0|issn=1090-7165|pmc=2953367}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[lymphogranuloma venereum]] [[proctitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Vries|first=Henry J.

Since the rectum can be easily damaged, the use of lubricants is highly recommended even when penetration occurs by using the finger. Especially for beginners, using a condom on the finger is both a protection measure against STI and a lubricant source. Most condoms are lubricated and they allow less painful and easier penetration.  Oil-based lubricants damage latex and should not be used with condoms;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner |first1=M. |last2=Piedrahita |first2=C. |last3=Glover |first3=L. |last4=Joanis |first4=C. |last5=Spruyt |first5=A. |last6=Foldesy |first6=R. | year = 1993 | title = The impact of lubricants on latex condoms during vaginal intercourse | url = http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA620.pdf| journal = International Journal of STD and AIDS | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 29–36 | doi=10.1177/095646249400500108}}&lt;/ref&gt; water-based and silicone-based [[lubricant]]s are available instead.

Anal stimulation with a sex toy requires similar safety measures to anal penetration with a penis, in this case using a condom on the sex toy in a similar way.

It is important that the man washes and cleans his penis after anal intercourse if he intends to penetrate the vagina. Bacteria from the rectum are easily transferred to the vagina, which may cause [[Vaginal infection|vaginal]] and [[Urinary tract infection|urinary tract infections]].&lt;ref name="SHR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexual-health-resource.org/anal_sex.htm#aidsanal |title=Anal Sex  - Facts and Safe Sex Information |accessdate=5 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404055257/http://www.sexual-health-resource.org/anal_sex.htm#aidsanal |archive-date=4 April 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When anal-oral contact occurs, protection is required since this is a [[risky sexual behavior]] in which illnesses as Hepatitis A or STIs can be easily transmitted, as well as enteric infections. The dental dam or the plastic wrap&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/225855360|title=HIVAIDS care &amp; counselling : a multidisciplinary approach|last=Van Dyk |first=Alta C. | date=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education South Africa|isbn=9781770251717|edition=4th|location=Cape Town|oclc=225855360|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; are effective protection means whenever anilingus is performed.

==Sex toys==
[[Image:Zwei unterschiedliche Butt-Plugs.jpg|right|thumb|Two [[butt plugs|sex toys intended for anal use]] (note the flared bases)]]
Putting a condom on a [[sex toy]] provides better sexual hygiene and can help to prevent transmission of infections if the sex toy is shared, provided the condom is replaced when used by a different partner. Some sex toys are made of porous materials, and pores retain viruses and bacteria, which makes it necessary to clean sex toys thoroughly, preferably with use of cleaners specifically for sex toys. Glass is non-porous and medical grade glass sex toys more easily sterilized between uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kinseyconfidential.org/safety-dance-sex-toy-safety-generation/|title=The Safety Dance: Sex Toy Safety for a New Generation|work=Kinsey Confidential|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases in which one of the partners is treated for an STI, it is recommended that the couple not use sex toys until the treatment has proved to be effective.

All sex toys have to be properly cleaned after use. The way in which a sex toy is cleaned varies on the type of material it is made of. Some sex toys can be boiled or cleaned in a dishwasher. Most of the sex toys come with advice on the best way to clean and store them and these instructions should be carefully followed.&lt;ref name="NHS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1690.aspx?CategoryID=118&amp;SubCategoryID=122 |title=Are sex toys safe? |accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sex toy should be cleaned not only when it is shared with other individuals but also when it is used on different parts of the body (such as mouth, vagina or anus).

A sex toy should regularly be checked for scratches or breaks that can be breeding ground for [[bacteria]]. It is best if the damaged sex toy is replaced by a new undamaged one. Even more [[hygiene]] protection should be considered by pregnant women when using sex toys. Sharing any type of sex toy that may draw [[blood]], like whips or needles, is not recommended, and is not safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1690.aspx?categoryid=118&amp;subcategoryid=122|title=Are sex toys safe? - Health questions - NHS Choices|first=N. H. S.|last=Choices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When using sex toys in the anus, sex toys "...can easily get lost" as "rectal muscles contract and can suck an object up and up, potentially obstructing the colon"; to prevent this serious problem, sex toy users are advised to use sex "...toys with a flared base or a string".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/good-vibrations-us-consumer-web-site-aims-to-enhance-sex-toy-safety/|title=Good Vibrations: U.S. Consumer Web Site Aims to Enhance Sex Toy Safety|first=Regina|last=Nuzzo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstinence==
[[Sexual abstinence]] reduces STIs and pregnancy risks associated with [[Human sexual activity|sexual contact]], but STIs may also be transmitted through non-sexual means, or by [[rape]]. HIV may be transmitted through contaminated needles used in [[tattoo]]ing, [[body piercing]], or [[Injection (medicine)|injections]]. Medical or dental procedures using contaminated instruments can also spread HIV, while some health-care workers have acquired HIV through occupational exposure to accidental injuries with needles.&lt;!--

{{marketing}}
'''Social marketing''' is the use of marketing theory, skills and practices to achieve social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/social-marketing.html|title=What is social marketing? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the primary goal of achieving "[[Common good|social good]]". Traditional [[commercial marketing]] aims are primarily financial, though they can have positive social affects as well. In the context of public health, social marketing would promote general health, raise awareness and induce changes in behaviour. To see social marketing as only the use of standard commercial marketing practices to achieve non-commercial goals is an [[oversimplification|oversimplified view]].  

Social marketing seeks to develop and integrate [[marketing]] concepts with other approaches to [[social change]]. Social marketing aims to influence behaviors that benefit individuals and communities for the greater social good. The goal is to deliver competition-sensitive and segmented social change programs that are effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authors=International Social Marketing Association, European Social Marketing Association &amp; Australian Association of Social Marketing|year=2013|title=Consensus Definition of Social Marketing|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Increasingly, social marketing is described as having "two parents." The "social parent" uses [[social science]] and [[social policy]] approaches. The "marketing parent" uses commercial and public sector [[marketing]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Truss|first=Aiden|title=Social Marketing and Public Health: Theory and practice|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsEijRnC8GYC|editor=Jeff French |editor2=Clive Blair-Stevens |editor3=Dominic McVey |editor4=Rowena Merritt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent years have also witnessed a broader focus.  Social marketing now goes beyond influencing individual behaviour. It promotes socio-cultural and structural change relevant to social issues.&lt;ref name="Strategic Social Marketing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=French|first1=Jeff|last2=Gordon|first2=Ross|title=Strategic Social Marketing|date=2015|publisher=Sage|isbn=9781446248621|url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/strategic-social-marketing/book237965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, social marketing scholars are beginning to advocate for a broader definition of social marketing: "social marketing is the application of marketing principles to enable individual and collective ideas and actions in the pursuit of effective, efficient, equitable, fair and sustained social transformation".
The new emphasis gives equal weight to the effects (efficiency and effectiveness) and the process (equity, fairness and sustainability) of social marketing programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Saunders, S. G.|author2=Barrington, D. J.|author3=Sridharan, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2015|title=Redefining social marketing: beyond behavioural change|journal=Journal of Social Marketing|volume=5|issue=2|pages=160–168|doi=10.1108/JSOCM-03-2014-0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications ==
The first documented evidence of the deliberate use of marketing to address a social issue comes from a 1963 [[reproductive health]] program led by [[K. T. Chandy]] at the Indian Institute of Management in Calcutta, India.  Chandy and colleagues proposed, and subsequently implemented, a national [[family planning]] program with high quality, government brand condoms distributed and sold throughout the country at low cost. The program included an integrated consumer marketing campaign run with active point of sale promotion. Retailers were trained to sell the product aggressively, and a new organization was created to implement the program.&lt;ref&gt;Chandy, K.T., Balakrishman, T.R., Kantawalla, J.M., Mohan, K., Sen, N.P., Gupta, S.S. &amp; Srivastva, S. (1965). Proposals for family planning promotion: A marketing plan. Studies in Family Planning;1(6):7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Developing country|developing countries]], the use of social marketing expanded to [[Prevention of HIV/AIDS|HIV prevention]], control of childhood [[diarrhea]] (through the use of [[Oral rehydration therapy|oral re-hydration therapies]]), [[malaria]] control and treatment, [[Portable water purification|point-of-use water treatment]], [[Self-supply of water and sanitation|on-site sanitation]] methods and the provision of basic health services.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R. C. (2011). An integrative model for social marketing. Journal of Social Marketing;1:54–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health promotion campaigns began applying social marketing in practice in the 1980s. In the United States, The National High Blood Pressure Education Program&lt;ref&gt;Roccella, E.J. &amp; Ward, G.W. (1984). The National High Blood Pressure Education Program: A description of its utility as a generic program model. Health Education Quarterly, 11(3): 225-242&lt;/ref&gt; and the community heart disease prevention studies in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and at Stanford University&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1988"&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. &amp; Flora, J.A. (1988). Social Marketing and Public Health Intervention (Portable Document Format). Health Education Quarterly; 15 (3): 300, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach to address population-based risk factor behaviour change. Notable early developments also took place in Australia. These included the Victoria Cancer Council developing its [[smoking cessation|anti-tobacco]] campaign "Quit" (1988) and "SunSmart" (1988), its campaign against [[skin cancer]] which had the slogan "[[Slip-Slop-Slap|Slip! Slop! Slap!]]"&lt;ref name="VicHealth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/en/About-VicHealth/VicHealth-History-Major-Events-and-Milestones.aspx |title=VicHealth History: Major Events and Milestones |work=VicHealth |publisher=Victorian Health Promotion Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719032451/http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/en/About-VicHealth/VicHealth-History-Major-Events-and-Milestones.aspx |archivedate=2009-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, the field has rapidly expanded around the world to include active living communities, disaster preparedness and response, [[ecosystem]] and species conservation, environmental issues, development of volunteer or indigenous workforces, financial literacy, global threats of [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]], government corruption, improving the quality of health care, injury prevention, landowner education, [[marine conservation]] and ocean sustainability, patient-centered health care, reducing health disparities, [[sustainable consumption]], transportation demand management, [[water treatment]] and [[sanitation]] systems and youth gambling problems, among other social needs (See&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (2013) Social marketing and social change: Strategies and tools for improving health, well-being and the environment. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lefebvre, R.C. 2013"&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (Ed). Social marketing: Six volume set. London: SAGE Publications, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;).

On a wider front, by 2007, government in the United Kingdom announced the development of its first social marketing strategy for all aspects of health.&lt;ref name="DeptofHealth2004"&gt;UK Department of Health, ''[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4094550 Choosing Health: Making Healthy Choices Easier]'', Cmd.6374 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the US national health objectives&lt;ref name="HealthyPeople2020"&gt;US Department of Health and Human Services, ''[http://healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/objectiveslist.aspx?topicId=18 Health Communication and Health Information Technology]''&lt;/ref&gt; included increasing the number of state health departments that report using social marketing in health promotion and disease prevention programs and increasing the number of schools of public health that offer courses and workforce development activities in social marketing.

Two other public health applications include the CDC's CDCynergy training and software application&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthmarketing/cdcynergy/ |title=CDC - CDCynergy (NCHM) |accessdate=2007-10-19 |date=2006-06-27 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SMART (Social Marketing and Assessment Response Tool) in the U.S.&lt;ref name="SMART"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CTG/is_2-3_18/ai_108194963/ |title=Positioning Social Marketing as a Planning Process for Health Education |accessdate=2012-01-13 |last= Neiger |first=Brad L. |author2=Rosemary Thackeray |author3=Michael D. Barnes |author4= James F. McKenzie  |year=2003 |journal=American Journal of Health Studies |volume=18 |issue=2/3 |pages=75–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social marketing theory and practice has been progressed in several countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK, and in the latter a number of key government policy papers have adopted a strategic social marketing approach. Publications such as "Choosing Health" in 2004,&lt;ref name="DeptofHealth2004"/&gt; "[http://www.nsmcentre.org.uk/component/remository/NSMC-Publications/Its-Our-Health-%28Summary-Report%29/ It's our health!]" in 2006 and "[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4139514 Health Challenge England]" in 2006, represent steps to achieve a strategic and operational use of social marketing. In India, [[AIDS]] controlling programs are largely using social marketing and social workers are largely working for it. Most of the social workers are professionally trained for this task.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

A variation of social marketing has emerged as a systematic way to foster more sustainable behavior. Referred to as community-based social marketing (CBSM) by Canadian environmental psychologist Doug McKenzie-Mohr, CBSM strives to change the behavior of communities to reduce their impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie-Mohr, D. (2000). Fostering sustainable behavior through community-based social marketing. American Psychologist, 55(5), 531-537.&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that simply providing information is usually not sufficient to initiate behavior change, CBSM uses tools and findings from social psychology to discover the perceived barriers to behavior change and ways of overcoming these barriers. Among the tools and techniques used by CBSM are focus groups and surveys (to discover barriers) and commitments, prompts, social norms, social diffusion, feedback and incentives (to change behavior). The tools of CBSM have been used to foster sustainable behavior in many areas, including energy conservation,&lt;ref&gt;Schultz P. W., Nolan J. M., Cialdini R. B., Goldstein N. J., Griskevicius Vladas (2007). The Constructive, Destructive, and Reconstructive Power of Social Norms. ''Psychological Science'', 18(5), 429-434.&lt;/ref&gt; environmental regulation&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, A. (2010). Using Community-Based Social Marketing Techniques to Enhance Environmental Regulation. ''Sustainability'', 2(4), 1138-1160&lt;/ref&gt; and recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Haldeman, T. &amp; Turner, J. (2009). Implementing a community-based social marketing program to increase recycling. ''Social Marketing Quarterly'', 15(3), 114-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the concept of strategic social marketing has emerged, which identifies that social change requires action at the individual, community, socio-cultural, political and environmental level, and that social marketing can and should influence policy, strategy and operational tactics to achieve pro-social outcomes.&lt;ref name="Strategic Social Marketing"/&gt;

Other social marketing can be aimed at products deemed, at least by proponents, as socially unacceptable. One of the most notable is [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) which for many years has waged social marketing campaigns against the use of natural fur products. The campaigns' efficacy has been subject to dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peek|first=Liz|title=Warm Weather Torments City Furriers|url=http://www.nysun.com/business/warm-weather-torments-city-furriers/43889/|accessdate=12 March 2013|newspaper=New York Sun|date=November 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all social marketing campaigns are effective everywhere. For example, anti-smoking campaigns such as [[World No Tobacco Day]] while being successful (in concert with government tobacco controls) in curbing the demand for tobacco products in North America and in parts of Europe, have been less effective in other parts of the world such as China, India and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Fedyashin, [Opinion &amp; Analysis: World No Tobacco Day, Futile Attempt to Curb Smoking. http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20090529/155119204.html], RiaNovosti (Russia), May 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[Prevalence of tobacco consumption]])

Social marketing uses the benefits of doing social good to secure and maintain [[customer engagement]]. In social marketing the distinguishing feature is therefore its "primary focus on social good, and it is not a secondary outcome.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Not all public sector and not-for-profit marketing is social marketing.

Public sector bodies can use standard marketing approaches to improve the promotion of their relevant services and organizational aims. This can be very important but should not be confused with social marketing where the focus is on achieving specific behavioral goals with specific audiences in relation to topics relevant to social good (e.g., health, sustainability, recycling, etc.). For example, a 3-month marketing campaign to encourage people to get a H1N1 vaccine is more tactical in nature and should not be considered social marketing. A campaign that promotes and reminds people to get regular check-ups and all of their vaccinations when they're supposed to encourages a long-term behavior change that benefits society. It can therefore be considered social marketing.

Social marketing can be confused with commercial marketing. A commercial marketer may only seek to influence a buyer to purchase a product. Social marketers have more difficult goals.  They want to make potentially difficult and long-term behavior changes in target populations, which may or may not involve purchasing a product.  For example, reducing cigarette smoking or encouraging use of condoms have difficult challenges to overcome that go beyond purchasing decisions.

Social marketing is sometimes seen as being restricted to a client base of non-profit organizations, health services groups, the government agency. However, the goal of inducing social change is not restricted to this narrow spectrum of organizations. Corporations, for example, can be clients.  Public relations or social responsibility departments may champion social causes such funding for the arts, which would involve social marketing.

Social marketing should not be confused with the societal marketing concept which was a forerunner of [[sustainable marketing]] in integrating issues of [[corporate social responsibility|social responsibility]] into commercial marketing strategies. In contrast to that, social marketing uses commercial marketing theories, tools and techniques to social issues.

Social marketing applies a "customer oriented" approach and uses the concepts and tools used by commercial marketers in pursuit of social goals like anti-smoking campaigns or fund raising for NGOs.

Social marketers must create competitive advantage by constantly adapting to and instigating change. With climate change in mind, adaptations to market changes are likely to be more successful if actions are guided by knowledge of the forces shaping market behaviours and insights that enable the development of sustainable competitive advantages.&lt;ref&gt;Shocker, Allan D., Rajendra K. Srivastava, and Robert W. Ruekert. "Challenges and Opportunities Facing Brand Management: An Introduction to the Special Issue." Journal of Marketing Research 31.2 (1994): 149. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Jupitermedia]] announced its "Social Marketing" service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialmarketing.blogs.com/r_craiig_lefebvres_social/2006/08/hello_jupiter_a.html |title=Hello Jupiter?

Despite protests from the social marketing communities over the perceived hijacking of the term, Jupiter stuck with the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/schatsky/archives/016969.html |title=Social Marketing vs. Social Marketing |accessdate=2006-09-01 |last=Schatsky |first=David |date=2006-09-01 |work=Jupiterresearch Analyst Weblogs |publisher=Jupitermedia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303050738/http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/schatsky/archives/016969.html |archivedate=2007-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jupiter's approach is more correctly (and commonly) referred to as [[social media optimization]].

==History ==

Many scholars ascribe the beginning of the field of social marketing to an article published by G.D. Wiebe in the Winter 1951-1952 edition of ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiebe|first=G.D.|title=Merchandising Commodities and Citizenship on Television|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1951–1952|volume=15|issue=Winter|pages=679|doi=10.1086/266353}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Wiebe posed a rhetorical question: "Why can’t you sell brotherhood and rational thinking like you can sell soap?” He then went on to discuss what he saw as the challenges of attempting to sell a social good as if it were a commodity, thus identifying social marketing (though he did not label it as such) as a discipline unique from c
mmodity marketing. Yet, Wilkie &amp; Moore (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W. L., &amp; Moore, E. S. (2003). Scholarly research in marketing: Exploring the “4 eras” of thought development. Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing; 22(2):116–146.&lt;/ref&gt; note that the marketing discipline has been involved with questions about the intersection of marketing and society since its earliest days as a discipline.

A decade later, organizations such as the [[KfW Entwicklungsbank]] in Germany, the Canadian International Development Agency, the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs in The Netherlands, UK Department for International Development, [[US Agency for International Development]], [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]] began sponsoring social marketing interventions to improve family planning and achieve other social goals in Africa, Sri Lanka, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Michael|title=The Marketing Book|year=2012|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford|pages=696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=R. Craig|title=Social Marketing and Social Change: Strategies and Tools to Improve Health, Well-Being and the Environment\year=2013|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next milestone in the evolution of social marketing was the publication of "Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change" in the ''[[Journal of Marketing]]'' by [[Philip Kotler]] and [[Gerald Zaltman]].&lt;ref name="Kotler 1971"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kotler|first=Philip|author2=Gerald Zaltman |title=Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change|journal=Journal of Marketing|date=July 1971|volume=35|pages=3–12|url=https://www.sfu.ca/cmns/faculty/laba_m/425/07-fall/documents/Kotler-Zaltman.PDF|doi=10.2307/1249783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kotler and Zaltman coined the term 'social marketing' and defined it as "the design, implementation, and control of programs calculated to influence the acceptability of social ideas and involving considerations of product planning, pricing, communication, distribution, and marketing research." They conclude that "social marketing appears to represent a bridging mechanism which links the behavior scientist's knowledge of human behavior with the socially useful implementation of what that knowledge allows."

Craig Lefebvre and June Flora introduced social marketing to the public health community in 1988,&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1988"/&gt; where it has been most widely used and explored. They noted that there was a need for "large scale, broad-based, behavior change focused programs" to improve public health (the community wide prevention of cardiovascular diseases in their respective projects) and outlined eight essential components of social marketing that still hold today:
#A consumer orientation to realize organizational (social) goals
#An emphasis on the voluntary exchanges of goods and services between providers and consumers
#Research in audience analysis and segmentation strategies
#The use of formative research in product and message design and the pretesting of these materials
#An analysis of distribution (or communication) channels
#Use of the [[marketing mix]]—using and blending product, price, place and promotion characteristics in intervention planning and implementation
#A process tracking system with both integrative and control functions
#A management process that involves problem analysis, planning, implementation and feedback functions&lt;ref name="Lefebvre"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lefebvre |first=R. Craig |author2=June A. Flora  |year=1988 |title=Social Marketing and Public Health Intervention |journal=Health Education Quarterly |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=300, 301 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |url=http://socialmarketing.blogs.com/Publications/Social_Marketing_and_Public_Health_Intervention.pdf |format=Portable Document Format |accessdate=2008-04-30 |doi=10.1177/109019818801500305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of what they termed "social change campaigns", Kotler and [[Ned Roberto]] introduced the subject by writing, "A social change campaign is an organized effort conducted by one group (the change agent) which attempts to persuade others (the target adopters) to accept, modify, or abandon certain ideas, attitudes, practices or behavior." Their 1989 text was updated in 2002 by [[Philip Kotler]], [[Ned Roberto]] and Nancy Lee.&lt;ref name="Kotler2002"&gt;Kotler, Philip, Ned Roberto and Nancy Lee. ''Social Marketing: Improving the Quality of Life'', SAGE, 2002. ({{ISBN|0-7619-2434-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[University of Stirling]] was the first university to open a dedicated research institute to Social Marketing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ism.stir.ac.uk/|title=Institute for Social Marketing – University of Stirling|author=|date=|website=www.ism.stir.ac.uk|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2007, [[Middlesex University]] became the first university to offer a specialized [[postgraduate]] programme in Health &amp; Social Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/marketing/health_soc_marketing_ma.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524003618/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/marketing/health_soc_marketing_ma.aspx |archivedate=2010-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been an important development to distinguish between "strategic social marketing" and "operational social marketing".

Much of the literature and case examples focus on operational social marketing, using it to achieve specific behavioral goals in relation to different audiences and topics. However, there has been increasing efforts to ensure social marketing goes "upstream" and is used much more strategically to inform policy formulation and strategy development. Here the focus is less on specific audience and topic work but uses strong customer understanding and insight to inform and guide effective policy and strategy development.

Social marketing is also being explored as a method for social innovation, a framework to increase the adoption of evidence-based practices among professionals and organizations, and as a core skill for public sector managers and social entrepreneurs. It is being viewed as an approach to design more effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable approaches to enhance social well-being that extends beyond individual behavior change to include creating positive shifts in social networks and social norms, businesses, markets and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (2013). Social marketing and social change: Strategies and tools for improving health, well-being and the environment. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many examples exist of social marketing research, with over 120 papers compiled in a six volume set.&lt;ref name="Lefebvre, R.C. 2013"/&gt;). For example, research now shows ways to reduce the intentions of people to binge drink or engage in dangerous driving. Martin, Lee, Weeks and Kaya (2013) suggests that understanding consumer personality and how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of the harmful effects of binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense of who they are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person’s close friends.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Brett A. S., Christina K.C. Lee, Clinton Weeks and Maria Kaya (2013), [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Martin-et-al.-2013.pdf "How to stop binge drinking and speeding motorists: Effects of relational-interdependent self-construable and self-referencing on attitudes toward social marketing "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160914/http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Martin-et-al.-2013.pdf |date=2015-04-27 }}, ''Journal of Consumer Behavior'', 12, 81-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social quality looks at elements that should constitute a good or decent society. It contributes to the body of work concerned with understanding social progress going beyond [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], taking into account the work of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and the [[European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions]]. Whilst most approaches have concentrated on the [[happiness economics|economics]] or [[Subjective well-being|psychology of well-being]], social quality can help understanding the social conditions that enable human flourishing.&lt;ref name="social quality"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbott |first=Pamela |last2=Wallace |first2=Claire |date=2012 |title=Social Quality: A way to measure the quality of society |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=153–167 |doi=10.1007/s11205-011-9871-0 |pmid=22773884 |pmc=3384781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Social quality.png|400px|right|Social quality diagram]]

There are four elements shown in the diagram on the right. ''Economic security'' refers to the material conditions that enable people to have a long term perspective on their lives, and their confidence for the future. This can include social policies, such as pensions and social security, that ensure this. It also includes economic conditions that enable people to feel secure because they have enough income to cover their basic needs.&lt;ref name="social quality" /&gt; ''Social cohesion'' refers to the bonds that link societies together, deriving from the work of [[Émile Durkheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durkheim |first=Émile |date=1952 |title=Suicide. A Study in Sociology |location=London |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durkheim |first=Émile |date=1952 |title=The Division of Labour in Society|location=New York |publisher=Free Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]]'s work considers the moral and social relationships between members of society and social groups, including factors such as trust in others, trust in social institutions, a sense of identity, a collective consciousness, solidarity  and commitment to the common good of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dragolov |first=Georgi |last2=Ignácz |first2=Zsófia |last3=Lorenz |first3=Jan |last4=Delhey |first4=Jan| last5=Boehnke |first5=Klaus |date=2013 |title=Social Cohesion Radar. Measuring Common Ground. An international Comparison of Social Cohesion|location=Gutersloh |publisher=Bertelsmann }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social inclusion'' refers to the way in which individuals and social groups are included into society, either through employment, networks and family or through access to social support of various kinds, this can come through support from other people or from social policies. Social policies that foster social inclusion, reduce poverty and tackle other forms of social exclusion can be important in this respect.&lt;ref name="social quality" /&gt; ''Social empowerment'' refers to the conditions that enable people to participate in their society, such as having good health, education and democratic opportunities for participation, such as voting and joining civil society. However, it can also mean the feelings of being empowered, being able to take control of one's circumstances. It derives from the work of [[Amartya Sen]], who suggests that people need to have the capability to be able to do the things that they wish to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sen |first=Amartya |editor-last=Nussbaum |editor-first=Martha Craven |editor-last2=Sen |editor-first2=Amartya|title=The Quality of Life |location=London|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=1993 |chapter=Capability and Well-being }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the social quality approach is fundamentally relational. As such, it emphasises a complex field of conditional (i), constitutional (ii) and normative factors (iii). These are (i) Socio-Economic Security, Social Cohesion, Social Inclusion, Social Empowerment; (ii) Person/human security, Social Recognition, Social Responsiveness, Personal/human Capacity; and (iii) Social Justice (Equity), Solidarity, Equal Valuation, Human Dignity. On the one hand this rejects the Durkheimian view on society as an independent social fact sui generis; on the other hand it qualifies Sen's approach as social quality is not primarily focusing on the subjective side and individuals within society but on the constitution of society by way of people producing and reproducing their daily life and with this society.

==Origins and development==
The idea of social quality began as a [[European Union]] project among a group of social scientists, concerned to develop a better way forward for social policies in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Wolfang |last2=van der Maesen |first2=Laurent |last3=Walker |first3=Alan |date=1997 |title=The Social Quality of Europe|location=The Hague |publisher=Kluwer Law International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Wolfang |last2=van der Maesen |first2=Laurent |last3=Walker |first3=Alan |last4=Thomes |first4=Fleur |date=2001 |title=Social Quality: A Vision for Europe|location=The Hague |publisher=Kluwer Law International }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |editor-last=van der Maesen |editor-first=Laurent |editor-last2=Walker |editor-first2=Alan |date=2012 |title=Social Quality. From Theory to Indicators|location=London |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the concept underwent some fundamental development. Empirically it had been developed amongst others by Pamela Abbott, [[Claire Wallace]] and Roger Sapsford, who looked at how the model can be developed empirically in Europe, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]], China and [[Rwanda]]. They have used a different variation, considering the impact on well being, measured through [[life satisfaction]] and human flourishing in order to understand how social quality might work in fostering the well being of people in society.&lt;ref name="social quality" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Pamela| last2=Wallace| first2=Claire |editor-last=Selin|editor-first=Helaine |editor-last2=Gareth|editor-first2=Gaveth|title=Happiness across Cultures: Views of Happiness and Quality of Life in Non-Western Cultures  |location=London|publisher=Springer Verlag|date=2012 |chapter=Happiness in Post-Conflict Rwanda| pages= 361–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Pamela| last2=Wallace| first2=Claire |editor-last=Selin|editor-first=Helaine |editor-last2=Gareth|editor-first2=Gaveth|title=Happiness across Cultures: Views of Happiness and Quality of Life in Non-Western Cultures  |location=London|publisher=Springer Verlag|date=2012 |chapter=Satisfaction and Societal Quality in Kazakhstan| pages= 107–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbott |first=Pamela |last2=Wallace |first2=Claire |date=2014 |title='Rising economic prosperity and social quality.

This empirical work had been to a large extent emerging from the work undertaken by colleagues in Asia, in particular by Ka Lin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lin |first=Ka |last2=Herrmann |first2=Peter |date=2015 |title=Social Quality Theory. A New Perspective on Social Development|location=New York/Oxford |publisher=Berghahn}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another development is by a marked shift towards questions around 'overall sustainability'. Laurent van der Maesen is the main proponent of this strand contends. In a working paper we read that "international and national (and urban) strategies and policies for development toward 'overall' sustainability not only have to have a strong emphasis on development toward sustainability of cities themselves (internal sustainability) but also – simultaneously – address the development toward sustainability of the cities' surroundings ('Hinterland')".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=International Association of Social Quality  |date=2012 |title=The need for a Comprehensive Conceptual and Methodological Framework for new politics and policies: A social quality perspective; A contribution to the Rio+ 20 Conference on the sustainability of human existence on Earth |journal=IASQ working papers |issue=11 |pages=12 f.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more traditional line is maintained by [[Peter Herrmann (social philosopher)|Peter Herrmann]] who had been since the end of the 1990s advisor of the then European Foundation, later International Association of Social Quality. He claims that 
"[w]e have to reconceptualize ... indicators. They are not measurement instruments sui generis. Rather they are instruments to develop an understanding of complex issues and trends. As such they need to be guided by a sound conceptual reflection of what they are looking for".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herrmann |first=Peter |date=2012 |title=Economic Performance, Social Progress and Social Quality |journal=International Journal of Social Quality |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=41–55 |doi=10.3167/IJSQ.2012.020104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Herrmann is on the one hand reclaiming the methodological and theoretical importance of Social Quality thinking, at least qualifying the empirical orientation. On the other hand, though this does not contradict the orientation on sustainability, Herrmann emphasises the need to reorient debates on "the kind of economy in place" instead of maintaining dichotomies, separations and hierarchies between different areas of societal development. This had been elaborated in a book on defining social policy as matter of producing society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herrmann |first=Peter  |date=2014 |title=Social Policy – Production rather than Distribution. A Rights-Based Approach|location=Bremen |publisher=EHV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soil conservation''' is the preventing of soil loss from [[erosion]] or reduced fertility caused by over usage, acidification, salinization or other chemical [[soil contamination]].

[[Slash-and-burn]] and other unsustainable methods of [[subsistence farming]] are practiced in some lesser developed areas. A sequel to the deforestation is typically large scale [[erosion]], loss of soil nutrients and sometimes total [[desertification]]. Techniques for improved soil conservation include [[crop rotation]], [[cover crop]]s, [[Tillage#Conservation tillage|conservation tillage]] and planted [[windbreak]]s and affect both erosion and fertility. When plants, especially trees, die, they decay and become part of the soil. Code 330 defines standard methods recommended by the U.S. [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]].
Farmers have practiced soil conservation for millennia. In Europe, policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy are targeting the application of best management practices such as reduced tillage, winter cover crops,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panagos|first=Panos|last2=Borrelli|first2=Pasquale|last3=Meusburger|first3=Katrin|last4=Alewell|first4=Christine|last5=Lugato|first5=Emanuele|last6=Montanarella|first6=Luca|title=Estimating the soil erosion cover-management factor at the European scale|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264837715001611|journal=Land Use Policy|volume=48|pages=38–50|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.05.021|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; plant residues and grass margins in order to better address the soil conservation.Political and economic action is further required to solve the erosion problem. A simple governance hurdle concerns how we name and value the land and what we call it and this can be changed by cultural adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panagos|first=Panos|last2=Imeson|first2=Anton|last3=Meusburger|first3=Katrin|last4=Borrelli|first4=Pasquale|last5=Poesen|first5=Jean|last6=Alewell|first6=Christine|date=2016-08-01|title=Soil Conservation in Europe: Wish or Reality?|journal=Land Degradation &amp; Development|language=en|volume=27|issue=6|pages=1547–1551|doi=10.1002/ldr.2538|issn=1099-145X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contour ploughing  ==
[[Contour ploughing]] orients furrows following the [[contour line]]s of the farmed area. Furrows move left and right to maintain a constant altitude, which reduces [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. Contour ploughing was practiced by the ancient [[Phoenicia]]ns, and is effective for slopes between two and ten percent.&lt;ref&gt;''Predicting soil erosion by water, a guide to conservation planning in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation'', [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Agricultural Research Service, Agricultural handbook no. 703 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Contour plowing can increase crop yields from 10 to 50 percent, partially as a result of greater soil retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/contourfarmingbo23unit|title=Contour farming boosts yields: a farmer's guide in laying out key contour lines and establishing grassed waterways|last=United States. Department of Agriculture|first=National Agricultural Library|date=1943-01-01|publisher=[Washington, D.C.] : U.S. Dept. of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Terrace Farming ==
[[terrace (agriculture)|Terracing]] is the practice of creating nearly level areas in a hillside area. The terraces form a series of steps, each at a higher level than the previous. Terraces are protected from erosion by other soil barriers.

Terraced farming is more common on small farms and in underdeveloped countries, since mechanized equipment is difficult to deploy in this setting.
It protects the soil from its erosion. It is one of the way by which soil erosion can be stopped. It is the step can be cut out on the slopes making terraces. It restricts soil erosion. It is practiced in western and central Himalayas

== Keyline design ==

[[Keyline design]] is an enhancement of contour farming, where the total watershed properties are taken into account in forming the [[contour line]]s.

== Perimeter runoff control ==
[[File:Runoff and filtersoxx.ogv|thumb|350px|runoff and filter soxx]]

Tree, [[shrub]]s and [[ground-cover]] are effective perimeter treatment for [[soil erosion]] prevention, by impeding surface flows. A special form of this perimeter or inter-row treatment is the use of a “grass way” that both [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s and dissipates runoff through surface friction, impeding [[surface runoff]] and encouraging infiltration of the slowed surface water.&lt;ref&gt;''Perimeter landscaping of Carneros Business Park'', Lumina Technologies, Santa Rosa, Ca., prepared for Sonoma County, Ca. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Windbreaks==

Windbreaks are sufficiently dense rows of [[tree]]s at the [[Windward and leeward|windward]] exposure of an agricultural field subject to [[wind]] [[erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Summer, ''Modelling Soil Erosion, Sediment Transport and Closely Related Hydrological Processes'' entry by Mingyuan Du, Peiming Du, Taichi Maki and Shigeto Kawashima, “Numerical modeling of air flow over complex terrain concerning wind erosion”, International Association of Hydrological Sciences publication no. 249 (1998)  {{ISBN|1-901502-50-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evergreen]] [[species]] provide year-round protection; however, as long as [[foliage]] is present in the seasons of bare [[soil]] surfaces, the effect of [[deciduous]] trees may be adequate.

== Cover crops/crop rotation ==

Cover crops such as legumes plant, white turnip, radishes and other species are rotated with cash crops to blanket the soil year-round and act as [[green manure]] that replenishes nitrogen and other critical nutrients. Cover crops also help suppress weeds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news

== Soil-conservation farming ==

Soil-conservation farming involves [[no-till farming]], “green manures” and other soil-enhancing practices.  Such farming methods attempt to mimic the biology of [[barren lands]]. They can revive damaged soil, minimize erosion, encourage plant growth, eliminate the use of nitrogen fertilizer or fungicide, produce above-average yields and protect crops during droughts or flooding. The result is less labor and lower costs that increase farmers’ profits. No-till farming and cover crops act as sinks for nitrogen and other nutrients. This increases the amount of [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Repeated plowing/tilling degrades soil, killing its beneficial fungi and earthworms. Once damaged, soil may take multiple seasons to fully recover, even in optimal circumstances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Critics argue that no-till and related methods are impractical and too expensive for many growers, partly because it requires new equipment. They cite advantages for conventional tilling depending on the geography, crops and soil conditions. Some farmers claimed that no-till complicates weed control, delays planting and that post-harvest residues, especially for corn, are hard to manage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Salinity management==
[[File:Aralship2.jpg|thumb|right|Salt deposits on the former bed of the [[Aral Sea]]]]

{{Main article|Soil salinity control}}
[[Salinity]] in soil is caused by irrigating with salty water. Water then evaporates from the soil leaving the salt behind. Salt breaks down the soil structure, causing infertility and reduced growth.
 
The [[ions]] responsible for salination are: [[sodium]] (Na&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[potassium]] (K&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;2+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;2+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and [[chlorine]] (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Salinity is estimated to affect about one third of the earth’s [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Yaron, ''Salinity in Irrigation and Water Resources'', Marcel Dekker, New York (1981)   {{ISBN|0-8247-6741-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil salinity adversely affects crop [[metabolism]] and erosion usually follows.

Salinity occurs on [[drylands]] from [[Irrigation|overirrigation]] and in areas with shallow saline water tables. Over-irrigation deposits salts in upper soil layers as a byproduct of soil [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]; irrigation merely increases the rate of salt deposition. The best-known case of shallow [[saline water]] table [[capillary action]] occurred in [[Egypt]] after the 1970 construction of the [[Aswan Dam]]. The change in the [[groundwater]] level led to high salt concentrations in the water table. The continuous high level of the [[water table]] led to [[soil salination]].

Use of [[humic acid]]s may prevent excess salination, especially given excessive irrigation. Humic acids can fix both [[anion]]s and [[cation]]s and eliminate them from [[root|root zones]]. Planting species that can tolerate saline conditions to produce surface cover can preserve soil salinity can be reduced. Salt-tolerant plants include [[saltbush]], a plant found in much of [[North America]] and in the [[Mediterranean]] regions of [[Europe]].

Pagal Organisms In Soil
[[File:K 1033CR08-9 Yellow fungus on stalk.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Yellow fungus, a [[mushroom]] that assists in organic decay.]]

When worms excrete [[faeces|egesta]] in the form of [[Vermicompost|casts]], a balanced selection of minerals and plant nutrients is made into a form accessible for [[root]] uptake. [[Earthworm]] casts are five times richer in available [[nitrogen]], seven times richer in available [[phosphate]]s and eleven times richer in available [[potash]] than the surrounding upper {{Convert|150|mm}} of soil. The weight of casts produced may be greater than 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg per worm per year. By burrowing, the earthworm improves soil [[poros]]ity, creating channels that enhance the processes of aeration and drainage.&lt;ref&gt;Bill  Mollison, ''Permaculture: A Designer's Manual'', Tagari Press, (December 1, 1988), 576 pages, {{ISBN|0908228015}}. Increases in porosity enhance infiltration and thus reduce adverse effects of [[surface runoff]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important soil organisms include [[nematodes]], [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrizha]] and [[bacteria]].

Degraded soil requires [[synthetic fertilizer]] to produce high yields. Lacking structure increases erosion and carries nitrogen and other pollutants into rivers and streams.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Each one percent increase in soil organic matter helps soil hold '''20,000''' gallons more water per acre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mineralization==
To allow plants full realization of their [[phytonutrient]] potential, active [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of the soil is sometimes undertaken. This can involve adding crushed rock or chemical soil supplements. In either case the purpose is to [[combat]] [[mineral]] depletion. A broad range of minerals can be used, including common substances such  as [[phosphorus]] and more exotic substances such as [[zinc]] and [[selenium]]. Extensive research examines the phase transitions of minerals in soil with aqueous contact.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur T. Hubbard, ''Encyclopedia of Surface and Colloid Science Vol 3'', Santa Barbara, California Science Project, Marcel Dekker, New York (2004) {{ISBN|0-8247-0759-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flooding can bring significant [[sediments]] to an [[alluvial]] plain. While this effect may not be desirable if floods endanger life or if the sediment originates from productive land, this process of addition to a [[floodplain]] is a natural process that can rejuvenate soil chemistry through mineralization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">'''Source reduction''' is activities designed to reduce the volume, mass, or toxicity of products throughout the life cycle.  It includes the design and manufacture, use, and disposal of products with minimum toxic content, minimum volume of material, and/or a longer useful life. 

An example of source reduction is use of a [[Reusable shopping bag]] at the grocery store;  although it uses more material than a single-use [[disposable]] bag, the material per use is less. 

== Synonyms ==
[[Pollution Prevention]] (or P2) and [[Toxics use reduction]] are also called source reduction because they address the use of hazardous substances at the source.

== Procedures ==
Source Reduction is achieved through improvements in design, production, use, reuse, recycling, and through Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP).  A [[Life-cycle assessment]] is useful to help choose among several alternatives and options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zabaniotou|first=A|authorlink= |author2=Kassidi  |date=August 2003 |title= Life cycle assessment applied to egg packaging made from polystyrene and recycled paper |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=549–559 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi= 10.1016/S0959-6526(02)00076-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Source reduction in the United States==
In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Trade Commission]] offers guidance for labelling claims: "Source reduction" refers to reducing or lowering the weight, volume or toxicity of a product or package. To avoid being misleading, source reduction claims must qualify the amount of the source reduction and give the basis for any comparison that is made. These principles apply regardless of whether a term like "source reduced" is used.

The [[Massachusetts]] Toxics Use Reduction Program (TURA) offers 6 strategies to achieve source reduction:{{fact|date=June 2015}}
# Toxic chemical substitution
# Production process modification
# Finished product reformulation
# Production [[modernization]]
# Improvements in operations and maintenance
# In-process recycling of production material

'''TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)''' is education and training which provides knowledge and skills for employment.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-UNEVOC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=What+is+TVET|title=What is TVET?|date=28 August 2017|website=UNESCO-UNEVOC|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVET uses [[Formal learning|formal]], [[Nonformal learning|non-formal]] and [[informal learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/skills-work-and-life|title=Skills for work and life|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|archiveurl=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVET is recognised to be a crucial vehicle for [[social equity]], inclusion and sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233030e.pdf|title=Unleashing the Potential: Transforming Technical and Vocational Education and Training|last=Marope|first=P.T.M.|last2=Chakroun|first2=B.|last3=Holmes|first3=K.P.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100091-1|pages=9-10, 41, 43, 47-48, 56-58, 63, 80, 95, 98-103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the term TVET ==
The term 'Technical and Vocational Education and Training' or TVET was officiated at the World Congress on TVET in 1999 in [[Seoul|Seoul, Republic of Korea]]. The congress recognised the term TVET to be broad enough to incorporate other terms that had been used to describe similar educational and training activities including Workforce Education (WE), and Technical-Vocational Education (TVE). The term TVET parallels other types of education and training e.g [[Vocational education|Vocational Education]] but is also used as an umbrella term to encompass education and training activities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=What+is+TVET|title=What is TVET?|last=UNESCO-UNEVOC|first=|date=|website=www.unevoc.unesco.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision in 1999 to officiate the term TVET led to the development of the [[UNESCO-UNEVOC]] International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training in [[Bonn, Germany]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Hybridisation ==
Because of TVET′s isolation with other education streams it was not widely adopted, in particularly in secondary education. Steps were taken to reduce segmentation of education and training and to address institutional barriers that restricted TVET learners′ options including choices to move vertically to higher levels of learning, or horizontally to other streams.

Policy-makers have introduced forms of hybridization with other education systems, additionally some of the distinctions between TVET and ′academic′ education streams have been blurred.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, R. and Pavlova, M. 2011. Vocationalisation of secondary and higher education: pathways to the world of work. UNESCO-UNEVOC, ''Revisiting Global Trends in TVET: Reflections on Theory and Practice''. Bonn, Germany, UNESCO-UNEVOC International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training, pp. 40–85.&lt;/ref&gt; This hybridisation has been termed the ′vocationalization of secondary education′, a similar process has happened to a lesser extent in tertiary education.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== France and the Netherlands ===
The [[Baccalauréat|baccalauréat professionnel]] in [[France]], and the [[Education in the Netherlands|middelbaar beroepsonderwijs]] (MBO) ount of work experience in the area they are specializing in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Germany and Austria ===
Apprenticeships enhanced content within occupational training courses and considerable emphasis has been placed on personal skills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== India ===
Work education has been included in the primary standards (grades 1–8) to make the students aware of work. At the lower secondary level (grades 9–10) pre-vocational education has been included with the aim to increase students’ familiarity with the world of work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Republic of Korea ===
Around 40% of secondary students are currently enrolled in TVET education, in some schools, academic and vocational students share almost 75% of the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Russian Federation ===
A new approach to vocationalization of secondary schooling has been introduced within the framework of general educational reform. This has been guided by the Ministry of Education’s strategy of modernization. Vocationalization in the Russian Federation refers to the introduction of profile education at the upper-secondary level (the last two years of schooling, grades 10 and 11) and the process of preparation for profile selection. Profile education provided students with the opportunity to study a chosen area in depth, usually one that would be related to their further study (TVET or academic). Schools could design their own profiles, e.g science, socio-economics, humanities, and technology, or keep a general orientation curriculum. In preparation for the upper-secondary specialization, a ′pre-profiling′ programme in grade 9 has been introduced to help students make their choices in grade 10.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== United States of America ===
Tech-prep programmes in the [[United States|United States of America]] are examples of how the ′blending′ approach was used to help students make the connections between school and work. In year nine, programmes in broad occupational fields such as the health professions, [[Automotive tecnology|automotive technology]], computer systems networking are offered within general technology studies. The programmes continue for at least two years after the end of secondary school, through a tertiary education or an apprenticeship programme, with students achieving an associate degree or certificate by the end of the programme.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Private sector ==
Private TVET providers include [[for-profit]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] institutions. Several factors triggered actions to support the expansion of private TVET including the limited capacities of public TVET providers and their low responsiveness to enterprises and trainees. Private TVET providers were expected to be more responsive because they were subject to fewer bureaucratic restrictions than public institutions (particularly in centralized systems). Their presence was expected to help raise quality system-wide, in many developing countries, government budgets constituted a vulnerable and unreliable source of financing for TVET, an important objective was to finance TVET systems by increasing the contribution of beneficiaries, including employers and trainees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Private TVET provision over since 2005 has become a significant and growing part of TVET in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, R. K. and Adams, A. V. 2004. ''Skills Development in Sub-Saharan Africa''. Washington, DC, World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;ETF and World Bank. 2005. ''Reforming Technical Vocational Education and Training in the Middle East and North Africa: Experiences and Challenges''. Luxembourg, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities.&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, e.g [[Lebanon]], enrolments in private TVET institutions have exceeded enrolments in public institutions. In [[Jordan]], private provision at the community college level has been promoted by the government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However not all experiences has been positive with private proprietary institutions or [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], their courses have often been concentrated in professional areas that typically do not require large capital investment, permitting easy entry and exit by private providers from the sector. Quality issues have also emerged, where market information about quality has been unavailable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Technological advancement and its impact==
TVET has an important role to play in technology diffusion through transfer of knowledge and skills. Rapid technological progress has had and continues to have significant implications for TVET. Understanding and anticipating changes has become crucial for designing responsive TVET systems and, more broadly, effective skills policies. The flexibility to adapt the supply of skills to the rapidly, and in some cases radically, changing needs in sectors such as [[information technology]] and the [[green economy]] has become a central feature of TVET systems. Globally, the skills requirements and qualifications demanded for job entry are rising. This reflects a need for not just a more knowledgeable and skilled workforce, but one that can adapt quickly to new emerging technologies in a cycle of continuous learning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

TVET courses have been created to respond to the diverse [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] needs of learners, whether these are related to work, education or citizenship. New courses have been introduced to address occupational changes in the ICT job market, while many TVET providers have shifted provision towards a blended approach, with significantly more self-directed and/or [[Distance education|distance learning]]. In developed countries, new ICT approaches have been introduced to modernize TVET organizations and to manage administration and finance, including learner records.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Education for all ==
{{main|Education For All}}

The Education for All (EFA) movement has had its own implications for TVET at both international and national levels. The third EFA goal lacked precision and measurable targets for TVET, however it called for ensuring ′that the learning needs of all young people and adults are met through equitable access to appropriate learning and life-skills programmes′.&lt;ref&gt;World Conference on Education for All. 2000. ''The Dakar Framework for Action: Meeting our Collective Commitments to Education for All''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; This goal had a symbolic value, helping to raise the visibility of TVET and skills development and create a more prominent place for them on the global education policy agenda. The current bulge of young people requiring TVET learning opportunities is partly fuelled by the success of the EFA movement in opening access to [[basic education]], particularly at the primary level. In 2009, 702 million children were enrolled worldwide in primary education, compared with 646 million in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Statistics. 2006. ''Participation in Formal Technical and Vocational Education and Training Programmes Worldwide: An Initial Statistical Study''. Bonn. UNESCO-UNEVOC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Continuing TVET ==
Continuing TVET involves ongoing training to upgrade existing skills and to develop new ones and has a much higher profile in ageing societies and knowledge-based economies. Increased recognition of the importance of human capital for economic growth and social development made it necessary to increase learning opportunities for adults in workplaces within the wider context of policies and strategies for lifelong learning.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. 2005. ''Promoting Adult Learning, Education and Training Policy''. Paris, OECD Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In many countries policy-makers have considered ways to expand workplace learning opportunities for workers and to assess and give credit for knowledge and skills acquired in workplaces. Efforts were geared towards training for workers in companies, encouraged by legislation, financial incentives and contractual agreements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Challenges ==
=== Labour market demands and trends ===
Following the [[Global financial crisis in 2009|global financial crisis in 2008]], labour markets across the world experienced structural changes that influenced the demand for skills and TVET. [[Unemployment]] worsened and the quality of jobs decreased, especially for [[youth]]. Gender differentials in labour force participation placed men ahead of women, and skill mismatches deepened. The crisis impacted labour markets adversely and led to deepening uncertainty, vulnerability of employment, and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Bacchetta, M. and Jansen, M. (eds). 2011. ''Making Globalisation Socially Sustainable''. Geneva, ILO and WTO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, measures to improve efficiency and profitability in the economic recovery have often led to [[jobless recovery|jobless growth]], as happened in [[Algeria]], [[India]] and [[post-apartheid South Africa]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In seeking to address the level of vulnerable employment, TVET systems have focused on increasing the employability of graduates and enhancing their capacity to function effectively within existing vulnerable labour markets and to adjust to other labour market constraints. This has meant enhanced coordination among government departments responsible for TVET and employment policies. It has also created the need for TVET systems to develop mechanisms that identify skills needs early on and make better use of labour market information for matching skills demands and supply. TVET systems have focused more on developing immediate job skills and wider competencies. This has been accomplished by adopting competency-based approaches to instruction and workplace learning that enable learners to handle vulnerable employment, adjust to changing jobs and career contexts, and build their capacity to learn and agility to adapt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Migration flows ===
Increasing migration are significant challenges to the national character of TVET systems and qualifications. TVET qualifications are progressively expected not only to serve as proxies for an individual's competencies but to also act as a form of a currency that signals national and international value.&lt;ref&gt;Leney, T. 2009a. ''Qualifications that Count: Strengthening the Recognition of Qualifications in the Mediterranean Region''. Thematic Study. Turin, Italy, ETF. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.etf.europa.eu/web&lt;/nowiki&gt;. nsf/(RSS)/C125782B0048D6F6C125768200396FB6?OpenDocument&amp;LAN=EN&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; TVET systems have been developing mechanisms to enable credible and fair cross-border recognition of skills. In 2007, the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] identified three types of recognition that TVET system may use: unilateral (independent assessment by the receiving country), mutual (agreements between sending and receiving countries), and multilateral (mostly between a regional grouping of countries). The most prevalent of these is unilateral recognition, which is mostly under the control of national credential evaluation agencies. Countries have been slow to move from input-based skill evaluations to outcome-based methodologies that focus on competencies attained.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Keevy, J. 2011. ''The recognition of qualifications across borders: the contribution of regional qualifications frameworks''. Background paper commissioned by UNESCO. Pretoria, South African Qualifications Authority.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

TVET systems are responding to migration by providing qualifications that can stand the rigour of these recognition systems and by creating frameworks for mutual recognition of qualifications. Regional Qualifications Frameworks such as those in [[Southern Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Caribbean]] aim to significantly support the recognition of qualifications across borders.&lt;ref&gt;Keevy, J., Chakroun, B. and Deij, A. 2010. ''Transnational Qualifications Frameworks''. Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts are further supported through the introduction of outcome-based learning methodologies within the broader context of multilateral recognition agreements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Providing broader competencies alongside specialist skills===
Skills for economic development include a mix of technical and [[soft skills]]. Empirical evidence and TVET policy reviews conducted by [[UNESCO]] suggest that TVET systems may not as yet sufficiently support the development of the so-called soft competencies.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2013b. ''Policy Review of TVET in Cambodia''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0022/002253/225360e.pdf#xml=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?database=&amp;set=53761B39_2_350&amp;hits_rec=2&amp;hits_lng=eng&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2013c. ''Policy Review of TVET in Lao PDR''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0022/002211/221146e.pdf#xml=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?datab&lt;/nowiki&gt; ase=&amp;set=53761918_0_231&amp;hits_rec=2&amp;hits_lng=eng&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2013d. ''Revue de politiques de formation technique et professionnelle au Benin''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002213/221304f.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries have, however, adopted competency-based approaches as measures for reforming TVET curricula.

The [[HEART Trust National Training Agency]] of [[Jamaica]] adopted this approach, with a particular emphasis on competency standards and balanced job-specific and generic skills. Competency standards aimed to ensure that the training was linked to industry and was up to date, and that competences were integrated into training programmes, along with the needed knowledge, skills and attitudes. The balancing of skill types was to ensure adequate attention was given to job-specific skills as well as the conceptual and experiential knowledge necessary to enable individuals to grow and develop in the workplace, and more generally in society.&lt;ref&gt;HEART Trust NTA. 2009. ''Policy on competency-based education and training''. Draft Concept Paper. Kingston, HEART Trust NTA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Globalization ===
Globalization of the economy and the consequent reorganization of the workplace require a more adaptable labour force, requiring countries to rethink the nature and role of TVET. Globalization intensifies pressure on the TVET sector to supply the necessary skills to workers involved in globalized activity and to adapt existing skills to rapidly changing needs. As a consequence, there is an increasing requirement for more demand-driven TVET systems with a greater focus on modular and competency-based programmes, as well as on cognitive and transferable skills, which are expected to help people adapt to unpredictable conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Promoting social equity and inclusive workplaces ===
Preparing marginalized groups of youths and adults with the right skills and helping them make the transition from school to work is part of the problem faced by TVET in promoting social equity. Ensuring that the workplace is inclusive poses numerous policy challenges, depending on the contextual dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, and the capabilities of individuals. For example, the experiences of exclusion by people with [[Disability|disabilities]] and disadvantaged women may be similar in some ways and different in others. Many individuals experience multiple forms of disadvantage in the workplace, to different degrees of severity, depending on social attitudes and traditions in a specific context or organization. Approaches to inclusiveness in the workplace will therefore vary according to population needs, social diversity and context. To give one example, the Netherlands set about the task of making workplaces more inclusive for low-skilled adults by offering programmes that combine language instruction with work, and in certain cases on-the-job training.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. 2012. ''Better Skills Better Jobs Better Lives – OECD: A Strategic Approach to Skills Policies''. Paris, OECD Publishing. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/better-skills-better-jobs-&lt;/nowiki&gt; better-lives_9789264177338-en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A review of employer surveys in [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States|United States of America]], reported that employers valued people with disabilities for their high levels of motivation and their diverse perspectives, and found their attendance records to be the same or better than those of other employees.&lt;ref&gt;Employers’ Forum on Disability. 2009. What does the research say are the commercial bene ts? &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.realising-potential.org/six-building-blocks/commercial/what-researchers-&lt;/nowiki&gt; say.html&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Many employers mentioned that being seen as pro-inclusion was positive for the company or organization's image, an advantage that goes well beyond&amp;nbsp;providing employment opportunities to disadvantaged groups. In many cases, however, social and cultural perceptions are an obstacle to making workplaces more inclusive, and this will require sensitive and concerted attention. Some low- and middle-income countries have sought to address this through legislation. In [[Tanzania]] the [[Disabled Persons (Employment) Act of 1982]] established a quota system that stipulates that 2 per cent of the workforce in companies with over fifty employees must be persons with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;SADC and UNESCO. 2011. ''Final Report: Status of TVET in the SADC Region''. Gaborone, SADC, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The 2012 [[Education for All Global Monitoring Report]] concluded that 'all countries, regardless of income level, need to pay greater attention to the needs of young people who face disadvantage in education and skills development by virtue of their poverty, gender or other characteristics'.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;UNESCO. 2012. ''Youth and Skills: Putting Education to Work''. EFA Global Monitoring Report. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002180/218003e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that several barriers and constraints reduced the success of TVET in meeting social equity demands. First, national TVET policies in most cases failed to address the skills needs of young people living in urban poverty and in deprived rural areas. Second, additional funds were needed to support TVET learning opportunities on a much larger scale. Third, the training needs of disadvantaged young women were particularly neglected. The 2012 EFA Global Monitoring Report also noted that skills training alone was not sufficient for the most disadvantaged of the rural and urban poor.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Coherent policies that link social protection, micro-finance and TVET are considered critical for ensuring better outcomes for marginalized groups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Gender disparities ===
Recent years have seen rising numbers of young women enrolling in TVET programmes, especially in service sector subjects. At times the challenge is to bring more males into female-dominated streams. However, beyond number games, the real gender parity test that TVET systems are yet to pass is balancing the gender participation in programmes that lead to employability, as well as to decent and high-paying jobs. Gender disparities in learning opportunities, and earnings, are a cause for concern. The persistent gender-typing of TVET requires concerted attention if TVET is to really serve a key facilitative role in shared growth, [[social equity]] and [[inclusive development]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233030e.pdf|title=Unleashing the Potential: Transforming Technical and Vocational Education and Training|last=Marope|first=P.T.M|last2=Chakroun|first2=B.|last3=Holmes|first3=K.P.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100091-1|location=|pages=20, 53, 85, 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of work, poor quality of work, lack of voice at work, continued gender discrimination and unacceptably high youth unemployment are all major drivers of TVET system reforms from the perspective of social equity. This is an area where TVET systems continue to be challenged to contribute proactively to the shaping of more equitable societies.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Gender equality has received significant international attention in recent years, and this has been reflected in a reduction in gender participation gaps in both [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary schooling]]. Efforts to analyse and address gender equality in TVET are relevant to other aspects of equity and dimensions of inclusion/exclusion. In almost all parts of the world, the proportion of girls to total enrolment in secondary education defined as TVET is less than for 'general' secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Statistics. 2012.

==== Responses ====

===== Bangladesh =====
Integrating women or men into areas of specialization in which they were previously under-represented is important to diversifying opportunities for TVET. The [[National Strategy for Promotion of Gender Equality in TVET]] in [[Bangladesh]] set clear priorities and targets for breaking gender stereotypes. The Strategy developed by a Gender Working Group comprising  fifteen representatives from government ministries and departments, employers, workers and civil society organizations. It provided an overview of the current status and nature of gender inequalities in TVET, highlighted the priority areas for action, explored a number of steps to promote equal participation of women in TVET, and outlined the way forward.&lt;ref&gt;ILO. 2012b.

===== Cambodia =====
In [[Cambodia]], TVET programmes set out to empower young women in traditional trades by upgrading their skills and technology in [[silk weaving]]. This led to the revitalization and reappraisal of a traditional craft by learners and society.&lt;ref&gt;Salzano, E. 2005. ''Technology-Based Training for Marginalised Girls''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===== The Shanghai Consensus of the Third International Congress on TVET =====
The Shanghai Consensus of the Third International Congress on TVET made the following recommendations on expanding access and improving quality and equity, including to:&amp;nbsp;

"Improve [[gender equality]] by promoting equal access of females and males to TVET programmes, particularly in fields where there is strong labour market demand, and by ensuring that TVET curricula and materials avoid stereotyping by gender."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2012.

'''Te-Tzu Chang''' or '''T. T. Chang''' ({{zh|s=张德慈|t=張德慈|p=Zhāng Décí}}; 1927—2006) was a prominent [[Chinese people|Chinese]] agricultural and environmental scientist.

== Biography ==
Chang was born in Shanghai on April 3, 1927 to a "scholar-gentry" family. Chang's father graduated from the [[Saint John's University, Shanghai|Saint John's University]] in Shanghai and won the [[Boxer Rebellion Indemnity Scholarship Program]] and completed his study in the [[United States]]. Chang had three (older) sisters and one (younger) brother.&lt;ref name="Chang bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seed.agron.ntu.edu.tw/cropsci/rice/TT%20Chang.htm |title=張德慈院士生平簡介(Brief Introduction to T.T. Chang's Life) |author=謝兆樞 |publisher=[[National Taiwan University]] |accessdate=May 17, 2010|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang finished his secondary education at the Saint John's School (a [[middle school]] afflicted to the Saint John's University) in Shanghai. Chang at beginning studied agricultural science at the Saint John's University in Shanghai, which was his father's [[alma mater]]. After about one year, Chang transferred to the [[University of Nanking]] in [[Nanjing]] and majored in [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]]. Chang graduated from University of Nanking with BSA in 1949.&lt;ref name="Chang bio"/&gt;

After graduation, Chang worked for the [[Council of Agriculture (Republic of China)|Council of Agriculture]] in [[Guangzhou]], the capital city of [[Guangdong Province]]. During this period of time [[Shen Tsung-han]] (1895–1980, [[:zh:沈宗瀚|沈宗瀚]], born [[Ningbo]], [[Zhejiang]]; death [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]) was one of his mentors. Shen was the second and former [[Director-general]] of the Council of Agriculture.&lt;ref name="Chang bio"/&gt;

In 1950, Chang moved to [[Taiwan]] and served as a technician in the Ministry of Agriculture. Recommended by Shen, in 1952 Chang went to study plant genetics at [[Cornell University]] which was also the alma mater of Shen (Shen received his [[PhD]] from Cornell). Chang obtained his MSc from Cornell in 1954 and continued his study at the [[University of Minnesota]] where he earned PhD in 1959.&lt;ref name="Chang bio"/&gt;

Chang went back to Taiwan in 1959. However, after two years of staying in Taiwan, Chang moved to [[Philippines]] and worked for the [[International Rice Research Institute]] (IRRI) in [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]]. From 1962 to 1991, Chang managed the International Rice Germplasm Center.

The ''T. T. Chang Genetic Resources Center'' is named after him.&lt;ref name="Chang pdf bio"/&gt;

'''''Totem and Taboo: Resemblances Between the Mental Lives of Savages and Neurotics''''', or '''''Totem and Taboo: Some Points of Agreement between the Mental Lives of Savages and Neurotics''''', ({{lang-de|Totem und Tabu: Einige Übereinstimmungen im Seelenleben der Wilden und der Neurotiker}}) is a 1913 book by [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], in which the author applies his work to the fields of [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], and the study of religion. It is a collection of four essays inspired by the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Carl Jung]] and first published in the journal ''[[American Imago|Imago]]'' (1912–13): "The Horror of Incest", "Taboo and Emotional Ambivalence", "Animism, Magic and the Omnipotence of Thoughts", and "The Return of [[Totemism]] in Childhood".

Though ''Totem and Taboo'' has been seen as one of the classics of anthropology, comparable to [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]'s ''Primitive Culture'' (1871) and Sir [[James George Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890), the work is now considered discredited by anthropologists. The cultural anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] was an early critic of ''Totem and Taboo'', publishing a critique of the work in 1920. Some authors have seen redeeming value in the work.

==Background==
Freud, who had a longstanding interest in [[social anthropology]] and was devoted to the study of [[archaeology]] and [[prehistory]], wrote that the work of Wilhelm Wundt and Carl Jung provided him with his "first stimulus" to write the essays included in ''Totem and Taboo''. The work was translated twice into English, first by [[Abraham Brill]] and later by [[James Strachey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dickson, Albert |author2=Freud, Sigmund |title=The Penguin Freud Library Volume 13: The Origins of Religion |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |pages=45, 46, 49 |isbn=0-14-013803-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud was influenced by the work of [[James George Frazer]], including ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, Ronald W. |title=Freud: The Man and the Cause |publisher=Jonathan Cape and Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |location=London |year=1980 |page=353 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

===Chapter 1===
"The Horror of Incest" concerns [[incest]] [[taboos]] adopted by societies believing in [[totemism]].

Freud examines the system of Totemism among the [[Australian Aborigines]]. Every clan has a totem (usually an animal, sometimes a plant or force of nature) and people are not allowed to marry those with the same totem as themselves. Freud examines this practice as preventing against incest. The totem is passed down hereditarily, either through the father or the mother. The relationship of father is also not just his father, but every man in the clan that, hypothetically, could have been his father. He relates this to the idea of young children calling all of their parents' friends as aunts and uncles. There are also further marriage classes, sometimes as many as eight, that group the totems together, and therefore limit a man's choice of partners. He also talks about the widespread practices amongst the cultures of the Pacific Islands and Africa of avoidance. Many cultures do not allow brothers and sisters to interact in any way, generally after puberty. Men are not allowed to be alone with their mothers-in-law or say each other's names. He explains this by saying that after a certain age parents often live through their children to endure their marriage and that mothers-in-law may become overly attached to their son-in-law. Similar restrictions exist between a father and daughter, but they only exist from puberty until engagement.

===Chapter 2===
In "Taboo and emotional ambivalence," Freud considers the relationship of [[taboo]]s to totemism. Freud uses his concepts [[psychological projection|projection]] and [[ambivalence#In psychoanalysis|ambivalence]] he developed during his work with neurotic patients in Vienna to discuss the relationship between taboo and totemism.

Like [[neuroticism|neurotics]], 'primitive' people feel ambivalent about most people in their lives, but will not admit this consciously to themselves. They will not admit that as much as they love their mother, there are things about her they hate. The suppressed part of this ambivalence (the hate parts) are projected onto others. In the case of natives, the hateful parts are projected onto the totem, as in: 'I did not want my mother to die; the totem wanted her to die.'

Freud expands this idea of ambivalence to include the relationship of citizens to their ruler. In ceremonies surrounding kings, which are often quite violent, – such as the king starving himself in the woods for a few weeks – he considers two levels that are functioning to be the "ostensible" (i.e., the king is being honored) and the "actual" (i.e., the king is being tortured). He uses examples to illustrate the taboos on rulers. He says the kings of Ireland were subject to restrictions such as not being able to go to certain towns or on certain days of the week.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund ''Totem and Taboo'' London WW Norton 1989 page 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 3===
In "Animism, Magic and the Omnipotence of Thought," Freud examines the animism and narcissistic phase associated with a primitive understanding of the universe and early libidinal development. A belief in magic and sorcery derives from an overvaluation of psychical acts whereby the structural conditions of mind are transposed onto the world: this overvaluation survives in both primitive men and neurotics. The [[animistic]] mode of thinking is governed by an "omnipotence of thoughts", a [[projection (psychology)|projection]] of inner mental life onto the external world. This imaginary construction of reality is also discernible in [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive]] thinking, [[delusional disorder]]s and [[phobia]]s. Freud comments that the omnipotence of thoughts has been retained in the magical realm of art. The last part of the essay concludes the relationship between [[magic (paranormal)]], [[superstition]] and taboo, arguing that the practices of animism are merely a cover up of instinctual [[repression (psychological)|repression]] (Freud).

===Chapter 4===
In "The Return of Totemism in Childhood," Freud combines one of [[Charles Darwin]]'s more speculative theories about the arrangements of early human societies (a single alpha-male surrounded by a harem of females, similar to the arrangement of [[gorilla]] groupings) with the theory of the sacrifice ritual taken from [[William Robertson Smith]] to conclude that the origins of  [[totem]]ism lie in a singular event, when a band of prehistoric brothers expelled from the alpha-male group returned to kill their father, whom they both feared and respected. In this respect, Freud located the beginnings of the [[Oedipus complex]] at the origins of human society, and postulated that all religion was in effect an extended and collective form of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and ambivalence to cope with the killing of the father figure (which he saw as the true [[original sin]]).

==Reception==
===Early reviews===
In 1914, ''Totem and Taboo'' received a negative review from Carl Furtmüller in ''Zentralblatt für Psychologie und Psychotherapie''. Other reviews written between 1912 and 1920 include those by the psychoanalyst [[Wilhelm Stekel]] in ''Zentralblatt für Psychologie und Psychotherapie'', the neurologist and psychiatrist [[William Alanson White]] in ''Psychoanalytic Review'', the biographer [[Francis Hackett]] in ''[[The New Republic]]'', the psychologist [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', and the anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] in ''[[American Anthropologist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kiell, Norman |title=Freud Without Hindsight: Reviews of His Work, 1893-1939 |publisher=Intertational Universities Press, Inc. |location=Madison, Connecticut |year=1988 |pages=387–417 |isbn=0-8236-2055-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furtmüller wrote that the work showed Freud's increasing "isolation from the scientific world". He accused Freud of ignoring criticisms directed against his theories, and objected to Freud's basing his investigations on the theory of the Oedipus complex. He credited Freud with providing a "compact survey" of the confusing state of research into totemism, but believed that it was difficult for psychoanalysts to deal with the subject because they could not base their conclusions on "first-hand experience", and that Freud attached too much importance to "the belief of totemistic acolytes that they are descendants of the totem animal." He criticized Freud's attempt to explain totemism through parallels with the "psychological life" of children, arguing that the analytical results Freud employed were of questionable accuracy and did little to provide a "solution of the problem of totemism", and that Freud failed to explain why the totem was represented as an animal. He also considered Freud wrong to consider exogamy one of the most important features of totemism. Though believing that Freud showed "sharp wit", he accused him of engaging in "the free play of fantasy" where "logical argumentation" was needed and of misunderstanding the work of Darwin. He wrote that Freud explained morality as the "product of a social contract" and compared the Oedipus complex to the "original sin of the human race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kiell, Norman |title=Freud Without Hindsight: Reviews of His Work, 1893-1939 |publisher=Intertational Universities Press, Inc. |location=Madison, Connecticut |year=1988 |pages=393–396 |isbn=0-8236-2055-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views of anthropologists===
''Totem and Taboo'' became widely known in the United States by the end of [[World War I]]. According to Annemarie De Waal Malefijt, the book produced "angry reactions" from anthropologists even on the basis of its subtitle alone.&lt;ref name="De Waal"&gt;{{cite book |author=De Waal Malefijt, Annemarie |title=Images of Man: A History of Anthropological Thought |publisher=Alfred A. Knpof |location=New York |year=1974 |page=295 |isbn=0-394-48330-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist critics of ''Totem and Taboo'' included Kroeber, who described Freud as a "gallant and stimulating adventurer into ethnology" but rejected the idea that Freud's theories could explain social origins and evolutionary phases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroeber|first1=Alfred, L.|title=Totem and Taboo: An Ethnologic Psychoanalysis|jstor=660103}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Boas]], who considered Freud's method in ''Totem and Taboo'' one-sided and useless for advancing understanding of cultural development,&lt;ref name="De Waal" /&gt; and [[Robert Ranulph Marett]], who referred to the work as a "just-so story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gay, Peter |title=Freud: A Life for Our Time |publisher=Papermac |location=London |year=1995 |pages=327 |isbn=0-333-48638-2 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] criticized ''Totem and Taboo'' in his ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (1948).&lt;ref&gt;concluding chapter of Claude Levi-Strauss, 562-563-564 pages of the edition by Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin, 2002, ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (1949), Needham, Rodney, ed&lt;/ref&gt;

Kroeber published a reassessment of ''Totem and Taboo'' in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harris, Marvin |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |year=1971 |publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell Company |page=431 |isbn=0-690-703228}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Harris]] described ''Totem and Taboo'' as representative of what Boas's followers regarded as "the worst form of evolutionary speculation", criticizing "the grandiosity of its compass, the flimsiness of its evidence ... the generality of its conclusions" and its "anachronistic framework". In his view, nothing about the work prepared "orthodox Freudians" to deal with the variety of culturally determined personality structures revealed by the work of [[Bronisław Malinowski]], [[Margaret Mead]], and [[Ruth Benedict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harris, Marvin |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |year=1971 |publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell Company |pages=425–6 |isbn=0-690-703228}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Farb]] wrote that ''Totem and Taboo'' "demonstrates the lengths to which a theorist will go to find an explanation" for totemism, adding that despite their disagreements on other issues, anthropologists now concur that the work is "totally discredited".&lt;ref name="Farb"&gt;{{cite book |author=Farb, Peter |title=Man's Rise to Civilization: The Cultural Ascent of the Indians of North America |publisher=E. P. Dutton |location=New York |year=1978 |pages=67–68 |isbn=0-525-15270-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views of psychoanalysts===
[[Géza Róheim]], an anthropologist as well as a psychoanalyst, considered ''Totem and Taboo'' one of the great landmarks in the history of anthropology, comparable only to Edward Burnett Tylor's ''Primitive Culture'' (1871) and Sir James George Frazer's ''The Golden Bough'' (1890). Róheim described ''Totem and Taboo'' as an "epoch-making work" in both anthropology and the social sciences generally. Róheim eventually abandoned the assumptions of ''Totem and Taboo'', but continued to regard it as a classic, the work that created psychoanalytic anthropology. [[Wilhelm Reich]], following [[Johann Jakob Bachofen]] and other authors, maintained that early human societies were matriarchies and that this ruled out Freud's account of the origins of civilization in ''Totem and Taboo''. Reich argued that Freud's theory that the Oedipus complex was a prime factor in the development of civilization ignored the cultural relativity of the Oedipus complex, which, drawing on the work of Malinowski, he saw as only a result of the patriarchal order.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, Paul |title=The Freudian Left |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca and London |year=1990 |pages=50–51, 89–90 |isbn=0-8014-9716-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud himself considered "The Return of Totemism in Childhood" his best-written work, and ''Totem and Taboo'' as a whole remained one of his favorite works.&lt;ref name="Dickson" /&gt;

===Other responses===
The classical scholar [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] called ''Totem and Taboo'' one of the most important works in her intellectual life. Harrison's work ''Themis: A Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion'' (1912) has been compared to ''Totem and Taboo'', since Harrison and Freud both attempted to find a universal mechanism that would account for the origins of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ackerman, Robert |title=The Myth and Ritual School: J. G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2002 |pages=116, 124 |isbn=0-415-93963-1 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Thomas Mann]] wrote that ''Totem and Taboo'' had made a stronger impression on him than any of Freud's other works, and that of all Freud's works it had the greatest artistic merit.&lt;ref name="Dickson"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dickson, Albert |author2=Freud, Sigmund |title=The Penguin Freud Library Volume 13: The Origins of Religion |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=47 |isbn=0-14-013803-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminist [[Simone de Beauvoir]] criticized ''Totem and Taboo'' in ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949), writing that Freud is forced to "invent strange fictions" to explain the passage from "the individual to the society"; she saw the inability to explain this transition as a failing of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beauvoir, Simone de |title=The Second Sex |publisher=Vintage Books |location=London |year=2009 |page=56 |isbn=978-0-099-49938-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges Bataille]] argued that Freud was misled by the "superficial knowledge of ethnographical data" typical of his time into concluding that the taboo on touching corpses generally countered a desire to touch them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bataille, Georges |title=Eroticism |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=2001 |page=47 |isbn=0-14-118410-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical scholar [[Norman O. Brown]] criticized the work in ''[[Life Against Death]]'' (1959), writing that Freud correlates psycho-sexual stages of development with stages of history, thereby seeing history as a "process of growing up". Brown saw this view as a "residue of eighteenth-century optimism and rationalism", and found it inadequate as both history and psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Norman O. |title=Life Against Death: The Psychoanalytical Meaning of Human History |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |location=Hanover |year=1985 |page=14 |isbn=0-8195-6144-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] considered Freud's ''Totem and Taboo'' and Jung's ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]'' (1912) the two key works that initiated the systematic interpretation of ethnological materials through insights gained through the study of neurotic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology |publisher=Secker &amp; Warburg |location=London |year=1960 |page=16 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[René Girard]] wrote in ''[[Violence and the Sacred]]'' (1972) that despite the rejection of ''Totem and Taboo'' by "contemporary criticism", its concept of collective murder is close to the themes of his own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Girard, René |title=Violence and the Sacred |publisher=Continuum |location=New York |year=2005 |page=204 |isbn=0-8264-7718-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Peter Gay]], writing in ''[[Freud: A Life for Our Time]]'' (1988), suggested that in ''Totem and Taboo'' Freud made conjectures more ingenious than those of the philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Gay observed that ''Totem and Taboo'' was in part an attempt by Freud to outdo his rival Jung, and that the work is full of evidence that "Freud's current combats reverberated with his past history, conscious and unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gay, Peter |title=Freud: A Life for Our Time |publisher=Papermac |location=London |year=1995 |pages=325–6 |isbn=0-333-48638-2 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Harold Bloom]] asserted in ''[[The American Religion]]'' (1992) that ''Totem and Taboo'' has no greater acceptance among anthropologists than does the [[Book of Mormon]], and that there are parallels between the two works, such as a concern with [[polygamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bloom, Harold |title=The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |year=1992 |pages=106–7 |isbn=0-671-67997-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Schechner]] criticized Freud for having assumed in ''Totem and Taboo'' that some humans are more "primitive" than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schechner, Richard |editor=Ingold, Tim |title=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology: Humanity, Culture, and Social Life |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1994 |pages=635–6 |isbn=0-415-16421-4 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[David P. Barash]] concluded that in ''Totem and Taboo'' Freud "combines idiosyncratic, almost crackpot fantasy with startling profundity and originality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barash, David P. |title=Ideas of Human Nature: From the Bhagavad Gita |year=1998 |publisher=Prentice Hall |page=116 |isbn=0-13-647587-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Elliott argued that Freud's account of social and cultural organization suffers from limitations, and that because of anthropological knowledge that became available subsequent to ''Totem and Taboo'' the theories Freud proposed there now have few advocates. Elliott wrote that, "Freud's attempt to anchor the Oedipus complex in a foundational event displaces his crucial insights into the radically creative power of the human imagination", ascribing to real events "what are in fact products of fantasy". Elliott added that Freud should be credited with showing that "reality is not pre-given or natural", but rather structured by the social and technical frameworks fashioned by human beings, and that "individual subjectivity and society presuppose one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elliott, Anthony |title=Psychoanalytic Theory: An Introduction |year=2002 |publisher=Palgrave |page=43 |isbn=0-333-91912-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominique Bourdin wrote that in ''Totem and Taboo'', Freud "develops an idea that clearly embarrasses the current psychoanalysts, but that is essential to the logic of Freudian thought: that of [[Phylogenetics]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bourdin, Dominique |title=La psychanalyse de Freud à aujourd'hui: Histoire, concepts, pratique |publisher=Bréal |location=Paris |year=2007 |page=89 |isbn=978-2749507460 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen]] and the psychologist [[Sonu Shamdasani]] argued that in ''Totem and Taboo'' Freud applied to history "the same method of interpretation that he used in the privacy of his office to 'reconstruct' his patients' forgotten and repressed memories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Borch-Jacobsen, Mikkel |author2=Shamdasani, Sonu |title=The Freud Files: An Inquiry into the History of Psychoanalysis |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2012 |pages=179–180 |isbn=978-0-521-72978-9 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Bordeaux''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Université de Bordeaux'') was founded in 1441 in France. In 1970, the University was split up in four separate universities. It was reestablished on 1 January 2014 from the merger of three of the new universities: [[University of Bordeaux 1|Bordeaux 1]], [[Bordeaux Segalen University|Victor Segalen University (Bordeaux 2)]], and [[Montesquieu University - Bordeaux IV|Montesquieu University (Bordeaux 4)]]. The University of Bordeaux is part of the [[Community of universities and higher education institutions of Aquitaine]].

== History ==
The original ''Université de Bordeaux'' was established by the papal bull of [[Pope Eugene IV]] on 7 June 1441 when Bordeaux was an English town. The initiative for the creation of the university is attributed to Archbishop [[Pey Berland]]. It was originally composed of four faculties: arts, medicine, law, and theology. The law faculty later split into faculties of civil law and canon law. A professorship in mathematics was founded in 1591 by Bishop [[François de Foix]], son of Gaston de Foix, [[Earl of Kendal]].

This university was disestablished in 1793, and then was re-founded on 10 July 1896.

In 1970 the university was split into three universities: Bordeaux 1, Bordeaux 2, and Bordeaux 3. In 1995, Bordeaux 4 split off from Bordeaux 1.

In 2007 the universities were grouped together as ''[[Community of universities and higher education institutions of Aquitaine|Communauté d'universités et établissements d'Aquitaine]]''

From 1 January 2014, the university of Bordeaux were reunited, except for [[Bordeaux Montaigne University|Bordeaux 3]] which chose not to take part to the merger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-bordeaux.fr/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visual literacy''' is the ability to [[Interpreting|interpret]], negotiate, and make meaning from information presented in the form of an [[image]], extending the meaning of [[literacy]], which commonly signifies interpretation of a written or printed [[Written language|text]].  Visual literacy is based on the idea that [[pictures]] can be "read" and that meaning can be through a process of reading.

==Historical Background==
The notion of visual literacy has been around for quite some time.  Classical and Medieval theories of memory and learning, for instance, placed a strong emphases on how the visual format of words and lines affected the ordering of information in the mind.  During the Enlightenment new emphasis was placed on training the senses through print and manuscript technologies in a way that benefitted the rising middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Shape of Knowledge: Children and the Visual Culture of Literacy and Numeracy|journal=Science in Context|year=2013|volume=26|pages=215–245|url=https://www.academia.edu/1817033/The_Shape_of_Knowledge_Children_and_the_Visual_Culture_of_Literacy_and_Numeracy_Science_in_Context_26_2013_215-245|doi=10.1017/s0269889713000045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Mathew Daniel|title=The Child Writer: Graphic Literacy and the Scottish Educational System, 1700–1820|journal=History of Education|date=2016|volume=45|pages=695–718|url=https://www.academia.edu/23569976/The_Child_Writer_Graphic_Literacy_and_the_Scottish_Educational_System_1700_1820_History_of_Education_45_2016_695-718}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to learning to read visual material like tables and figures, many schoolchildren learned how to write and draw in graphic patterns that made their notes more accessible and easier to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Nature of Notebooks: How Enlightenment Schoolchildren Transformed the Tabula Rasa|journal=Journal of British Studies|date=2018|volume=57|page=275-307|url=https://www.academia.edu/34448924/The_Nature_of_Notebooks_How_Enlightenment_Schoolchildren_Transformed_the_Tabula_Rasa_Journal_of_British_Studies_57_2018_275-307}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the nineteenth century visual literacy was a core component of the national educations systems that were emerging in Europe and North America, with educational reformers like Sir John Lubbock arguing for visual tools like diagrams and models to be used in the classroom.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Modern Visual Literacy==
The term "visual literacy" is credited to John Debes, co-founder of the [[International Visual Literacy Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031204235851/http://ivla.org/org_what_vis_lit.htm What is visual literacy?], [http://www.ivla.org/ International Visual Literacy Association]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 Debes offered a tentative definition of the concept: "Visual literacy refers to a group of vision-competencies a human being can develop by seeing and at the same time having and integrating other sensory experiences."&lt;ref&gt;Avgerinou, M. &amp; Ericson, J. (1997). "[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119145211/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 A review of the concept of visual literacy]", ''British Journal of Educational Technology'', 28(4), 280-291.&lt;/ref&gt;  A white paper drawn up in January 2004, defines visual literacy as "understanding how people perceive objects, interpret what they see, and what they learn from them".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James 2010. The concept of visual literacy, and its limitations, In: Visual Literacy, ed. James Elkins.  Routledge, New York. pgs 217.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because multiple disciplines such as [[visual literacy in education]], [[art history]] and [[criticism]], [[rhetoric]], [[semiotics]], [[philosophy]], [[information design]], and [[graphic design]] make use of the term visual literacy, arriving at a common definition of visual literacy has been contested since its first appearance in professional publications.

Since technological advances continue to develop at an unprecedented rate, educators are increasingly promoting the learning of visual literacies as indispensable to life in the [[Information Age|information age]].  Similar to [[Literacy|linguistic literacy]] ([[meaning-making]] derived from written or oral human language) commonly taught in schools, most educators would agree that literacy in the 21st Century has a wider scope.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, J. (2009). ''Engaging the Eye Generation: Visual Literacy Strategies for the K-5 Classroom''. Stenhouse Publishers page 3.  {{ISBN|978-1-57110-749-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators are recognizing the importance of helping students develop visual literacies in order to survive and communicate in a highly complex world.

[[File:Lascaux painting.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.7|Lascaux Cave painting]]

Many [[Academia|scholars]] from the New London Group&lt;ref name=NewLondon&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090708022433/http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School The New London School], Information Habitat wiki, [[Michigan State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; such as Courtney Cazden, [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]], [[Gunther Kress]], and [[Allan Luke]] advocate against the dichotomy of visual literacy versus linguistic literacy.  Instead, they stress the necessity of accepting the co-presence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kress|first =Gunther R.|authorlink=Gunther Kress|title=Literacy in the New Media Age |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-415-25356-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vaNeafOoiYC&amp;dq=inauthor:Gunther+inauthor:Kress&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=0&amp;output=html&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  of linguistic literacies and visual literacies as interacting and interlacing modalities which complement one another in the meaning making process.

Visual literacy is not limited to modern [[mass media]] and new [[Technology|technologies]].  The graphic novel ''[[Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art|Understanding Comics]]'' by [[Scott McCloud]] discusses the history of narrative in visual media.  Also, animal drawings in ancient caves, such as the one in [[Lascaux]], [[France]], are early forms of visual literacy.  Hence, even though the name visual literacy itself as a label dates to the 1960s, the concept of reading signs and symbols is [[Prehistory|prehistoric]].

Visual literacy is the ability to evaluate, apply, or create conceptual visual representations. Skills include the evaluation of advantages and disadvantages of visual representations, to improve shortcomings, to use them to create and communicate knowledge, or to devise new ways of representing insights.  The didactic approach consists of rooting visualization in its application contexts, i.e. giving the necessary critical attitude, principles, tools and feedback to develop their own high-quality visualization formats for specific problems (problem-based learning). The commonalities of good visualization in diverse areas, and exploration of the specificities of visualization in the field of specialization (through real-life case studies).

Visual Literacy Standards for teaching in higher education were adopted by the [[Association of College &amp; Research Libraries]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/visualliteracy ACRL Visual Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education]&lt;/ref&gt; They were "developed over a period of 19 months, informed by current literature, shaped by input from multiple communities and organizations, reviewed by individuals from over 50 institutions, and approved by 3 ACRL committees and the ACRL Board of Directors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://acrlvislitstandards.wordpress.com/ ACRL Visual Literacy Standards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

== Education ==
There are many different formats of visual literacy and also many different ways of teaching students how to interpret visual literacy. Questions to be asked when looking at visuals can be "What is going on in this photograph?" and "What comes to mind when you first look at this photograph?". This allows students to begin the analyzing process. When looking at visuals, students should be able to see, understand, think, create and communicate graphically. In order to do all, the student must always carefully observe.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Film director [[Martin Scorsese]] emphasizes how children should begin developing visual literacy skills at an early age. This involves exploring how ideas and emotions are expressed and the use of lighting to create an emotional or physiological point. He explains how there is a need for children to understand these concepts. Visual literacy is taught in many schools and is becoming a more popular subject throughout the years. With technology, images and visual presentations are flourishing more than ever.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

== Estonia ==
In Estonia, Tiina Raitviir surveyed female executives from Estonia’s Top500 companies.  One hundred women managers were identified as the basis for an informal network and a mentorship program.  Eighty women managers participated in an initial seminar. Nine women followed up in subsequent workshops.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt; All of the companies were foreign owned because it was believed they would be more willing to participate in the project than Estonian companies.&lt;ref name="svd" /&gt;

== Denmark ==
Fifty-one potential top managers attended interdisciplinary networks hosted by CeLi and two trade unions, the Danish Society of Engineers (IDA) and the Danish Association of Lawyers and Economists (DJØF). These women formed professional networks for Women in Top Management, Women in Human Resource Management and Women in Project Management.  They attended seminars and a national conference.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt; In addition, four recruitment firms were involved in a focus group to develop gender recommendations for consultants and managers.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt;

== Greece ==
In Greece, the project worked with The Research Centre for Gender Equality (KETHI). Thirty women attended counselling on entrepreneurship for women who wanted to start their own businesses. Seven more women attended vocational workshops at the organisations Amel, Elgeka and the Municipality of Athens. Members from ten recruitment companies took part in seminars and research on gender inequality and leadership. A survey was carried out to learn more about gender and employment.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt;

The '''world landscape''', a translation of the German '''''Weltlandschaft''''', is a type of composition in Western painting showing an imaginary panoramic landscape seen from an elevated viewpoint that includes mountains and lowlands, water, and buildings.  The subject of each painting is usually a Biblical or historical narrative, but the figures comprising this narrative element are dwarfed by their surroundings.

The world landscape first appeared in painting in the work of the [[Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Joachim Patinir]] (c. 1480–1524), most of whose few surviving paintings are of this type, usually showing religious subjects, but commissioned by secular patrons. "They were imaginary compilations of the most appealing and spectacular aspects of European geography, assembled for the delight of the wealthy armchair traveler",&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Ann Sutherland, ''Seventeenth-century Art and Architecture'', 378, 2005, Laurence King Publishing, {{ISBN|1856694151}}, 9781856694155, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xd0CuzsPYJcC&amp;pg=PA378 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; giving "an idealized composite of the world taken in at a single Olympian glance".&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 431&lt;/ref&gt;

The compositional type was taken up by a number of other Netherlandish artists, most famously [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. There was a parallel development by Patinir's contemporary [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and other artists of the [[Danube school]].  Although compositions of this broad type continued to be common until the 18th century and beyond, the term is usually only used to describe works from the [[Low Countries]] and Germany produced in the 16th century.  The German term ''Weltlandschaft'' was first used by Eberhard Freiherr von Bodenhausen in 1905 with reference to [[Gerard David]],&lt;ref&gt;In his monograph on Gerard David and his School (Munich, F. Bruckmann), Weemans, 263&lt;/ref&gt; and then in 1918 applied to Patinir's work by [[Ludwig von Baldass]], defined as the depiction of "all that which seemed beautiful to the eye; the sea and the earth, mountains and plains, forests and fields, the castle and the hut".&lt;ref&gt;Weemans, 263, quoting von Baldass&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of landscape backgrounds in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] was greatly admired in Italy, and Flemish specialists were employed in some Italian workshops, including that of [[Titian]].  The backgrounds to many of [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s early prints were appropriated by a number of Italian artists. Patinir, "emboldened by the Italian taste for Northern rusticity, began as early as the 1510s to expand the backgrounds of his paintings out of all proportion" in a way that "violently reversed the ordinary hierarchy of subject and setting".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 42–45, 43 and 45 quoted in turn&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1520 he was well known for these subjects, and when Dürer visited him in [[Antwerp]] he described him in his diary as "the good painter of landscapes" (''gut landschaftsmaler'') in the first use of ''Landschaft'' in an artistic context.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 138; Wood, 45 (dating the visit to 1521)&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings are relatively small and use a horizontal format; this was to become so standard for landscapes in art that it is now called "landscape" format in ordinary contexts, but at the time it was a considerable novelty, as "portable panel paintings were almost always vertical in format before 1520" and "Patinir's landscapes were among the first small horizontal panels of any sort".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 47, quoted&lt;/ref&gt; He typically uses three base colours to articulate his compositions, with a brownish foreground, a blue-green middle zone, and blues in the distance.  The horizon-line is relatively high on the picture plane.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 139; Jenson, 280&lt;/ref&gt;  Patinir (and [[Herri met de Bles]]) came from [[Dinant]] on the [[Meuse]] (in modern [[Belgium]]) where, in "a startlingly un-Netherlandish landscape", there are dramatic rock cliffs and free-standing crags along the river. These are frequently recalled in his paintings, and came to form a common feature of works by other artists.  [[Image:Crossing the River Styx.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Landscape with Charon Crossing the Styx]]'', [[Joachim Patinir]], c. 1515–1524, Prado]]
With other vertical features, these are painted as though seen straight on even when in the lower parts of the landscape, and thus "reassert the integrity of the picture plane" in his works, against the sprawling horizontal impetus of the main landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 410; Harbison, 139, quoted ("reassert"); Silver, 30; Schama, 416–417, 416 quoted ("startlingly un-Netherlandish")&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[Kenneth Clark]] and [[Simon Schama]] see these as "the last survivors of the landscape of symbols", relating them to medieval and even earlier "corkscrew" representations of mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 25–27, 27 quoted; Schama, 415–417&lt;/ref&gt;

The style is related to the landscape backgrounds of [[Hieronymous Bosch]], although in his main works these function as a backdrop to his crowds of figures and are not as concerned to include a variety of landscape elements; but those of smaller works such as his ''[[St. Jerome at Prayer (Bosch)|St. Jerome at Prayer]]'' anticipate the new style.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 27&lt;/ref&gt; In most respects the paintings retain the same elements as many 15th-century treatments of the same subjects but show, in modern cinematic terms, a [[long shot]] rather than a [[medium shot]].

Most art historians regard the figure subject as continuing to be important in the works of Patinir and his followers, rather than mere [[staffage]] for a landscape, and most are of subjects where a wide landscape had relevance.  Among the most popular were the [[Flight to Egypt]], and the Netherlandish 15th-century innovation of the ''Rest on the Flight to Egypt'', and subjects showing hermits such as Saints [[Jerome]] and [[Anthony the Great|Anthony]] with the world from which they had withdrawn laid out beneath them.  As well as connecting the style to the [[Age of Discovery]], the role of [[Antwerp]] as a booming centre both of world trade and [[cartography]], and the wealthy town-dweller's view of the countryside, art historians have explored the paintings as religious metaphors for the pilgrimage of life.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 26–36; Wood, 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;    
[[File:Cornelis massys-huida egipto-prado.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|''Rest on the Flight into Egypt'', [[Cornelis Massys]], c. 1540]]

The style is also an early example of the 16th-century artistic trend to "Mannerist inversion" (the term devised by [[Max Dvořák]]) or the "inverted composition", where previously minor or background elements come to dominate the picture space. In the 1550s [[Pieter Aertsen]] began a style of large canvasses dominated by great spreads of food [[still life]] and large [[genre art|genre figures]] of cooks or market-sellers, while in the background small biblical scenes can be glimpsed. Some paintings by [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]] place genre figures in the foreground of paintings on religious or moral subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 152–153; Falkenberg, throughout&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century all these subject areas became established as independent genres in Dutch and Flemish painting, and later throughout Western painting.

Patinir's invention was developed by [[Herri met de Bles]] (1510 – c.1555–1560), who was probably his nephew. He took the type into the new style of [[Northern Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 432, 441–2&lt;/ref&gt;  Other artists were [[Lucas Gassel]], the [[Brunswick Monogrammist]], and [[Cornelis Massys]].&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 35–39; Baldwin, 362&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Pieter Bruegel de Oude - De val van Icarus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'', [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], now seen as a good early copy of Bruegel's original]]

Massys was the son of [[Quentin Massys]], a friend of Patinir, who had added the figures to at least one Patinir landscape, the ''Temptation of St Anthony'' ([[Prado]]),&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 45; Snyder, 409&lt;/ref&gt; and who had used the style in some of his own works, such as a ''Madonna and Child'' (1513) in [[Poznań]]. Patinir increasingly left the larger figures in his works to other masters, and also seems to have had a large workshop or circle of followers in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 410; Silver, 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The style was adopted and made more natural in the landscapes of [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]], who had travelled to Italy via the Alps.  Back in Antwerp he was commissioned in the 1550s by the publisher [[Hieronymus Cock]] to make drawings for a series of [[engraving]]s, the ''Large Landscapes'', to meet what was now a growing demand for landscape images.  Some of his earlier paintings, such as his ''[[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Bruegel)|Landscape with the Flight into Egypt]]'' ([[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld]], 1563, illustrated at top), are fully within the Patinir conventions, but his ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'' (known from two copies) had a Patinir-style landscape, but already the largest figure was a [[genre painting|genre figure]] and not part of the supposed narrative subject.

Other works explored variations on the theme, with his famous set of landscapes with genre figures depicting the seasons being the culmination of his style; the five surviving paintings use the basic elements of the world landscape (only one lacks craggy mountains) but transform them into his own style.  They are larger than most previous works, with a [[genre scene]] with several figures in the foreground, and the panoramic view seen past or through trees.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 39–52; Snyder, 502–510; Harbison, 140–142; Schama, 431–433&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruegel was also aware of the Danube landscape style through [[old master print|prints]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Chapter 5, especially 275–278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Danube school==
[[Image:Albrecht Altdorfer, The Battle of Alexander at Issus.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht Altdorfer]], ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'', 1529, 158.4 cm × 120.3 cm (62.4 in × 47.4 in)]]

The [[Danube school]] was a contemporary group of German and [[Austria]]n artists who were also pioneers of landscape painting, and the first to regularly paint pure landscapes without figures.  Their landscapes revel in the forests of the Upper Danube, and the place of a foreground figure is often taken by a single tree, a formula invented by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], the most significant artist of the group, and used, mostly in drawings and prints, by [[Wolf Huber]] and [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]. Other innovative works showed close-up views of dense forest with hardly any distant view or even sky.  But many of their landscapes are panoramic in a version of the Netherlandish style, although the river winding out of sight normally replaces the sea that occupies the horizon of many Netherlandish works.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, throughout, especially 160–168; Snyder, 357–359, 362–364; Harbison, 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;  It is probable that at least Altdorfer had seen a Patinir by about 1531; one was in [[Augsburg]] from 1517 (an ''Assumption'' now in [[Philadelphia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Altdorfer's painted landscapes are usually vertical,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 49&lt;/ref&gt; and, if only because it was commissioned for a vertical space, this is the case for the most extreme of all large world landscapes, his ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'' (1529, Munich). This extraordinary painting shows a view right across the [[Mediterranean]], with a mass of tiny figures fighting a great battle in the foreground. They are in modern [[Turkey]], and the view extends beyond the island of [[Cyprus]] to the coast of [[Egypt]] and the [[Sinai peninsula]] and the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 22–23, 201–202, 266–267; Snyder, 362–363; Harbison,&lt;/ref&gt; The painting originally formed one part of a set of historical paintings in the same format.

==Influence on later landscape painting==
Both the Netherlandish and Danubian approaches to landscape painting were greatly influential for later artists.&lt;ref&gt;On Danubian influence: Wood, 165–171, 234–235, 267–275&lt;/ref&gt; Later generations of Flemish artists such as [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], [[Anton Mirou]], [[Lucas van Valkenborch]] and [[Gillis van Coninxloo]] continued to produce late Mannerist versions of the full formula, as developed by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, before in the 1590s van Coninxloo let the trees move in like curtains from the sides to restrict and then eliminate a distant view, pioneering the Flemish development of the dense forest views of the Danube school.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 175–176, 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rubens]] had studied in the 1590s with his relative [[Tobias Verhaecht]], an especially conservative artist who continued to use world landscape styles derived from Pieter Bruegel the Elder until the 1620s.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;  Though [[Rubens]] rapidly outgrew his influence, in some of his later landscapes, such as the ''Summer, Peasants going to Market'' (c. 1618, [[Royal Collection]]), "the tradition of the old 'world landscape' plainly lives on".&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 189–192, 191 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Peasants going to market PP Rubens.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|''Summer, Peasants going to Market'', [[Peter Paul Rubens]], c. 1618]]

Aspects of the particular formula of the world landscape, though no longer usually described by that term, continue to reappear in different versions until the 19th century.  In [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] the idiosyncratic paintings and prints of [[Hercules Seghers]] (c. 1589 – c. 1638), as rare as Patinirs, were great panoramic views, very often with mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Silvers, 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Philips Koninck]] (1619–1688) used the panoramic elevated view, and often included water, but showed vistas of flat farmland or town roofs with a low horizon.

The Italian [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]], part of the [[School of Fontainebleau]], introduced the Flemish world landscape into French art in works such as the ''[[Orpheus]] and [[Euridice]]'' in the [[National Gallery, London]] and the ''Rape of [[Proserpina|Prosperine]]'' in [[the Louvre]], both large paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt, Anthony]], ''Art and Architecture in France, 1500–1700'', p. 61, 2nd edn 1957, Penguin&lt;/ref&gt;  In French Baroque or classical painting many artists including both [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]] painted "Landscape with ..." subjects, and for Claude wide panoramic views with mixed elements of mountains, water and small figures formed the bulk of his work, although both the viewpoint and horizon are generally much lower than in 16th-century works. Claude in turn became enormously influential, and until the early 19th century his style continued to have the advantage of giving a painting of a "landscape with" a higher place in the [[hierarchy of genres]], and consequently a higher price, than a mere pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Romanticism]] this changed, but panoramic views continued to be painted in the 19th century, and artists such as those in the [[Hudson River School]], [[Edward Lear]] and Russian landscape painters took the compositional style to new landscapes around the world in works such as ''[[The Heart of the Andes]]'' (1859, [[Frederic Edwin Church]]), though often excluding all people and buildings. These still featured in the huge apocalyptic religious paintings of the English painter [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], which are often literally "end of the world landscapes", taking the history of the genre back to its origins with Bosch.
