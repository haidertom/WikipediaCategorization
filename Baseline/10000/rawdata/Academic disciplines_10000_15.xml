      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9843">In the field of [[artificial intelligence]], the most difficult problems are informally known as '''AI-complete''' or '''AI-hard''', implying that the difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problem—making computers as intelligent as people, or [[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]].&lt;ref name="Shapiro92"&gt;Shapiro, Stuart C. (1992). [http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf Artificial Intelligence] In Stuart C. Shapiro (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence'' (Second Edition, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–57). New York: John Wiley. (Section 4 is on "AI-Complete Tasks".)&lt;/ref&gt;  To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple specific algorithm.  

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include [[computer vision]], [[natural language understanding]], and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem.&lt;ref&gt;Roman V. Yampolskiy. Turing Test as a Defining Feature of AI-Completeness . In Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Computation and Metaheuristics (AIECM) --In the footsteps of Alan Turing. Xin-She Yang (Ed.). pp. 3-17. (Chapter 1). Springer, London. 2013. http://cecs.louisville.edu/ry/TuringTestasaDefiningFeature04270003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, AI-complete problems cannot be solved with modern computer technology alone, but would also require [[human computation]].  This property can be useful, for instance to test for the presence of humans as with [[CAPTCHA]]s, and for [[computer security]] to circumvent [[brute-force attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas Hopper, and John Langford. [http://www.captcha.net/captcha_crypt.pdf CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001102/http://www.captcha.net/captcha_crypt.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}. In Proceedings of Eurocrypt, Vol. 2656 (2003), pp. 294-311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Richard | last = Bergmair | title = Natural Language Steganography and an "AI-complete" Security Primitive | citeseerx = 10.1.1.105.129 | date = January 7, 2006 }} (unpublished?)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was coined by [[Fanya Montalvo]] by analogy with [[NP-complete]] and [[NP-hard]] in [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], which formally describes the most famous class of difficult problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Mallery | first=John C.  |year=1988 | url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/mallery88thinking.html | contribution=Thinking About Foreign Policy: Finding an Appropriate Role for Artificially Intelligent Computers | title=The 1988 Annual Meeting of the International Studies Association. | location=St. Louis, MO }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early uses of the term are in Erik Mueller's 1987 Ph.D. dissertation&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Erik T. (1987, March). [ftp://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/tech-report/198_-reports/870017.pdf ''Daydreaming and Computation'' (Technical Report CSD-870017)] Ph.D. dissertation, University of California, Los Angeles. ("Daydreaming is but one more ''AI-complete'' problem: if we could solve any one artificial intelligence problem, we could solve all the others", p.&amp;nbsp;302)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Eric S. Raymond|Eric Raymond]]'s 1991 [[Jargon File]].&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Eric S. (1991, March 22). [http://catb.org/esr/jargon/oldversions/jarg282.txt Jargon File Version 2.8.1] (Definition of "AI-complete" first added to jargon file.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==AI-complete problems==
AI-complete problems are hypothesized to include:
*[https://www.wired.com/2017/02/ai-can-solve-peer-review-ai-can-solve-anything/ AI peer review] (composite [[natural language understanding]], [[automated reasoning]], [[automated theorem proving]], [[Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)|formalized]] [[logic]] [[expert system]])
*[[Bongard problems]]
*[[Computer vision]] (and subproblems such as [[object recognition]])
*[[Natural language understanding]] (and subproblems such as [[text mining]], [[machine translation]], and [[word sense disambiguation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ide |first=N. |last2=Veronis |first2=J. |year=1998 |title=Introduction to the special issue on word sense disambiguation: the state of the art |journal=Computational Linguistics |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=2–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem, whether it's [[robotic mapping|navigation]] or [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] or even the kind of [[reasoning]] done by [[expert system]]s.

===Machine translation===
{{main|Machine translation}}

To translate accurately, a machine must be able to understand the text. It must be able to follow the author's argument, so it must have some ability to [[artificial intelligence#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]. It must have extensive [[commonsense knowledge|world knowledge]] so that it knows what is being discussed — it must at least be familiar with all the same commonsense facts that the average human translator knows. Some of this knowledge is in the form of facts that can be explicitly represented, but some knowledge is unconscious and closely tied to the human body: for example, the machine may need to understand how an ocean makes one ''feel'' to accurately translate a specific metaphor in the text. It must also model the authors' goals, intentions, and emotional states to accurately reproduce them in a new language. In short, the machine is required to have wide variety of human intellectual skills, including [[artificial intelligence#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]], [[commonsense knowledge]] and the intuitions that underlie [[robotics|motion and manipulation]], [[machine perception|perception]], and [[artificial intelligence#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]. [[Machine translation]], therefore, is believed to be AI-complete: it may require strong AI to be done as well as humans can do it.

==Software brittleness==
{{main|Software brittleness}}
Current AI systems can solve very simple and/or restricted versions of AI-complete problems, but never in their full generality. When AI researchers attempt to "scale up" their systems to handle more complicated, real world situations, the programs tend to become excessively [[brittle (software)|brittle]] without [[commonsense knowledge]] or a rudimentary understanding of the situation: they fail as unexpected circumstances outside of its original problem context begin to appear.  When human beings are dealing with new situations in the world, they are helped immensely by the fact that they know what to expect: they know what all things around them are, why they are there, what they are likely to do and so on. They can recognize unusual situations and adjust accordingly. A machine without strong AI has no other skills to fall back on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lenat | first=Douglas |  last2=Guha | first2=R. V.| year = 1989 | title = Building Large Knowledge-Based Systems | publisher = Addison-Wesley| author-link=Douglas Lenat|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formalization==
[[Computational complexity theory]] deals with the relative computational difficulty of [[computable function]]s.  By definition it does not cover problems whose solution is unknown or has not been characterised formally.  Since many AI problems have no formalisation yet, conventional complexity theory does not allow the definition of AI-completeness.

To address this problem, a complexity theory for AI has been proposed.&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"&gt;Dafna Shahaf and Eyal Amir (2007) [http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2007/SS-07-05/SS07-05-026.pdf Towards a theory of AI completeness]. [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/commonsense07 Commonsense 2007,  8th International Symposium on Logical Formalizations of Commonsense Reasoning].&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on a [[model of computation]] that splits the computational burden between a computer and a human: one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by human.  This is formalised by a '''human-assisted [[Turing machine]]'''.  The formalisation defines algorithm complexity, problem complexity and reducibility which in turn allows [[equivalence class]]es to be defined.

The complexity of executing an algorithm with a human-assisted Turing machine is given by a pair &lt;math&gt;\langle\Phi_{H},\Phi_{M}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where the first element represents the complexity of the human's part and the second element is the complexity of the machine's part.

===Results===
The complexity of solving the following problems with a human-assisted Turing machine is:&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"/&gt;

* [[Optical character recognition]] for printed text: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(1), poly(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Turing test]]:
** for an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sentence conversation where the oracle remembers the conversation history (persistent oracle): &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
** for an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sentence conversation where the conversation history must be retransmitted: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n^2) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
** for an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sentence conversation where the conversation history must be retransmitted and the person takes linear time to read the query: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n^2), O(n^2) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* [[ESP game]]: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* Image labelling (based on the [[Arthur–Merlin protocol]]): &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Object categorization from image search|Image classification]]: human only: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, and with less reliance on the human: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(\log n), O(n \log n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Aesthetic Realism''' is a philosophy founded by poet and critic [[Eli Siegel]] (1902–1978) in 1941. It is based on three core principles. First, the deepest desire of every person is to like the world on an honest or accurate basis. Second, the greatest danger for a person is to have contempt for the world and what is in it—contempt defined as the false importance or glory from the lessening of things not oneself. Third, the study of what makes for beauty in art is a guide for a good life: "All beauty is a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is what we are going after in ourselves."

The philosophy is principally taught at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, a nonprofit educational foundation based in [[SoHo]], [[New York City]], through a variety of lectures, classes in poetry, anthropology, art, music, and individual consultations.

The Foundation faced controversy for its assertion that men changed from homosexuality through study of this philosophy. In 1990, it stopped presentations and consultations on this subject, explaining that it did not want to be involved in the atmosphere of anger surrounding the issue, and saying that "we do not want this matter, which is certainly not fundamental to Aesthetic Realism, to be used to obscure what Aesthetic Realism truly is: education of the largest, most cultural kind."&lt;ref&gt;Statement of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, 1990: "It is a fact that men and women have changed from homosexuality through study of Aesthetic Realism. Meanwhile, as is well known, there is now intense anger in America on the subject of homosexuality and how it is seen. Since this subject is by no means central to Aesthetic Realism, and since the Aesthetic Realism Foundation has not wanted to be involved in that atmosphere of anger, in 1990 the Foundation discontinued its public presentation of the fact that through Aesthetic Realism people have changed from homosexuality, and consultations to change from homosexuality are not being given. That is because we do not want this matter, which is certainly not fundamental to Aesthetic Realism, to be used to obscure what Aesthetic Realism truly is: education of the largest, most cultural kind."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Aesthetic Realism is based on the idea that reality, or the world, has a structure that is beautiful. Siegel identified beauty as the making one, or unity, of opposites.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Bready, "Eli Siegel's system lives" in the ''Baltimore Evening Sun'', 28 July 1982: "In brief, the Siegelian lifeview holds 'all reality, including the reality that is oneself [to be] the aesthetic oneness of opposites.' Motion and rest, surface and depth, love and anger, and so on, once identified, can and must be reconciled..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "In Aesthetic Realism, beauty is the putting together of things that can be thought of as opposites….Aesthetic Realism says that reality is aesthetics….Reality is, when completely seen, beautiful: that is, reality consists of a mingling in aesthetic relation, of such opposites as the orderly and disorderly…." ''Aesthetic Realism: Three Instances''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Siegel’s critical theory, "the resolution of conflict in self is like the making one of opposites in art." A successful novel, for example, composes opposites that people are trying to put together: oneness and manyness, intensity and calm, sameness and change.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub in ''Contemporary Authors'': "This philosophy sprang from Siegel’s belief that ‘what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life…, for poetry is a mingling of intensity and calm, emotion and logic.’" URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; His studies led him to conclude that any successful work of art or music combines essential dualities.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Packard (author)|William Packard]]: "And as far as Aesthetic Realism goes, it is eminent good sense. Eli Siegel has boiled it down to a simple formula: ‘In reality, opposites are one; art shows this.’ An artist will try to see the opposites in action, in himself and in his world and eventually in his own work." "How a Major Poet Is Ostracized by Lit Cliches: Eli Siegel in View," published in ''newsArt The Smith,'' (1978) URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/NewsArt-Packard-article.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hattersley: "The solution to our problem with opposites and the use we can make of photography in finding it is pointed to succinctly in the Eli Siegel dictum, ‘In reality opposites are one. Art shows this.’" "Form and Content in Color," ''Popular Photography'', July 1964, (Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 84-87)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism, Siegel developed this concept, writing that the arts and sciences all give evidence that reality has an aesthetic nature.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Campbell in ''Art Students League News'': "According to Siegel all the arts and sciences are really attempts at liking and understanding the world." (March 1983, Volume 37, Number 3)&lt;/ref&gt;  He described the world as having a construction like art: it, too, is composed of opposites. In Siegel's eyes, freedom at one with order could be seen in an electron, a tree, or the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "Philosophers have often seen reality as freedom and order, simultaneously and continually. Indeed, the first opposites I chose in my ''Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites?'', 1955, were Freedom and Order. You can see these right now in the world if you look at it: freedom and order are in the street, in the ocean, in woods in upper New York State." "Good Sense for the World," ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', #221 (22 June 1977); URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/tro/tro221.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "Verlaine...has some of the subtlest music in French verse. And here we have the first description of the world which beauty and art illustrate: that is, the world is simple and various at once. It is one universe, even as it has many twigs in twilight." "Good Sense for the World" (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Siegel reasoned, "If...the structure of the world corresponds to the structure [of art], that much the world may be beautiful in the deepest sense of the word; and therefore can be liked."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "If…the structure of the world corresponds to the structure music may have or a novel may have [or any art], that much the world may be beautiful in the deepest sense of the word; and therefore can be liked. "Good Sense for the World," (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary concept of Aesthetic Realism is that the world can be liked honestly by seeing it as an aesthetic oneness of opposites. Further, a core teaching of Aesthetic Realism is that it is "every person's deepest desire to like the world on an honest or accurate basis."&lt;ref&gt;Martha Shepp: "Aesthetic Realism teaches that the deepest desire of every person is to like the world, honestly. This is the purpose of art education, and actually, ALL education." (Cataloguing Critiques: Submission to C. Staples &amp; H. Williams, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN.) URL: http://www.marthashepp.com/cv_syll_phil/CritPresent4Website.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily Poetics, URL: http://dailypoetics.typepad.com/daily_poetics/2006/09/the_world_art_a.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510041505/http://dailypoetics.typepad.com/daily_poetics/2006/09/the_world_art_a.html |date=2010-05-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Aesthetic Realism: a Tripartite Study," ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' #247 (21 December 1977) URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/tro/tro247.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Siegel recognized another competing desire which drives humans away from such an appreciation—the desire to have contempt for the world and what is in it, in order to make oneself feel more important.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "Aesthetic Realism describe[s] the two opposed purposes in everyone’s life. As Siegel once observed, even though 'every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable,' there is also 'a disposition in every person to think he will be for himself by making less of the outside world.' According to the philosopher, contempt for the world causes tremendous damage to the self (with effects ranging from boredom to insanity) and, on a larger scale, to the entire world when one nation’s contempt for another leads to war." ''Contemporary Authors'', URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Siegel argued that when a person seeks self-esteem through contempt—"the addition to self through the lessening of something else"—he or she is unjust to people and things.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Patterson: "Eli Siegel, the great American poet and historian, defined hatred and contempt of people different from ourselves as the false importance or glory people received from the lessening of people not like themselves." ''Herald Sun'' of Melbourne, Australia (19 April 2009); URL: http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/sunday-heraldsun/better-to-try-world-on-love/story-e6frf92o-1225700167216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contempt, the philosophy maintains, may seem like a triumph, but ultimately results in self-dislike and mental distress,&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "According to the philosopher, contempt for the world causes tremendous damage to the self (with effects ranging from boredom to insanity)." ''Contemporary Authors''; URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; and lessens the capacity of one's mind to perceive and feel in the fullest manner. Siegel held that, in the extreme, contempt causes insanity.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Campbell: "Among many bold pronouncements none by Siegel are stronger than the assertion that contempt of the world produces insanity." ''Art Students League News'' (March 1983, Volume 37, Number 3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kernan]] in ''The Washington Post'' (16 August 1978): "There are two elements: oneself and everything that is not oneself, which he calls ‘the world.’ These two opposites must be brought into harmony: By liking the world, one can come to like oneself. If, on the other hand, one feels disdain, or what he calls contempt, for the world, unhappiness results. ‘Contempt can be defined as the lessening of what is different from oneself as a means of self-increase as one sees it,’ he says. Contempt can lead to insanity, according to Siegel." URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.org/Press-Articles-on-Aesthetic-Realism/Wash-Post-Article-Kernan.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic Realism attests that one’s attitude to the world governs how all of life's components are seen: a friend, a spouse, a lover, a book, food, people of another skin tone.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "An attitude to the world…governs one in one's everyday life. If you feel that the world is ill-managed, is contemptible, is unkind, you have to show that in how you see Mildred or how you see Morton…" "Aesthetic Realism; or, Is a Person an Aesthetic Situation?" (14 January 1969); URL: http://www.annefielding.net/Aesthetic-Situation-by-Eli-Siegel.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "Siegel regarded this emphasis on the attitude of the individual towards the world as the major difference between Aesthetic Realism and other philosophies." ''Contemporary Authors'', URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, Aesthetic Realism argues, individuals have an ethical obligation to give full value to things and people, not devalue them in order to make oneself seem more important.  Aesthetic Realism states that the conscious intention to be fair to the world and people is not only an ethical obligation, but the means of liking oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Schiff: "Nancy Starrels once attempted a working definition: Aesthetic Realism, she said, is: ‘The art of liking oneself through seeing the world, art, and oneself as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.’" ''New York Post'' (16 June 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "As Siegel once observed,…‘every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable.’" ''Contemporary Authors''; URL:http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy identifies contempt as the underlying cause of broader social problems as well: societal evils like racism and war arise from contempt for "human beings placed differently from ourselves" in terms of race, economic status, or nationality.  Siegel stated that for centuries ill will has been the predominant purpose in humanity’s economic activities.  The philosophy asserts that humanity cannot overcome its biggest problems until people cease to feel that "the world’s failure or the failure of a[nother] person enhances one’s own life." Siegel stated that until good will rather than contempt is at the center of economics and in the thoughts of people, "civilization has yet to begin."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Civilization Begins" in ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', #228 (10 August 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophic basis of Aesthetic Realism was set forth systematically by Siegel in two major texts.  The first, ''Self and World: An Explanation of Aesthetic Realism, '' was written from 1941-3.  Individual chapters, including "Psychiatry, Economics, Aesthetics" and "The Aesthetic Method in Self-Conflict,"&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0910492294}}&lt;/ref&gt; were printed in 1946. The full text was published in 1981 (NY: Definition Press).&lt;ref&gt;D.E., ''Booklist,'' (American Library Association, 15 January 1982): "A distinguished poet and teacher, Siegel died in 1978. This posthumous publication combines his essays and articles to give a final overview of his philosophy, called Aesthetic Realism....Siegel's passionate, affirmative intelligence is deeply stirring, frequently convincing. This is one of the few 'human improvement' doctrines to merit philosophic respect."&lt;/ref&gt; His second text, ''Definitions, and Comment: Being a Description of the World,'' completed in 1945, defines 134 terms used in the philosophic thought of Aesthetic Realism, including Existence, Change, Fixity, Freedom, Thought, Will, Wonder, Fear, Hope, Negation, Reality, and Relation. The work was published in 1978-9 as a series in the journal ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known.''

==Poetry==

Siegel stated that ideas central to the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism were implicitly present in "Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana,"&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Starrett in the ''Chicago Sunday Tribune'' (28 July 1957, part 4, p.4): "It is a longish poem, at once serious and jocose; an essay, according to Siegel, in Aesthetic Realism; and Aesthetic Realism, he says, is 'about [how] the having-to-do-withness or relation of people, is they, is themselves.'&lt;/ref&gt; the poem that brought him widespread fame when it was awarded ''The Nation'''s esteemed poetry prize in 1925. The philosophic principle that individuality ''is'' relation, "that the very self of a thing is its relations, its having-to-do-with other things," is in this poem.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett &amp; Boldt: ''Modern American Poetry,'' p. 144 (Macmillan Company, 1965): "Siegel’s poetry reveals a view of reality in which ‘the very self of a thing is its relation, its having-to-do-with other things.’"&lt;/ref&gt;  It begins with a hot, quiet afternoon in Montana and travels through time and space, showing that things usually thought of as separate and unrelated "have a great deal to do with each other."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors'': "Siegel composed ‘Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana’ with this principle in mind, taking 'many things that are thought of usually as being far apart and foreign and [showing] in a beautiful way, that they aren’t so separate and that they do have a great deal to do with each other.'"&lt;/ref&gt; These are lines near the end of the poem: &lt;br&gt;
::Hot afternoons are real; afternoons are; places, things, thoughts, feelings are; poetry is;
::The world is waiting to be known; Earth, what it has in it!  The past is in it;
::All words, feelings, movements, words, bodies, clothes, girls, trees, stones, things of beauty,
:::books, desires are in it; and all are to be known;
::Afternoons have to do with the whole world….

The search for that which connects all branches of knowledge &lt;ref&gt;"Aesthetic Realism on Art and Self," ''Peter Gorlin Interviews Eli Siegel on The World of Art, WKCR, 18 April 1963'' published in ''Definition 15'' (Definition Press, 1963): "Aesthetic Realism is an educational method. And the first thing that it asks is: What is there in common in biology, and in history, and in the study of music, and in psychology, and in religion, and in cookery, and in the study of the history of sport, and in the study of fabrics, and in the study of chemistry, and the study of geology, and in the study of the dance?  ''Is'' there something in common? The one thing that is in common is, obviously, the opposites, because in every art and every science, there is something that is and something that changes."&lt;/ref&gt; led Siegel to discover a key concept of Aesthetic Realism: "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."&lt;ref&gt;''Music's Intellectual History,'' edited by Zravko Blažeković &amp; Barbara Dobbs Mackenzie (Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale, 2009), page 167: "It is a central belief of Aesthetic Realism that art, indeed, has metaphysical substance, and therefore any attempt to sever art and philosophy limits the precision and the freedom of one's mind. 'The world, art, and self,' said Eli Siegel, 'explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic Realism classes were scholarly&lt;ref&gt;Donald Kirkley, ''Baltimore Sun,'' 24 September 1944: "These proceedings are orderly, sensible, and, in this writer’s opinion, scholarly and valuable."&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to demonstrate that poetry is related to the problems of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Villager,'' 26 July 1956: "This relation of poetry and aesthetics to what a person feels and thinks, goes through in any day of his life, is the unique contribution of Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy taught by Mr. Siegel."&lt;/ref&gt; The viewpoint of Aesthetic Realism is that "what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors:'' "Known first as Aesthetic Analysis and later as Aesthetic Realism, this philosophy sprang from Siegel’s belief that 'what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life.'"&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicts the Freudian view of art as sublimation.&lt;ref&gt;Katinka Matson, ''Psychology Today Omnibook of Personal Development'' (William Morrow &amp; Company, Inc., 1982): The basic tenet of Aesthetic Realism is that all reality is united in an aesthetic union of opposites: This is beauty itself....Siegel analyzes what he calls 'failures' as personified in the work of certain men, Sigmund Freud and T.S.Eliot among others. Siegel believes their common failure to be the neglect of seeing 'the large continuous purpose of man as good will for everything, animate an inaminate.' Freud 'appealed to incompleteness in man.' He confined man's possible view of self by emphasizing his sexual anxieties and death instinct as the keys to mental disorder."&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel defined poetry as "the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual."&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, Preface to ''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005): "Eli Siegel…[is the] founder of the philosophy Aesthetic Realism....Poetry, he wrote, 'is the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual.'"&lt;/ref&gt; In Aesthetic Realism classes he explained that the greatest desire of a person is to put together opposites, as, in a good poem, "emotion changes into logic: there is no rift between the two."&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Skene Catling, ''Baltimore Sun,'' 19 April 1952: "'In aesthetic realism,' Mr. Siegel said, 'emotion changes into logic: There is no rift between the two.' Emotion and logic, energy and calm, can and must coexist in poetry if it is to be good poetry, in Mr. Siegel’s opinion."&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that music distinguishes true poetry, whatever the language, period or style; the music of a poem shows the poet has honestly perceived opposites as one, and sincerely united personal feelings with the impersonal structure of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, Preface to ''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005): "Eli Siegel...founder of the philosophy Aesthetic Realism...[showed that] every true poem...has come from a person’s seeing something so justly that he or she has perceived in the immediate object the structure of the world itself: ''the oneness of opposites.'' And we ''hear'' that structure as poetic music. Poetry, he wrote, 'is the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual.' That is true about every instance of good poetry--no matter what its style, or language, or in what century it was written. On the other hand, an unauthentic poem, however impressive, however praised, is insufficiently sincere...lacks that honesty which is a self at its very center meeting what an object really is."&lt;/ref&gt; "Poetry," he wrote, "arises out of a like of the world so intense and wide that of itself, it is musical."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' #181 (15 September 1976): "Poetry arises out of a like of the world so intense and wide that of itself, it is musical."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Aesthetic Realism teaches, even a poem that in substance seems to condemn the world, in its technique and music is praising the world, seeing it truly.

In thousands of Aesthetic Realism lectures, Siegel demonstrated the centrality of poetry to every aspect of life, including "Poetry and Anger," "Poetry and Love," "Educational Method Is Poetic," "Poetry and Time," "Poetry, Money, and Good Will," "A Poetic Technique of Parenthood," "Poetry and History," and "Hamlet Revisited; or, The Family Should Be Poetry."&lt;ref&gt;http://aestheticrealism.net/lectures/&lt;/ref&gt; His students affirm that an important aspect of the philosophy continues to be the study of how a good poem has within it "the composition, beauty, sanity we want in ourselves."  This education, they assert, "makes it possible for poetry to be, as Matthew Arnold said, a ''criticism of life.''"&lt;ref&gt;M. Carpenter, K. Van Outryve, Preface to ''The Critical Muse,'' p. iii (Terrain Gallery, 1973) {{ISBN|0-911492-18-6}}: "''The Critical Muse'' is an anthology permeated with the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism....Every poem on the pages that follow is about the need of a person to put together opposites in himself. What makes these poems so important is this: as they tell us about the opposites in ourselves, the ''way'' they tell us, the technique of poetry, shows that opposites can be one. The music of poetry...is the most important sign that opposites are one....In our studies with Eli Siegel, we have come to see poetry as having within it the composition, beauty, sanity we want in ourselves.  This is the education which makes it possible for poetry to be, as Matthew Arnold said, a ''criticism of life.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Lectures and classes by Eli Siegel ===
In 1946, Siegel began giving weekly lectures at [[Steinway Hall]] in New York City, in which he presented what he first called Aesthetic Analysis (later, Aesthetic Realism), "a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Kirkley, "Poet Outlines a Philosophy," ''Baltimore Sun,'' 2 August 1946: "More than 160 persons…attended the introductory talk. Subsequent lectures will be given weekly at Steinway Hall. Tonight’s theme was 'Self and World.' In it, Mr. Siegel affirmed his belief that 'aesthetic analysis can be of help to everybody.' It is, he said, ‘a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier.’"&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1948 through 1977, Siegel continued teaching in his library at 67 Jane Street in [[Greenwich Village]], where he also resided. Individuals studied Aesthetic Realism in classes such as the Ethical Study Conference, the Nevertheless Poetry Class, and classes in which Aesthetic Realism was discussed in relation to the arts and sciences, history, philosophy, national ethics, and world literature.&lt;ref&gt;"From Here to Obscurity" by Michael Kernan, ''The Washington Post,'' 16 August 1978: "[A]t 67 Jane St. in the Village…[Siegel] gave his first lessons….[T]oday there are perhaps 250 serious students, mostly New Yorkers, though a few commute from nearby cities."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The arts ===
Among the earliest students of Aesthetic Realism were [[Chaim Koppelman]] (1920–2009),&lt;ref&gt;[http://chaimkoppelman.net/].&lt;/ref&gt; a painter, sculptor, printmaker,&lt;ref&gt;Trudie A. Grace, ''Same Objects/Different Visions: Etchings by Chaim and Dorothy Koppelman'' in ''Journal of the Print World'' (Winter, 2004) p. 36: "In the 1940s, Chaim Koppelman wanted to be a sculptor and then a painter, but in 1953 he switched to printmaking, attracted primarily by the potential for subtle chiaroscuro in the handling of form and atmospheric qualities as well as effects achieved in the biting of the plate."&lt;/ref&gt; and founder of the printmaking department of the [[School of Visual Arts]], and his wife, painter Dorothy Koppelman, who opened the [[Terrain Gallery]] in 1955, introducing Aesthetic Realism to the cultural scene of New York City with art exhibitions and public discussions of the Siegel Theory of Opposites in relation to painting, sculpture, photography, poetry, and later, music, theatre, and architecture."&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Schiff in the ''New York Post,'' Sunday, 16 June 1957: "An interesting aspect of the cultural life of this city within the past three years has been the development of the Terrain Gallery. There probably hasn’t been a gallery before this like the Terrain, which devotes itself to the integration of art with all of living, according to an esthetic principle which is part of an entire, encompassing philosophic theory. The gallery was organized and launched about three years ago by a group of young, cultivated persons including writers, artists and teachers, all of whom held a fundamental belief in common. This was the validity of the theory of ‘Aesthetic Realism’ as developed and taught by Eli Siegel, a poet and philosopher whose work has received growing recognition….Aesthetic Realism is: ‘The art of liking oneself through seeing the world, art, and oneself as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.’"&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaim Koppelman’s interviews of Roy Lichtenstein, Richard Anuszkiewicz, and Clayton Pond, in which these artists discussed the relevance of Aesthetic Realism and Eli Siegel’s Theory of Opposites to their work, are now part of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Archives of American Art: "Relevance of the Siegel theory of opposites to the work of Roy Lichtenstein, Clayton Pond, and Richard Anuszkiewicz, interview by Chaim Koppelman, 1968." [http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/collection/koppchai.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists began using Aesthetic Realism in writings about their fields, including [[Ralph Hattersley]], editor of the photography journal '' Infinity'',&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hattersley, "Form and Content in Color," ''Popular Photography'' July 1964 (Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 84-87): "The solution to our problem with opposites and the use we can make of photography in finding it is pointed to succinctly in the...dictum, ‘In reality opposites are one; art shows this.’ Siegel has, incidentally, a considerable influence on my thinking about photography; but to hold him directly responsible for any of my statements would be to make him considerably less of a philosopher and critic than he actually is."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nat Herz]], author of articles in '' Modern Photography'' and of the ''Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography.''&lt;ref&gt;Nat Herz, ''Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography,'' Universal Photo Books series (NY: Verlan Books, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aesthetic Realism: We Have Been There'' (NY: Definition Press, 1969), a book of essays by working artists in the fields of painting, printmaking, photography, acting, and poetry, documents how the Siegel Theory of Opposites "relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics".&lt;ref&gt;''Library Journal,'' 1 September 1969: "Heraclitus, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and even Martin Buber have posited contraries and polarities in their philosophies. Eli Siegel, however, seems to be the first to demonstrate that ‘all beauty is the making one of the permanent opposites in reality.’ Since the 1940s, this poet-philosopher-aesthetician has been advocating Aesthetic Realism: ‘that the structure of reality is aesthetic.’ He has also been demonstrating the practicality of and the necessity for the aesthetic criticism of self. The Siegel Theory of Opposites relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artistic productions inspired by the philosophy were surrounded by controversy.  A theatrical production of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen’s]] ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' by The Opposites Company of the Theatre, in which the title character was presented as "essentially good", in keeping with Siegel’s interpretation of the play,&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Two Critics of the New Hedda Gabler," ''New York Times, '' Sunday, 15 March 1970: "Did Hedda Gabler want humanity and the world to be more beautiful?  I see her as good because with all her uncertainty and displeasingness, this was the main thing in her life."&lt;/ref&gt; was highly praised in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Ted Kalem, ''Time,'' 19 December 1969, p. 58: "Now, in an off-off-Broadway production by a group called the Opposites Company, there is a new Hedda Gabler, not only beautifully performed, but deeply and subtly thought through in terms that make it peculiarly relevant to the psychic and psychological states of the modern woman."&lt;/ref&gt; but severely criticized in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kerr, "Hedda Is Not Candida," ''New York Times,'' 25 January 1970: "It is wholly boring and only boring….It doesn’t really mean anything to say that Hedda is 'essentially' good.  All people are 'essentially' good, or so I believe."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clive Barnes, "Hedda Gabler: the Good Person," ''New York Times,'' 18 January 1970: "To see Ibsen’s wonderful and dangerous Hedda…as 'a good person' is a cheap little travesty of drama, a misinterpretation of the playwright’s clear demands."&lt;/ref&gt; which also published Siegel’s response to the critics.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Two Critics of the New Hedda Gabler," ''New York Times, '' Sunday, 15 March 1970: "The history of criticism makes it clear that a lack of good will on the part of a critic constitutes an early form of critical incompetence….As Barnes and Kerr deal with various aspects of the Actor’s Playhouse production, if you have your ear to the ground you will discern not criticism but a displeasure with the existence of Aesthetic Realism as a thing to learn."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aesthetic Realism Theatre Company, composed of actors, singers and musicians, has appeared throughout the country in both musical performances and dramatic productions based on Siegel's lectures on [[Shakespeare]], [[Moliere]], [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], [[Ibsen]], [[Strindberg]], [[Eugene O’Neill]], [[George Kelly (playwright)|George Kelly]], [[Susan Glaspell]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aestheticrealismtheatreco.org/outreach.htm Aesthetic Realism Theatre Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic Realism Foundation ===
The not-for-profit Aesthetic Realism Foundation was established by Siegel's students in 1973. Located at 141 Greene Street in [[SoHo]], New York, it is the primary location where the philosophy is taught, in public seminars and dramatic presentations, and in consultations for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Katinka Matson, p.34, ''The Psychology Today Omnibook of Personal Development'' (William Morrow &amp; Co., Inc., 1977): "The process of Aesthetic Realism takes the form of seminars...sponsored by the A[esthetic] R[ealism] Foundation. The seminars deal with a wide range of subjects: those that are directed toward daily problems and the greater problems of life. In seminars, a consultation trio discusses aesthetic solutions to these problems, in terms of music, literature, poetry, painting, history, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors:'' "Informing and educating the public has therefore become the primary task of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation…whose staff members conduct seminars, workshops, and consultation sessions." URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation offers classes in poetry, anthropology, art, music, acting, and singing, and classes for children.&lt;ref&gt;Filomena Gomes, "Promising the world" in ''The Bergen Record'' 26 March 1999: "In a monthly program dubbed 'Learning to Like the World,' educators at the nonprofit foundation, established by Eli Siegel, work with children ages 5 to 12 to help them learn to use books as a tool to appreciate the world and the people around them....The world, according to the foundation’s philosophy, is made up of opposites: outside and inside, rest and motion. Similarly, children want to feel excited and feel at ease at the same time."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ellen Reiss - 20050815.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ellen Reiss, Chairman of Education]]

In 1977, Siegel appointed Ellen Reiss chairperson for the teaching of Aesthetic Realism. Since that time, she has conducted professional classes for the Foundation's faculty. Herself an Aesthetic Realism consultant since 1971, Reiss also taught in the English departments of [[Queens College|Queens]] and [[Hunter College]]s, [[City University of New York]]. She is a poet, editor, co-author (with Martha Baird) of ''The Williams-Siegel Documentary'' (Definition Press, 1970), and instructor of the course "The Aesthetic Realism Explanation of Poetry".&lt;ref&gt;''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005) back cover: "Ellen Reiss is editor of the periodical ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' where her commentaries on literature, life, and national ethics appear regularly. She is Class Chairman of Aesthetic Realism, appointed by its founder, the philosopher, critic, and poet Eli Siegel; and is co-author, with Martha Baird, of ''The Williams-Siegel Documentary.'' She teaches at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation and taught previously in the English departments of Queens and Hunter Colleges, City University of New York."&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel died on November 8, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' obituary, 10 November 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  His work is continued by Reiss, whose editorial commentaries on literature, life, and national ethics appear regularly in the periodical ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known.''&lt;ref&gt;http://aestheticrealism.net/tro&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic Realism and homosexuality===

A controversial aspect of the philosophy concerns the assertion that men and women could change from homosexuality through studying its principles. In 1946 writer and WW II veteran Sheldon Kranz (1919–1980) was the first man to report that he changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis: "Gays Who Have Gone Straight," ''NY Daily News'', March 15, 1981. "The late Sheldon Kranz, a GI in World War II, was the first man to make the change in 1946. Kranz later married Anne Fielding and the couple remained married for 24 years until his death recently."&lt;/ref&gt;   Kranz said that as his way of seeing the world changed, his sexual preference also changed: from a homosexual orientation (he was no longer impelled toward men) to a heterosexual one that included love for a woman for the first time in his life. Kranz was married for 25 years (until his death) to [[Obie]] award-winning actress Anne Fielding.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black; ''Free Time'' show, WNET, Channel 13, 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971). "Aesthetic Realism is the first body of knowledge which presents a way of seeing the world that incidentally affects one in terms of the way one sees women…so that one can be permanently heterosexual." Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black: "One of the things that happened in terms of my wife is that every time I had sex I have never had that ghastly feeling afterwards. As a matter of fact, it never ceases to be a source of wonder to me that one could have sex and really feel good afterwards."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SKranz-and-AFielding.jpg|border|thumb|right|267px|alt=Sheldon Kranz and Anne Fielding|Sheldon Kranz and Anne Fielding (1980)]]

In keeping with its general approach, Aesthetic Realism views homosexuality as a philosophic matter.&lt;ref&gt;"The Homosexual Story" by Eli Siegel, ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', Issue #316, April 25, 1979. "Aesthetic Realism was not chiefly interested, as I said, in talking to homosexual people, although it felt it could be of great use. [T]he principal purpose of Aesthetic Realism in talking to a homosexual person [was] to have him see the world differently and therefore himself differently; or, if one wishes, to have him see himself differently and therefore the world differently."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black, ''Free Time'' show, WNET, New York: 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor,(New York: Definition Press, 1971), "Aesthetic Realism is the first body of knowledge which presents a way of seeing the world that incidentally affects one in terms of the way one sees women…so that one can be permanently heterosexual."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Elmhurst Press'' (Elmhurst, Illinois), "Aesthetic Realism Ends Homosexuality," August 17, 1983, "Five formerly homosexual men…appeared with David [Susskind] and told how they had changed from homosexuality to heterosexuality with the help of a program of Aesthetic Realism developed by Eli Siegel…It is not just for homosexuals but everyone who may feel he or she would like to make some changes."&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental principle of the philosophy is that every person is in a fight between contempt for the world and respect for it.&lt;ref&gt;"Aesthetic Realism and Homosexuality" by Kay Longcope, ''The Boston Globe'', April 18, 1982. "The cornerstone of Aesthetic Realism is four-fold: ‘Every person is always trying to put together opposites in himself. Every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable. There is a disposition in every person to think he will be for himself by making less of the outside world."&lt;/ref&gt;   Siegel stated that this fight is present as well in homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Staub in ''Contemporary Authors.'' "The first statement of Aesthetic Realism maintains that ‘every person is always trying to put together opposites in himself.’ Though Siegel never intended this principle to become identified with any particular form of self-conflict, it long ago became linked to his position on what he termed the ‘H Persuasion’--homosexuality. Because he believed homosexuality arises from contempt for the world that manifests itself as contempt for women, the philosopher reasoned that people could be 'changed from homosexuality' if they were taught to 'like the world on an honest basis.' Since 1946, over 100 men and women say they have 'changed from homosexuality' after attending special question-and-answer consultation sessions conducted by teachers of Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; He explained: "All homosexuality arises from contempt of the world, not liking it sufficiently. This changes into a contempt for women."&lt;ref&gt;"Instances of How Aesthetic Realism Sees A Matter of This Time" by Eli Siegel from ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the philosophy, in the field of love and sex, a homosexual man prefers the sameness of another man while undervaluing the difference of the world that a woman represents. This undervaluing of difference is a form of contempt for the world; therefore, as a man learns how to like the world honestly, his attitude towards difference changes and this affects every area of his life, including sexual preference.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black, ''Free Time'', show, WNET, New York: 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971): "It’s a very philosophic matter, but maybe I can explain it as simply as possible. I think that the desire of every person, just as person, is to be able to welcome and take to himself as much of the variety and diversity and difference of the world as possible….A person becomes educated…to get more and more of the diversity of the world to him. I feel that in homosexuality there is such a limiting of that…such a denying of difference, that I feel there is something very deep in the self of a person that says, ‘This is not what I want.’ Now, as I said…if people…really can say, ‘I like myself this way, really,’ –it’s not for me to say one way or the other."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1965 supporters of the philosophy began an effort to have press and media report on the change from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971), p. xvii. "Since 1965 there has been a more or less continuous effort to have some coverage of the documented changes from homosexuality through the study of Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1971 men (including Kranz) who said they changed through Aesthetic Realism were interviewed on New York City’s WNET Channel 13 ''Free Time'' show&lt;ref&gt;''Free Time'' show, WNET, Channel 13, New York, aired 19 February 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''David Susskind Show'',&lt;ref&gt;''The David Susskind Show'' WNEW-TV, Channel 5, aired 4 April 1971, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; which had a national syndication.  The book ''The H Persuasion'',&lt;ref&gt;''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; published that year, contained writing by Siegel detailing his premise about the cause of homosexuality, transcripts of Aesthetic Realism lessons, and narratives by men who said they changed, describing both why they changed and how.  In response to requests from men and women wanting to study Aesthetic Realism, Siegel designated four consultation trios, one of which, Consultation With Three, was for the purpose of teaching men who wanted to change from homosexuality.  In 1983, five other men who said they had changed from homosexuality were interviewed on the ''David Susskind Show.''&lt;ref&gt;''The David Susskind Show'' WNEW-TV, Channel 5, aired 8 May 1983, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcript of this interview was published in the 1986 book ''The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality.''&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, editor, ''The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality'' (New York: Definition Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of a brief 1971 review calling ''The H Persuasion'' "less a book than a collection of pietistic snippets by Believers,"&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', Book Review, page BR64, September 12, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  the ''New York Times'' never reported that men said they changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Green: "FYI Put those fears away, all citizens-to-be" ''The Globe and Mail'', April 28, 1978, p.8 "Pity the lot of the Aesthetic Realists…who are mad at the ''New York Times'' because the ''Times,'' they claim, refuses to print a story that 123 homosexuals have changed (to heterosexuality) through Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; Students of the philosophy who said they changed from homosexuality or in other large ways accused the press of unfairly withholding information valuable to the lives of people. In the 1970s they mounted an aggressive campaign of telephone calls, letters, ads, and vigils in front of various media offices and at the homes of editors.&lt;ref&gt;"Some News that’s Unfit to Print," ''New York Magazine'', 17 April 1978, p.8: "Though the ''New York Times'' does a fine job of covering Milanese fashions…it has somehow managed to overlook the Aesthetic Realism story. The Aesthetic Realists do not like this, and they are doing something about it….[They] have disrupted the ''Times'' city desk with more than 65 calls a day from people demanding that the story be run….What is more, the Aesthetic Realists have gone into the city streets, holding vigils in front of publisher Punch Sulzberger’s home and those of other top ''Times'' officials."&lt;/ref&gt; Many wore lapel buttons that read "Victim of the Press".&lt;ref&gt;Nat Hentoff, "Minority protesters trash First Amendment," ''St. Petersburg Times'', Wednesday, May 5, 1993, p. 11A. "For many years in New York's Greenwich Village, decorously dressed followers of poet and guru Eli Siegel ("Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana") used to wear buttons proclaiming themselves ‘Victims of the Press.’"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Fischkin, ''Muddy Cup: a Dominican Family Comes of Age in a New America'', (NY: Scribner) {{ISBN|0-684-80704-1}}, pages 231-232: "Linda Kunz wore a 'Victim of the Press' button on her lapel. On the first day of class, she wrote this on the blackboard: 'The purpose of all education is to like the world through knowing it--Eli Siegel.' And then this question: 'Can grammar, which is the structure of language, tell us anything about the structure of the world--including ourselves?'"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Bayer, Ronald (1987) ''Homosexuality and American Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 3, p.158, pp. 127-8.  {{ISBN|0-691-02837-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, ads were placed in three major newspapers stating "we have changed from homosexuality through our study of the Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel." They were signed by 50 men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement, "We Have Changed from Homosexuality" March 18, 1978, ''New York Times'', ''Washington Post'', ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt; With few exceptions, the press in general either ignored or dismissed the assertion of persons who said they changed.

The gay press and gay reporters were generally hostile to Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Roskoff, "Gay Activist Allen Roskoff Lets It All Out", ''Queerty'', "…they were telling the gay men that it was unnatural to be homosexual.  Only opposites could attract in art and in life.  The whole philosophy was about opposites, and of course that meant that homosexuality was wrong.  I guess they matched up or convinced men.  Whenever I saw a woman with a button, I would say, ‘What’s the matter, you can’t find a straight man?’  I detested these people. I mean, they were the ex-gay people."&lt;/ref&gt;   A 1982 ''Boston Globe'' article written by "the first openly gay reporter" on its staff,&lt;ref&gt;Obituary of Kay Longcope, ''The Boston Globe'', April 8, 2007.  "Generally regarded as the first openly gay reporter on the newspaper's staff…. Ms. Longcope, who spent 22 years at the ''Globe'' and then founded a statewide gay and lesbian newsweekly in her home state of Texas, died of pancreatic cancer March 28 in Hospice Austin's Christopher House."&lt;/ref&gt; interviewed primarily gay therapists and then reported that the "assertion" of change through Aesthetic Realism was "a claim staggering to psychiatrists and psychologists."&lt;ref&gt;Kay Longcope: "Aesthetic Realism and Homosexuality," ''The Boston Globe'', April 18, 1982. "The assertion of change based on Aesthetic Realism is especially startling to professionals in the psychotherapeutic field after a decade of rethinking homosexuality—a process triggered by the Gay Liberation Movement."&lt;/ref&gt;  About 250 people protested the article on the Boston Common.  The ''Globe’s'' ombudsman later wrote in his column that the article was biased against Aesthetic Realism and that it contained "strong, negative words without attribution" and "inaccuracies".&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Kierstead, Ombudsman, "''Globe'' article on ‘Aesthetic Realism’ and gays prompts complaints," ''The Boston Globe'', 24 May 1982. "On May 13, an estimated 250 people rallied on the Boston Common…in the case of The Boston Globe and the Aesthetic Realism Foundation in New York City….The ''Globe'', once it decided to do the article…also assumed an obligation to spare no effort in thoroughly researching and investigating an organization which espouses a philosophy which is both complex and controversial. [Assistant Living Editor Ed Siegel] and writer Longcope believed that under the circumstances involved the story was fair….The ombudsman disagrees. The story, as published, contains a preponderance of material based on interviews with representatives of the gay community who, for the most part, are not un-biased in their views of Aesthetic Realism….The ombudsman believes the article, not intended as an exposé, contained a negative tone and strong negative words without attribution. It also contained inaccuracies."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some gay advocacy groups and gay activists presented Aesthetic Realism as "anti-gay", accusing the philosophy of offering a "gay cure" and expressing skepticism that homosexuality could or should change.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Gay Cult Pulls Fast One" by Bill Schoell, ''The New York Blade'' April 25, 2008. "Unfortunately, Siegel and his followers believed that homosexuality was an illness ‘caused’ by self-contempt….In the 70s AR…heavily promoted the myth that they could convert people from gay to straight….New York’s Gay Activist Alliance responded by infiltrating [or "zapping"] their meetings at their Greene Street headquarters and passing out pro-gay literature."&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons within the gay pride movement associated the desire of a man to change from homosexuality with a lack of pride in a gay identity, and saw Aesthetic Realism as biased against those living a gay lifestyle.  The Aesthetic Realism Foundation stated unequivocally that it supported full, completely equal civil rights for homosexuals, including the right of a man or woman to live their life in the way they chose.&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis: "Gays Who Have Gone Straight" ''NY Daily News'', March 15, 1981. "Ellen Reiss a teacher at the foundation said: ‘What we offer is a means to have people see themselves and the world as they truly are. We are not interested in grabbing people off the street and saying, "Change." If a person is gay and likes himself and the world and wants to stay that way, fine. But if a person wants to change we offer them a scientific logical approach.’"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to prejudice and racism==
{{Wide image|The People of Clarendon County at The Congressional Auditorium, US Capitol Visitor Center - 20091021.jpg|400px|''"The People of Clarendon County"—A Play by Ossie Davis, &amp; the Answer to Racism,'' presented at the Congressional Auditorium, US Capitol Visitor Center on October 21, 2009 with Lee Central HS Chorus and the Thelma Slater Singers of Bishopville, South Carolina.|50%|right|alt=alt text}}

In one of his earliest essays, "The Equality of Man" (1923), Siegel criticized writers who were promoting [[eugenics]]. He argued that thus far in the history of the world, people have not had equal conditions of life, to bring out their potential abilities, and he asserted that if all men and women had "an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth, they would be equal."&lt;ref&gt;''The Modern Quarterly Beginnings of Aesthetic Realism 1922-1923'' (NY: Definition Press, 1969), p. 28: "Whatever the reason, no attempt has been made to bring out all the powers of mind that are in each man at birth, by giving it conditions that would fit it best. Worded differently, men have not had an equal chance to be as actively powerful as they might be. And if they had been given an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth, they would be equal."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aesthetic Realism, racism and prejudice of all kinds begin with the human inclination towards contempt, "the addition to self through the lessening of something else." Students of the philosophy assert that the racist attitude is not inevitable, but can change if one learns to recognize and criticize contempt. In public forums, individuals of diverse nationalities and cultural backgrounds have described how, through study of Aesthetic Realism, their racism and prejudice changed, not into mere "tolerance" but into a respectful desire to know and to see that the feelings of another are "as real, and as deep, as one’s own."&lt;ref&gt;Susan P. Smith, Hickory, SC Branch, NAACP, "Back to School Rally Offers Answer to Racism," ''Hickory Daily Record,'' Friday, 21 August 2009: "The Belk Centrum Theater at Lenoir Rhyne University was packed Saturday for an intellectually stimulating Back to School Rally sponsored by the Hickory Branch NAACP....This demonstrates that people in this area are ready for new ideas in education and race relations.  Aesthetic Realism views contempt as the cause of racism, 'the addition to self through the lessening of something else'…. The criticism of contempt, including in oneself, and learning to see that the feelings of other people are as real and as deep as one's own, are essential in ending racism."&lt;/ref&gt;

On an international level, proponents advocated the study of contempt and good will, as described by Aesthetic Realism, as "The Only Answer to the Mideast Crisis," in a 1990 advertisement on the op-ed page of ''The New York Times.''&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times,'' 13 October 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  To oppose prejudice they recommend that persons of nations who are in conflict "write a soliloquy of 500 words" describing the feelings of a person in the opposing land.&lt;ref&gt;Oron, Bernstein, Fishman, Gvili, Ratz, Levy, Shazar, "Contempt Must Be Studied for Mideast Terror to End!" ''Aesthetic Realism and the Answer to Racism,'' ed. Bernstein (Orange Angle Press, 2004), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN commissioned filmmaker Ken Kimmelman, a consultant on the faculty of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, to make two anti-prejudice films: ''Asimbonanga,'' and ''Brushstrokes.'' Kimmelman credits Aesthetic Realism as his inspiration for these films, as well as his 1995 Emmy-award winning anti-prejudice public service film, ''The Heart Knows Better,'' based on, and including, a statement by Eli Siegel.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac J. Black, ''The Heart Knows Better'', ''The Amsterdam News'', 28 October 1995: "The Heart Knows Better, produced by Ken Kimmelman of Imagery Film Ltd., was just awarded the Emmy for Outstanding National Public Service Film. The film addresses racial prejudice and was inspired by this...statement of Eli Siegel, the American poet and founder of Aesthetic Realism: 'It will be found that black and white man have the same goodnesses, the same temptations, and can be criticized in the same way. The skin may be different, but the aorta is quite the same.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Another noted speaker on the subject of Aesthetic Realism and how it opposes prejudice and racism is Alice Bernstein, whose articles on the subject have been published in hundreds of papers throughout the country, including in her serialized column, "Alice Bernstein &amp; Friends."&lt;ref&gt;Robin H. King, ''South Carolina Black News'', 18 Dec. 2008: "Many people have been introduced to Alice Bernstein through her nationally published articles, and her column in the ''South Carolina Black News'' for the last five years.  She writes about what she learned  about the cause of and answer to racism from the educational philosophy, Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Bernstein is the editor of ''The People of Clarendon County'' (Chicago: Third World Press, 2007), a book that includes a play by Ossie Davis re-discovered by Bernstein, together with historical documents, photographs, and essays about Aesthetic Realism, which she describes as "the education that can end racism." The late Ossie Davis, noted actor and civil rights activist, stated: "Alice Bernstein has dedicated her life to ending racism in this country. ...[She] is writing an introduction [to my play] based on what she has learned about people and history from Aesthetic Realism which she has studied for decades."&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Alice, ed., ''The People of Clarendon County--A Play by Ossie Davis with Photographs and Historical Documents, and Essays on the Education That Can End Racism'' (Chicago: Third World Press, 2007, p. xiv).&lt;/ref&gt;

A production of ''The People of Clarendon County—a Play by Ossie Davis, &amp; the Answer to Racism,'' presenting Aesthetic Realism as the educational method that explains and changes prejudice and racism, was staged in the Congressional Auditorium of the US Capitol Visitor Center in Washington, DC on October 21, 2009, with introductory remarks given by House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn.&lt;ref&gt;''CapitalWire'', Culture, 1 Nov. 2009: "House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn gave opening remarks at a historic event on Capitol Hill in Washington, October 21st: ''The People of Clarendon County—A Play by Ossie Davis &amp; the Answer to Racism!''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and response==
The organization has also been accused by some ex-students and cult researchers for operating as a [[cult]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelbluejay.com/x/jewishtimes.html Monumental Man: The Controversial Legacy of Eli Siegel], Melissa Goldman, Jewish Times, August 22, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-05-06/news/political-surrealism/&lt;/ref&gt; Some former and current students of the philosophy have responded in a website titled "Countering the Lies," saying that the technique of the persons who want to discredit Aesthetic Realism is "1) to find out what characteristics a cult is supposed to have and, 2) then say Aesthetic Realism has them (though of course it doesn't)."&lt;ref&gt;http://counteringthelies.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Algebraic specification seeks to systematically develop more efficient programs by:

# formally defining [[data type|types of data]], and mathematical operations on those data types
# abstracting implementation details, such as the size of representations (in memory) and the efficiency of obtaining outcome of computations
# formalizing the computations and operations on data types
# allowing for automation by formally restricting operations to this limited set of behaviors and data types.

An algebraic specification achieves these goals by defining one or more data types, and specifying a collection of functions that operate on those data types.  These functions can be divided into two classes:

# [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructor functions]]: functions that create or initialize the data elements, or construct complex elements from simpler ones
# [[Method (computer programming)|additional functions]]: functions that operate on the data types, and are defined in terms of the constructor functions.

==Example==
Consider a formal algebraic specification for the [[Boolean data type|boolean]] data type.

One possible algebraic specification may provide two constructor functions for the data-element: a ''true'' constructor and a ''false'' constructor.  Thus, a boolean data element could be declared, constructed, and initialized to a value.  In this scenario, all other [[Boolean algebra|connective elements]], such as [[XOR]] and [[Logical conjunction|AND]], would be ''additional functions''.  Thus, a data element could be instantiated with either "true" or "false" value, and additional functions could be used to perform any operation on the data element.

Alternatively, the entire system of boolean data types could be specified using a different set of constructor functions: a ''false'' constructor and a ''[[Negation|not]]'' constructor.  In that case, an additional function could be defined to yield the value "true."

The algebraic specification therefore describes [[state machine|all possible states]] of the data element, and all possible [[State_machine#Concepts_and_vocabulary|transitions]] between states.

'''Animal rights''' is the idea in which some, or all, [[non-human]] [[animal]]s are entitled to the possession of their own lives and that their most basic interests—such as the need to avoid [[suffering]]—should be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2009), pp. 8, 19–20; Rowlands (1998), p. 31ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its advocates oppose the assignment of moral value and fundamental protections on the basis of species membership alone—an idea known since 1970 as [[speciesism]], when the term was coined by [[Richard D. Ryder]]—arguing that it is a prejudice as irrational as any other.&lt;ref&gt;Horta (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that animals should no longer be viewed as property or used as food, clothing, research subjects, entertainment, or beasts of burden.&lt;ref&gt;That a central goal of animal rights is to eliminate the property status of animals, see Sunstein (2004), p. 11ff.
*For speciesism and fundamental protections, see Waldau (2011).
*For food, clothing, research subjects or entertainment, see Francione (1995), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple cultural traditions around the world such as [[Jainism]], [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Animism]] also espouse some forms of animal rights.

In parallel to the debate about moral rights, [[animal law]] is now widely taught in law schools in North America, and several prominent legal scholars{{who|date=January 2013}} support the extension of basic legal rights and [[person]]hood to at least some animals. The animals most often considered in arguments for personhood are [[bonobo]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s. This is supported by some animal rights academics because it would break through the species barrier, but opposed by others because it predicates moral value on mental complexity, rather than on [[sentience]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;For animal law courses in North America, see [http://aldf.org/article.php?id=445 "Animal law courses"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613170018/http://aldf.org/article.php?id=445 |date=2010-06-13 }}, [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]].

Critics of animal rights argue that nonhuman animals are unable to enter into a [[social contract]], and thus cannot be possessors of rights, a view summed up by the philosopher [[Roger Scruton]], who writes that only humans have duties, and therefore only humans have rights.&lt;ref name=Scruton/&gt; Another argument, associated with the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] tradition, is that animals may be used as resources so long as there is no unnecessary suffering&lt;ref name="Ethical"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liguori, G.| displayauthors=etal| year = 2017 | title = Ethical Issues in the Use of Animal Models for Tissue Engineering: Reflections on Legal Aspects, Moral Theory, 3Rs Strategies, and Harm-Benefit Analysis| journal = Tissue Engineering Part C Methods | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages= 850–862 | doi=10.1089/ten.TEC.2017.0189| pmid=28756735}}&lt;/ref&gt;; they may have some moral standing, but they are inferior in status to human beings, and any interests they have may be overridden, though what counts as "necessary" suffering or a legitimate sacrifice of interests varies considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2005), pp. 11, 16.

===Moral status and animals in the ancient world===
{{main|Moral status of animals in the ancient world}}
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Aristotle]] argued that animals lacked reason (''logos''), and placed humans at the top of the natural world.&lt;ref name=Sorabji7/&gt;]]
Aristotle argued that animals lacked reason (logos), and placed humans at the top of the natural world, yet the respect for animals in ancient Greece was very high. Some animals were considered divine, e.g. dolphins.
The 21st-century debates about animals can be traced back to the savage stone age from horrible histories, and the idea of a divine hierarchy. In the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' 1:26 (5th or 6th century BCE), [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] is given "dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." Dominion need not entail property rights, but it has been interpreted, by some, over the centuries to imply ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1995), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary philosopher [[Bernard Rollin]] writes that "''dominion'' does not entail or allow abuse any more than does dominion a parent enjoys over a child."&lt;ref name="Rollin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollin|first=Bernard E.|title=Animal Rights and Human Morality|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|isbn=978-1-61592-211-6|page=117}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rollin further states that the [[Biblical Sabbath]] requirement promulgated in the [[Ten Commandments]] "required that animals be granted a day of rest along with humans. Correlatively, the Bible forbids 'plowing with an ox and an ass together' (Deut. 22:10–11). According to the rabbinical tradition, this prohibition stems from the hardship that an ass would suffer by being compelled to keep up with an ox, which is, of course, far more powerful. Similarly, one finds the prohibition against 'muzzling an ox when it treads out the grain' (Deut. 25:4–5), and even an environmental prohibition against destroying trees when besieging a city (Deut. 20:19–20). These ancient regulations, virtually forgotten, bespeak of an eloquent awareness of the status of animals as ends in themselves", a point also corroborated by [[Norm Phelps]].&lt;ref name="Rollin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phelps2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phelps|first=Norm|title=Animal Rights According to the Bible|year=2002|publisher=Lantern Books|isbn=978-1-59056-009-9|page=70|quote=The Bible's most important reference to the sentence and will of nonhuman animals is found in Deuteronomy 25:4, which became the scriptural foundation of the rabbinical doctrine of ''tsar ba'ale Chayim'', "the suffering of the living," which makes relieving the suffering of animals a religious duty for Jews. "You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing." The point of muzzling the ox was to keep him from eating any of the grain that he was threshing. The point of the commandment was the cruelty of forcing an animal to work for hours at a time with his face only inches from delicious food while not allowing him to eat any of it. From time immemorial, Jew have taken great pride in the care they provide their animals.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher and mathematician, [[Pythagoras]] (c. 580–c. 500 BCE), urged respect for animals, believing that human and nonhuman souls were [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] from human to animal, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner (2005), p. 47; Taylor (2009), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Against this, [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE), student to the philosopher [[Plato]], argued that nonhuman animals had no interests of their own, ranking them far below humans in the [[Great Chain of Being]]. He was the first to create a taxonomy of animals; he perceived some similarities between humans and other species, but argued for the most part that animals lacked reason (''logos''), reasoning (''logismos''), thought (''dianoia'', ''nous''), and belief (''doxa'').&lt;ref name=Sorabji7&gt;Sorabji (1993), p. 12ff.; [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007642/animal-rights Wise (2007)].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theophrastus]] (c. 371 – c. 287 BCE), one of Aristotle's pupils, argued that animals also had reasoning (''logismos'') and opposed eating meat on the grounds that it robbed them of life and was therefore unjust.&lt;ref name=Taylor35&gt;Taylor (2009), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sorabji (1993) p. 45 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Theophrastus did not prevail; [[Richard Sorabji]] writes that current attitudes to animals can be traced to the heirs of the Western Christian tradition selecting the hierarchy that Aristotle sought to preserve.&lt;ref name="  Sorabji7"/&gt;

Plutarch (1 C. CE) in his Life of Cato the Elder comments that while law and justice are applicable strictly to men only, beneficence and charity towards beasts is characteristic of a gentle heart. This is intended as a correction and advance over the merely utilitarian treatment of animals and slaves by Cato himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html|title=Plutarch • Life of Cato the Elder|website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Beauchamp]] (2011) writes that the most extensive account in antiquity of how animals should be treated was written by the Neoplatonist philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (234–c. 305 CE), in his ''On Abstinence from Animal Food'', and ''On Abstinence from Killing Animals''.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp (2011a), pp. 4–5.

===17th century: Animals as automata===

====Early animal protection laws in Europe====
&lt;!---[[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]] was the Shogun of Japan from 1680 until 1709 and enacted animal rights, protecting especially d ogs. Wiki community, Please make a pretty wiki article about this subject---&gt;According to [[Richard D. Ryder]], the first known animal protection legislation in Europe was passed in Ireland in 1635. It prohibited pulling wool off sheep, and the attaching of ploughs to horses' tails, referring to "the cruelty used to beasts."&lt;ref&gt;''The Statutes at Large''. Dublin, 1786, cited in Ryder (2000), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1641, the first legal code to protect domestic animals in North America was passed by the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].&lt;ref name=Francione7/&gt; The colony's constitution was based on ''[[Massachusetts Body of Liberties|The Body of Liberties]]'' by the Reverend [[Nathaniel Ward]] (1578–1652), an English lawyer, [[Puritan]] clergyman, and University of Cambridge graduate. Ward's list of "rites" included rite 92: "No man shall exercise any Tirrany or Crueltie toward any brute Creature which are usually kept for man's use." Historian [[Roderick Nash]] (1989) writes that, at the height of René Descartes' influence in Europe—and his view that animals were simply automata—it is significant that the New Englanders created a law that implied animals were not unfeeling machines.&lt;ref name=Nash19&gt;Nash (1989), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puritans passed animal protection legislation in England too. Kathleen Kete writes that animal welfare laws were passed in 1654 as part of the ordinances of the [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]]—the government under [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1599–1658), which lasted from 1653 to 1659, following the [[English Civil War]]. Cromwell disliked blood sports, which included [[cockfighting]], [[cock throwing]], [[dog fighting]], [[bull baiting]] and bull running, said to tenderize the meat. These could be seen in villages and fairgrounds, and became associated with idleness, drunkenness, and gambling. Kete writes that the Puritans interpreted the biblical dominion of man over animals to mean responsible stewardship, rather than ownership. The opposition to blood sports became part of what was seen as Puritan interference in people's lives, and the animal protection laws were overturned during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was returned to the throne in 1660.&lt;ref name=Kete2&gt;Kete (2002), p. 19 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

====René Descartes====
{{rquote|right|[Animals] eat without pleasure, cry without pain, grow without knowing it; they desire nothing, fear nothing, know nothing. — [[Nicolas Malebranche]] (1638–1715)&lt;ref name=Malebranche&gt;Harrison (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The great influence of the 17th century was the French philosopher, [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650), whose [[Meditations on First Philosophy|''Meditations'']] (1641) informed attitudes about animals well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Midgley1999/&gt; Writing during the [[scientific revolution]], Descartes proposed a [[Mechanistic#Universal mechanism|mechanistic theory]] of the universe, the aim of which was to show that the world could be mapped out without allusion to subjective experience.&lt;ref name=Cottingham&gt;Cottingham (1995), pp. 188–192.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{rquote|right|Hold then the same view of the dog which has lost his master, which has sought him in all the thoroughfares with cries of sorrow, which comes into the house troubled and restless, goes downstairs, goes upstairs; goes from room to room, finds at last in his study the master he loves, and betokens his gladness by soft whimpers, frisks, and caresses.
There are barbarians who seize this dog, who so greatly surpasses man in fidelity and friendship, and nail him down to a table and dissect him alive, to show you the mesaraic veins! You discover in him all the same organs of feeling as in yourself. Answer me, [[Mechanism (philosophy)#Universal mechanism|mechanist]], has Nature arranged all the springs of feeling in this animal to the end that he might not feel? — [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778)&lt;ref&gt;"Bêtes, ''Dictionnaire Philosophique''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
His mechanistic approach was extended to the issue of animal [[consciousness]]. Mind, for Descartes, was a thing apart from the physical universe, a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|separate substance]], linking human beings to the mind of God. The nonhuman, on the other hand, were for Descartes nothing but complex [[Automaton|automata]], with no souls, minds, or reason.&lt;ref name="Midgley1999"&gt;Midgley, Mary (May 24, 1999-2000). [http://www.newstatesman.com/node/134849], ''The New Statesman''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of animals as man's duty towards himself===

====John Locke, Immanuel Kant====
Against Descartes, the British philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) argued, in ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' (1693), that animals did have feelings, and that unnecessary cruelty toward them was morally wrong, but that the right not to be harmed adhered either to the animal's owner, or to the human being who was being damaged by being cruel. Discussing the importance of preventing children from tormenting animals, he wrote: "For the custom of tormenting and killing of beasts will, by degrees, harden their minds even towards men."&lt;ref&gt;Locke (1693).&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke's position echoed that of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274). [[Paul Waldau]] writes that the argument can be found at [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] (9:9–10), when [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] asks: "Is it for oxen that God is concerned? Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our sake." Christian philosophers interpreted this to mean that humans had no direct duty to nonhuman animals, but had a duty only to protect them from the effects of engaging in cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;Waldau (2001), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), following Aquinas, opposed the idea that humans have direct duties toward nonhumans. For Kant, cruelty to animals was wrong only because it was bad for humankind. He argued in 1785 that "cruelty to animals is contrary to man's duty to ''himself'', because it deadens in him the feeling of sympathy for their sufferings, and thus a natural tendency that is very useful to morality in relation to other ''human beings'' is weakened."&lt;ref name=Kant1785&gt;Kant (1785), part II, paras 16 and 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century: Centrality of sentience===
[[File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|130px|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] argued for the inclusion of animals in [[natural law]].]]

====Jean-Jacques Rousseau====
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778) argued in ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' (1754) for the inclusion of animals in [[natural law]] on the grounds of [[sentience]]: "By this method also we put an end to the time-honored disputes concerning the participation of animals in natural law: for it is clear that, being destitute of intelligence and liberty, they cannot recognize that law; as they partake, however, in some measure of our nature, in consequence of the sensibility with which they are endowed, they ought to partake of natural right; so that mankind is subjected to a kind of obligation even toward the brutes. It appears, in fact, that if I am bound to do no injury to my fellow-creatures, this is less because they are rational than because they are sentient beings: and this quality, being common both to men and beasts, ought to entitle the latter at least to the privilege of not being wantonly ill-treated by the former."&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau (1754), quoted in Midgley (1984), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his treatise on education, ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'' (1762), he encouraged parents to raise their children on a vegetarian diet. He believed that the food of the culture a child was raised eating, played an important role in the character and disposition they would develop as adults. "For however one tries to explain the practice, it is certain that great meat-eaters are usually more cruel and ferocious than other men. This has been recognized at all times and in all places. The English are noted for their cruelty while the Gaures are the gentlest of men. All savages are cruel, and it is not their customs that tend in this direction; their cruelty is the result of their food."

====Jeremy Bentham====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Jeremy Bentham]]: "The time will come, when humanity will extend its mantle over every thing which breathes."&lt;ref&gt;Bentham (1781), Part III.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Four years later, one of the founders of modern utilitarianism, the English philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] (1748–1832), although opposed to the concept of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], argued that it was the ability to suffer that should be the benchmark of how we treat other beings. Bentham claims that the capacity for suffering gives the right to equal consideration, equal consideration is that the interest of any being affected by an action are to be considered and have the equal interest of any other being. If rationality were the criterion, he argued, many humans, including infants and the disabled, would also have to be treated as though they were things.&lt;ref name=Benthall&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8322.2007.00494.x Benthall (2007)], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not conclude that humans and nonhumans had equal moral significance, but argued that the latter's interests should be taken into account. He wrote in 1789, just as African slaves were being [[Slavery in the British and French Caribbean|freed by the French]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may one day come to be recognized that the number of the legs, the [[Hair follicle|villosity]] of the skin, or the termination of the ''[[Sacrum|os sacrum]]'' are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they ''reason''?, nor Can they ''talk''? but, Can they ''suffer?''&lt;ref name=Bentham&gt;Bentham (1789), quoted in Garner (2005), pp. 12—13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===19th century: Emergence of ''jus animalium''===
{{Further|Badger baiting|Bull baiting|Cockfighting}}
[[File:Badger-baiting2.jpg|thumb|[[Badger baiting]], one of the rural sports campaigners sought to ban from 1800 onwards.]]
The 19th century saw an explosion of interest in animal protection, particularly in England. Debbie Legge and Simon Brooman write that the educated classes became concerned about attitudes toward the old, the needy, children, and the insane, and that this concern was extended to nonhumans. Before the 19th century, there had been prosecutions for poor treatment of animals, but only because of the damage to the animal as property. In 1793, for example, John Cornish was found not guilty of maiming a horse after pulling the animal's tongue out; the judge ruled that Cornish could be found guilty only if there was evidence of malice toward the owner.&lt;ref name=Legge40&gt;Legge and Brooman (1997), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1800 onwards, there were several attempts in England to introduce animal protection legislation. The first was a bill against [[bull baiting]], introduced in April 1800 by a Scottish MP, Sir [[Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet|William Pulteney]] (1729–1805). It was opposed ''inter alia'' on the grounds that it was anti-working class, and was defeated by two votes. Another attempt was made in 1802, this time opposed by the Secretary at War, [[William Windham]] (1750–1810), who said the Bill was supported by Methodists and Jacobins who wished to "destroy the Old English character, by the abolition of all rural sports."&lt;ref name="Phelps 2007 pp. 96"&gt;Phelps (2007), pp. 96–98.
*''Speeches in Parliament, of the Right Honourable William Windham. Volume I''. Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown (1812), pp. 303, 340–356.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1809, [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Lord Erskine]] (1750-1823) introduced a bill to protect cattle and horses from malicious wounding, wanton cruelty, and beating.  He told the House of Lords that animals had protection only as property: "''The animals themselves are without protection''--the law regards them not ''substantively''--they have no rights!"&lt;ref&gt;''Cruelty to Animals: The Speech of Lord Erskine in the House of Peers'' [https://archive.org/details/b28748165 (London: Richard Phillips, 1809) p 2] Italics in original speech.

[[File:Trial of Bill Burns.jpg|thumb|The Trial of Bill Burns]]

{{further|wikisource:Martin's Act 1822}}

In 1821, the Treatment of Horses bill was introduced by Colonel [[Richard Martin (Irish politician)|Richard Martin]] (1754–1834), MP for Galway in Ireland, but it was lost among laughter in the House of Commons that the next thing would be rights for asses, dogs, and cats.&lt;ref name=Legge41&gt;Legge and Brooman (1997), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknamed "Humanity Dick" by George IV, Martin finally succeeded in 1822 with his "Ill Treatment of Horses and Cattle Bill"—or "Martin's Act", as it became known—which was the world's first major piece of animal protection legislation. It was given royal assent on June 22 that year as ''[[Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822|An Act to prevent the cruel and improper Treatment of Cattle]]'', and made it an offence, punishable by fines up to five pounds or two months imprisonment, to "beat, abuse, or ill-treat any horse, mare, gelding, mule, ass, ox, cow, heifer, steer, sheep or other cattle."&lt;ref name=Legge40/&gt;

Legge and Brooman argue that the success of the Bill lay in the personality of "Humanity Dick", who was able to shrug off the ridicule from the House of Commons, and whose sense of humour managed to capture the House's attention.&lt;ref name=Legge40/&gt; It was Martin himself who brought the first prosecution under the Act, when he had Bill Burns, a [[costermonger]]—a street seller of fruit—arrested for beating a donkey, and paraded the animal's injuries before a reportedly astonished court. Burns was fined, and newspapers and music halls were full of jokes about how Martin had relied on the testimony of a donkey.&lt;ref name=Phelps100&gt;Phelps 2007, pp. 98–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries followed suit in passing legislation or making decisions that favoured animals. In 1822, the courts in New York ruled that wanton cruelty to animals was a misdemeanor at common law.&lt;ref name=Francione7&gt;Francione 1996, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In France in 1850, [[:fr:Loi Grammont|Jacques Philippe Delmas de Grammont]] succeeded in having the ''Loi Grammont'' passed, outlawing cruelty against domestic animals, and leading to years of arguments about whether bulls could be classed as domestic in order to ban bullfighting.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, John. Bullfighting: Art, Technique and Spanish Society''. Transaction Publishers, 1999, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Washington followed in 1859, New York in 1866, California in 1868, and Florida in 1889.&lt;ref name=Legge50&gt;Legge and Brooman (1997), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, a series of amendments extended the reach of the 1822 Act, which became the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]], outlawing cockfighting, baiting, and dog fighting, followed by another [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1849|amendment in 1849]], and [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1876|again in 1876]].

Richard Martin soon realized that magistrates did not take the Martin Act seriously, and that it was not being reliably enforced. Martin's Act was supported by various social reformers who were not parliamentarians and an informal network had gathered around the efforts of Reverend [[Arthur Broome]] (1779-1837) to create a voluntary organisation that would promote kindness toward animals.

Broome did organise and chair a meeting of sympathisers in November 1822 where it was agreed that a Society should be created and at which Broome was named its Secretary but the attempt was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;See Kathryn Shevelow, ''For the Love of Animals: The Rise of the Animal Protection Movemen''t (New York: Henry Holt, 2008), 268; Arthur W. Moss, ''Valiant Crusade: The History of the RSPCA'' (London: Cassell, 1961), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824, Broome arranged a new meeting in Old Slaughter's Coffee House in [[St Martin's Lane]], a London café frequented by artists and actors. The group met on June 16, 1824, and included a number of MPs: Richard Martin, Sir [[James Mackintosh]] (1765–1832), Sir [[Sir Thomas Buxton, 1st Baronet|Thomas Buxton]] (1786–1845), [[William Wilberforce]] (1759–1833), and Sir [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|James Graham]] (1792–1861), who had been an MP, and who became one again in 1826.&lt;ref name=RSPCAhistory&gt;Anonymous (1972).

They decided to form a "Society instituted for the purpose of preventing cruelty to animals"; the [[RSPCA|Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], as it became known. It determined to send men to inspect slaughterhouses, [[Smithfield Market]], where livestock had been sold since the 10th century, and to look into the treatment of horses by coachmen.&lt;ref name="RSPCAhistory"/&gt; The Society became the Royal Society in 1840, when it was granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria, herself strongly opposed to [[vivisection]].&lt;ref name=Legge47&gt;Legge and Brooman 1997, p. 47.

From 1824 onwards, several books were published, analyzing animal rights issues, rather than protection alone. [[Lewis Gompertz]] (1783/4–1865), one of the men who attended the first meeting of the SPCA, published ''Moral Inquiries on the Situation of Man and of Brutes'' (1824), arguing that every living creature, human and nonhuman, has more right to the use of its own body than anyone else has to use it, and that our duty to promote happiness applies equally to all beings. [[Edward Nicholson (librarian)|Edward Nicholson]] (1849–1912), head of the [[Bodleian Library]] at the University of Oxford, argued in ''Rights of an Animal'' (1879) that animals have the same natural right to life and liberty that human beings do, disregarding Descartes' mechanistic view—or what he called the "Neo-Cartesian snake"—that they lack consciousness.&lt;ref name=Taylor62&gt;Taylor (2009), p. 62.

Howard Moore (1862–1916), an American zoologist and author of ''The Universal Kinship'' (1906) and ''The New Ethics'' (1907).&lt;ref name=Nash137&gt;Nash 1989, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arthur Schopenhauer====
[[File:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|140px|[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] argued in 1839 that the view of cruelty as wrong only because it hardens humans was "revolting and abominable".&lt;ref name=Schopenhauer96&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]''. This edition Hackett Publishing, 1998, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The development in England of the concept of animal rights was strongly supported by the German philosopher, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860). He wrote that Europeans were "awakening more and more to a sense that beasts have rights, in proportion as the strange notion is being gradually overcome and outgrown, that the animal kingdom came into existence solely for the benefit and pleasure of man."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Phelps 2007, p. 153–154.
*Schopenhauer wrote in ''The Basis of Morality'': "It is asserted that beasts have no rights&amp;nbsp;... that 'there are no duties to be fulfilled towards animals.' Such a view is one of revolting coarseness, a barbarism of the West, whose source is Judaism." A few passages later, he called the idea that animals exist for human benefit a "Jewish stence." See Phelps, ''op cit''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He stopped short of advocating vegetarianism, arguing that, so long as an animal's death was quick, men would suffer more by not eating meat than animals would suffer by being eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schopenhauer |first1=Arthur |title=The World as Will and Idea Vol.I |publisher=The Project Gutenberg, 2011 |pages=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer also theorized that the reason people succumbed to the "''unnatural diet''" of meat-eating was because of the unnatural, cold climate they emigrated to and the necessity of meat for survival in such a climate, for fruits and vegetables could not be dependably cultivated at those times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schopenhauer |first1=Arthur |title=Parerga &amp; Paralipomena Vol. II |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=144, 338}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He applauded the animal protection movement in England—"To the honor, then, of the English, be it said that they are the first people who have, in downright earnest, extended the protecting arm of the law to animals."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He also argued against the dominant [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian idea that animal cruelty is wrong only insofar as it brutalizes humans:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, because Christian morality leaves animals out of account&amp;nbsp;... they are at once outlawed in philosophical morals; they are mere "things," mere ''means'' to any ends whatsoever. They can therefore be used for vivisection, hunting, coursing, bullfights, and horse racing, and can be whipped to death as they struggle along with heavy carts of stone. Shame on such a morality that is worthy of pariahs, [[chandala]]s, and [[Mleccha|mlechchhas]], and that fails to recognize the eternal essence that exists in every living thing&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=Schopenhauer96/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Percy Bysshe Shelley====
The English poet and dramatist [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (1792–1822) wrote two essays advocating a vegetarian diet, for ethical and health reasons: ''[[A Vindication of Natural Diet]]'' (1813) and ''On the Vegetable System of Diet'' (1829, posth.).

====John Stuart Mill====
[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873), the English philosopher, also argued that utilitarianism must take animals into account, writing in 1864:{{verify source|type=year|date=November 2012}} "Nothing is more natural to human beings, nor, up to a certain point in cultivation, more universal, than to estimate the pleasures and pains of others as deserving of regard exactly in proportion to their likeness to ourselves.&amp;nbsp;... Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man; is that practice moral or immoral? And if, exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness, they do not with one voice answer 'immoral,' let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned."&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2005), p. 12; [http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/mill01.htm/ Mill (1874)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805172223/http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/mill01.htm |date=2012-08-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charles Darwin====
[[File:1878 Darwin photo by Leonard from Woodall 1884 - cropped grayed partially cleaned.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=portrait|[[Charles Darwin]] wrote in 1837: "Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind?"]]
[[James Rachels]] writes that [[Charles Darwin]]'s (1809–1882) ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859)—which presented the [[theory of evolution]] by [[natural selection]]—revolutionized the way humans viewed their relationship with other species. Not only did human beings have a direct kinship with other animals, but the latter had social, mental and moral lives too, Darwin argued.&lt;ref name=Rachels2009/&gt; He wrote in his ''Notebooks'' (1837): "Animals – whom we have made our slaves we do not like to consider our equals. – Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind?"&lt;ref&gt;Darwin (1837), quoted in Redclift (2010), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871), he argued that "There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties", attributing to animals the power of reason, decision making, memory, sympathy, and imagination.&lt;ref name=Rachels2009&gt;Rachels (2009), pp. 124–126; Beauchamp (2009), pp. 248–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachels writes that Darwin noted the moral implications of the cognitive similarities, arguing that "humanity to the lower animals" was one of the "noblest virtues with which man is endowed." He was strongly opposed to any kind of cruelty to animals, including setting traps. He wrote in a letter that he supported [[vivisection]] for "real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror&amp;nbsp;..." In 1875, he testified before a Royal Commission on Vivisection, lobbying for a bill to protect both the animals used in vivisection, and the study of physiology. Rachels writes that the animal rights advocates of the day, such as Frances Power Cobbe, did not see Darwin as an ally.&lt;ref name=Rachels2009/&gt;

====American SPCA, Frances Power Cobbe, Anna Kingsford====
[[File:FrancesPowerCobbe2.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Frances Power Cobbe]] founded two of the first anti-vivisection groups.]]
[[File:Anna Kingsford 2.JPG|thumb|140px|[[Anna Kingsford]], one of the first English women to graduate in medicine, published ''The Perfect Way in Diet'' (1881), advocating vegetarianism.]]

An early proposal for legal rights for animals came from a group of citizens in [[Ashtabula County, Ohio]]. Around 1844, the group proposed an [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] stating that if slaves from [[Slave and free states|slave states]] were receiving representation as 3/5 of a person on the basis that they were animal property, all the animal property of the free states should receive representation also.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/25466018|title=Petition from Citizens of Ashtabula County, Ohio for a Constitutional Amendment that Representation in Congress be Uniform throughout the Country|last=|first=|date=1844|website=[[National Archives Catalog]]|publisher=|access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first animal protection group in the United States, the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), was founded by [[Henry Bergh]] in April 1866. Bergh had been appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to a diplomatic post in Russia, and had been disturbed by the mistreatment of animals he witnessed there. He consulted with the president of the RSPCA in London, and returned to the United States to speak out against bullfights, cockfights, and the beating of horses. He created a "Declaration of the Rights of Animals", and in 1866 persuaded the New York state legislature to pass anti-cruelty legislation and to grant the ASPCA the authority to enforce it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advocacy.britannica.com/blog/advocacy/2006/11/the-aspca-pioneers-in-animal-welfare/|title=The ASPCA–Pioneers in Animal Welfare - Advocacy for Animals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, the Irish social reformer [[Frances Power Cobbe]] (1822–1904) founded the Society for the Protection of Animals Liable to Vivisection, the world's first organization opposed to animal research, which became the [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]]. In 1880, the English feminist [[Anna Kingsford]] (1846–1888) became one of the first English women to graduate in medicine, after studying for her degree in Paris, and the only student at the time to do so without having experimented on animals. She published ''The Perfect Way in Diet'' (1881), advocating vegetarianism, and in the same year founded the Food Reform Society. She was also vocal in her opposition to experimentation on animals.&lt;ref&gt;Rudacille (2000), pp. 31, 46.
*Also see Vyvyan (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, Cobbe set up the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]], with which she campaigned against the use of dogs in research, coming close to success with the 1919 Dogs (Protection) Bill, which almost became law.&lt;!--add source, plus something about Cobbe/Kingsford disputes--&gt;

Ryder writes that, as the interest in animal protection grew in the late 1890s, attitudes toward animals among scientists began to harden. They embraced the idea that what they saw as [[anthropomorphism]]—the attribution of human qualities to nonhumans—was unscientific. Animals had to be approached as physiological entities only, as [[Ivan Pavlov]] wrote in 1927, "without any need to resort to fantastic speculations as to the existence of any possible subjective states." It was a position that hearkened back to Descartes in the 17th century, that nonhumans were purely mechanical, with no rationality and perhaps even no consciousness.&lt;ref name=Ryder5&gt;Ryder (2000), pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Friedrich Nietzsche====
Avoiding utilitarianism, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) found other reasons to defend animals. He argued that "The sight of blind suffering is the spring of the deepest emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Animal Rights: A Historical Anthology. By [[Andrew Linzey]], Paul A. B. Clarke&lt;/ref&gt; He once wrote: "For man is the cruelest animal. At tragedies, bull-fights, and crucifixions hath he hitherto been happiest on earth; and when he invented his hell, behold, that was his heaven on earth."&lt;ref&gt;The Selected Writings of Friedrich Nietzsche. {{ISBN|978-1-60459-332-7}} Wilder Publications April 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his writings, he speaks of the human being as an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciy.org/2010/06/10/6286/|title=Posthuman Destinies|publisher=sciy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Henry Salt====
In 1894, [[Henry Stephens Salt|Henry Salt]] (1851–1939), a former master at [[Eton College|Eton]], who had set up the Humanitarian League to lobby for a ban on hunting the year before, published ''Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress''.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2009), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the object of the essay was to "set the principle of animals' rights on a consistent and intelligible footing."&lt;ref name=Salt1/&gt; Concessions to the demands for ''jus animalium'' had been made grudgingly to date, he wrote, with an eye on the interests of animals ''qua'' property, rather than as rights bearers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even the leading advocates of animal rights seem to have shrunk from basing their claim on the only argument which can ultimately be held to be a really sufficient one—the assertion that animals, as well as men, though, of course, to a far less extent than men, are possessed of a distinctive individuality, and, therefore, are in justice entitled to live their lives with a due measure of that "restricted freedom" to which Herbert Spencer alludes.&lt;ref name=Salt1&gt;[http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/salt01.htm Salt 1894, chapter 1]. Salt cited Spencer's definition of rights: "Every man is free to do that which he wills, provided he infringes not the equal liberty of any other man&amp;nbsp;... Whoever admits that each man must have a certain restricted freedom, asserts that it is right he should have this restricted freedom&amp;nbsp;... And hence the several particular freedoms deducible may fitly be called, as they commonly are called, his rights."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He argued that there was no point in claiming rights for animals if those rights were subordinated to human desire, and took issue with the idea that the life of a human might have more moral worth. "[The] notion of the life of an animal having 'no moral purpose,' belongs to a class of ideas which cannot possibly be accepted by the advanced humanitarian thought of the present day—it is a purely arbitrary assumption, at variance with our best instincts, at variance with our best science, and absolutely fatal (if the subject be clearly thought out) to any full realization of animals' rights. If we are ever going to do justice to the lower races, we must get rid of the antiquated notion of a 'great gulf' fixed between them and mankind, and must recognize the common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood."&lt;ref name=Salt1/&gt;

===20th century: Animal rights movement===

====Brown Dog Affair, Lizzy Lind af Hageby====
{{main|Brown Dog affair}}
[[File:International Anti-Vivisection Congress, 1913.jpg|thumb|[[Lizzy Lind af Hageby]] (centre, seated) in 1913.]]
In 1902, [[Lizzy Lind af Hageby]] (1878–1963), a Swedish feminist, and a friend, Lisa Shartau, traveled to England to study medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women, intending to learn enough to become authoritative anti-vivisection campaigners. In the course of their studies, they witnessed several animal experiments, and published the details as ''The Shambles of Science: Extracts from the Diary of Two Students of Physiology'' (1903). Their allegations included that they had seen a brown terrier dog dissected while conscious, which prompted angry denials from the researcher, [[William Bayliss]], and his colleagues. After [[Stephen Coleridge]] of the National Anti-Vivisection Society accused Bayliss of having violated the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1876]], Bayliss sued and won, convincing a court that the animal had been anesthetized as required by the Act.&lt;ref name=Mason1997/&gt;

In response, anti-vivisection campaigners commissioned a statue of the dog to be erected in Battersea Park in 1906, with the plaque: "Men and Women of England, how long shall these Things be?" The statue caused uproar among medical students, leading to frequent vandalism of the statue and the need for a 24-hour police guard. The affair culminated in riots in 1907 when 1,000 medical students clashed with police, suffragettes and trade unionists in Trafalgar Square. Battersea Council removed the statue from the park under cover of darkness two years later.&lt;ref name=Mason1997&gt;Mason (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coral Lansbury]] (1985) and [[Hilda Kean]] (1998) write that the significance of the affair lay in the relationships that formed in support of the "Brown Dog Done to Death", which became a symbol of the oppression the women's suffrage movement felt at the hands of the male political and medical establishment. Kean argues that both sides saw themselves as heirs to the future. The students saw the women and trade unionists as representatives of anti-science sentimentality, while the women saw themselves as progressive, with the students and their teachers belonging to a previous age.&lt;ref&gt;Lansbury (1985), pp. 152–169; Kean (1998), pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Development of veganism====
{{main|Veganism}}
Members of the English Vegetarian Society who avoided the use of eggs and animal milk in the 19th and early 20th century were known as strict vegetarians. The International Vegetarian Union cites an article informing readers of alternatives to shoe leather in the Vegetarian Society's magazine in 1851 as evidence of the existence of a group that sought to avoid [[animal product]]s entirely. There was increasing unease within the Society from the start of the 20th century onwards with regards to egg and milk consumption, and in 1923 its magazine wrote that the "ideal position for vegetarians is [complete] abstinence from animal products."&lt;ref name="Salt 1880"&gt;[http://www.ivu.org/history/europe19b/salt_a_plea_for_vegetarianism.pdf Salt (1880)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616115150/http://www.ivu.org/history/europe19b/salt_a_plea_for_vegetarianism.pdf |date=2012-06-16 }}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (1869–1948) argued in 1931 before a meeting of the Society in London that vegetarianism should be pursued in the interests of animals, and not only as a human health issue. He met both Henry Salt and Anna Kingsford, and read Salt's ''A Plea for Vegetarianism'' (1880). Salt wrote in the pamphlet that "a Vegetarian is still regarded, in ordinary society, as little better than a madman."&lt;ref name="Salt 1880"/&gt; In 1944, several members, led by [[Donald Watson]] (1910–2016), decided to break from the Vegetarian Society over the issue of egg and milk use. Watson coined the term "vegan" for those whose diet included no animal products, and they formed the British [[Vegan Society]] on November 1 that year.&lt;ref name=Leneman&gt;Leneman (1999)

====''Tierschutzgesetz''====
{{Further|Animal welfare in Nazi Germany}}
[[File:Hermann Goering 2.jpg|thumb|This cartoon appeared in ''[[Kladderadatsch]]'', a German satirical magazine, on September 3, 1933, showing lab animals giving the [[Nazi salute]] to [[Hermann Göring]], after restrictions on [[animal testing]] were announced.]]

On coming to power in January 1933, the [[Nazi Party]] passed a comprehensive set of animal protection laws. The laws were similar to those that already existed in England, though more detailed and with severe penalties for breaking them. Arnold Arluke and [[Boria Sax]] write that the Nazis tried to abolish the distinction between humans and animals, to the point where many people were regarded as less valuable than animals.&lt;ref name=Arluke1992&gt;Arluke and Sax (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1933 they passed laws regulating the slaughter of animals; one of their targets was [[kosher slaughter]]. In November the ''Tierschutzgesetz'', or animal protection law, was introduced, with [[Adolf Hitler]] announcing an end to animal cruelty: "''Im neuen Reich darf es keine Tierquälerei mehr geben.''" ("In the new Reich, no more animal cruelty will be allowed.") It was followed in July 1934 by the ''Reichsjagdgesetz'', prohibiting hunting; in July 1935 by the ''Naturschutzgesetz'', environmental legislation; in November 1937 by a law regulating animal transport in cars; and in September 1938 by a similar law dealing with animals on trains.&lt;ref&gt;Sax (2000) p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was a vegetarian in the later years of his life; several members of his inner circle, including [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], and [[Heinrich Himmler]], adopted some form of vegetarianism, though by most accounts their vegetarianism was not as strict as Hitler's.&lt;ref&gt;Proctor (1999), pp. 135–137; Sax (2000), pp. 35, 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Increase in animal use====
Despite the proliferation of animal protection legislation, animals still had no legal rights. Debbie Legge writes that existing legislation was very much tied to the idea of human interests, whether protecting human sensibilities by outlawing cruelty, or protecting property rights by making sure animals were not damaged. The over-exploitation of fishing stocks, for example, is viewed as harming the environment for people; the hunting of animals to extinction means that humans in the future will derive no enjoyment from them; poaching results in financial loss to the owner, and so on.&lt;ref name="Legge50"/&gt;

Notwithstanding the interest in animal welfare of the previous century, the situation for animals arguably deteriorated in the 20th century, particularly after the Second World War. This was in part because of the increase in the numbers used in animal research—300 in the UK in 1875, 19,084 in 1903, and 2.8 million in 2005 (50–100 million worldwide), and a modern annual estimated range of 10 million to upwards of 100 million in the US&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/24_07_06_animaltesting.pdf "Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Great Britain, 2005"], Her Majesty's Stationery Office.

====Development of direct action====
{{further|Hunt Saboteurs Association|RSPCA Reform Group}}
In the early 1960s in England, support for animal rights began to coalesce around the issue of [[blood sport]]s, particularly hunting deer, [[Foxhunting|foxes]], and otters using dogs, an aristocratic and middle-class English practice, stoutly defended in the name of protecting rural traditions. The psychologist [[Richard D. Ryder]] – who became involved with the animal rights movement in the late 1960s – writes that the new chair of the [[League Against Cruel Sports]] tried in 1963 to steer it away from confronting members of the hunt, which triggered the formation that year of a [[direct action]] breakaway group, the Hunt Saboteurs Association. This was set up by a journalist, John Prestige, who had witnessed a pregnant deer being chased into a village and killed by the [[Devon and Somerset Staghounds]]. The practice of sabotaging hunts (for example, by misleading the dogs with scents or horns) spread throughout south-east England, particularly around university towns, leading to violent confrontations when the huntsmen attacked the "sabs".&lt;ref name=Ryder167&gt;Ryder (2000), p. 167ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy spread to the RSPCA, which had arguably grown away from its radical roots to become a conservative group with charity status and royal patronage. It had failed to speak out against hunting, and indeed counted huntsmen among its members. As with the League Against Cruel Sports, this position gave rise to a splinter group, the RSPCA Reform Group, which sought to radicalize the organization, leading to chaotic meetings of the group's ruling Council, and successful (though short-lived) efforts to change it from within by electing to the Council members who would argue from an animal rights perspective, and force the RSPCA to address issues such as hunting, factory farming, and animal experimentation. Ryder himself was elected to the Council in 1971, and served as its chair from 1977 to 1979.&lt;ref name=Ryder167/&gt;

====Formation of the Oxford group====
{{main|Oxford Group (animal rights)}}
The same period saw writers and academics begin to speak out again in favor of animal rights. [[Ruth Harrison]] published ''Animal Machines'' (1964), an influential critique of factory farming, and on October 10, 1965, the novelist [[Brigid Brophy]] had an article, "The Rights of Animals", published in ''The Sunday Times''.&lt;ref name="Ryder5"/&gt; She wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The relationship of [[homo sapiens]] to the other animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entrails in the hope—or on the mere off chance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present&amp;nbsp;... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible that we do not notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.&lt;ref name=Ryder5/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Richard D Ryder in 2012 film The Superior Human?.png|thumb|British psychologist [[Richard D. Ryder]] was a member of the Oxford Group.]] --&gt;
[[Robert Garner]] writes that Harrison's book and Brophy's article led to an explosion of interest in the relationship between humans and nonhumans.&lt;ref name=Garner2004p3&gt;Garner (2004), p. 3ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Brophy's article was discovered in or around 1969 by a group of postgraduate philosophy students at the University of Oxford, Roslind and Stanley Godlovitch (husband and wife from Canada), John Harris, and [[David Wood (philosopher)|David Wood]], now known as the Oxford Group. They decided to put together a [[symposium]] to discuss the theory of animal rights.&lt;ref name=Ryder5/&gt;

Around the same time, Richard Ryder wrote several letters to ''The Daily Telegraph'' criticizing animal experimentation, based on incidents he had witnessed in laboratories. The letters, published in April and May 1969, were seen by Brigid Brophy, who put Ryder in touch with the Godlovitches and Harris. Ryder also started distributing pamphlets in Oxford protesting against experiments on animals; it was in one of these pamphlets in 1970 that he coined the term "[[speciesism]]" to describe the exclusion of nonhuman animals from the protections offered to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Waldau (2001), pp. 5, 23–29.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became a contributor to the Godlovitches' symposium, as did Harrison and Brophy, and it was published in 1971 as ''[[Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non-humans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Godlovitch, Godlovitch, and Harris (1971); see the Introduction for the reference to the symposium.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Publication of ''Animal Liberation''====
{{main|Animal Liberation (book)}}
In 1970, over lunch in Oxford with fellow student Richard Keshen, a vegetarian, Australian philosopher Peter Singer came to believe that, by eating animals, he was engaging in the oppression of other species. Keshen introduced Singer to the Godlovitches, and in 1973 Singer reviewed their book for ''The New York Review of Books''. In the review, he used the term "animal liberation", writing:

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AnimalLiberation.jpg|140px|thumb|[[Peter Singer]]'s ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975)]] --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We are familiar with Black Liberation, Gay Liberation, and a variety of other movements. With Women's Liberation some thought we had come to the end of the road. Discrimination on the basis of sex, it has been said, is the last form of discrimination that is universally accepted and practiced without pretense&amp;nbsp;... But one should always be wary of talking of "the last remaining form of discrimination."&amp;nbsp;... ''Animals, Men and Morals'' is a manifesto for an Animal Liberation movement.&lt;ref name=SingerReview/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the strength of his review, ''The New York Review of Books'' took the unusual step of commissioning a book from Singer on the subject, published in 1975 as ''Animal Liberation'', now one of the animal rights movement's canonical texts. Singer based his arguments on the principle of utilitarianism – the view, in its simplest form, that an act is right if it leads to the "greatest happiness of the greatest number", a phrase first used in 1776 by Jeremy Bentham.&lt;ref name=SingerReview&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=9900 Singer (April 5, 1973)].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued in favor of the [[equal consideration of interests]], the position that there are no grounds to suppose that a violation of the basic interests of a human—for example, an interest in not suffering—is different in any morally significant way from a violation of the basic interests of a nonhuman.&lt;ref name=Singer5&gt;Singer 1990, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Singer used the term "speciesism" in the book, citing Ryder, and it stuck, becoming an entry in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1990), p. 269, footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's publication triggered a groundswell of scholarly interest in animal rights. [[Richard D. Ryder|Richard Ryder]]'s ''Victims of Science: The Use of Animals in Research'' (1975) appeared, followed by [[Andrew Linzey]]'s ''Animal Rights: A Christian Perspective'' (1976), and [[Stephen R. L. Clark]]'s ''The Moral Status of Animals'' (1977). A Conference on Animal Rights was organized by Ryder and Linzey at Trinity College, Cambridge, in August 1977. This was followed by [[Mary Midgley]]'s ''Beast And Man: The Roots of Human Nature'' (1978), then ''Animal Rights–A Symposium'' (1979), which included the papers delivered to the Cambridge conference.&lt;ref name=Garner2004p3/&gt;

From 1982 onwards, a series of articles by [[Tom Regan]] led to his ''[[The Case for Animal Rights]]'' (1984), in which he argues that nonhuman animals are "subjects-of-a-life", and therefore possessors of moral rights, a work regarded as a key text in animal rights theory.&lt;ref name=Garner2004p3/&gt; Regan wrote in 2001 that philosophers had written more about animal rights in the previous 20 years than in the 2,000 years before that.&lt;ref&gt;Regan (2001), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Garner writes that Charles Magel's bibliography, ''Keyguide to Information Sources in Animal Rights'' (1989), contains 10 pages of philosophical material on animals up to 1970, but 13 pages between 1970 and 1989 alone.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2004), p. 2.

====Founding of the Animal Liberation Front====
{{main|Animal Liberation Front}}
In 1971, a law student, [[Ronnie Lee]], formed a branch of the Hunt Saboteurs Association in Luton, later calling it the Band of Mercy after a 19th-century RSPCA youth group. The Band attacked hunters' vehicles by slashing tires and breaking windows, calling it "active compassion". In November 1973, they engaged in their first act of arson when they set fire to a Hoechst Pharmaceuticals research laboratory, claiming responsibility as a "nonviolent guerilla organization dedicated to the liberation of animals from all forms of cruelty and persecution at the hands of mankind."&lt;ref name=Molland70&gt;Molland (2004), pp. 70–74; Monaghan (2000), pp. 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee and another activist were sentenced to three years in prison in 1974, paroled after 12 months. In 1976, Lee brought together the remaining Band of Mercy activists along with some fresh faces to start a [[leaderless resistance]] movement, calling it the Animal Liberation Front (ALF).&lt;ref name=Molland70/&gt; ALF activists see themselves as a modern [[Underground Railroad]], passing animals removed from farms and laboratories to sympathetic veterinarians, safe houses and sanctuaries.&lt;ref&gt;Best (2004), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Some activists also engage in threats, intimidation, and arson, acts that have lost the movement sympathy in mainstream public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1998), pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decentralized model of activism is frustrating for law enforcement organizations, who find the networks difficult to infiltrate, because they tend to be organized around friends.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Gunn, former Chief Constable, Cambridge Constabulary, interviewed for "It Could Happen to You," True Spies, BBC Two, November 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the US Department of Homeland Security indicated how seriously it takes the ALF when it included them in a list of domestic terrorist threats.&lt;ref&gt;Rood, Justin. [http://www.cq.com/public/20050325_homeland.html "Animal Rights Groups and Ecology Militants Make DHS Terrorist List, Right-Wing Vigilantes Omitted"], ''Congressional Quarterly'', March 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The tactics of some of the more determined ALF activists are anathema to many animal rights advocates, such as Singer, who regard the movement as something that should occupy the moral high ground. ALF activists respond to the criticism with the argument that, as [[Ingrid Newkirk]] puts it, "Thinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out."&lt;ref name=NewkirkBest341&gt;Newkirk (2004), p. 341./&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1980s through to the early 2000s there was an increased level of violence by animal rights extremist groups directed at individuals and institutions associated with [[animal research]]. Activist groups involved included the [[Justice Department (animal rights)|Justice Department]], the [[Animal Rights Militia]] and [[SHAC]].&lt;ref&gt;Holder, T.

====Animal Rights International====
{{further|Animal protectionism}}

[[Henry Spira]] (1927–1998), a former seaman and civil rights activist, became the most notable of the new animal advocates in the United States. A proponent of gradual change, he formed Animal Rights International in 1974, and introduced the idea of "reintegrative shaming", whereby a relationship is formed between a group of animal rights advocates and a corporation they see as misusing animals, with a view to obtaining concessions or halting a practice. It is a strategy that has been widely adopted, most notably by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]].&lt;ref&gt;Francione and Garner (2010), p. 1ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spira's first campaign was in opposition to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in 1976, where cats were being experimented on, research that he persuaded them to stop. His most notable achievement was in 1980, when he convinced the cosmetics company [[Revlon]] to stop using the [[Draize test]], which involves toxicity tests on the skin or in the eyes of animals. He took out a full-page ad in several newspapers, featuring a rabbit with sticking plaster over the eyes, and the caption, "How many rabbits does Revlon blind for beauty's sake?" Revlon stopped using animals for cosmetics testing, donated money to help set up the [[Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing]], and was followed by other leading cosmetics companies.&lt;ref name=Feder&gt;Feder, Barnaby J. (November 26, 1889). [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/26/magazine/pressuring-perdue.html "Pressuring Perdue"], ''The New York Times''.
*Also see Singer (1998), and Singer (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Revlon has since renewed testing on animals as it is unwilling to give up revenue from sales in China, where animal testing is required for cosmetics and other items.

===21st century: Developments===
In 1999, New Zealand passed a new Animal Welfare Act that had the effect of banning experiments on "non-human hominids".&lt;ref name=Waldau2000p108/&gt;

Also in 1999, Public Law 106-152 (Title 18, Section 48) was put into action in the United States. This law makes it a felony to create, sell, or possess videos showing animal cruelty with the intention of profiting financially from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pet-abuse.com/pages/animal_cruelty/crush_videos.php#ixzz2C6yKSljR%3E|title=Stopping Crush Videos|publisher=pet-abuse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Austrian Parliament|Austrian parliament]] banned experiments on apes, unless they are performed in the interests of the individual ape.&lt;ref name=Waldau2000p108/&gt; Also in Austria, the Supreme Court ruled in January 2008 that a chimpanzee (called Matthew Hiasl Pan by those advocating for his [[personhood]]) was not a person, after the Association Against Animal Factories sought personhood status for him because his custodians had gone bankrupt. The chimpanzee had been captured as a baby in [[Sierra Leone]] in 1982, then smuggled to Austria to be used in pharmaceutical experiments, but was discovered by customs officials when he arrived in the country, and was taken to a shelter instead. He was kept there for 25 years, until the group that ran the shelter went bankrupt in 2007. Donors offered to help him, but under Austrian law only a person can receive personal gifts, so any money sent to support him would be lost to the shelter's bankruptcy. The Association appealed the ruling to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. The lawyer proposing the chimpanzee's personhood asked the court to appoint a legal guardian for him and to grant him four rights: the right to life, limited freedom of movement, personal safety, and the right to claim property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22670956/ It's official: In Austria, a chimp is not a person], Associated Press, January 15, 2008.

In June 2008, a committee of Spain's national legislature became the first to vote for a resolution to extend limited rights to nonhuman primates. The parliamentary Environment Committee recommended giving chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans the right not to be used in medical experiments or in circuses, and recommended making it illegal to kill apes, except in self-defense, based upon the rights recommended by the [[Great Ape Project]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldau (2011), p. 108.

==== Petitions for Habeas Corpus ====
In 2015, the [[Nonhuman Rights Project]] (NhPR) filed three lawsuits in New York State on behalf of four captive chimpanzees, demanding that the courts grant them the right to bodily liberty via the [[Habeas corpus|writ of Habeas Corpus]] and to immediately send them to a sanctuary affiliated with the North American Primate Sanctuary Alliance.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/2013/11/30/press-release-re-nhrp-lawsuit-dec-2nd-2013/ |title=Press Release re.

{{Further|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[File:Lord Mahavir Gold.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mahavira]], The Torch-bearer of [[Ahimsa]]. Ahimsa includes kindness and non-violence to all living organisms.]] [[Robert Garner]] writes that both [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] societies abandoned animal sacrifice and embraced vegetarianism from the 3rd century BCE. Several kings in India built hospitals for animals, and the emperor [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) issued orders against hunting and animal slaughter, in line with ''[[ahimsa]]'', the doctrine of non-violence. Garner writes that [[Jainism]] took this idea further. Jains believe that no living creature should be harmed, and they are known to clear paths in front of them by sweeping them to protect any insect life that may be present.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2005), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palitana Temple.jpg|thumb|The temple town of [[Palitana]] is the world's first vegetarian-only city.]]
In 2014, the [[Jain]] pilgrimage destination of [[Palitana|Palitana City]] in Indian state of [[Gujarat]] became the first city in the world to be legally [[vegetarian]].

===Legal actions in the 21st century===
[[Paul Waldau]] writes that, in 2000, the High Court in [[Kerala]] used the language of "rights" in relation to circus animals, ruling that they are "beings entitled to dignified existence" under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The ruling said that if human beings are entitled to these rights, animals should be too. The court went beyond the requirements of the Constitution that all living beings should be shown compassion, and said: "It is not only our fundamental duty to show compassion to our animal friends, but also to recognize and protect their rights." Waldau writes that other courts in India and one court in Sri Lanka have used similar language.&lt;ref name=Waldau2000p108&gt;Waldau (2011), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
For some the basis of animal rights is in religion or [[animal worship]] (or in general [[nature worship]]), with some religions banning killing of any animal; One of the most important sanctions of the [[Buddhist]] faith is the concept of [[ahimsa]], or refraining from the destruction of life&lt;!-- ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;234)--&gt;. According to Buddhist belief, humans do not deserve preferential treatment over other living beings. See also [[#Religions|in section above]].

In contrast, in other religions, animals can be [[unclean animal|unclean]], with in general allowing eating all except for these; "[[The Torah]] allows eating certain kinds of "winged swarming things" (i.e. insects) while prohibiting others".

{{Main|Animals in Islam}}

[[File:Amina Abaza with Dog.jpg|thumb|175px|Amina Tharwat Abaza{{snd}} Animal rights activist. Founder of [[Society for Protection of Animal Rights in Egypt]] holding a street dog.]]
Animal rights were recognized early by the [[Sharia]] (Islamic law). This recognition is based on both the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Hadith]]. In the Qur'an, there are many references to animals, detailing that they have souls, form communities, communicate with God and worship Him in their own way. [[Muhammad]] forbade his followers to harm any animal and asked them to respect the rights of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/animals_1.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Animals|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a distinctive characteristic of the Shariah that all animals have legal rights. Othman Llewellyn even argues that Shariah has mechanisms for the full repair of injuries suffered by non-human creatures including their representation in court, assessment of injuries and awarding of relief to them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} The classical Muslim jurist 'Izz ad-Din ibn 'Abd as-Salam, who flourished during the thirteenth century, formulated the following statement of animal rights:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The rights of livestock and animals upon man: these are that he spend on them the provision that their kinds require, even if they have aged or sickened such that no benefit comes from them; that he not burden them beyond what they can bear; that he not put them together with anything by which they would be injured, whether of their own kind or other species, and whether by breaking their bones or butting or wounding; that he slaughters them with kindness when he slaughters them, and neither flay their skins nor break their bones until their bodies have become cold and their lives have passed away; that he not slaughter their young within their sight, but that he isolate them; that he makes comfortable their resting places and watering places; that he puts their males and females together during their mating seasons; that he not discard those which he takes as game; and neither shoots them with anything that breaks their bones nor brings about their destruction by any means that renders their meat unlawful to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last='Abd as-Salam|first='Izz ad-Din |title=Qawaa'id AlAhkaam fi Masaalih AlAnaam |publisher=AlMaktaba AlTijaariya AlKubra |location=Cairo |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, animal sacrifice is a prominent feature of [[Eid al-Adha#Traditions and practices|''Eid al-Adha'' observances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/42661/the-cost-of-sacrifice/ |title=Bakra Eid: The cost of sacrifice |publisher=Asian Correspondent |date=November 16, 2010 |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and legal approaches==

===Overview===
{{Further|Consequentialism|Deontological ethics}}
[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Martha Nussbaum]], Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago, is a proponent of the [[Capability approach|capabilities approach]] to animal rights.]]
The two main philosophical approaches to animal rights are utilitarian and rights-based. The former is exemplified by Peter Singer, and the latter by Tom Regan and [[Gary Francione]]. Their differences reflect a distinction philosophers draw between ethical theories that judge the rightness of an act by its consequences (consequentialism/teleological ethics, or utilitarianism), and those that focus on the principle behind the act, almost regardless of consequences (deontological ethics). Deontologists argue that there are acts we should never perform, even if failing to do so entails a worse outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Craig (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of positions that can be defended from a consequentalist or deontologist perspective, including the [[Capability approach|capabilities approach]], represented by [[Martha Nussbaum]], and the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian approach]], which has been examined by Ingmar Persson and [[Peter Vallentyne]]. The capabilities approach focuses on what individuals require to fulfill their capabilities: Nussbaum (2006) argues that animals need a right to life, some control over their environment, company, play, and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum (2006), pp. 388ff, 393ff; also see Nussbaum (2004), p. 299ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen R. L. Clark]], [[Mary Midgley]], and [[Bernard Rollin]] also discuss animal rights in terms of animals being permitted to lead a life appropriate for their kind.&lt;ref&gt;Weir (2009): see Clark (1977); Rollin (1981); Midgley (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Egalitarianism favors an equal distribution of happiness among all individuals, which makes the interests of the worse off more important than those of the better off.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25115834 Vallentyne (2005)]; Vallentyne (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, [[virtue ethics]], holds that in considering how to act we should consider the character of the actor, and what kind of moral agents we should be. [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] has suggested an approach to animal rights based on virtue ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands (2009), p. 98ff; Hursthouse (2000a); Hursthouse (2000b), p. 146ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Rowlands]] has proposed a [[Social contract|contractarian]] approach.&lt;ref name=Rowlands1998p118/&gt;&lt;!--expand Clark, Nussbaum, virtue ethics--&gt;

===Utilitarianism===
{{further|Equal consideration of interests|Utilitarianism}}
{{rquote|right|''They talk about this thing in the head; what do they call it?'' ["Intellect," whispered someone nearby.] ''That's it. What's that got to do with women's rights or Negroes' rights? If my cup won't hold but a pint and yours holds a quart, wouldn't you be mean not to let me have my little half-measure full?'' — [[Sojourner Truth]]&lt;ref name=Singer1990p6&gt;Singer (1990), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Nussbaum (2004) writes that utilitarianism, starting with Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, has contributed more to the recognition of the moral status of animals than any other ethical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum (2004), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; The utilitarian philosopher most associated with animal rights is Peter Singer, professor of bioethics at Princeton University. Singer is not a rights theorist, but uses the language of rights to discuss how we ought to treat individuals. He is a [[Preference utilitarianism|preference utilitarian]], meaning that he judges the rightness of an act by the extent to which it satisfies the preferences (interests) of those affected.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of preference utilitarianism, see Singer (2011), pp. 14ff, 94ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

His position is that there is no reason not to give equal consideration to the interests of human and nonhumans, though his principle of equality does not require identical treatment. A mouse and a man both have an interest in not being kicked, and there are no moral or logical grounds for failing to accord those interests equal weight. Interests are predicated on the ability to suffer, nothing more, and once it is established that a being has interests, those interests must be given equal consideration.&lt;ref name=Singer7&gt;Singer (1990), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Singer quotes the English philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] (1838–1900): "The good of any one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view&amp;nbsp;... of the Universe, than the good of any other."&lt;ref name=Singer5/&gt;

[[File:Singer1.jpg|160px|thumb|[[Peter Singer]]: interests are predicated on the ability to suffer.]]
Singer argues that equality of consideration is a prescription, not an assertion of fact: if the equality of the sexes were based only on the idea that men and women were equally intelligent, we would have to abandon the practice of equal consideration if this were later found to be false. But the moral idea of equality does not depend on matters of fact such as intelligence, physical strength, or moral capacity. Equality therefore cannot be grounded on the outcome of scientific investigations into the intelligence of nonhumans. All that matters is whether they can suffer.&lt;ref name=Singer1990p4&gt;Singer (1990), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators on all sides of the debate now accept that animals suffer and feel pain, although it was not always so. [[Bernard Rollin]], professor of philosophy, animal sciences, and biomedical sciences at Colorado State University, writes that Descartes' influence continued to be felt until the 1980s. Veterinarians trained in the US before 1989 were taught to ignore pain, he writes, and at least one major veterinary hospital in the 1960s did not stock narcotic analgesics for animal pain control. In his interactions with scientists, he was often asked to "prove" that animals are conscious, and to provide "scientifically acceptable" evidence that they could feel pain.&lt;ref name=Rollin117&gt;Rollin (1989), pp. xii, pp. 117–118; [http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v8/n6/full/7400996.html Rollin (2007)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific publications have made it clear since the 1980s that the majority of researchers do believe animals suffer and feel pain, though it continues to be argued that their suffering may be reduced by an inability to experience the same dread of anticipation as humans, or to remember the suffering as vividly.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1990), pp. 10–17, citing Stamp Dawkins (1980), Walker (1983), and Griffin (1984); Garner (2005), pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of animal suffering, and animal consciousness in general, arose primarily because it was argued that animals [[animal language|have no language]]. Singer writes that, if language were needed to communicate pain, it would often be impossible to know when humans are in pain, though we can observe pain behavior and make a calculated guess based on it. He argues that there is no reason to suppose that the pain behavior of nonhumans would have a different meaning from the pain behavior of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1990) p. 12ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subjects-of-a-life===
{{further|The Case for Animal Rights}}
[[File:TomRegan2.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Tom Regan]]: animals are subjects-of-a-life.]]
Tom Regan, professor emeritus of philosophy at North Carolina State University, argues in ''The Case for Animal Rights'' (1983) that nonhuman animals are what he calls "subjects-of-a-life", and as such are bearers of rights.&lt;ref name=Regan243&gt;Regan (1983), p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that, because the moral rights of humans are based on their possession of certain [[Cognition|cognitive]] abilities, and because these abilities are also possessed by at least some nonhuman animals, such animals must have the same moral rights as humans. Although only humans act as moral agents, both marginal-case humans, such as infants, and at least some nonhumans must have the status of "moral patients".&lt;ref name=Regan243/&gt;

Moral patients are unable to formulate moral principles, and as such are unable to do right or wrong, even though what they do may be beneficial or harmful. Only moral agents are able to engage in moral action. Animals for Regan have "[[Intrinsic value (animal ethics)|intrinsic value]]" as subjects-of-a-life, and cannot be regarded as a means to an end, a view that places him firmly in the abolitionist camp. His theory does not extend to all animals, but only to those that can be regarded as subjects-of-a-life.&lt;ref name=Regan243/&gt; He argues that all normal mammals of at least one year of age would qualify:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;individuals are subjects-of-a-life if they have beliefs and desires; perception, memory, and a sense of the future, including their own future; an emotional life together with feelings of pleasure and pain; preference- and welfare-interests; the ability to initiate action in pursuit of their desires and goals; a psychophysical identity over time; and an individual welfare in the sense that their experiential life fares well or ill for them, logically independently of their utility for others and logically independently of their being the object of anyone else's interests.&lt;ref name=Regan243/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whereas Singer is primarily concerned with improving the treatment of animals and accepts that, in some hypothetical scenarios, individual animals might be used legitimately to further human or nonhuman ends, Regan believes we ought to treat nonhuman animals as we would humans. He applies the strict [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] ideal (which Kant himself applied only to humans) that they ought never to be sacrificed as a means to an end, and must be treated as ends in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Regan (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolitionism===
{{further|Abolitionism (animal rights)|Animals, Property, and the Law}}
[[File:Gary Francione (cropped).jpg|thumb|130px|[[Gary Francione]]: animals need only the right not to be regarded as property.]]
Gary Francione, professor of law and philosophy at [[Rutgers Law School]] in Newark, is a leading abolitionist writer, arguing that animals need only one right, the right not to be owned. Everything else would follow from that [[paradigm shift]]. He writes that, although most people would condemn the mistreatment of animals, and in many countries there are laws that seem to reflect those concerns, "in practice the legal system allows any use of animals, however abhorrent." The law only requires that any suffering not be "unnecessary". In deciding what counts as "unnecessary", an animal's interests are weighed against the interests of human beings, and the latter almost always prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1990), pp. 4, 17ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Francione's ''Animals, Property, and the Law'' (1995) was the first extensive jurisprudential treatment of animal rights. In it, Francione compares the situation of animals to the treatment of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves in the United States]], where legislation existed that appeared to protect them, while the courts ignored that the institution of slavery itself rendered the protection unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1995), pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He offers as an example the United States [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]], which he describes as an example of symbolic legislation, intended to assuage public concern about the treatment of animals, but difficult to implement.&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1995), p. 208ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that a focus on animal welfare, rather than animal rights, may worsen the position of animals by making the public feel comfortable about using them and entrenching the view of them as property. He calls animal rights groups who pursue animal welfare issues, such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], the "[[Animal protectionism|new welfarists]]", arguing that they have more in common with 19th-century animal protectionists than with the animal rights movement; indeed, the terms "animal protection" and "protectionism" are increasingly favored. His position in 1996 was that there is no animal rights movement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AmKARgx_FCgC&amp;pg=PA32 Francione (1996), p. 32ff]

Retrieved February 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contractarianism===
{{further|Social contract}}
[[Mark Rowlands]], professor of philosophy at the University of Florida, has proposed a contractarian approach, based on the [[original position]] and the [[veil of ignorance]]—a "state of nature" thought experiment that tests intuitions about justice and fairness—in [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971). In the original position, individuals choose principles of justice (what kind of society to form, and how primary social goods will be distributed), unaware of their individual characteristics—their race, sex, class, or intelligence, whether they are able-bodied or disabled, rich or poor—and therefore unaware of which role they will assume in the society they are about to form.&lt;ref name=Rowlands1998p118&gt;Rowlands (1998), p. 118ff, particularly pp. 147–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is that, operating behind the veil of ignorance, they will choose a social contract in which there is basic fairness and justice for them no matter the position they occupy. Rawls did not include species membership as one of the attributes hidden from the decision makers in the original position. Rowlands proposes extending the veil of ignorance to include rationality, which he argues is an undeserved property similar to characteristics including race, sex and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Rowlands1998p118"/&gt;

===''Prima facie'' rights theory===
{{further|Prima facie right}}
American philosopher Timothy Garry has proposed an approach that deems nonhuman animals worthy of ''prima facie'' rights. In a philosophical context, a ''prima facie'' (Latin for "on the face of it" or "at first glance") right is one that appears to be applicable at first glance, but upon closer examination may be outweighed by other considerations. In his book ''Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory'', Lawrence Hinman characterizes such rights as "the right is real but leaves open the question of whether it is applicable and overriding in a particular situation".&lt;ref name="Hinman1998p208"&gt;Hinman, Lawrence M. Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory. Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace College, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that nonhuman animals are worthy of ''prima facie'' rights is to say that, in a sense, animals do have rights. However, these rights can be overridden by many other considerations, especially those conflicting a human's right to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. Garry supports his view arguing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;if a nonhuman animal were to kill a human being in the U.S., it would have broken the laws of the land and would probably get rougher sanctions than if it were a human.  My point is that like laws govern all who interact within a society, rights are to be applied to all beings who interact within that society.  This is not to say these rights endowed by humans are equivalent to those held by nonhuman animals, but rather that if humans possess rights then so must all those who interact with humans.&lt;ref name=Garry2012p6&gt;Garry, Timothy J. Nonhuman Animals: Possessors of Prima Facie Rights (2012), p.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In sum, Garry suggests that humans have obligations to nonhuman animals; however, animals do not, and ought not to, have uninfringible rights against humans.

===Feminism and animal rights===
{{further|Women and animal advocacy|Ethics of care|Feminist ethics}}
[[File:Carol J. Adams with Snowball.jpg|thumb|180px|The American [[Ecofeminism|ecofeminist]] [[Carol J. Adams|Carol Adams]] has written extensively about the link between feminism and animal rights, starting with ''The Sexual Politics of Meat'' (1990).]]
Women have played a central role in animal advocacy since the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Lansbury et al"&gt;Lansbury (1985); Adams (1990); Donovan (1993); Gruen (1993); Adams (1994); Adams and Donovan (1995); Adams (2004); MacKinnon (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-vivisection movement in the 19th and early 20th century in England and the United States was largely run by women, including [[Francis Power Cobbe]], [[Anna Kingsford]], [[Lizzy Lind af Hageby]] and [[Caroline Earle White]] (1833–1916).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4289385 Kean (1995)].&lt;/ref&gt; Garner writes that 70 per cent of the membership of the Victoria Street Society (one of the anti-vivisection groups founded by Cobbe) were women, as were 70 per cent of the membership of the British RSPCA in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2005), p. 141, citing Elston (1990), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern animal advocacy movement has a similar representation of women, though Garner (2005) writes that they are not invariably in leadership positions: during the March for Animals in Washington, D.C., in 1990—the largest animal rights demonstration held until then in the United States—most of the participants were women, but most of the platform speakers were men.&lt;ref name=Garner2005p142&gt;Garner (2005), pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, several influential animal advocacy groups have been founded by women, including the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] by Cobbe in London in 1898; the [[Animal Welfare Board of India]] by [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]] in 1962; and [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], co-founded by [[Ingrid Newkirk]] in 1980. In the Netherlands, [[Marianne Thieme]] and [[Esther Ouwehand]] were elected to parliament in 2006 representing the Parliamentary group for Animals.

The preponderance of women in the movement has led to a body of academic literature exploring feminism and animal rights; feminism and vegetarianism or veganism, the oppression of women and animals, and the male association of women and animals with nature and emotion, rather than reason—an association that several feminist writers have embraced.&lt;ref name="Lansbury et al"/&gt; [[Lori Gruen]] writes that women and animals serve the same symbolic function in a patriarchal society: both are "the used"; the dominated, submissive "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gruen (1993), p. 60ff.&lt;/ref&gt; When the British feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759–1797) published ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] (1758–1835), a Cambridge philosopher, responded with an anonymous parody, ''A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes'' (1792), claiming that Wollstonecraft's arguments for women's rights could be applied equally to animals, a position he intended as ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1990), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--add something about language; treatment of female animals; feminist care ethic; suffragettes--&gt;

Some [[transhumanism|transhumanists]] argue for animal rights, liberation, and "uplift" of animal consciousness into machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ethics of Animal Enhancement|author=George Dvorsky|author-link=George Dvorsky|url=https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET2/more/dvorsky20110729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transhumanism also understands animal rights on a gradation or spectrum with other types of sentient rights, including human rights and the rights of conscious artificial intelligences (posthuman rights).&lt;ref Name="Evans 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Evans | first = Woody | authorlink = Woody Evans | title = Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds | journal = Teknokultura | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | date = 2015 | url = http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/TEKN/article/view/49072/46310 | accessdate = December 5, 2016| doi = 10.5209/rev_TK.2015.v12.n2.49072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critics===

====R. G. Frey====
[[R. G. Frey]], professor of philosophy at Bowling Green State University, is a preference utilitarian, as is Singer, but reaches a very different conclusion, arguing in ''Interests and Rights'' (1980) that animals have no interests for the utilitarian to take into account. Frey argues that interests are dependent on desire, and that no desire can exist without a corresponding belief. Animals have no beliefs, because a belief state requires the ability to hold a second-order belief—a belief about the belief—which he argues requires language: "If someone were to say, e.g. 'The cat believes that the door is locked,' then that person is holding, as I see it, that the cat holds the declarative sentence 'The door is locked' to be true; and I can see no reason whatever for crediting the cat or any other creature which lacks language, including human infants, with entertaining declarative sentences."&lt;ref&gt;Frey (1989), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carl Cohen====
[[Carl Cohen (professor)|Carl Cohen]], professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan, argues that rights holders must be able to distinguish between their own interests and what is right. "The holders of rights must have the capacity to comprehend rules of duty governing all, including themselves. In applying such rules, [they]&amp;nbsp;... must recognize possible conflicts between what is in their own interest and what is just. Only in a community of beings capable of self-restricting moral judgments can the concept of a right be correctly invoked." Cohen rejects Singer's argument that, since a brain-damaged human could not make moral judgments, moral judgments cannot be used as the distinguishing characteristic for determining who is awarded rights. Cohen writes that the test for moral judgment "is not a test to be administered to humans one by one", but should be applied to the capacity of members of the species in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/phil1200, Spr07/cohen.pdf Cohen (1986)]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

====Richard Posner====
[[File:Richard-A-Posner.jpg|thumb|150px|Judge [[Richard Posner]]: "facts will drive equality."&lt;ref name=Posner/&gt;]]
Judge [[Richard Posner]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] debated the issue of animal rights in 2001 with Peter Singer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dialogues/features/2001/animal_rights/_2.html Singer (June 15, 2001)].&lt;/ref&gt; Posner posits that his [[Ethical intuitionism|moral intuition]] tells him "that human beings prefer their own. If a dog threatens a human infant, even if it requires causing more pain to the dog to stop it, than the dog would have caused to the infant, then we favour the child. It would be monstrous to spare the dog."&lt;ref name=Posner&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/110101/entry/110129/ Posner (June 15, 2001)]; [http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/interviews-debates/200106--.htm Posner-Singer debate in full], courtesy link on utilitarian.net.
*Also see Posner (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer challenges this by arguing that formerly unequal rights for gays, women, and certain races were justified using the same set of intuitions. Posner replies that equality in civil rights did not occur because of ethical arguments, but because facts mounted that there were no morally significant differences between humans based on race, sex, or sexual orientation that would support inequality. If and when similar facts emerge about humans and animals, the differences in rights will erode too. But facts will drive equality, not ethical arguments that run contrary to instinct, he argues. Posner calls his approach "soft utilitarianism", in contrast to Singer's "hard utilitarianism". He argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The "soft" utilitarian position on animal rights is a moral intuition of many, probably most, Americans. We realize that animals feel pain, and we think that to inflict pain without a reason is bad. Nothing of practical value is added by dressing up this intuition in the language of philosophy; much is lost when the intuition is made a stage in a logical argument. When kindness toward animals is levered into a duty of weighting the pains of animals and of people equally, bizarre vistas of social engineering are opened up.&lt;ref name=Posner/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Roger Scruton, September 2002.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Roger Scruton]]: rights imply obligations.]]

====Roger Scruton====
[[Roger Scruton]], the British philosopher, argues that rights imply obligations. Every legal privilege, he writes, imposes a burden on the one who does not possess that privilege: that is, "your right may be my duty." Scruton therefore regards the emergence of the animal rights movement as "the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview", because the idea of rights and responsibilities is, he argues, distinctive to the human condition, and it makes no sense to spread them beyond our own species.&lt;ref name=Scruton/&gt;

He accuses animal rights advocates of "pre-scientific" [[anthropomorphism]], attributing traits to animals that are, he says, [[Beatrix Potter]]-like, where "only man is vile." It is within this fiction that the appeal of animal rights lies, he argues. The world of animals is non-judgmental, filled with dogs who return our affection almost no matter what we do to them, and cats who pretend to be affectionate when, in fact, they care only about themselves. It is, he argues, a fantasy, a world of escape.&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;Scruton, Roger. [http://www.city-journal.org/html/10_3_urbanities-animal.html "Animal Rights"], ''City Journal'', summer 2000.
*Scruton (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton singled out [[Peter Singer]], a prominent Australian philosopher and animal-rights activist, for criticism. He wrote that Singer's works, including ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'', "contain little or no philosophical argument. They derive their radical moral conclusions from a vacuous utilitarianism that counts the pain and pleasure of all living things as equally significant and that ignores just about everything that has been said in our philosophical tradition about the real distinction between persons and animals."&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;Scruton, Roger.

==Continuity between humans and nonhuman animals==
[[File:Bonobo 009.jpg|thumb|A [[bonobo]], a nonhuman great ape]]

[[Evolution]]ary studies have provided explanations of [[altruism|altruistic behaviours]] in humans and nonhuman animals, and suggest similarities between humans and some nonhumans.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (2004) Animal Acts: Configuring the Human in Western History. Journal of Popular Culture, 37(3), 555&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists such as [[Jane Goodall]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] believe in the capacity of nonhuman [[great apes]], humans' closest relatives, to possess rationality and self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Ape Project: Equality beyond humanity. 1993. Fourth Estate publishing, London, England.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, research led by psychologist [[Diana Reiss]] and zoologist Lori Marino was presented to a conference in San Diego, suggesting that [[dolphin]]s are second in intelligence only to human beings, and concluded that they should be regarded as nonhuman persons. Marino used [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scans to compare the dolphin and primate brain; she said the scans indicated there was "psychological continuity" between dolphins and humans. Reiss's research suggested that dolphins are able to solve complex problems, use tools, and pass the [[mirror test]], using a mirror to inspect parts of their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In [[Christian theology]], the founder of the [[Methodist]] movement, [[John Wesley]], was a [[Christian vegetarian]] and maintained "that animals had immortal souls and that there were considerable similarities between human and non-human animals."&lt;ref name="Preece2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Preece|first=Rod|title=Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought|date=1 July 2009|publisher=UBC Press|language=English|isbn=9780774858496|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public attitudes ==

According to a paper published in 2000 by Harold Herzog and Lorna Dorr, previous academic surveys of attitudes towards animal rights have tended to suffer from small sample sizes and non-representative groups.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Harold; Dorr, Lorna (2000) "Electronically Available Surveys of Attitudes Toward Animals", ''Society &amp; Animals'' 10:2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of factors appear to correlate with the attitude of individuals regarding the treatment of animals and animal rights. These include gender, age, occupation, religion, and level of education. There has also been evidence to suggest that prior experience with [[pet|companion animals]] may be a factor in people's attitudes.&lt;ref name="SignalAndTaylor2006"&gt;Apostol, L., Rebega, O.L. &amp; Miclea, M. (2013). "Psychological and Socio-Demographic Predictors of Attitudes towards Animals". ''Social and Behavioural Sciences'', 78, pages 521–525.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are more likely to empathize with the cause of animal rights than men.&lt;ref name="SignalAndTaylor2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Harold. (2007). "Gender Differences in Human-Animal Interactions: A Review". ''Anthrozoos: A Multidisciplinary Journal of The Interactions of People &amp; Animals''. 20:1. Pages 7–21.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1996 study of adolescents by Linda Pifer suggested that factors that may partially explain this discrepancy include attitudes towards [[feminism]] and science, scientific literacy, and the presence of a greater emphasis on "nurturance or compassion" among women.&lt;ref&gt;Pifer, Linda. (1996). "Exploring the Gender Gap in Young Adults' Attitudes about Animal Research". ''Society and Animals''. 4:1. Pages 37–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 survey to examine whether or not people who believed in evolution were more likely to support animal rights than [[creationism|creationists]] and believers in [[intelligent design]] found that this was largely the case – according to the researchers, the respondents who were strong [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]]s and believers in [[creationism]] were less likely to advocate for animal rights than those who were less fundamentalist in their beliefs. The findings extended previous research, such as a 1992 study which found that 48% of animal rights activists were [[atheist]]s or [[agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;DeLeeuwa, Jamie; Galen, Luke; Aebersold, Cassandra; Stanton, Victoria (2007). "[http://www.animalsandsociety.org/assets/library/745_s3.pdf Support for Animal Rights as a Function of Belief in Evolution, Religious Fundamentalism, and Religious Denomination] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620141651/http://www.animalsandsociety.org/assets/library/745_s3.pdf |date=2013-06-20 }}", ''Society and Animals'' 15, pages 353–363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, Shelley L.; Herzog Jr., Harold A. (1992) "Ethical Ideology, Animal Rights Activism, And Attitudes Toward The Treatment Of Animals." ''Ethics &amp; Behavior'' 2.3. Pages 141–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two surveys found that attitudes towards animal rights tactics, such as [[direct action]], are very diverse within the animal rights communities. Near half (50% and 39% in two surveys) of activists do not support direct action. One survey concluded "it would be a mistake to portray animal rights activists as homogeneous."&lt;ref name="SignalAndTaylor2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An attitude survey of animal rights activists. Psychological Science. 2(3), 194–196&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bibliography''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] βιβλίον ''biblion'', "book" and -γραφία ''-graphia'', "writing"), as a discipline, is traditionally the academic study of [[book]]s as physical,  cultural objects; in this sense, it is also known as '''bibliology'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford English Dictionary |title=bibliology |edition=2nd |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from Greek {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''). Carter and Barker (2010) describe bibliography as a twofold scholarly discipline—the organized listing of books (enumerative bibliography) and the systematic description of books as objects (descriptive bibliography).

== Etymology ==
The word ''bibliographia'' (βιβλιογραφία) was used by Greek writers in the first three centuries AD to mean the copying of books by hand. In the 12th century, the word started being used for "the intellectual activity of composing books". The 17th century then saw the emergence of the modern meaning, that of description of books.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Rudolf. ''Bibliographia, an inquiry into its definition and designations''. Translated by Mathilde V. Rovelstad. Chicago, Ill.: American Library Association; Folkestone, Kent, England: Dawson, 1980. p. 12. {{ISBN|0-8389-0146-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, the field of bibliography has expanded to include studies that consider the book as a material object.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Bibliography. http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/bsuva/sb/&lt;/ref&gt; Bibliography in its systematic pursuit of understanding the past and the present through written and printed documents describes a way and means of extracting information from this material. Bibliographers are interested in comparing versions of texts to each other rather than in interpreting their meaning or assessing their significance.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hagan Hardy, M. (2017). Bibliographic enterprise and the digital age: Charles Evans and the making of early American literature. ''American Literary History, 29''(2), 331-351.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Field of study ==
Bibliography is a specialized aspect of [[library science]] (or [[library and information science]], LIS) and [[documentation science]]. It was established by a [[Belgian]], named [[Paul Otlet]] (1868-1944), who was the founder of the field of documentation, as a branch of the information sciences,  who wrote about "the science of bibliography."&lt;ref&gt;Otlet, P. (1903). ''Les sciences bibliographiques et la documentation''. Bruxelles, Institut international de bibliographie.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otlet, P. (1903). "The science of bibliography and documentation"2. In Rayward, W.B. (trans. and ed.), (1990), ''International organisation and dissemination of knowledge: Selected essays of Paul Otlet''. FID, Amsterdam: Elsevier.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have recently been voices claiming that "the bibliographical paradigm" is obsolete, and it is not today common in LIS. A defense of the bibliographical paradigm was provided by Hjørland (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, B. (2007). "Arguments for 'the bibliographical paradigm'. Some thoughts inspired by the new English edition of the UDC", Information Research, 12(4) paper colis06. [Available at http://InformationR.net/ir/12-4/colis06.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The quantitative study of bibliographies is known as [[bibliometrics]], which is today an influential subfield in LIS.

== Branches ==
Carter and Barker (2010) describe bibliography as a twofold scholarly discipline—the organized listing of books (enumerative bibliography) and the systematic description of books as physical objects (descriptive bibliography). These two distinct concepts and practices have separate rationales and serve differing purposes. Innovators and originators in the field include [[W. W. Greg]], [[Fredson Bowers]], [[Philip Gaskell]], [[G. Thomas Tanselle]].

Bowers (1949) refers to enumerative bibliography as a procedure that identifies books in “specific collections or libraries,” in a specific discipline, by an author, printer, or period of production (3). He refers to descriptive bibliography as the systematic description of a book as a material or physical artifact. Analytical bibliography, the cornerstone of descriptive bibliography, investigates the printing and all physical features of a book that yield evidence establishing a book's history and transmission (Feather 10). It is the preliminary phase of bibliographic description and  provides the vocabulary, principles and techniques of analysis that descriptive bibliographers apply and on which they base their descriptive practice.

Descriptive bibliographers follow specific conventions and associated classification in their description.  Titles and title pages are transcribed in a quasi-facsimile style and representation. Illustration, typeface, binding, paper, and all physical elements related to identifying a book follow formulaic conventions, as Bowers established in his foundational opus, ''The Principles of Bibliographic Description''. The thought expressed in this book expands substantively on W. W. Greg's groundbreaking theory that argued for the adoption of formal bibliographic principles (Greg 29). Fundamentally, analytical bibliography is concerned with objective, physical analysis and history of a book while descriptive bibliography employs all data that analytical bibliography furnishes and then codifies it with a view to identifying the ideal copy or form of a book that most nearly represents the printer's initial conception and intention in printing.

In addition to viewing bibliographic study as being composed of four interdependent approaches (enumerative, descriptive, analytical, and textual), Bowers notes two further subcategories of research, namely historical bibliography and aesthetic bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;Fredson Bowers, "Four Faces of Bibliography" Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada 10 (1971):33-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both historical bibliography, which involves the investigation of printing practices, tools, and related documents, and aesthetic bibliography, which examines the art of designing type and books, are often employed by analytical bibliographers.

D. F. McKenzie extended previous notions of bibliography as set forth by W. W. Greg, Bowers, Gaskell and Tanselle. He describes the nature of bibliography as "the discipline that studies texts as recorded forms, and the processes of their transmission, including their production and reception" (1999 12). This concept broadens the scope of bibliography to include "non-book texts" and an accounting for their material form and structure, as well as textual variations, technical and production processes that bring sociocultural context and effects into play. McKenzie's perspective contextualizes textual objects or artifacts with sociological and technical factors that have an effect on production, transmission and, ultimately, ideal copy (2002 14). Bibliography, generally, concerns the material conditions of books [as well as other texts] how they are designed, edited, printed, circulated, reprinted, collected.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Gaskell, ''A New Introduction to Bibliography'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliographic works differ in the amount of detail depending on the purpose and can generally be divided into two categories: enumerative bibliography (also called compilative, reference or systematic), which results in an overview of [[publication]]s in a particular category and analytical or critical bibliography, which studies the production of books.&lt;ref&gt;Belanger, Terry.

=== Enumerative bibliography ===
[[File:Pn-samara-n-a-2000-11.jpg|thumb|Bibliographer workplace in Russia]]
An enumerative bibliography is a systematic list of books and other works such as [[academic journal|journal]] [[article (publishing)|article]]s. Bibliographies range from "works [[citation|cited]]" lists at the end of books and articles, to complete and independent publications. A notable example of a complete, independent publication is Gow's, ''A. E. Housman: A Sketch, Together with a List of His Classical Papers'' (1936). As separate works, they may be in bound volumes such as those shown on the right, or computerized [[bibliographic database]]s. A [[library catalog]], while not referred to as a "bibliography," is bibliographic in nature. Bibliographical works are almost always considered to be [[tertiary source]]s.

Enumerative bibliographies are based on a unifying principle such as creator, subject, date, topic or other characteristic. An entry in an enumerative bibliography provides the core elements of a text resource including a title, the creator(s), publication date and place of publication. Belanger (1977) distinguishes an enumerative bibliography from other bibliographic forms such as descriptive bibliography, analytical bibliography or textual bibliography in that its function is to record and list, rather than describe a source in detail or with any reference to the source's physical nature, materiality or textual transmission. The enumerative list may be comprehensive or selective. One noted example would be Tanselle's bibliography that exhaustively enumerates topics and sources related to all forms of bibliography. A more common and particular instance of an enumerative bibliography relates to specific sources used or considered in preparing a scholarly paper or academic term paper.

Citation styles vary.

An entry for a book in a bibliography usually contains the following elements:
* creator(s)
* title
* place of publication
* publisher or printer
* date of publication

An entry for a journal or periodical article usually contains:
* creator(s)
* article title
* journal title
* volume
* pages
* date of publication

A bibliography may be arranged by author, topic, or some other scheme. [[Annotated bibliography|Annotated bibliographies]] give descriptions about how each source is useful to an author in constructing a paper or argument. These descriptions, usually a few sentences long, provide a summary of the source and describe its relevance. [[Reference management software]] may be used to keep track of references and generate bibliographies as required.

Bibliographies differ from [[library catalog]]s by including only relevant items rather than all items present in a particular library. However, the catalogs of some [[national library|national libraries]] effectively serve as {{illm|National bibliography|de|Nationalbibliografie|lt=national bibliographies}}, as the national libraries own almost all their countries' publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ifla.org/node/2216 |work= Ifla.org |title= National Bibliographic Register |accessdate= 1 December 2017 |publisher=[[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] |location=The Hague }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/refworks/natbib/bibprint.html |work= Help for researchers |title=National bibliographies and books in print |publisher=British Library |accessdate= 1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Descriptive bibliography ===
Fredson Bowers described and formulated a standardized practice of descriptive bibliography in his ''Principles of Bibliographical Description''
(1949). Scholars to this day treat Bowers' scholarly guide as authoritative. In this classic text, Bowers describes the basic function of bibliography as, "[providing] sufficient data so that a reader may identify the book described, understand the printing, and recognize the precise contents" (124).

==== Descriptive bibliographies as scholarly product ====
Descriptive bibliographies as a scholarly product usually include information on the following aspect of a given book as a material object:
*Format and Collation/Pagination Statement&amp;nbsp;– a conventional, symbolic formula that describes the book block in terms of sheets, folds, quires, signatures, and pages
:::According to Bowers (193), the format of a book is usually abbreviated in the collation formula:
::::Broadsheet: I° or b.s. or bs.
::::Folio: 2° or fol.
::::Quarto: 4° or 4to or Q° or Q
::::Octavo: 8° or 8vo
::::Duodecimo: 12° or 12mo
::::Sexto-decimo: 16° or 16mo
::::Tricesimo-secundo: 32° or 32mo
::::Sexagesimo-quarto: 64° or 64mo
:::The collation, which follows the format, is the statement of the order and size of the gatherings.
::::For example, a quarto that consists of the signed gatherings:
:::::2 leaves signed A, 4 leaves signed B, 4 leaves signed C, and 2 leaves signed D
::::would be represented in the collation formula:
:::::4°: A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B-C&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
*Binding&amp;nbsp;– a description of the binding techniques (generally for books printed after 1800)
*Title Page Transcription&amp;nbsp;– a transcription of the title page, including rule lines and ornaments
*Contents&amp;nbsp;– a listing of the contents (by section) in the book
*Paper&amp;nbsp;– a description of the physical properties of the paper, including production process, an account of chain-line measurements, and a description of watermarks (if present)
*Illustrations&amp;nbsp;– a description of the illustrations found in the book, including printing process (e.g. woodblock, intaglio, etc.), measurements, and locations in the text
*Presswork&amp;nbsp;– miscellaneous details gleaned from the text about its production
*Copies Examined&amp;nbsp;– an enumeration of the copies examined, including those copies' location (i.e. belonging to which library or collector)

=== Analytical bibliography ===
This branch of the bibliographic discipline examines the material features of a textual artifact&amp;nbsp;– such as type, ink, paper, imposition, format, impressions and states of a book&amp;nbsp;– to essentially recreate the conditions of its production. Analytical bibliography often uses collateral evidence&amp;nbsp;– such as general printing practices, trends in format, responses and non-responses to design, etc.&amp;nbsp;– to scrutinize the historical conventions and influences underlying the physical appearance of a text. The bibliographer utilizes knowledge gained from the investigation of physical evidence in the form of a descriptive bibliography or textual bibliography.&lt;ref name="New Encyclopædia Britannica: Macropaedia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowers|first=Fredson|title=Bibliography|year=1974|edition=2nd|pages=978–981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive bibliography is the close examination and cataloging of a text as a physical object, recording its size, format, [[bookbinding|binding]], and so on, while textual bibliography (or textual criticism) identifies variations&amp;nbsp;– and the aetiology of variations&amp;nbsp;– in a text with a view to determining "the establishment of the most correct form of [a] text (Bowers 498[1]).

== Bibliographers ==
[[File:Paul Otlet à son bureau.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Otlet]], to work in an office built at his home following the closure of the [[Mundaneum|Palais Mondial]] in June 1937]]
A ''bibliographer'' is a person who describes and lists books and other publications, with particular attention to such characteristics as authorship, publication date, edition, typography, etc. A person who limits such efforts to a specific field or discipline is a subject bibliographer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reitz|first= Joan M. |year=2010|url= http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx |title=Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science|publisher=abc-clio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bibliographer, in the technical meaning of the word, is anyone who writes about books. But the accepted meaning since at least the 18th century is a person who attempts a comprehensive account—sometimes just a list, sometimes a fuller reckoning—of the books written on a particular subject. In the present, bibliography is no longer a career, generally speaking; bibliographies tend to be written on highly specific subjects and by specialists in the field.

The term ''bibliographer'' is sometimes—in particular subject bibliographer—today used about certain roles performed in libraries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/bib_bibliographers |title=MLA Field Bibliographers |publisher=mla.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bibliographic database]]s.

== Non-book material ==
Systematic lists of media other than books can be referred to with terms formed analogously to ''bibliography'':
* [[Discography]]&amp;nbsp;– recorded music
* [[Filmography]]&amp;nbsp;–  films
* [[Webography]] (or webliography)&amp;nbsp;– websites (the first use of the word "webliography" recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates from June 1995)

Arachniography is a term coined by [[NASA]] research historian Andrew J. Butrica, which means a reference list of [[URL]]s about a particular subject. It is equivalent to a bibliography in a book. The name derives from ''[[arachne]]'' in reference to a spider and its web.&lt;ref name=atlantic2007&gt;{{cite book | author=Staff | page=28 | title=Encyclopedia Of Information Technology | publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors | year=2007 | isbn=81-269-0752-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKenzie|first=D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4924">The '''Center for the Advanced Study of India''' ('''CASI''') is an academic research center on contemporary India at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  The Center collaborates with other institutions in the United States, India, and elsewhere to carry out its goals of nurturing a new generation of scholars across disciplines and providing a forum for dialogue among the academic, business, and [[foreign policy]] communities. The Center also collaborates with their New Delhi counterpart research organization, University of Pennsylvania Institute for the Advanced Study of India (UPIASI), to widen CASI’s reach within India.

==History==
Founded in 1992 by Dr. Francine Frankel a year after historic [[Economic liberalization in India]], CASI was the first – and even now, only – academic research centre in the [[United States]] for the study of contemporary India. Dr. Frankel has also written about [[Foreign relations of India#United States|Indo-US]] and [[Sino-Indian relations]]. The revised edition of her study, ''India's Political Economy'', was published in 2005.

In 2006, Dr. [[Devesh Kapur]] became the centre's director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/oct/07aziz.htm|title=Kapur takes over helm of UPenn's India centre|work=rediff.com|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Kapur has worked on issues of [[human capital]], [[Dalit]] studies,  national and international public institutions, and the ways in which local-global linkages affect political and economic change in [[developing countries]].

The [[University of Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/|title=Home {{!}} University of Pennsylvania|website=www.upenn.edu|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been at the forefront of area studies since 1942 when Prof. W. Norman Brown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/faids/upt/upt50/brownwn.html|title=Guide, W. Norman (William Norman) Brown Papers (UPT 50 B879), University Archives, University of Pennsylvania|work=upenn.edu|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; pioneered the study of modern India, a full fifteen years before area studies appeared on any other US campus. That legacy continues at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences]] through the Department of South Asian Studies and its South Asia Center, the holdings of the South Asian Studies Collection at the [[Van Pelt Library]], and CASI.

Today, CASI is recognised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casi.ssc.upenn.edu/inprint|title=New in Print|work=upenn.edu|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a national resource, addressing the urgent need for objective knowledge of India’s rapidly changing society, politics and economy, and the forces and processes behind them. CASI expands the University of Pennsylvania’s leadership on South Asian studies through its research focus on India’s economic transition, governance and politics, security and foreign policy, human capital, and media.

==History==

=== Civil engineering as a discipline ===
Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems of society, and its history is intricately linked to advances in understanding of [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] throughout history. Because civil engineering is a wide-ranging profession, including several specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials science, geography, geology, [[soil]]s, [[hydrology]], [[environmental science|environment]], [[mechanics]] and other fields.

Throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by [[artisan]]s, such as [[masonry|stonemasons]] and [[carpenter]]s, rising to the role of [[Architect|master builder]]. Knowledge was retained in [[guild]]s and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures, roads and infrastructure that existed were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.&lt;ref name="Saouma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceae.colorado.edu/~saouma/Lecture-Notes/se.pdf|title=Lecture Notes in Structural Engineering|author=Victor E. Saouma|publisher=University of Colorado|accessdate=2 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest examples of a scientific approach to physical and mathematical problems applicable to civil engineering is the work of [[Archimedes]] in the 3rd century BC, including Archimedes Principle, which underpins our understanding of [[buoyancy]], and practical solutions such as [[Archimedes' screw]]. [[Brahmagupta]], an Indian mathematician, used arithmetic in the 7th century AD, based on Hindu-Arabic numerals, for excavation (volume) computations.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Thomas Colebrook, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A3cAAAAAMAAJ ''Algebra: with Arithmetic and mensuration''] (London 1817)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil engineering profession ===
{{See also|History of structural engineering}}
Engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence. The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in [[ancient Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], and [[Mesopotamia]] (ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a [[nomad]]ic existence, creating a need for the construction of shelter. During this time, transportation became increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and [[Maritime history|sailing]].[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonhard Euler]] developed the theory explaining the [[buckling]] of columns]]

Until modern times there was no clear distinction between civil engineering and architecture, and the term engineer and architect were mainly geographical variations referring to the same occupation, and often used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VQYeHMGp2gwC&amp;q=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&amp;dq=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&amp;pgis=1 ''The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance''] Jacob Burckhardt {{ISBN|0805210822}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] in Egypt (circa 2700–2500 BC) were some of the first instances of large structure constructions. Other ancient historic civil engineering constructions include the [[Qanat]] water management system (the oldest is older than 3000 years and longer than 71&amp;nbsp;km,&lt;ref&gt;p. 4 of {{Cite book | publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-9048186310| last = Mays| first = L.| title = Ancient Water Technologies| date = 30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the [[Parthenon]] by [[Iktinos]] in [[Ancient Greece]] (447–438 BC), the [[Appian Way]] by [[Roman engineering|Roman engineers]] (c. 312 BC), the [[Great Wall of China]] by General [[Meng Tian|Meng T'ien]] under orders from Ch'in Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang|Shih Huang Ti]] (c. 220 BC)&lt;ref name="Oakes"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Oakes | first = William C. | last2 = Leone | first2 = Les L. | last3 = Gunn | first3 = Craig J. | title = Engineering Your Future | publisher = Great Lakes Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-1881018575 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stupas constructed in ancient [[Sri Lanka]] like the [[Jetavanaramaya]] and the extensive irrigation works in [[Anuradhapura]]. The Romans developed civil structures throughout their empire, including especially [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[insulae]], harbors, bridges, dams and roads.

[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|A Roman [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] [built circa 19 BC] near [[Pont du Gard]], France]]
[[File:Chichen Itza 3.jpg|thumb|[[Chichen Itza]] was a large pre-Columbian city in Mexico built by the [[Maya people]] of the Post Classic. The northeast column temple also covers a [[Channel (geography)|channel]] that [[funnels]] all the rainwater from the complex some 40 metres (130 ft) away to a rejollada, a former [[cenote]].]]

In the 18th century, the term civil engineering was coined to incorporate all things civilian as opposed to military engineering.&lt;ref name="eb" /&gt; The first self-proclaimed civil engineer was [[John Smeaton]], who constructed the [[Eddystone Lighthouse]].&lt;ref name="CSCE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oakes" /&gt; In 1771 Smeaton and some of his colleagues formed the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, a group of leaders of the profession who met informally over dinner. Though there was evidence of some technical meetings, it was little more than a social society.[[File:John Smeaton.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[John Smeaton]], the "father of civil engineering"]]In 1818 the Institution of Civil Engineers was founded in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ice.org.uk/about-ice/our-history|title=Our history|publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers|accessdate=12 April 2018|date=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1820 the eminent engineer [[Thomas Telford]] became its first president. The institution received a Royal Charter in 1828, formally recognising civil engineering as a profession. Its charter defined civil engineering as:{{quote|the art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man, as the means of production and of traffic in states, both for external and internal trade, as applied in the construction of roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation and docks for internal intercourse and exchange, and in the construction of ports, harbours, moles, breakwaters and lighthouses, and in the art of navigation by artificial power for the purposes of commerce, and in the construction and application of machinery, and in the drainage of cities and towns.&lt;ref name=ICE&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ice.org.uk| title=Institution of Civil Engineers' website| accessdate=26 December 2007| date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Civil engineering education===
The first private college to teach civil engineering in the United States was [[Norwich University]], founded in 1819 by Captain Alden Partridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norwich.edu/about/legacy.html|title=Norwich University Legacy Website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first degree in civil engineering in the United States was awarded by [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Griggs, Francis E Jr. "Amos Eaton was Right!". ''Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice'', Vol. 123, No. 1, January 1997, pp. 30–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.rpi.edu/Archives/timeline/all_time/index.html RPI Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; The first such degree to be awarded to a woman was granted by [[Cornell University]] to [[Nora Stanton Blatch]] in 1905.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9124919/Nora-Stanton-Blatch-Barney | accessdate=8 October 2010 | title=Nora Stanton Blatch Barney | work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK during the early 19th century, the division between civil engineering and military engineering (served by the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]), coupled with the demands of the Industrial Revolution, spawned new engineering education initiatives: the Class of Civil Engineering and Mining was founded at [[King's College London]] in 1838, mainly as a response to the growth of the railway system and the need for more qualified engineers, the private [[College for Civil Engineers]] in [[Putney]] was established in 1839, and the UK's first Chair of Engineering was established at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1840.

==Education==
{{Main|Civil engineer}}''Civil engineers'' typically possess an [[academic degree]] in civil engineering. The length of study is three to five years, and the completed degree is designated as a [[bachelor of technology]], or a [[bachelor of engineering]]. The curriculum generally includes classes in physics, mathematics, [[project management]], design and specific topics in civil engineering. After taking basic courses in most sub-disciplines of civil engineering, they move onto specialize in one or more sub-disciplines at advanced levels. While an undergraduate degree (BEng/BSc) normally provides successful students with industry-accredited qualification, some academic institutions offer post-graduate degrees (MEng/MSc), which allow students to further specialize in their particular area of interest.&lt;ref name="CITE Postgrad"&gt;,{{cite web|url=http://www.uel.ac.uk/cite/programmes/postgraduate/index.htm|title=Cite Postgrad|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106121950/http://www.uel.ac.uk/cite/programmes/postgraduate/index.htm|archive-date=2008-11-06|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Surveying students with professor at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] in the late 19th century.]]

== Practicing Engineers ==
In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]], and a [[professional body]] certifies the degree program. After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience and exam requirements) before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated as a [[professional engineer]] (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), a [[chartered engineer]] (in most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries), a chartered professional engineer (in Australia and [[New Zealand]]), or a European engineer (in most countries of the [[European Union]]). There are international agreements between relevant professional bodies to allow engineers to practice across national borders.

The benefits of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada, "only a licensed [[professional engineer]] may prepare, sign and seal, and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval, or seal engineering work for public and private clients."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate = 11 August 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050604085233/http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | archivedate = 4 June 2005 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement is enforced under provincial law such as the Engineers Act in [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061005184956/http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 5 October 2006 | accessdate = 11 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No such legislation has been enacted in other countries including the United Kingdom. In Australia, state licensing of engineers is limited to the state of [[Queensland]]. Almost all certifying bodies maintain a [[code of ethics]] which all members must abide by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ethics Codes and Guidelines | work = Online Ethics Center | url = http://onlineethics.org/CMS/profpractice/ethcodes.aspx | accessdate = 11 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers must obey [[contract law]] in their contractual relationships with other parties. In cases where an engineer's work fails, they may be subject to the law of [[negligence|tort of negligence]], and in extreme cases, criminal charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Singapore's Circle Line criminal trial started | work = New Civil Engineer | url = http://www.nce.co.uk/singapores-circle-line-criminal-trial-started/530302.article | accessdate = 16 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as [[building codes]] and [[environmental law]].

==Sub-disciplines==
[[File:Akashi-kaikyo bridge3.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The [[Akashi Kaikyō Bridge]] in Japan, currently the world's longest suspension span.]]
There are a number of sub-disciplines within the broad field of civil engineering. General civil engineers work closely with surveyors and specialized civil engineers to design grading, drainage, [[Pavement (material)|pavement]], water supply, sewer service, dams, electric and communications supply. General civil engineering is also referred to as site engineering, a branch of civil engineering that primarily focuses on converting a tract of land from one usage to another. Site engineers spend time visiting project sites, meeting with stakeholders, and preparing construction plans. Civil engineers apply the principles of geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, environmental engineering, transportation engineering and construction engineering to residential, commercial, industrial and public works projects of all sizes and levels of construction.

===Coastal engineering===
{{Main|Coastal engineering|Coastal management}}
[[File:Oosterscheldekering, Netherlands.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Oosterscheldekering]], a [[storm surge barrier]] in the Netherlands.]]
''Coastal engineering'' is concerned with managing coastal areas. In some jurisdictions, the terms sea defense and coastal protection mean defense against flooding and erosion, respectively. The term coastal defense is the more traditional term, but coastal management has become more popular as the field has expanded to techniques that allow erosion to claim land.

===Construction engineering===
{{Main|Construction engineering}}
''Construction engineering'' involves planning and execution, transportation of materials, site development based on hydraulic, environmental, structural and geotechnical engineering. As construction firms tend to have higher business risk than other types of civil engineering firms do, construction engineers often engage in more business-like transactions, for example, drafting and reviewing contracts, evaluating [[Logistics|logistical operations]], and monitoring prices of supplies.

===Earthquake engineering===
{{Main|Earthquake engineering}}
''Earthquake engineering'' involves designing structures to withstand hazardous earthquake exposures. Earthquake engineering is a sub-discipline of structural engineering. The main objectives of earthquake engineering are&lt;ref&gt;Chen W-F, Scawthorn C. Earthquake Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0849300681}}, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; to understand interaction of structures on the shaky ground; foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes; and design, construct and maintain structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] at earthquake in compliance with [[building code]]s.

===Environmental engineering===
{{Main|Environmental engineering}}
[[File:Water pollution.jpg|right|thumbnail|left|upright=1.15|Water pollution]]
''Environmental engineering'' is the contemporary term for [[sanitary engineering]], though sanitary engineering traditionally had not included much of the hazardous waste management and environmental remediation work covered by environmental engineering. Public health engineering and environmental health engineering are other terms being used.

Environmental engineering deals with treatment of chemical, biological, or thermal wastes, purification of water and air, and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated sites after waste disposal or accidental contamination. Among the topics covered by environmental engineering are pollutant transport, [[water purification]], [[waste water treatment]], air pollution, [[Waste management|solid waste treatment]], and [[hazardous waste|hazardous waste management]]. Environmental engineers administer pollution reduction, green engineering, and [[industrial ecology]]. Environmental engineers also compile information on environmental consequences of proposed actions.

===Forensic engineering===
{{Main|Forensic engineering}}
''Forensic engineering'' is the investigation of materials, [[Product (business)|products]], structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. The consequences of failure are dealt with by the law of product liability. The field also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery. The subject is applied most commonly in civil law cases, although it may be of use in criminal law cases. Generally the purpose of a Forensic engineering investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to improve performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in determining the facts of an accident. It can also involve investigation of intellectual property claims, especially [[patent]]s.

===Geotechnical engineering===
{{Main|Geotechnical engineering}}
[[File:Soil-phase-diagram.svg|thumb|A phase diagram of soil indicating the weights and volumes of air, soil, water, and voids.]]
''Geotechnical engineering'' studies rock and soil supporting civil engineering systems. Knowledge from the field of [[soil science]], materials science, [[mechanics]], and [[hydraulics]] is applied to safely and economically design [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]], [[retaining wall]]s, and other structures. Environmental efforts to protect [[groundwater]] and safely maintain landfills have spawned a new area of research called geoenvironmental engineering.&lt;ref name="mitchell"&gt;Mitchell, James Kenneth (1993), Fundamentals of Soil Behavior (2nd ed.), John Wiley and Sons, pp 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shroff, Arvind V.; Shah, Dhananjay L. (2003), Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003, pp 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification of soil properties presents challenges to geotechnical engineers. [[Boundary condition]]s are often well defined in other branches of civil engineering, but unlike steel or concrete, the material properties and behavior of soil are difficult to predict due to its variability and limitation on [[geotechnical investigation|investigation]]. Furthermore, soil exhibits nonlinear ([[stress (physics)|stress]]-dependent) [[shear strength (soil)|strength]], stiffness, and dilatancy (volume change associated with application of shear stress), making studying [[soil mechanics]] all the more difficult.&lt;ref name="mitchell"/&gt; Geotechnical engineers frequently work with professional [[geologists]] and [[soil scientists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geotechnical/Geological Engineering |url=https://www.ausimm.com.au/content/docs/careers_booklet_geotgeoleng.pdf |website=Professional Careers in the Mineral Industry |publisher=The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy |accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials science and engineering===
{{Main|Materials science}}
''Materials science'' is closely related to civil engineering. It studies fundamental characteristics of materials, and deals with ceramics such as concrete and mix asphalt concrete, strong metals such as aluminum and steel, and [[thermosetting polymer]]s including [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) and carbon fibers.

''Materials engineering'' involves protection and prevention (paints and finishes). Alloying combines two types of metals to produce another metal with desired properties. It incorporates elements of [[applied physics]] and [[chemistry]]. With recent media attention on [[nanoscience]] and [[nanotechnology]], materials engineering has been at the forefront of academic research. It is also an important part of forensic engineering and [[failure analysis]].

===Structural engineering===
{{Main|Structural engineering}}
[[File:Burj Dubai Evolution.ogv|right|thumb|[[Burj Khalifa]] animation of construction process|thumbtime=0:23]]
[[File:Construcción de una cimentación por zapata aislada.ogv|thumb|left|[[Shallow foundation]] construction example]]
''Structural engineering'' is concerned with the [[structural design]] and [[structural analysis]] of buildings, bridges, [[tower]]s, [[overpass|flyovers]] (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, [[aerostructure]] and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be ''serviceable''). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including [[wind engineering]] and earthquake engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan, R, A Beeby. ''Introduction to Design for Civil Engineers''. London: Spon, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Design considerations will include strength, stiffness, and stability of the structure when subjected to loads which may be static, such as furniture or self-weight, or dynamic, such as wind, seismic, crowd or vehicle loads, or transitory, such as temporary construction loads or impact. Other considerations include cost, constructability, safety, aesthetics and [[sustainability]].

===Surveying===
{{Main|Surveying|Construction surveying}}
[[File:Student using a dumpy level.jpg|thumb|A student using a [[dumpy level]]]]
''Surveying'' is the process by which a surveyor measures certain dimensions that occur on or near the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment, such as levels and theodolites, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments. Data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface in the form of a map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. Although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping, as well as [[geographic information system]]s. Surveyors also lay out the routes of railways, [[tramway track]]s, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure, such as [[harbor]]s, before construction.

;Land surveying

In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and most Commonwealth countries land surveying is considered to be a separate and distinct profession. [[Surveying#Land surveyor|Land surveyors]] are not considered to be engineers, and have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. The services of a licensed land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys (to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description) and subdivision plans (a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land, with boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicate the creation of new boundary lines and roads), both of which are generally referred to as [[Cadastral surveying]].[[File:Bureau of Land Management Cadastral Survey Marker Arizona.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] [[cadastral]] survey marker from 1992 in [[San Xavier, Arizona]].]]

;Construction surveying
Construction surveying is generally performed by specialised technicians. Unlike land surveyors, the resulting plan does not have legal status. Construction surveyors perform the following tasks:
* Surveying existing conditions of the future work site, including topography, existing buildings and infrastructure, and underground infrastructure when possible;
* "lay-out" or "setting-out": placing reference points and markers that will guide the construction of new structures such as roads or buildings;
* Verifying the location of structures during construction;
* As-Built surveying: a survey conducted at the end of the construction project to verify that the work authorized was completed to the specifications set on plans.

===Transportation engineering===
{{Main|Transportation engineering}}''Transportation engineering'' is concerned with moving people and goods efficiently, safely, and in a manner conducive to a vibrant community. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining transportation infrastructure which includes streets, canals, highways, [[rail transport|rail systems]], airports, ports, and [[mass transit]]. It includes areas such as transportation design, [[transportation planning]], [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]], some aspects of [[municipal or urban engineering|urban engineering]], [[queueing theory]], [[pavement engineering]], [[Intelligent Transportation System]] (ITS), and infrastructure management.

===Municipal or urban engineering===
[[File:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], England, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving]]
{{Main|Urban engineering}}
[[File:LagoMenorChapultepec3.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Lake [[Chapultepec]]]]
''Municipal engineering'' is concerned with municipal infrastructure. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, [[sidewalk]]s, [[municipal water supply|water supply networks]], sewers, [[street light]]ing, [[municipal solid waste]] management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), [[urban park|public parks]] and [[cycling infrastructure]]. In the case of underground [[public utility|utility]] networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services. It can also include the optimizing of waste collection and [[public transport bus service|bus service]] networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously, and managed by the same municipal authority.  Municipal engineers may also design the site civil works for large buildings, industrial plants or campuses (i.e. access roads, parking lots, potable water supply, treatment or pretreatment of waste water, site drainage, etc.)

===Water resources engineering===
{{See also|Hydraulic engineering|Hydrology}}
[[File:Hoover dam from air.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hoover Dam]] ]]
''Water resources engineering'' is concerned with the collection and management of water (as a [[natural resource]]). As a discipline it therefore combines elements of hydrology, environmental science, [[meteorology]], [[water conservation|conservation]], and [[resource management]]. This area of civil engineering relates to the prediction and management of both the quality and the quantity of water in both underground ([[aquifer]]s) and above ground (lakes, rivers, and streams) resources. Water resource engineers analyze and model very small to very large areas of the earth to predict the amount and content of water as it flows into, through, or out of a facility. Although the actual design of the facility may be left to other engineers.

''Hydraulic engineering'' is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids, principally water. This area of civil engineering is intimately related to the design of [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[water supply network]], drainage facilities (including bridges, dams, [[Channel (geography)|channels]], [[culvert]]s, [[levee]]s, [[storm sewer]]s), and canals. Hydraulic engineers design these facilities using the concepts of [[fluid pressure]], [[fluid statics]], [[fluid dynamics]], and hydraulics, among others.[[File:FalkirkWheelSide 2004 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Falkirk Wheel]] in Scotland]]
===Civil engineering systems===
Civil engineering systems is a discipline that promotes the use of systems thinking to manage complexity and change in civil engineering within its wider public context. It posits that the proper development of civil engineering [[infrastructure]] requires a [[Holism|holistic]], coherent understanding of the relationships between all of the important factors that contribute to successful projects while at the same time emphasising the importance of attention to technical detail. Its purpose is to help integrate the entire civil engineering [[Project management|project life cycle]] from conception, through planning, designing, making, operating to decommissioning.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Introduction+to+Civil+Engineering+Systems%3A+A+Systems+Perspective+to+the+Development+of+Civil+Engineering+Facilities-p-9780470530634 Samuel Labi ''Introduction to Civil Engineering Systems: A Systems Perspective to the Development of Civil Engineering Facilities''] 2014, John Wiley{{ISBN|978-0470530634}} Retrieved May 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icebookshop.com/bookshop_main.asp?ISBN=9780727760821 David Blockley and Patrick Godfrey ''Doing it Differently: Systems for Rethinking Infrastructure (2nd Edition)''] ICE Publications, London {{ISBN|978-0727760821}}" Retrieved May 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cross-boundary subsidies''' are caused by organisms or materials that cross or traverse habitat [[landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patch]] boundaries, subsidizing the resident [[populations]]. The transferred organisms and materials may provide additional predators, prey, or nutrients to resident species, which can affect [[community]] and [[food web]] structure. Cross-boundary subsidies of materials and organisms occur in landscapes composed of different habitat patch types, and so depend on characteristics of those patches and on the boundaries in between them. Human alteration of the landscape, primarily through [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]], has the potential to alter important cross-boundary subsidies to increasingly isolated habitat patches. Understanding how processes that occur outside of habitat patches can affect populations within them may be important to habitat management.

==Introduction and development of the concept==
The concept of cross-boundary subsidies developed out of a merging of ideas from the studies of [[landscape ecology]] and [[food web]] ecology. The ideas from landscape ecology allow the study of population, community, and food web dynamics to incorporate spatial relationships between landscape elements into an understanding of such dynamics (Polis et al. 1997).

Janzen (1986) first defined cross-boundary subsidies as a process whereby organisms that disperse from one patch into another impact resident organisms by providing increased food resources or opportunities for reproduction, thus serving as a subsidy to the residents. By this definition, only the cross-boundary movement of organisms is considered, but broader definitions of cross-boundary subsidies can also include materials such as nutrients and [[detritus]] (i.e. Marburg et al. 2006, Facelli and Pickett 1991).

Cross-boundary subsidies are a subset of the more general process of spatial subsidies (see Polis et al. 1997). Cross-boundary subsidies acknowledge the presence and role of the boundary between different habitat patches in mediating flows of organisms and materials. In contrast, spatial subsidies require only that external inputs of materials and organisms originate from outside the patch of interest.

===Conceptual models===
Few attempts have been made to combine landscape and [[food web]] ecology in such a way that explicitly recognizes the importance of cross-boundary subsidies and spatial features of the landscape on food web dynamics. Often, spatial subsidies are treated as subsidies that simply arrive from outside the patch of interest, not addressing the landscape patterns and processes that may affect the movement of these inputs, such as boundary characteristics and patch connectivity. Polis et al. (1997) published a thorough review of spatially subsidized food web dynamics, focusing on the effect of subsidies on population, [[community]], consumer-resource, and food web dynamics. One of the main conclusions was that subsidies of consumer species (organisms that eat other organisms to obtain energy) resulted in declines of food resources in the recipient patch. Callaway and Hastings (2002) built off Polis et al.’s conclusion with a model to show that subsidized consumers may not always drive down the resource in the recipient patch if consumers move between patches frequently. This might occur because consumers often move for reasons other than food resource acquisition.

Cadenasso et al. (2003) developed a framework for studying ecological boundaries, which has implications for understanding the dynamics of specific cross-boundary subsidies. The boundary is defined as the zone of the steepest gradient of change in some characteristic from one patch to another, such as rapidly decreasing light levels as habitat transitions from a field to a forest. In this framework, flows across variable landscapes are characterized by the type of flow (materials, energy, organisms, etc.), patch contrast (architecture, composition, process), and boundary structure (architecture, composition, symbolic and perceptual features). Considering a cross-boundary subsidy in terms of this framework shows how the boundary itself can mediate the subsidy. For example, Cadenasso and Pickett (2001) found that the decreased lateral vegetation at the boundary between a forest and field increased the amount of seeds transferred into the forest interior.

Another conceptual model that specifically considers cross-boundary subsidies is a model developed by Rand et al. (2006) of spillover from agriculture to wildland patches by predatory insects. The edge is permeable to insects that are habitat generalists and therefore capable of easily crossing the boundary between agriculture and wildland patches, whereas it is considered impermeable to insects that specialize on a particular patch type and cannot cross the boundary. In this model, edge permeability (habitat specialists vs. generalists), patch [[productivity]], and complementary resource use (use of resources obtained in both agriculture and wildland patches) determine the expected impact of cross-boundary subsidies by predatory insects (Fig. 1).

[[Image:Rand2006 adapted.JPG|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Conceptual model of cross-boundary subsidies of insect predators from agricultural to adjacent wildland patches. '''a.''' Habitat specialization, the boundary is a hard edge to predators such that they do not disperse to the wildland patch. '''b.''' Differences in [[productivity]], increased productivity in the agricultural patch allows a generalist insect predator to disperse to the lower productivity wildland patch. This is an example of a directional positive edge response. '''c.''' Complementary resource use, insect predator abundance is highest near the edge because they need resources present in both patches. This is an example of a reciprocal positive edge response.

==Relation to selected ecological concepts==

===Landscape ecology===
A spatial subsidy, in the context of landscape ecology, is a doner-mediated resource (nutrient, detritus, prey) which is passed from one habitat to a recipient (consumer) in a second habitat. As a result, the productivity of the recipient is increased (Polis et al., 1997). For example, a bear eats a salmon and acquires the resources that have passed through the marine environment across the habitat boundary and into a terrestrial environment.

===Source sink dynamics===
The idea of a subsidy of materials or organisms across a patch boundary affecting resident populations has clear parallels with [[source-sink dynamics]] (Fagan et al. 1999). In this theory, local populations are connected by dispersal, and the extinction of local populations can be prevented through immigration from neighboring patches (Pulliam 1988). In source-sink dynamics, it is assumed that individuals from more productive patches will move to less productive patches with unsustainable populations (Pulliam 1988). Many examples of cross-boundary subsidies can be thought of as exhibiting source-sink dynamics. Rand et al. (2006) found that insects in a high productivity agricultural patch were able to sustain local populations in a lower productivity wildland patch through continued dispersal from the agricultural patch. The effect of these subsidies to local patches can also impact populations of other species in the recipient [[food web]], because the subsidized population may compete with or prey upon other species more effectively than they would be able to without such an influx (Fagan et al. 1999).

===Biotic interactions and trophic structure===
Cross-boundary subsidies have important impacts on species interactions and food web dynamics. Subsidies of materials and organisms can affect all trophic, or feeding, levels of food webs either directly or indirectly. Inputs of nutrient and [[detritus]] from another patch generally increase the population growth of the resident producers (plants) and [[detritus|detritivores]] (Polis et al. 1997). Increased growth at the producer level can result in a bottom-up trophic effect, in which increases in [[populations]] at lower [[trophic level]]s support a higher population of consumers than would otherwise be possible in a closed system (Polis et al. 1997). [[allochthonous]] detrital inputs can also have strong impacts on food web dynamics over a variety of temporal scales, ranging from seconds to millennia, as in the case of [[fossil fuel]] formation from build-up of detritus over millennia (Moore et al. 2004).

====Coarse woody debris====
Many food webs rely on cross-boundary subsidies of detritus for sources of energy and nutrients (Huxel and McCann 1998). For example, a series of lakes in Wisconsin were examined for the presence of [[Coarse woody debris]] (CWD) and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape that might control its input to lakes. Coarse woody debris in these lakes is important for providing habitat and food resources for a variety of organisms including small fish (Werner and Hall 1988), algae, and detritivores (Bowen et al. 1998). Marburg et al. (2006) compared variation within and among lakes in CWD. They found that subsidies of CWD to lakes were lower when the lakes had human development along the shore. Development along the lakeshore can be thought of as an alteration to the characteristics of the patch boundary between the lake and forest. In this case, development decreased both forest density that is the source of CWD and also the permeability of the boundary to flows of CWD (Marburg et al. 2006).

====Predator-prey====
In addition to bottom-up effects, top-down effects may also occur due to cross-boundary subsidies. In top-down effects, subsidies of consumers at the top level of the food web control populations at lower levels more so than would be expected by only the action of resident consumers (Polis et al. 1997). Consumers that cross boundaries may have a greater effect on the recipient patch population if prey in the recipient patch have a lower population growth rate than prey in the source patch (Fagan et al. 1999, Rand et al. 2006). Thus, cross-boundary subsidies may alter predator-prey/competitive interactions that can result in a disproportionate impact on the communities of the recipient patch.

====Trophic cascade====
In subsidizing top trophic levels, effects may also be felt at all lower trophic levels in a phenomenon known as a [[trophic cascade]]. An example of a trophic cascade that also acted as a cross-boundary subsidy is illustrated in a study by Knight et al. (2005) in which changes in the trophic structure of one ecosystem resulted in an effect that cascaded to the adjacent ecosystem. In ponds containing fish, dragonfly larvae were kept to a minimum by fish predation. The resulting low density of adult dragonfly predators led to a high density of bee pollinators. With fish present in adjacent ponds, bees were able to pollinate more flowers in the adjacent upland ecosystem than they were when fish were absent. The dragonfly population could be thought of as subsidized by the absence of fish predation. That subsidy was then transferred across the pond-upland boundary by adult dragonfly movement to affect the interaction between bee pollinators and plants.

===Subsidy cascade===
Native species that forage on resources that don't originate in their same habitat. This may increase their local abundances thereby affecting other species in the ecosystem. For example, Luskin et al (2017) found that native animals living protected primary rainforest in Malaysia found food subsidies in neighboring oil palm plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luskin |first1=Matthew |title=Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8 |issue=9 |page=2231 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01920-7 |pmid=29263381 |pmc=5738359 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subsidy allowed native animal populations to increase, which then triggered powerful secondary ‘cascading’ effects on forest tree community. Specically, crop-raiding wild boar (Sus scofa) built thousands of nests from the forest understory vegatation and this caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over a 24-year study period. Such cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

==Human activities affecting cross-boundary subsidies==

===Agriculture ===
Native species that forage in farmland may increase their local abundances thereby affecting adjacent ecosystems within their landscape. For example, Luskin et al (2017) used two decades of ecological data from a protected primary rainforest in Malaysia to illustrate how subsidies from neighboring oil palm plantations triggered powerful secondary ‘cascading’ effects on natural habitats located &gt;1.3 km away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luskin |first1=Matthew |title=Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8 |issue=8 |page=2231 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01920-7 |pmid=29263381 |pmc=5738359 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that (i) oil palm fruit drove 100-fold increases in crop-raiding native wild boar (Sus scrofa), (ii) wild boar used thousands of understory plants to construct birthing nests in the pristine forest interior, and (iii) nest building caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over the 24-year study period. The long-term, landscape-scale indirect effects from agriculture suggest its full ecological footprint may be larger in extent than is currently recognized. Cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

===Fragmentation===
As landscapes become increasingly fragmented due to human activity, the influence of patch boundaries on individual patches becomes relatively more important (Murcia 1995). [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] can both cut off necessary subsidies to patches and increase the magnitude of subsidies from adjacent patches. For example, in a study of fragmentation of wildlands in an agriculturally dominated landscape, subsidies of habitat specialist insects to wildland patches were prevented by surrounding small, wildland patches with inhospitable agricultural land. This isolation reduced the potential for [[gene flow]] and long-term persistence of the population. Subsidies of other insects that specialized on agricultural crops were increased to wildland [[populations]], increasing their effect on the resident wildland species (Duelli 1990).

===Alteration of patch and boundary characteristics===
Changing the internal structure and composition of a patch may substantially alter cross-boundary subsidies. [[Logging]] may temporarily increase subsidies of nutrients and detritus to adjacent streams (Likens et al. 1970). [[Invasive species]] introduced to agricultural patches may act as a subsidy to adjacent wildland invasive populations, preventing native species establishment, even within the protected area (Janzen 1983).

====Marine systems====
Human alterations of patch characteristics may also curtail cross-boundary subsidies such as [[overfishing]] in marine systems, which may drastically reduce potentially crucial marine subsidies of organisms to freshwater and riparian systems (Zhang et al. 2003). For example, Helfield and Naiman (2002) found that riparian trees in [[Alaska]] obtain 24-26% of their nitrogen from marine sources, transferred from migrating [[salmon]]. In this system, [[salmon]] that feed in the ocean, incorporating marine nitrogen into their biomass, later return to their natal small streams where they spawn and die. [[Salmon]] carcasses transferred across the stream-riparian zone boundary by terrestrial predators or flooding events subsidized growth of terrestrial plants. Thus, marine overfishing may affect the productivity of Alaskan forests that depend on subsidies of marine-derived nitrogen.

As discussed above, cross-boundary subsidies depend on the characteristics of the patch boundary. Human-induced changes in these characteristics can affect boundary permeability to certain organisms or materials. For example, a cross-boundary subsidy of leaf litter from forest to an adjacent open field may be attenuated at the boundary if a road is present, making the boundary less permeable to flows of leaf litter (Facelli and Pickett 1991).

==Implications for management and future research needs==
Habitat management might benefit from recognizing the effect that humans may have on both individual patches and on the dynamics between patches. In such cases, managers may need to focus on patterns and processes that occur outside of their patch of interest, as these factors may also be important to internal [[population dynamics]]. An understanding of boundary features that influence the various flows of interest is necessary in managing for those flows.

=== Invasive species ===
The implications of [[invasive species]] and the use of [[biological control]] agents may also be closely related to the idea of cross-boundary subsidies. Introducing species into one patch for [[biocontrol]] may have unforeseen consequences on dynamics within adjacent patches.

Other fields, such as public policy, can also benefit from considering cross-boundary subsidies. For example, governments often provide [[subsidy|financial subsidies]] to [[fisheries]], which have a negative effect on those ecosystems by encouraging overfishing (Munro and Sumaila 2002). Understanding what processes affect how those financial resources flow across that particular government-industry boundary is important to the maintenance of marine [[food web]]s. Considering cross-boundary effects will be essential to a complete understanding of potential consequences of human action on the landscape.

'''''Deinococcus radiodurans''''' is an [[extremophile|extremophilic]] [[bacterium]], one of the most [[radioresistance|radiation-resistant]] organisms known. It can survive cold, dehydration, vacuum, and [[acid]], and is therefore known as a [[polyextremophile]] and has been listed as the world's toughest bacterium in ''[[Guinness World Records|The Guinness Book Of World Records]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/07_02/deinococcus.shtml | author= Sarah DeWeerdt | title=The World's Toughest Bacterium }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and classification==
The name ''Deinococcus radiodurans'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] δεινός (''deinos'') and κόκκος (''kokkos'') meaning "terrible grain/berry" and the [[Latin]] ''radius'' and ''durare'', meaning "radiation surviving". The species was formerly called ''Micrococcus radiodurans''. As a consequence of its hardiness, it has been nicknamed [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Bacterium]].&lt;ref name=huyghe&gt;{{Cite journal

Initially, it was placed in the genus ''[[Micrococcus]]''. After evaluation of [[ribosome|ribosomal]] [[RNA]] sequences and other evidence, it was placed in its own genus '''''[[Deinococcus]]''''', which is closely related to the genus ''[[Thermus]]''.

==History==
''D. radiodurans'' was discovered in 1956 by Arthur W. Anderson at the Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station in [[Corvallis, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 575–577 | last = Anderson | first = A W |author2=H C Nordan |author3=R F Cain |author4=G Parrish |author5=D Duggan  | title = Studies on a radio-resistant micrococcus. I. Isolation, morphology, cultural characteristics, and resistance to gamma radiation | journal = Food Technol. | year = 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments were being performed to determine whether canned food could be sterilized using high doses of [[gamma radiation]]. A tin of meat was exposed to a dose of radiation that was thought to kill all known forms of life, but the meat subsequently spoiled, and ''D. radiodurans'' was isolated.

The complete DNA sequence of ''D. radiodurans'' was published in 1999 by [[The Institute for Genomic Research|TIGR]]. A detailed annotation and analysis of the genome appeared in 2001.&lt;ref name="makarova"/&gt; The sequenced strain was ATCC BAA-816.

''Deinococcus radiodurans'' has a unique quality in which it can repair both single- and double-stranded DNA. When damage is apparent to the cell, it brings it into a compartmental ring-like structure, where the DNA is repaired and then is able to fuse the nucleoids from the outside of the compartment with the damaged DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, D.P, Dunlap, P.V., Madigan, M.T., Martinko, J.M.

==Description==
''D. radiodurans'' is a rather large, spherical bacterium, with a diameter of 1.5 to 3.5 [[micrometre|µm]].&lt;ref name="Jena"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jena|first1=Sidhartha S.|last2=Joshi|first2=Hiren M.|last3=Sabareesh|first3=K.P.V.|last4=Tata|first4=B.V.R.|last5=Rao|first5=T.S.|title=Dynamics of Deinococcus radiodurans under Controlled Growth Conditions|journal=Biophysical Journal|volume=91|issue=7|pages=2699–2707|doi=10.1529/biophysj.106.086520|url=https://doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.106.086520|bibcode=2006BpJ....91.2699J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four cells normally stick together, forming a tetrad. The bacteria are easily cultured and do not appear to cause disease.&lt;ref name="makarova"/&gt; Under controlled growth conditions, cells of dimer, tetramer, and even multimer morphologies can be obtained.&lt;ref name="Jena" /&gt;  Colonies are smooth, convex, and pink to red in color. The cells stain [[Gram positive]], although its cell envelope is unusual and is reminiscent of the cell walls of [[Gram negative]] bacteria.&lt;ref name="battista"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''D. radiodurans'' does not form [[endospore]]s and is nonmotile. It is an [[aerobic organism|obligate aerobic]] [[Chemoorganoheterotrophy|chemoorganoheterotroph]], i.e., it uses [[oxygen]] to derive energy from organic compounds in its environment. It is often found in habitats rich in organic materials, such as soil, feces, meat, or sewage, but has also been isolated from dried foods, room dust, medical instruments and textiles.&lt;ref name="battista"/&gt;

It is extremely resistant to [[ionizing radiation]], [[ultraviolet]] light, [[desiccation]], and oxidizing and [[electrophile|electrophilic]] agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slade | first1 = D | last2 = Radman | first2 = M | year = 2011 | title = Oxidative stress resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans | journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 75 | issue = 1| pages = 133–91 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00015-10 | pmid = 21372322 | pmc=3063356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its genome consists of two circular [[chromosome]]s, one 2.65 million base pairs long and the other 412,000 base pairs long, as well as a [[plasmid|megaplasmid]] of 177,000 base pairs and a [[plasmid]] of 46,000 base pairs. It has about 3,195 [[gene]]s. In its stationary phase, each bacterial cell contains four copies of this genome; when rapidly multiplying, each bacterium contains 8-10 copies of the genome.

==Ionizing-radiation resistance==
''D. radiodurans'' is capable of withstanding an acute dose of 5,000&amp;nbsp;[[Gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy), or 500,000&amp;nbsp;rad, of [[ionizing radiation]] with almost no loss of viability, and an acute dose of 15,000&amp;nbsp;Gy with 37% viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moseley BE, Mattingly A | year = 1971 | title = Repair of irradiated transforming deoxyribonu- cleic acid in wild type and a radiation- sensitive mutant of Micrococcus radiodu- rans | url = | journal = J.

Chem. | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1239–47 | doi=10.1271/bbb1961.47.1239}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dose of 5,000&amp;nbsp;Gy is estimated to introduce several hundred double-strand breaks (DSBs) into the organism's DNA (~0.005&amp;nbsp;DSB/Gy/Mbp (haploid genome)). For comparison, a chest X-ray or Apollo mission involves about 1&amp;nbsp;mGy, 5&amp;nbsp;Gy can kill a human, 200-800&amp;nbsp;Gy will kill ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', and over 4,000&amp;nbsp;Gy will kill the radiation-resistant [[tardigrade]].

Several bacteria of comparable radioresistance are now known, including some species of the genus ''[[Chroococcidiopsis]]'' (phylum [[cyanobacteria]]) and some species of ''[[Rubrobacter]]'' (phylum [[actinobacteria]]); among the [[archaea]], the species ''[[Thermococcus]] gammatolerans'' shows comparable radioresistance.&lt;ref name=battista2/&gt;  ''Deinococcus radiodurans'' also has a unique ability to repair damaged DNA.  It isolates the damaged segments in a controlled area and repairs it. This bacteria can also repair many small fragments from an entire chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, D.P., Dunlap, P.V., Madigan, M.T., Martinko, J.M. Brock Biology of Microorganisms. San Francisco: Pearson. 2009. 281 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms of ionizing-radiation resistance==
''Deinococcus'' accomplishes its resistance to radiation by having multiple copies of its [[genome]] and rapid [[DNA repair]] mechanisms. It usually repairs breaks in its chromosomes within 12–24 hours by a 2-step process. First, ''D. radiodurans'' reconnects some chromosome fragments by a process called [[Single-stranded DNA|single-stranded]] annealing. In the second step, multiple proteins mend double-strand breaks through [[homologous recombination]]. This process does not introduce any more mutations than a normal round of replication would.

[[Electron microscopy#Scanning electron microscope .28SEM.29|Scanning electron microscopy]] analysis has shown that DNA in ''D. radiodurans'' is organized into tightly packed [[toroid]]s, which may facilitate DNA repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levin-Zaidman S, Englander J, Shimoni E, Sharma AK, Minton KW, Minsky A | title=Ringlike structure of the Deinococcus radiodurans genome: a key to radioresistance? | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | year=2003 | volume=299 | issue=5604 | pages=254–256 | pmid=12522252 | doi=10.1126/science.1077865|bibcode = 2003Sci...299..254L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of Croatian and French researchers led by [[Miroslav Radman]] have bombarded ''D. radiodurans'' to study the mechanism of DNA repair. At least two copies of the genome, with random DNA breaks, can form DNA fragments through [[Annealing (biology)|annealing]]. Partially overlapping fragments are then used for synthesis of [[Homology (biology)#Homology of sequences in genetics|homologous]] regions through a moving [[D-loop]] that can continue extension until they find [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] partner strands. In the final step, there is [[Chromosomal crossover|crossover]] by means of [[RecA]]-dependent [[Chromosomal crossover|homologous recombination]].&lt;ref name="MRadman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Zahradka K, Slade D, Bailone A, Sommer S, Averbeck D, Petranovic M, Lindner AB, Radman M | author8-link=Miroslav Radman | title=Reassembly of shattered chromosomes in Deinococcus radiodurans | journal=Nature | volume=443 | issue=7111 | year=2006 | pages=569–573 | pmid=17006450 | doi=10.1038/nature05160 | bibcode=2006Natur.443..569Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''D. radiodurans'' is capable of genetic transformation, a process by which DNA derived from one cell can be taken up by another cell and integrated into the recipient genome by homologous recombination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moseley | first1 = BE | last2 = Setlow | first2 = JK | year = 1968 | title = Transformation in Micrococcus radiodurans and the ultraviolet sensitivity of its transforming DNA | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 176–183 | pmid = 5303325 |pmc = 285920 | doi=10.1073/pnas.61.1.176|bibcode = 1968PNAS...61..176M }}&lt;/ref&gt;   When DNA damages (e.g. pyrimidine dimers) are introduced into donor DNA by UV irradiation, the recipient cells efficiently repair the damages in the transforming DNA as they do in cellular DNA when the cells themselves are irradiated.

A team of Russian and American scientists proposed that the radioresistance of ''D. radiodurans'' had a [[Mars|Martian]] origin. Evolution of the microorganism could have taken place on the Martian surface until it was delivered to Earth on a [[meteorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2009, [[nitric oxide]] was reported to play an important role in the bacteria's recovery from radiation exposure: the gas is required for division and proliferation after DNA damage has been repaired. A gene was described that increases nitric oxide production after UV radiation, and in the absence of this gene, the bacteria were still able to repair DNA damage, but would not grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news175197704.html|title=Research reveals key to world's toughest organism|author=Krishna Ramanujan|date=October 19, 2009|work=Physorg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of ionizing-radiation resistance==

A persistent question regarding ''D. radiodurans'' is how such a high degree of radioresistance could evolve. Natural [[background radiation]] levels are very low—in most places, on the order of 0.4&amp;nbsp;mGy per year, and the highest known background radiation, near [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], [[Iran]] is only 260&amp;nbsp;mGy per year. With naturally occurring background radiation levels so low, organisms evolving mechanisms specifically to ward off the effects of high radiation are unlikely.

Valerie Mattimore of [[Louisiana State University]] has suggested the radioresistance of ''D. radiodurans'' is simply a side effect of a mechanism for dealing with prolonged cellular [[desiccation]] (dryness). To support this hypothesis, she performed an experiment in which she demonstrated that mutant strains of ''D. radiodurans'' which are highly susceptible to damage from [[ionizing radiation]] are also highly susceptible to damage from prolonged desiccation, while the wild-type strain is resistant to both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattimore V, Battista JR | title=Radioresistance of Deinococcus radiodurans: functions necessary to survive ionizing radiation are also necessary to survive prolonged desiccation | journal=Journal of Bacteriology | date=1 February 1996| volume=178 | issue=3 | pages=633–637 |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/reprint/178/3/633?view=long&amp;pmid=8550493 |pmid=8550493 | pmc=177705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to DNA repair, ''D. radiodurans'' use LEA proteins ([[Late Embryogenesis Abundant proteins]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goyal K, Walton LJ, Tunnacliffe A | title=LEA proteins prevent protein aggregation due to water stress | journal=Biochemical Journal | year=2005 | volume=388 | issue=Pt 1 | pages=151–157 |url=http://www.biochemj.org/bj/388/0151/bj3880151.htm | doi=10.1042/BJ20041931 | pmid=15631617 | pmc=1186703}}&lt;/ref&gt; expression to protect against desiccation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Battista JR, Park MJ, McLemore AE | title=Inactivation of two homologues of proteins presumed to be involved in the desiccation tolerance of plants sensitizes Deinococcus radiodurans R1 to desiccation | journal=Cryobiology | year=2001 | volume=43 | issue=2 | pages=133–139  |pmid=11846468 | doi=10.1006/cryo.2001.2357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
''Deinococcus radiodurans'' has shown to have a great potential to be used in different fields of investigation. Not only ''D.radiodurans'' has been genetically modified for [[bioremediation]] applications, but also it has been discovered that it could perform a major role in biomedical research and in [[Nanotechnology]].

[[Bioremediation]] refers to any process that uses microorganisms, fungi, plants or the enzymes derived from them to return an environment altered by contaminants to its natural condition. Large areas of soils, sediments and groundwater are contaminated with [[radionuclides]], [[heavy metals]] and toxic solvents. There are microorganisms that are able to decontaminate soils with [[heavy metals]] by immobilizing them, but in the case of nuclear waste, [[ionizing radiation]] limits the amount of microorganisms that can be useful. In this sense, ''D. radiodurans'', due to its characteristics, can be used for the treatment of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] waste. ''Deinococcus radiodurans'' has been [[genetically engineered]] to consume and digest solvents and heavy metals in these radioactive environments. The [[Mercury(II) reductase|mercuric reductase]] [[gene]] has been [[clone (genetics)|cloned]] from ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' into ''Deinococcus'' to detoxify the [[ion]]ic [[mercury (element)|mercury]] residue frequently found in [[radioactive waste]] generated from [[nuclear weapon]]s manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brim H, McFarlan SC, Fredrickson JK, Minton KW, Zhai M, Wackett LP, Daly MJ | title=Engineering Deinococcus radiodurans for metal remediation in radioactive mixed waste environments | journal=Nature Biotechnology | year=2000 | volume=18 | issue=1 | pages=85–90 | url=http://www.usuhs.edu/pat/deinococcus/pdf/Brim_2000.pdf | pmid=10625398 | doi=10.1038/71986|format=PDF}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Those researchers developed a [[strain (biology)|strain]] of ''Deinococcus'' that could detoxify both mercury and [[toluene]] in mixed radioactive wastes. Moreover, a gene encoding a non-specific acid [[phosphatase]] from ''[[Salmonella enterica]]'' serovar Typhi &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Appukuttan|first1=Deepti|last2=Rao|first2=Amara Sambasiva|last3=Apte|first3=Shree Kumar|title=Engineering of Deinococcus radiodurans R1 for Bioprecipitation of Uranium from Dilute Nuclear Waste|pmc=1694275|website=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|pages=7873–7878|doi=10.1128/AEM.01362-06|date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the alkaline [[phosphatase]] gene from ''[[Sphingomonas]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kulkarni|first1=Sayali|last2=Ballal|first2=Anand|last3=Apte|first3=Shree Kumar|title=Bioprecipitation of uranium from alkaline waste solutions using recombinant Deinococcus radiodurans|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389413007012?via%3Dihub|website=Journal of Hazardous Materials|pages=853–861|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2013.09.057|date=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been introduced in strains of ''D.radiodurans'' for the bioprecipitation of uranium in acid and alkaline solutions, respectively.

In the biomedical field, ''Deinococcus radiodurans'' could be used as a model to study the processes that lead to [[aging]] and [[cancer]]. The main causes of these physiological changes are related to the damage in [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and [[proteins]] resulting from [[oxidative stress]], the weakening of antioxidant defence and the inability of repair mechanisms to deal with the damage originated by [[reactive oxygen species]], also known as ROS. To this extent, ''D.radiodurans'' mechanisms of protection against oxidative damage and of DNA reparation could be the starting points in research aimed to develop medical procedures to prevent [[aging]] and [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Slade|first1=Dea|last2=Radman|first2=Miroslav|title=Oxidative Stress Resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans|pmc=3063356|website=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews : MMBR|pages=133–191|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00015-10|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lines of investigation are focused on the application of ''D. radiodurans'' antioxidant systems in human cells to prevent ROS damaging and the study of the development of resistance to radiation in tumoral cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rew|first1=D.

Whereas chemical and physical methods to produce these [[nanoparticles]] are expensive and generate a huge amount of [[pollutants]], biosynthetic processes represent an ecofriendly and cheaper alternative. The importance of these [[nanoparticles]] relies on their medical applications as they have been demonstrated to exhibit activity against pathogenic bacteria, [[antifouling]] effects and [[cytotoxicity]] to tumoral cells.

Moreover, there are other uncommon applications of ''Deinococcus radiodurans''. The [[J. Craig Venter Institute|Craig Venter Institute]] has used a system derived from the rapid DNA repair mechanisms of ''D. radiodurans'' to assemble synthetic DNA fragments into [[chromosomes]], with the ultimate goal of producing a synthetic organism they call ''[[Mycoplasma laboratorium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ted.com/talks/craig_venter_on_dna_and_the_sea Craig Venter's TED talk] (February 2005) mentions ''D. radiodurans'' as the ultimate genome assembly machine&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, U.S. scientists demonstrated ''D. radiodurans'' could be used as a means of information storage that might survive a nuclear catastrophe. They translated the song "[[It's a Small World]]" into a series of DNA segments 150 [[base pair]]s long, inserted these into the bacteria, and were able to retrieve them without errors 100 bacterial generations later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Data stored in multiplying bacteria |first=Natasha |last=McDowell |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3243 |newspaper=[[New Scientist]] |date=2003-01-08 |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diatomic carbon''' (systematically named '''dicarbon''' and '''1λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,2λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-ethene''', is a green, gaseous [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[chemical]] with the [[chemical formula]] C=C (also written {{Chem|[C|2|]}} or {{Chem|C|2}}). It is kinetically unstable at ambient temperature and pressure, being removed through autopolymerisation. It occurs in carbon vapor, for example in [[electric arc]]s; in [[comet]]s, [[stellar atmosphere]]s and the [[interstellar medium]]; and in blue [[hydrocarbon]] [[flame]]s.&lt;ref name="Hoffman1995"&gt;{{cite journal

Diatomic carbon is the second simplest form of carbon after [[atomic carbon]], and is an intermediate participator in the genesis of fullerenes.

== Properties ==

C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a component of carbon vapor. One paper estimates that carbon vapor is around 28% diatomic,&lt;ref name=singlet/&gt; but theoretically this depends on the temperature and pressure.

=== Electromagnetic properties ===

The electrons in diatomic carbon are distributed among the atomic orbitals according to the aufbau principle to produce unique quantum states, with corresponding energy levels. The state with the lowest energy level, or ground state, is a singlet state (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Σ{{Su|b=''g''|p=+}}), which is systematically named ethene-1,2-diylidene or dicarbon(0•). There are several excited singlet and triplet states that are relatively close in energy to the ground state, which form significant proportions of a sample of dicarbon under ambient conditions. When most of these excited states undergo photochemical relaxation, they emmit in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, one state in particular emmits in the green region. That state is a triplet state (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Π&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;), which is systematically named ethene-μ,μ-diyl-μ-ylidene or dicarbon(2•). In addition, there is an excited state somewhat further in energy from the ground state, which only form a significant proportion of a sample of dicarbon under mid-ultraviolet irradiation. Upon relaxation, this excited state fluoresces in the violet region and phosphoresces in the blue region. This state is also a singlet state (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Π&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;), which is also named ethene-μ,μ-diyl-μ-ylidene or dicarbon(2•).

[[Molecular orbital theory]] shows that there are two sets of paired electrons in a degenerate pi bonding set of orbitals. This gives a bond order of 2, meaning that there should exist a double bond between the two carbons in a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule.&lt;ref name = Zhong /&gt; One analysis suggests instead that a [[quadruple bond]] exists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Quadruple bonding in C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and analogous eight-valence electron species

[[CASSCF]] calculations indicate that the quadruple bond based on molecular orbital theory is also reasonable.&lt;ref name = Zhong&gt;{{cite journal|title = Latent harmony in dicarbon between VB and MO theories through orthogonal hybridization of 3σ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and 2σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;|first1 = Ronglin|last1 = Zhong|first2 = Min|last2 = Zhang|first3 = Hongliang|last3 = Xu|first4 = Zhongmin|last4 = Su|journal = [[Chemical Science (journal)|Chemical Science]]|year = 2016|volume = 7|pages = 1028–1032|doi = 10.1039/c5sc03437j}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bond dissociation energy|Bond dissociation energies]] of [[Boron|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[Nitrogen|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] show increasing BDE, indicating single, double, and triple bonds, respectively.

In certain forms of crystalline carbon, such as diamond and graphite, a saddle point or “hump” occurs at the bond site in the charge density. The triplet state of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does follow this trend. However, the singlet state of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts more like silicon or germanium; that is, the charge density has a maximum at the bond site.&lt;ref name= high&gt;{{cite journal | title = Higher-order finite-difference pseudopotential method: An application to diatomic molecules | last1 = Chelikowsky | first1 = James R. | authorlink1 = James R.

== Reactions ==

Diatomic carbon will react with [[acetone]] and [[acetaldehyde]] to produce [[acetylene]] by two different pathways.&lt;ref name= singlet&gt;{{cite journal | title = Chemistry of the singlet and triplet C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules.

* [[Triplet state|Triplet]] C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules will react through an intermolecular pathway, which is shown to exhibit radical character. The intermediate for this pathway is the ethylene radical. Its abstraction is correlated with bond energies.&lt;ref name="singlet" /&gt;
* [[Singlet state|Singlet]] C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules will react through an intramolecular, nonradical pathway in which two hydrogen atoms will be taken away from one molecule. The intermediate for this pathway is singlet [[vinylidene]]. The singlet reaction can happen through a 1,1-diabstraction or a 1,2-diabstraction. This reaction is insensitive to isotope substitution. The different abstractions are possibly due to the spatial orientations of the collisions rather than the bond energies.&lt;ref name="singlet" /&gt;
* Singlet C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will also react with [[alkene]]s. Acetylene is a major product; however, it appears C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will insert into carbon-hydrogen bonds. 
* C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 2.5 times more likely to insert into a [[methyl group]] as into [[methylene group]]s.&lt;ref name= alkanes&gt;{{cite journal | title = Reaction of Diatomic Carbon with Alkanes and Ethers/ Trapping of Alkylcarbenes by Vinylidene | last1 = Skell | first1 = P.

== History ==
[[File:C2014Q2 Lovejoy by Paul Stewart.png|thumb|C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) glows green due to diatomic carbon.]]
The light of fainter comets mainly originates from the emission of diatomic carbon. An example is [[C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy)]], where there are several lines of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; light, mostly in the [[visible spectrum]], forming the [[Swan band]]s.&lt;ref name="CrniVrhObservatory"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.observatorij.org/CCDPhot/iwca5.html

A '''gravel stop''' is a sheet metal fabrication used at the perimeter of [[flat roof|built up roofing]].

== Background ==
Traditional [[flat roof|built up roofing]] (informally called '''"tar-and-gravel" roofing''') consists of multiple layers of [[roofing felt]] mopped with layers of hot liquid [[bitumen]], and surfaced with [[gravel]].  At the edges of the roof, some means is required of terminating the roofing, preventing water from running underneath the roofing, and preventing the gravel surfacing from washing off in heavy rains.  The traditional method is a sheet metal fabrication called a gravel stop.

== Materials ==
Gravel stops are made from sheet metals including [[copper]], [[aluminum]], [[terne]] metal, [[galvanized]] steel, and [[stainless steel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5658">[[Image:J-Dryden.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[John Dryden]], who formulated and wrote the heroic drama in the 1670s.]]
'''Heroic drama''' is a type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] popular during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era in [[England]], distinguished by both its verse structure and its subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. Waith, ''Ideas of Greatness: Heroic Drama in England'', London, Routledge, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Douglas Canfield, ''Heroes and States: On the Ideology of Restoration Tragedy'', Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The subgenre of heroic drama evolved through several works of the middle to later 1660s; [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[The Indian Emperour]]'' ([[1665 in literature|1665]]) and [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery| Roger Boyle's]] ''[[The Black Prince (play)|The Black Prince]]'' ([[1667 in literature|1667]]) were key developments.

==Dryden in 1670==
The term "heroic drama" was invented by Dryden for his play, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' ([[1670 in literature|1670]]).  For the ''Preface'' to the printed version of the play, Dryden argued that the drama was a species of ''[[epic poetry]]'' for the stage, that, as the epic was to other poetry, so the heroic drama was to other plays.  Consequently, Dryden derived a series of rules for this type of play.

First, the play should be composed in [[heroic verse]] (closed couplets in iambic pentameter).  Second, the play must focus on a subject that pertains to national foundations, mythological events, or important and grand matters.  Third, the hero of the heroic drama must be powerful, decisive, and, like [[Achilles]], dominating even when wrong.  ''The Conquest of Granada'' followed all of these rules.  The story was that of the national foundation of [[Spain]] (and [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] was known to be fond of Spanish plays), and the hero, Almanzor, was a man of great martial prowess and temperament.

Dryden's ''Conquest of Granada'' is often considered one of the better heroic tragedies, but his highest achievement is his adaptation (which he called ''All for Love'', 1678) of Shakespeare's ''Anthony and Cleopatra'' to the heroic formula. Other heroic dramatists were Nathaniel Lee (''The Rival Queens'') and Thomas Otway, whose ''Venice Preserved'' is a fine tragedy that transcends the usual limitations of the form. We also owe indirectly to heroic tragedy two very amusing parodies of the type: the Duke of Buckingham's ''The Rehearsal'' and Henry Fielding's ''The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great''

==Other dramatists==
"Those who associate 'heroic drama' primarily with the use of the 'heroic couplet' usually set as its extent the years from 1664 to 1678. This, certainly, is its period of fullest development and authority. Those who prefer to accentuate the elements suggested by the very term 'heroic' rather than the strict rhymed verse form are willing to admit wider limits."&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, ''English Drama of the Restoration and Eighteenth Century, 1642&amp;ndash;1780'', New York, Macmillan, 1914; p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration plays by Sir [[William Davenant]], [[Thomas Otway]], [[Nathaniel Lee]], [[John Crowne]], [[Elkanah Settle]], and [[John Banks (playwright)|John Banks]], and later works by [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] and [[Joseph Addison]], have been included in tighter or looser definitions of heroic drama.&lt;ref&gt;Nettleton, pp. 24-9; Waith, pp. 235-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heroic drama in literary criticism==
Today, drama is divided up into numerous subgenres; Dryden, however, worked from [[Classical literature|Classical]] critics.  There was little dramatic critical theory for him to appeal to, and the new rules brought over from [[France]] (particularly those of [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]] and [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]) did not match English theatrical history or practice.  The emphasis on unities and on maintaining only Classically proscribed dramatic forms also came from [[Thomas Rymer]], who condemned the heterogeneity of the stage.  [[Aristotle]] had only spoken of [[satire]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and [[tragedy]], and [[Horace]] also wrote only of [[comedy]], tragedy and satire, and so Dryden was seeking to square actual theatrical practice with an ancient framework for literature.  He was attempting his own neo-classicism.  The [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] had divided Shakespeare's plays into "history," "tragedy," and "comedy," but these terms were stretched.  Dryden, therefore, implicitly recognizes that drama had moved into the territory of other types of poetry, but he strives to restrain that freedom by reforming the stage to a true and epic subject matter. 

==Satirical response==
[[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]] and others satirized heroic drama in ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]''.  The satire was successful enough that heroic drama largely disappeared afterward.  Buckingham attacked the stupidity of blustering, military heroes, as well as the apparent self-importance of attempting a dramatic entertainment about the serious subjects of military and national history.

Buckingham's criticism of Dryden in ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]'' is partly Dryden's bombastic verse but, more pointedly, Dryden's ''personal'' interest in creating a "pure" drama.  The character of Bayes is ludicrous more for his hubris in damning actual plays in favor of imagined ones than he is for being a poetaster.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">{{more footnotes|date=September 2015}}'''Heterogram''' ([[classical compound]]: "[[wikt:hetero-#English|different]]" + "[[wikt:-gram#English|written]]") is a term used mostly in the [[philology|study of ancient texts]] for a special kind of a [[logogram]] consisting of the embedded written representation of a word in a foreign language, which does not have a spoken counterpart in the main (matrix) language of the text. In most cases, the matrix and embedded languages share the same script. While from the perspective of the embedded language the word may be written either phonetically (representing the sounds of the embedded language) or logographically, it is never a phonetic spelling from the point of view of the matrix language of the text, since there is no relationship between the symbols used and the underlying pronunciation of the word in the matrix language.

In English, the written abbreviations ''[[wikt:e.g.|e.g.]]'', ''[[wikt:i.e.|i.e.]]'', and ''[[wikt:viz.|viz.]]'' are often read respectively as "for example", "that is", and "namely".  When read this way, the abbreviations for the [[Latin]] words ''exempli gratia'', ''id est'', and ''videlicet'' are being used logographically to indicate unrelated English phrases.  Similarly, the [[ampersand]] ⟨&amp;⟩, originally a [[typographic ligature|ligature]] for the Latin word ''[[wikt:et#Latin|et]]'', in many European languages stands logographically for the local word for "and" regardless of pronunciation.  This can be contrasted with the older way of abbreviating ''[[et cetera]]''—''[[wikt:&amp;c.|&amp;c.]]''—where ⟨&amp;⟩ is used to represent ''et'' as a full [[loanword]], not a heterogram.

Heterograms are frequent in [[cuneiform script]]s, such as the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] cuneiform, which uses [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian]] heterograms, or the Anatolian cuneiform, which uses both [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian]] and [[Cuneiform script|Akkadian]] heterograms.&lt;ref&gt;Kudrinski M. and I. Yakubovich. 2016. Sumerograms and Akkadograms in Hittite: Ideograms, Logograms, Allograms, or
Heterograms? ''Altorientalische Forschungen'' 43(1-2): 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] scripts derived from the [[Aramaic]] scripts (such as the [[Pahlavi scripts]]), all logograms are heterograms coming from Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Iranica, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/huzwares Huswāreš].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes such heterograms are referred to by terms identifying the source language such as "[[Sumerogram]]s" or "[[Aramaeogram]]s".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11851">'''Heterotopia''' is a concept elaborated by philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] to describe certain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow ‘other’:  disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming. Heterotopias are worlds within worlds, mirroring and yet upsetting what is outside. Foucault provides examples: ships, cemeteries, brothels, prisons, gardens of antiquity, fairs, Turkish baths and many more. Foucault outlines the notion of heterotopia on three occasions between 1966-67. A [https://foucault.info/documents/heterotopia/foucault.heteroTopia.en/ talk] given to a group of architects is the most well-known explanation of the term.  His first mention of the concept is in his ''preface'' to 'The Order of Things' and refers to texts rather than socio-cultural spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |date=1971 |title=The Order of Things |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-75335-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Heterotopia follows the template established by the notions of [[utopia]] and [[dystopia]]. The prefix hetero- is from Ancient Greek ἕτερος (héteros, "other, another, different") and is combined with the Greek morpheme τόπος ("place") and means "other place".  A utopia is an idea or an image that is not real but represents a perfected version of society, such as [[Utopia (book)|Thomas More's book]] or [[Le Corbusier]]'s drawings. As Walter Russell Mead has written, "Utopia is a place where everything is good; dystopia is a place where everything is bad; heterotopia is where things are different — that is, a collection whose members have few or no intelligible connections with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mead |first=Walter Russell |date=Winter 1995–1996 |title=Trains, Planes, and Automobiles: The End of the Postmodern Moment |url= |journal=World Policy Journal |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=13–31 |jstor=40209444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault uses the term "heterotopia" ({{lang-fr|hétérotopie}}) to describe spaces that have more layers of meaning or relationships to other places than immediately meet the eye. In general, a heterotopia is a physical representation or approximation of a utopia, or a parallel space (such as a prison) that contains undesirable bodies to make a real utopian space impossible.

Foucault explains the link between utopias and heterotopias using the metaphor of a mirror. A mirror is a utopia because the image reflected is a 'placeless place', an unreal virtual place that allows one to see one's own visibility. However, the mirror is also a heterotopia, in that it is a real object. The heterotopia of the mirror 
is at once absolutely real, relating with the real space surrounding it, and absolutely unreal, creating a virtual image. 

Foucault articulates several possible types of heterotopia or spaces that exhibit dual meanings: 
* A ‘crisis heterotopia’ is a separate space like a boarding school or a motel room where activities like coming of age or a honeymoon take place out of sight. Foucault describes the crisis heterotopia as "reserved for individuals who are, in relation to society and to the human environment in which they live, in a state of crisis." He also points that crisis heterotopias are constantly disappearing from society and being replaced by the following heterotopia of deviation. 
* ‘Heterotopias of deviation’ are institutions where we place individuals whose behavior is outside the norm (hospitals, asylums, prisons, rest homes, cemetery).  
* Heterotopia can be a single real place that juxtaposes several spaces.  A garden can be a heterotopia, if it is a real space meant to be a microcosm of different environments, with plants from around the world. 
* 'Heterotopias of time' such as museums enclose in one place objects from all times and styles.  They exist in time but also exist outside of time because they are built and preserved to be physically insusceptible to time’s ravages. 
* 'Heterotopias of ritual or purification' are spaces that are isolated and penetrable yet not freely accessible like a public place. Either entry to the heterotopia is compulsory like in entering a prison, or entry requires special rituals or gestures, like in a [[sauna]] or a [[Turkish bath|hammam]].
* Heterotopia has a function in relation to all of the remaining spaces. The two functions are: heterotopia of illusion creates a space of illusion that exposes every real space, and the heterotopia of compensation is to create a real space—a space that is other.

Foucault's elaborations on heterotopias were published in an article entitled ''Des espaces autres'' (Of Other Spaces). The philosopher calls for a society with many heterotopias, not only as a space with several places of/for the affirmation of difference, but also as a means of escape from authoritarianism and repression, stating metaphorically that if we take the ship as the utmost heterotopia, a society without ships is inherently a repressive one, in a clear reference to [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foucault |first=Michel |date=October 1984 |title=Des Espace Autres |journal=Architecture, Mouvement, Continuité |volume=5 |pages=46–49}}; it has been translated into English twice, first as {{cite journal |last=Foucault |first=Michel |others=trans.

==Heterotopia in the work of other authors==
Human geographers often connected to the [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] school have been using the term (and the author's propositions) to help understand the contemporary emergence of (cultural, social, political, economic) difference and identity as a central issue in larger multicultural cities. The idea of ''place'' (more often related to ethnicity and gender and less often to the social class issue) as a heterotopic entity has been gaining attention in the current context of postmodern, post-structuralist theoretical discussion (and political practice) in Geography and other spatial social sciences. The concept of a heterotopia has also been discussed in relation to the space in which learning takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blair |first=Erik |date=2009 |title=A Further Education College as a Heterotopia |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13596740902717465 |journal=Research in Post-Compulsory Education |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=93–101 |doi=10.1080/13596740902717465}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an extensive debate with theorists, such as [[David Harvey]], that remain focused on the matter of class domination as the central determinant of social heteronomy.

The geographer [[Edward Soja]] has worked with this concept in dialogue with the works of [[Henri Lefebvre]] concerning urban space in the book ''Thirdspace''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Soja |first=Edward |date=1996 |title=Thirdspace: Journeys to Los Angeles and Other Real-and-Imagined Places |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |isbn=1-55786-675-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Franklin-Brown uses the concept of heterotopia in an epistemological context to examine the thirteenth century [[encyclopedia|encyclopedias]] of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and [[Ramon Llull]]  as conceptual spaces where many possible ways of knowing are brought together without attempting to reconcile them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Franklin-Brown |first=Mary |date=2012 |title=Reading the World: Encyclopedic Writing in the Scholastic Age |location=Chicago, Ill. |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-26068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Media scholar Hye Jean Chung applies the concept of heterotopia to describe the multiple superimposed layers of spaciality and temporality observed in highly digitized audiovisual media. A heterotopic perception of digital media is, according to Chung, to grasp the globally dispersed labor structure of multinational capitalism that produces the audiovisual representations of various spacio-temporalities. &lt;ref&gt;Chung, Hye Jean. ''Media Heterotopias: Digital Effects and Material Labor in Global Film Production'', Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2018, pp.17-37 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Heterotopia in literature==
The concept of heterotopia has had a significant impact on literature, especially science fiction, fantasy and other [[Speculative fiction|speculative genres]]. Many readers consider the worlds of [[China Miéville]] and other [[weird fiction]] writers to be heterotopias insofar as they are worlds of radical difference transparent or of indifference to their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=Joan |date=November 2003 |title=Hybridity, Heterotopia, and Mateship in China Miéville's ''Perdido Street Station'' |journal=Science Fiction Studies |publisher=SF-TH Inc., DePauw University |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=456–476 |jstor=4241204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel R. Delany|Samuel Delany's]] 1976 novel ''[[Triton (novel)|Trouble on Triton]]'' is subtitled ''An Ambiguous Heterotopia'' and was written partly in dialogue with [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula K.

'''High-altitude adaptation in humans''' is an instance of [[evolutionary adaptation|evolutionary modification]] in certain human populations, including those of [[Tibetan people|Tibet]] in Asia, the [[Andes]] of the Americas, and [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] in Africa, who have acquired the ability to survive at extremely high [[altitudes]]. This adaptation means irreversible, [[adaptive evolution|long-term physiological responses]] to high-altitude environments, associated with heritable [[ethology|behavioural]] and [[mutation|genetic changes]].

While the rest of the human population would suffer serious health consequences, the indigenous inhabitants of these regions thrive well in the highest parts of the world. These people have undergone extensive physiological and genetic changes, particularly in the regulatory systems of oxygen [[respiratory system|respiration]] and blood [[circulatory system|circulation]], when compared to the general lowland population.&lt;ref name=fris&gt;{{cite book|author=Frisancho AR|title=Human Adaptation and Accommodation|year=1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-K_SYHBo42MC&amp;pg|pages=175–301 |isbn =0472095110|publisher=University of Michigan Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Hillary Mayell |title=Three High-Altitude Peoples, Three Adaptations to Thin Air|date=24 February 2004 | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.in/news/2004/02/0224_040225_evolution.html |work=National Geographic News |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andeans===

In contrast to the Tibetans, the Andean highlanders, who have been living at high-altitudes for no more than 11,000 years, show different pattern of haemoglobin adaptation. Their haemoglobin concentration is higher compared to those of lowlander population, which also happens to lowlanders moving to high altitude. When they spend some weeks in the lowland their haemoglobin drops to average of other people. This shows only temporary and reversible acclimatisation. However, in contrast to lowland people, they do have increased oxygen level in their haemoglobin, that is, more oxygen per blood volume than other people. This confers an ability to carry more oxygen in each red blood cell, making a more effective transport of oxygen in their body, while their breathing is essentially at the same rate.&lt;ref name=beall07 /&gt; This enables them to overcome hypoxia and normally reproduce without risk of death for the mother or baby. The Andean highlanders are known from the 16th-century missionaries that their reproduction had always been normal, without any effect in the [[fecundity|giving birth]] or the risk for early pregnancy loss, which are common to hypoxic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vitzthum |first1=Virginia J. |title=Fifty fertile years: anthropologists' studies of reproduction in high altitude natives |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |year=2013 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=179–189 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22357 |pmid=23382088}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have developmentally acquired enlarged residual lung volume and its associated increase in [[alveolus|alveolar]] area, which are supplemented with increased tissue thickness and moderate increase in [[red blood cells]]. Though the physical growth in body size is [[stunted growth|delayed]], growth in lung volumes is accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frisancho|first1=A.

==Genetic basis==

The underlying [[molecular evolution]] of high-altitude adaptation has been explored and understood fairly recently.&lt;ref name=mue /&gt; Depending on the geographical and environmental pressures, high-altitude adaptation involves different genetic patterns, some of which
have evolved quite recently. For example, Tibetan adaptations became prevalent in the past 3,000 years, a rapid example of [[recent human evolution]]. At the turn of the 21st century, it was reported that the genetic make-up of the respiratory components of the Tibetan and the Ethiopian populations are significantly different.&lt;ref name=bea00 /&gt;

=== Tibetans ===

Substantial evidence in Tibetan highlanders suggests that variation in haemoglobin and [[oxygen saturation|blood-oxygen]] levels are adaptive as [[Fitness (biology)|Darwinian fitness]]. It has been documented that Tibetan women with a high likelihood of possessing one to two [[allele]]s for high blood-oxygen content (which is odd for normal women) had more surviving children; the higher the oxygen capacity, the lower the infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beall CM, Song K, Elston RC, Goldstein MC |year=2004 |title=Higher offspring survival among Tibetan women with high oxygen saturation genotypes residing at {{convert|4000|m|ft}}| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/39/14300 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=101|issue=39 |pages=14300–14304 |pmid=15353580|pmc=521103 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0405949101|last2=Song |last3=Elston |last4=Goldstein |bibcode=2004PNAS..10114300B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, for the first time, the genes responsible for the unique adaptive traits were identified following genome sequences of 50 Tibetans and 40 [[Han Chinese]] from [[Beijing]]. Initially, the strongest signal of natural selection detected was a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia, called endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (''[[EPAS1]]''). It was found that one [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) at ''EPAS1'' shows a 78% frequency difference between Tibetan and mainland Chinese samples, representing the fastest genetic change observed in any human gene to date. Hence, Tibetan adaptation to high altitude becomes the fastest process of [[phenotype|phenotypically observable]] evolution in humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Native Village Youth |author2=Education news |title=Tibetans evolved at fastest pace ever measured |url=http://www.nativevillage.org/Archives/2011%20Archives/MAY%202011%20News/Tibetans%20Evolved%20at%20Fastest%20Pace%20Ever%20Measured.htm | date=May 2011|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is estimated to occur in less than 3,000 years ago, when the Tibetans split up from the mainland Chinese population.&lt;ref name=yi /&gt; [[Mutations]] in ''EPAS1'', at higher frequency in Tibetans than their Han neighbours, correlate with decreased haemoglobin concentrations among the Tibetans, which is the hallmark of their adaptation to hypoxia. Simultaneously, two genes, egl nine homolog 1 (''[[EGLN1]]'') (which inhibits haemoglobin production under high oxygen concentration) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (''[[PPARA]]''), were also identified to be positively selected in relation to decreased haemoglobin nature in the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simonson TS, Yang Y, Huff CD, Yun H, Qin G, Witherspoon DJ, Bai Z, Lorenzo FR, Xing J, Jorde LB, Prchal JT, Ge R |year=2010 |title=Genetic evidence for high-altitude adaptation in Tibet | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5987/72 |journal=Science |volume=329 |issue=5987|pages=72–75 |pmid=20466884 |doi=10.1126/science.1189406|last2=Yang |last3=Huff |last4=Yun |last5=Qin |last6=Witherspoon |last7=Bai |last8=Lorenzo |last9=Xing |last10=Jorde |last11=Prchal |last12=Ge |bibcode=2010Sci...329...72S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Sherpas]], known for their Himalayan hardiness, exhibit similar patterns in the ''EPAS1'' gene, which further fortifies that the gene is under [[Selection (biology)|selection]] for adaptation to the high-altitude life of Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hanaoka M, Droma Y, Basnyat B, Ito M, Kobayashi N, Katsuyama Y, Kubo K, Ota M |year=2012 |title=Genetic variants in EPAS1 contribute to adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in Sherpas | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0050566 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=12|pages=e50566|pmid=23227185 |pmc=3515610|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050566|last2=Droma |last3=Basnyat |last4=Ito |last5=Kobayashi |last6=Katsuyama |last7=Kubo |last8=Ota |bibcode=2012PLoSO...750566H }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2014 indicates that the mutant ''[[EPAS1]]'' gene could have been inherited from archaic [[hominin]]s, the [[Denisovans]].&lt;ref name="Huerta-Sanchez et al. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huerta-Sánchez|first1=Emilia |last2=Jin |first2=Xin |last3=Asan |last4=Bianba |first4=Zhuoma|last5=Peter|first5=Benjamin M. |last6=Vinckenbosch|first6=Nicolas|last7=Liang|first7=Yu|last8=Yi|first8=Xin|last9=He|first9=Mingze|last10=Somel|first10=Mehmet|last11=Ni|first11=Peixiang|last12=Wang|first12=Bo|last13=Ou|first13=Xiaohua|last14=Huasang|last15=Luosang|first15=Jiangbai|last16=Cuo|first16=Zha Xi Ping |last17=Li |first17=Kui |last18=Gao |first18=Guoyi |last19=Yin |first19=Ye |last20=Wang|first20=Wei |last21=Zhang |first21=Xiuqing |last22=Xu |first22=Xun|last23=Yang |first23=Huanming |last24=Li |first24=Yingrui |last25=Wang |first25=Jian |last26=Wang |first26=Jun |last27=Nielsen |first27=Rasmus |title=Altitude adaptation in Tibetans caused by introgression of Denisovan-like DNA |journal=Nature |date=2014 |volume=512 |issue=7513 |pages=194–197 |doi=10.1038/nature13408 |pmid=25043035 |bibcode=2014Natur.512..194H |display-authors=8 |pmc=4134395}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''EPAS1'' and ''EGLN1'' are definitely the major genes for unique adaptive traits when compared with those of the Chinese and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peng Y, Yang Z, Zhang H, Cui C, Qi X, Luo X, Tao X, Wu T, Ouzhuluobu, Basang, Ciwangsangbu, Danzengduojie, Chen H, Shi H, Su B|year=2011 |title=Genetic variations in Tibetan populations and high-altitude adaptation at the Himalayas | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/2/1075.full |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=28|issue=2|pages=1075–81|pmid=21030426 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msq290|last2=Yang |last3=Zhang |last4=Cui |last5=Qi |last6=Luo |last7=Tao |last8=Wu |last13=Chen |last14=Shi |last15=Su }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative genome analysis in 2014 revealed that the Tibetans inherited an equal mixture of genomes from the Nepalese-Sherpas and Hans, and they acquired the adaptive genes from the sherpa-lineage.

===Andeans===

The patterns of genetic adaptation among the Andeans are largely distinct from those of the Tibetan, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. However, ''EGLN1'' appears to be the principal signature of evolution, as it shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. Even then, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations.&lt;ref name=bigh /&gt; Among the Andeans, there are no significant associations between ''EPAS1'' or ''EGLN1'' SNP [[genotype]]s and haemoglobin concentration, which has been the characteristic of the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bigham AW, Wilson MJ, Julian CG, Kiyamu M, Vargas E, Leon-Velarde F, Rivera-Chira M, Rodriquez C, Browne VA, Parra E, Brutsaert TD, Moore LG, Shriver MD |year=2013 |title=Andean and Tibetan patterns of adaptation to high altitude | journal=Am J Hum Biol|volume=25|issue=2|pages=190–197|pmid=23348729 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22358|last2=Wilson |last3=Julian |last4=Kiyamu |last5=Vargas |last6=Leon-Velarde |last7=Rivera-Chira |last8=Rodriquez |last9=Browne |last10=Parra |last11=Brutsaert |last12=Moore |last13=Shriver }}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole genome sequences of 20 Andeans (half of them having chronic mountain sickness) revealed that two genes, SENP1 (an erythropoiesis regulator) and ANP32D (an oncogene) play vital roles in their weak adaptation to hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhou D, Udpa N, Ronen R, Stobdan T, Liang J, Appenzeller O, Zhao HW, Yin Y, Du Y, Guo L, Cao R, Wang Y, Jin X, Huang C, Jia W, Cao D, Guo G, Gamboa JL, Villafuerte F, Callacondo D, Xue J, Liu S, Frazer KA, Li Y, Bafna V, Haddad GG |title=Whole-genome sequencing uncovers the genetic basis of chronic mountain sickness in Andean highlanders |journal=Am J Hum Genet |volume=93|issue=S0002–9297(13)00331–5 | pages=452–62|year=2013 |pmid=23954164 |pmc=3769925 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.07.011|last2=Udpa |last3=Ronen |last4=Stobdan |last5=Liang |last6=Appenzeller |last7=Zhao |last8=Yin |last9=Du |last10=Guo |last11=Cao |last12=Wang |last13=Jin |last14=Huang |last15=Jia |last16=Cao |last17=Guo |last18=Gamboa |last19=Villafuerte |last20=Callacondo |last21=Xue |last22=Liu |last23=Frazer |last24=Li |last25=Bafna |last26=Haddad }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopians===

The adaptive mechanism of Ethiopian highlanders is quite different. This is probably because their migration to the highland was relatively early; for example, the [[amhara people|Amhara]] have inhabited altitudes above {{convert|2500|m|ft}} for at least 5,000 years and altitudes around {{convert|2000|m|ft}} to {{convert|2400|m|ft}} for more than 70,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Human technical behavior in the African Middle Stone Age: The lithic assemblange of Porc-Epic Cave (Dire Dawa, Ethiopia)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10437-006-9000-7|journal=African Archaeological Review|volume=22|issue=4|pages=177–197|doi=10.1007/s10437-006-9000-7|pmid=|author=Pleurdeau D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genomic analysis of two ethnic groups, Amhara and [[oromo people|Oromo]], revealed that gene variations associated with haemoglobin difference among Tibetans or other variants at the same [[locus (genetics)|gene location]] do not influence the adaptation in Ethiopians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alkorta-Aranburu G, Beall CM, Witonsky DB, Gebremedhin A, Pritchard JK, Di Rienzo A|year=2012 |title=The genetic architecture of adaptations to high altitude in Ethiopia | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110 |journal=PLOS Genetics |volume=8|issue=12|pages=e1003110|pmid=23236293| pmc=3516565 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110|last2=Beall |last3=Witonsky |last4=Gebremedhin |last5=Pritchard |last6=Di Rienzo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification of specific genes further reveals that several candidate genes are involved in Ethiopians, including ''[[CBARA1]]'', ''[[VAV3]]'', ''[[ARNT2]]'' and ''[[THRB]]''. Two of these genes (''THRB'' and ''ARNT2'') are known to play a role in the [[Hypoxia-inducible factors|HIF-1 pathway]], a pathway implicated in previous work reported in Tibetan and Andean studies. This supports the concept that adaptation to high altitude arose independently among different highlanders as a result of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scheinfeldt LB, Soi S, Thompson S, Ranciaro A, Woldemeskel D, Beggs W, Lambert C, Jarvis JP, Abate D, Belay G, Tishkoff SA|year=2012 |title=Genetic adaptation to high altitude in the Ethiopian highlands | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110 |journal=Genome Biol |volume=13|issue=1|pages=R1 |pmid=22264333| pmc=3334582 |doi=10.1186/gb-2012-13-1-r1|last2=Soi |last3=Thompson |last4=Ranciaro |last5=Woldemeskel |last6=Beggs |last7=Lambert |last8=Jarvis |last9=Abate |last10=Belay |last11=Tishkoff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Please don't change it without also updating the text with something equally or more suitable. --&gt;|thumb|300px|The principle of homology: The biological relationships (shown by colours) of the bones in the forelimbs of vertebrates were used by [[Charles Darwin]] as an argument in favor of [[evolution]].]]

In [[biology]], '''homology''' is the existence of shared ancestry between a pair of structures, or genes, in different [[Taxon|taxa]]. A common example of homologous structures is the forelimbs of [[vertebrates]], where the [[Bat wing development|wings of bats]], the arms of [[primate]]s, the front flippers of [[whale]]s and the forelegs of [[Canidae|dogs]] and [[Equidae|horses]] are all derived from the same ancestral [[tetrapod]] structure. [[Evolutionary biology]] explains homologous structures [[adaptation (biology)|adapted]] to different purposes as the result of descent with modification from a [[Common descent|common ancestor]]. The term was first applied to biology in a non-evolutionary context by the anatomist [[Richard Owen]] in 1843. Homology was later explained by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution in 1859, but had been observed before this, from [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle]] onwards, and it was explicitly analysed by [[Pierre Belon]] in 1555.

In [[developmental biology]], organs that developed in the embryo in the same manner and from similar origins, such as from matching [[Primordium|primordia]] in successive segments of the same animal, are [[serial homology|serially homologous]]. Examples include the legs of a [[centipede]], the [[Insect mouthparts|maxillary palp]] and [[Insect mouthparts|labial palp]] of an insect, and the [[Vertebral column|spinous processes]] of successive [[Vertebral column|vertebrae]] in a [[vertebral column]]. Male and female [[reproductive organ]]s are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the [[ovaries]] and [[testicles]] of mammals including humans.

[[Sequence homology]] between [[protein]] or [[DNA sequence]]s is similarly defined in terms of shared ancestry.  Two segments of DNA can have shared ancestry because of either a [[speciation]] event (orthologs) or a [[Gene duplication|duplication event]] (paralogs). Homology among proteins or DNA is inferred from their sequence similarity.  Significant similarity is strong evidence that two sequences are related by [[divergent evolution]] from a common ancestor. [[Sequence alignment|Alignments]] of multiple sequences are used to discover the homologous regions.

Homology remains controversial in [[ethology|animal behaviour]], but there is suggestive evidence that, for example, [[dominance hierarchies]] are homologous across the [[primates]].

==History==
[[File:BelonBirdSkel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Pierre Belon]] compared the skeletons of birds and humans in his ''Book of Birds'' (1555).&lt;ref name=Panchen1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Panchen |first1=A. L. |title=Homology—history of a concept |journal=Novartis Found Symp |date=1999 |volume=222 |pages=5–18 |pmid=10332750}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Homology was noticed by [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle]] (c. 350 BC), and was explicitly analysed by [[Pierre Belon]] in his 1555 ''Book of Birds'', where he systematically compared the skeletons of birds and humans. The pattern of similarity was interpreted as part of the static [[great chain of being]] through the [[mediaeval]] and [[early modern]] periods: it was not then seen as implying evolutionary change.
In the German ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' tradition, homology was of special interest as demonstrating unity in nature.&lt;ref name=Panchen1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brigandt/&gt;
In 1790, [[Goethe]] stated his [[foliar theory]] in his essay "Metamorphosis of Plants", showing that flower part are derived from leaves.&lt;ref name=Dornelas&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S1677-04202005000400001 |title=From leaf to flower: Revisiting Goethe's concepts on the ¨metamorphosis¨ of plants |year=2005 |last1=Dornelas |first1=Marcelo Carnier |last2=Dornelas |first2=Odair |journal=Brazilian Journal of Plant Physiology |volume=17 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[serial homology]] of limbs was described late in the 18th century.
The French zoologist [[Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] showed in 1818 in his ''theorie d'analogue'' ("theory of homologues") that structures were shared between fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. When Geoffroy went further and sought homologies between [[Georges Cuvier]]'s ''[[embranchement]]s'', such as vertebrates and molluscs, his claims triggered the 1830 [[Cuvier-Geoffroy debate]]. Geoffroy stated the principle of connections, namely that what is important is the relative position of different structures and their connections to each other.
The Estonian [[embryologist]] [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] stated what are now called [[von Baer's laws]] in 1828, noting that related animals begin their development as similar embryos and then diverge: thus, animals in the same [[family (biology)|family]] are more closely related and diverge later than animals which are only in the same [[order (biology)|order]] and have fewer homologies. von Baer's theory recognises that each [[taxon]] (such as a family) has distinctive shared features, and that embryonic development parallels the taxonomic hierarchy: not the same as [[recapitulation theory]].
The term "homology" was first used in biology by the anatomist [[Richard Owen]] in 1843 when studying the similarities of vertebrate [[fin]]s and limbs, contrasting it with the matching term "analogy" which he used to describe different structures with the same function.
Richard Owen codified 3 main criteria for determining if features were homologous: position, development, composition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] explained homologous structures as meaning that the organisms concerned shared a [[body plan]] from a common ancestor, and that taxa were branches of a single [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]].&lt;ref name=Panchen1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sommer |first1=R.

===In cladistics===
{{further|Cladistics}}

Specialised terms are used in taxonomic research. Primary homology is a researcher's initial hypothesis based on similar structure or anatomical connections, suggesting that a character state in two or more taxa share is shared due to common ancestry. Primary homology may be conceptually broken down further:  we may consider all of the states of the same character as "homologous" parts of a single, unspecified, transformation series.  This has been referred to as topographical correspondence.  For example, in an aligned DNA sequence matrix, all of the A, G, C, T or implied gaps at a given nucleotide site are homologous in this way.  Character state identity is the hypothesis that the particular condition in two or more taxa is "the same" as far as our character coding scheme is concerned.  Thus, two Adenines at the same aligned nucleotide site are hypothesized to be homologous unless that hypothesis is subsequently contradicted by other evidence.  Secondary homology is implied by [[parsimony analysis]], where a character state that arises only once on a tree is taken to be homologous.&lt;ref name="de Pinna1991"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.1991.tb00045.x| title=Concepts and Tests of homology in the cladistic paradigm| year=1991| last1=de Pinna | first1=M.

Shared ancestral character states, symplesiomorphies, represent either synapomorphies of a more inclusive group, or complementary states (often absences) that unite no natural group of organisms.  For example, the presence of wings is a synapomorphy for pterygote insects, but a symplesiomorphy for holometabolous insects.  Absence of wings in non-pterygote insects and other organisms is a complementary symplesiomorphy that unites no group (for example, absence of wings provides no evidence of common ancestry of silverfish, spiders and annelid worms).  On the other hand, absence (or secondary loss) of wings is a synapomorphy for fleas.  Patterns such as these lead many cladists to consider the concept of homology and the concept of synapomorphy to be equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, C. 1982. Morphological characters and homology.

{{further|ABC model of flower development}}

The four types of flower parts, namely [[carpel]]s, [[stamen]]s, [[petal]]s, and [[sepal]]s, are homologous with and derived from leaves, as [[Goethe]] correctly noted in 1790. The development of these parts through a pattern of [[gene expression]] in the growing zones ([[meristem]]s) is described by the [[ABC model of flower development]]. Each of the four types of flower parts is serially repeated in concentric whorls, controlled by a small number of genes acting in various combinations. Thus, A genes working alone result in sepal formation; A and B together produce petals; B and C together create stamens; C alone produces carpels. When none of the genes are active, leaves are formed. Two more groups of genes, D to form [[ovule]]s and E for the floral whorls, complete the model. The genes are evidently ancient, as old as the [[flowering plants]] themselves.&lt;ref name="Dornelas"/&gt;

==Developmental biology==
[[File:Pachyrhachis problematicus 45.JPG|thumb|The [[Cretaceous]] snake ''[[Pachyrhachis problematicus]]'' had hind legs (circled).]]

[[Developmental biology]] can identify homologous structures that arose from the same tissue in [[embryogenesis]]. For example, adult [[snake]]s have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had hind legs is confirmed by [[fossil]] evidence: the [[Cretaceous]] snake ''[[Pachyrhachis problematicus]]'' had hind legs complete with hip bones ([[ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[pubis (bone)|pubis]], [[ischium]]), thigh bone ([[femur]]), leg bones ([[tibia]], [[fibula]]) and foot bones ([[calcaneum]], [[astragalus]]) as in tetrapods with legs today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homologies: developmental biology |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/lines_07 |publisher=UC Berkeley |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with anatomical structures, [[sequence homology]] between [[protein]] or [[DNA sequence]]s is defined in terms of shared ancestry.  Two segments of DNA can have shared ancestry because of either a [[speciation]] event ([[Sequence homology#Orthology|orthologs]]) or a [[Gene duplication|duplication event]] ([[Sequence homology#Paralogy|paralogs]]). Homology among proteins or DNA is typically inferred from their sequence similarity.  Significant similarity is strong evidence that two sequences are related by divergent evolution of a common ancestor.  [[Sequence alignment|Alignments]] of multiple sequences are used to indicate which regions of each sequence are homologous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koonin, E. V. |title=Orthologs, Paralogs, and Evolutionary Genomics |journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=39 |issue= |pages=309–38 |year=2005 |pmid=16285863 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.39.073003.114725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homologous sequences are orthologous if they are descended from the same ancestral sequence separated by a [[speciation]] event: when a species diverges into two separate species, the copies of a single gene in the two resulting species are said to be ''orthologous''. The term "ortholog" was coined in 1970 by the [[molecular evolution]]ist [[Walter M. Fitch|Walter Fitch]].&lt;ref name="Fitch WM 99–113"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fitch, W. M. |title=Distinguishing homologous from analogous proteins |journal=Systematic Zoology |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=99–113 |date=June 1970 |pmid=5449325 |doi=10.2307/2412448|jstor=2412448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homologous sequences are paralogous if they were created by a duplication event within the genome. For [[gene duplication]] events, if a gene in an organism is duplicated to occupy two different positions in the same genome, then the two copies are paralogous. Paralogous genes often belong to the same species. They can shape the structure of whole genomes and thus explain genome evolution to a large extent. Examples include the [[Homeobox]] ([[Hox gene|Hox]]) genes in animals. These genes not only underwent gene duplications within [[chromosome]]s but also [[Genome evolution|whole genome duplications]]. As a result, Hox genes in most vertebrates are spread across multiple chromosomes: the HoxA–D clusters are the best studied.&lt;ref name=Zakany&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zakany |first=Jozsef |last2=Duboule |first2=Denis |date=2007 |title=The role of Hox genes during vertebrate limb development |journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=359–366 |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2007.05.011|issn=0959-437X |pmid=17644373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flanery, using data on humans and on nonhuman [[primates]], argue that patterns of behaviour in [[dominance hierarchies]] are homologous across the primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rajecki, D.

This agreement of unusual characteristics is found at several levels, including fine motor movement, gross motor movement, and behavior at the group level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for the Study of the Ancient World''' (ISAW) is a center for advanced scholarly research and graduate education at [[New York University]].  ISAW's mission is to cultivate comparative, connective investigations of the [[ancient history|ancient world]] from the [[Ancient Near East|western Mediterranean]] to [[Ancient China|China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/about |title=About ISAW |website=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World |date= |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of specialty among ISAW's faculty include the [[Greco-Roman world]], the [[Ancient Near East]], [[Egypt]], Central Asia and the [[Silk Road]], [[East Asian art]] and archaeology, [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[early Middle Ages]], [[ancient science]], and [[digital humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/people/faculty/isaw-faculty |title=ISAW Faculty |website=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World |date= |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISAW was founded in 2006 with funding from the [[Leon Levy Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401EFD71F31F932A15750C0A9609C8B63 |title=N.Y.U. and Columbia to Receive $200 Million Gifts for Research - NYTimes.com |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2006-03-21 |accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; established to continue the philanthropic legacy of [[Leon Levy]], co-founder of the Oppenheimer mutual funds. Long interested in ancient history, Levy in his final years, along with his wife Shelby White, began discussions about the creation of a path-breaking institute where advanced scholars would explore trade and cultural links among ancient civilizations. After Levy’s death in 2003, one of the earliest initiatives of the Leon Levy Foundation, was the fulfillment of that plan.  ISAW is a discrete entity within New York University, independent of any other school or department of the university, with its own endowment and its own board of trustees, and is housed in separate facilities in a historic six-story limestone on [[84th Street (Manhattan)|East 84th Street]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid%3Dnewsarchive%26sid%3DaFTWRsVQhuFo%26refer%3Dculture-redirectoldpage |title=New York University Gets $200 Mln for Ancient Studies (Update3) |author=Patrick Cole |newspaper=Bloomberg News |accessdate=2018-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131152/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aFTWRsVQhuFo&amp;refer=culture-redirectoldpage |date=2006-03-21 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance, faculty, and staff==

The Director of ISAW is [[Alexander Jones (classicist)]]. He succeeded the founding director [[Roger Bagnall]] in September, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://chronicle.com/news/article/1939/nyu-hires-renowned-classicist-from-columbia-u-to-lead-new-institute |title=NYU Hires Renowned Classicist From Columbia U. to Lead New Institute |website=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/news/alexander-jones-appointed-director-of-isaw |title=Alexander Jones Appointed Director of ISAW |website=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World |date=2017-08-15 |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 1, 2018, the following individuals served as ISAW faculty:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISAW Faculty|url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/people/faculty/isaw-faculty|website=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISAW's website describes its governance structure as follows:

Appointments and academic programs of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World are under the jurisdiction of its faculty, which achieved independent status in fall, 2010, and which is led by the Director. The Director reports to the Provost and President of New York University. In addition, the Institute has its own [http://isaw.nyu.edu/people/directors-council Director's Council]. Its chair is the Institute's Founder, Shelby White. The Council plays a crucial role in ensuring that ISAW fulfills its mission and has the means necessary to do so. It provides essential advice to the Director on strategic directions and public programming, and its members are vital ambassadors for ISAW in enlarging the public reached by its work. 

==Academic programs==
ISAW's graduate program offers a PhD in the Study of the Ancient World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/graduate-studies |title=Doctoral Program in the Ancient World — Institute for the Study of the Ancient World |website=Isaw.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISAW offers hosts visiting research scholars conducting postdoctoral research. There are three types of appointment for visiting scholars:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/visiting-scholars |title=Visiting Research Scholar Program — Institute for the Study of the Ancient World |website=Isaw.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Visiting assistant professors, appointed for two years, during which they are expected to teach two undergraduate courses and one graduate seminar.
* Visiting research scholars, appointed for one year of research, funded in part or in whole by ISAW. These scholars may be at any point in their career from postdoctoral to retired.
* Externally funded scholars, who have the same responsibilities and privileges as the categories above, but do not receive financial support from ISAW.

Scholars in all three categories are expected to be in residence at ISAW for the duration of their appointment and to participate in the intellectual life of the community, including presenting a public lecture.

==Exhibitions==
In order to support its mission of communicating information about antiquity to the public, ISAW organizes public exhibitions. Past exhibitions include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions |title=Exhibitions at ISAW |website=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World |date=2014-06-16 |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(sound source: 100 ms [[white noise]] from 90&amp;deg; [[azimuth]], 0&amp;deg; [[elevation]])]]

The '''interaural time difference''' (or '''ITD''') when concerning humans or animals, is the difference in arrival time of a sound between two ears. It is important in the localization of sounds, as it provides a cue to the direction or angle of the sound source from the head. If a signal arrives at the head from one side, the signal has further to travel to reach the far ear than the near ear. This pathlength difference results in a time difference between the sound's arrivals at the ears, which is detected and aids the process of identifying the direction of sound source.

When a signal is produced in the horizontal plane, its angle in relation to the head is referred to as its [[azimuth]], with 0 degrees (0°) azimuth being directly in front of the listener, 90° to the right, and 180° being directly behind.

==Different methods for measuring ITDs==
*For an abrupt stimulus such as a click, onset ITDs are measured. An onset ITD is the time difference between the onset of the signal reaching two ears.
*A transient ITD can be measured when using a random noise stimulus and is calculated as the time difference between a set peak of the noise stimulus reaching the ears.
*If the stimulus used is not abrupt but periodic then ongoing ITDs are measured. This is where the waveforms reaching both ears can be shifted in time until they perfectly match up and the size of this shift is recorded as the ITD. This shift is known as the interaural phase difference (IPD) and can be used for measuring the ITDs of periodic inputs such as pure tones and amplitude modulated stimuli.  An amplitude modulated stimulus IPD can be assessed by looking at either the waveform [[Temporal envelope and fine structure|envelope]] or the waveform [[Temporal envelope and fine structure|fine structure]].

==Duplex theory==
The Duplex theory proposed by [[Lord Rayleigh]] (1907) provides an explanation for the ability of humans to localise sounds by time differences between the sounds reaching each ear (ITDs) and differences in sound level entering the ears (interaural level differences, ILDs). But there still lies a question whether ITD or ILD is prominent.

The duplex theory states that ITDs are used to localise low frequency sounds, in particular, while ILDs are used in the localisation of high frequency sound inputs. However, the frequency ranges for which the auditory system can use ITDs and ILDs significantly overlap, and most natural sounds will have both high and low frequency components, so that the auditory system will in most cases have to combine information from both ITDs and ILDs to judge the location of a sound source.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A consequence of this duplex system is that it is also possible to generate so-called "cue trading" or "time–intensity trading" stimuli on headphones, where ITDs pointing to the left are offset by ILDs pointing to the right, so the sound is perceived as coming from the midline.
A limitation of the duplex theory is that the theory does not completely explain directional hearing, as no explanation is given for the ability to distinguish between a sound source directly in front and behind. Also the theory only relates to localising sounds in the horizontal plane around the head. The theory also does not take into account the use of the [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] in localisation.(Gelfand, 2004)

Experiments conducted by Woodworth (1938) tested the duplex theory by using a solid sphere to model the shape of the head and measuring the ITDs as a function of azimuth for different frequencies. The model used had a distance between the 2 ears of approximately 22–23&amp;nbsp;cm. Initial measurements found that there was a maximum time delay of approximately 660 μs when the sound source was placed at directly 90° azimuth to one ear. This time delay correlates to the wavelength of a sound input with a [[frequency]] of 1500&amp;nbsp;Hz. The results concluded that when a sound played had a frequency less than 1500&amp;nbsp;Hz the [[wavelength]] is greater than this maximum time delay between the ears. Therefore, there is a [[phase difference]] between the sound waves entering the ears providing acoustic localisation cues. With a sound input with a frequency closer to 1500&amp;nbsp;Hz the wavelength of the sound wave is similar to the natural time delay. Therefore, due to the size of the head and the distance between the ears there is a reduced phase difference so localisations errors start to be made. When a high frequency sound input is used with a frequency greater than 1500&amp;nbsp;Hz, the wavelength is shorter than the distance between the 2 ears, a [[head shadow]] is produced and ILD provide cues for the localisation of this sound.

Feddersen et al. (1957) also conducted experiments taking measurements on how ITDs alter with changing the azimuth of the loudspeaker around the head at different frequencies. But unlike the Woodworth experiments human subjects were used rather than a model of the head. The experiment results agreed with the conclusion made by Woodworth about ITDs. The experiments also concluded that is there is no difference in ITDs when sounds are provided from directly in front or behind at 0° and 180° azimuth. The explanation for this is that the sound is equidistant from both ears. Interaural time differences alter as the loudspeaker is moved around the head. The maximum ITD of 660 μs occurs when a sound source is positioned at 90° azimuth to one ear.

==Current Findings==

Starting in 1948, the prevailing theory on interaural time differences centered around the idea that inputs from the medial superior olive differentially process inputs from the ipsilateral and contralateral side relative to the sound. This is accomplished through a discrepancy in arrival time of excitatory inputs into the medial superior olive, based on differential conductance of the axons, which allows both sounds to ultimately converge at the same time through neurons with complementary intrinsic properties. 

The article, ''In vivo'' coincidence detection in mammalian sound localization generates phase delays, authored by Franken et al. attempts to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying ITD in mammalian brains. One experiment they performed was to isolate discrete inhibitory post-synaptic potentials to try and determine if inhibitory inputs to the superior olive were allowing the faster excitatory input to delay firing until the two signals were synced. However, after blocking EPSPs with a glutamate receptor blocker, they determine that the size of inhibitory inputs was too marginal to appear to play a significant role in phase locking. This was verified when the experimenters blocked inhibitory input and still saw clear phase locking of the excitatory inputs in their absence. This lead them to the theory that in phase excitatory inputs are summated such that the brain can process sound localization by counting the number of action potentials that arise from various magnitudes of summated depolarization. 

Franken, et al. also examined anatomical and functional patterns within the superior olive to clarify previous theories about the rostrocaudal axis serving as a source of tonotopy. Their results showed a significant correlation between tuning frequency and relative position along the dorsoventral axis, while they saw no distinguishable pattern of tuning frequency on the rostrocaudal axis. 

Lastly, they went on to further explore the driving forces behind the interaural time difference, specifically whether the process is simply the alignment of inputs that is processed by a coincidence detector, or whether the process is more complicated. Evidence from Franken, et al. shows that the processing is affected by inputs that precede the binaural signal, which would alter the functioning of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels to shift the membrane potential of the neuron. Furthermore, the shift is dependent on the frequency tuning of each neuron, ultimately creating a more complex confluence and analysis of sound. Franken, et al.'s findings provide several pieces of evidence that contradict existing theories about binaural audition.

==The anatomy of the ITD pathway==
The auditory nerve fibres, known as the [[afferent nerve]] fibres, carry information from the [[organ of Corti]] to the [[brainstem]] and [[brain]]. Auditory afferent fibres consist of two types of fibres called type I and type II fibres. Type I fibres innervate the base of one or two [[inner hair cells]] and Type II fibres innervate the outer hair cells. Both leave the [[organ of Corti]] through an opening called the habenula perforata. The type I fibres are thicker than the type II fibres and may also differ in how they innervate the [[inner hair cells]]. [[Neurons]] with large calycal endings ensure preservation of timing information throughout the ITD pathway. 

Next in the pathway is the [[cochlear nucleus]], which receives mainly ipsilateral (that is, from the same side) afferent input. The cochlear nucleus has three distinct anatomical divisions, known as the antero-ventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN), postero-ventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN) and dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and each have different neural innervations.

The AVCN contains predominant ''bushy cells'', with one or two profusely branching [[dendrites]]; it is thought that bushy cells may process the change in the spectral profile of complex stimuli. The AVCN also contain cells with more complex firing patterns than bushy cells called ''multipolar cells'', these cells have several profusely branching dendrites and irregular shaped cell bodies. Multipolar cells are sensitive to changes in acoustic stimuli and in particular, onset and offset of sounds, as well as changes in intensity and frequency. The axons of both cell types leave the AVCN as large tract called the ''ventral acoustic stria'', which forms part of the [[trapezoid body]] and travels to the [[superior olivary complex]].

A group of nuclei in [[pons]] make up the [[superior olivary complex]] (SOC). This is the first stage in auditory pathway to receive input from both cochleas, which is crucial for our ability to localise the sounds source in the horizontal plane. The SOC receives input from cochlear nuclei, primarily the ipsilateral and contralateral AVCN. Four nuclei make up the SOC but only the medial superior olive (MSO) and the lateral superior olive (LSO) receive input from both cochlear nuclei.

The MSO is made up of neurons which receive input from the low-frequency fibers of the left and right AVCN. The result of having input from both cochleas is an increase in the firing rate of the MSO units. The neurons in the MSO are sensitive to the difference in the arrival time of sound at each ear, also known as the interaural time difference (ITD). Research shows that if stimulation arrives at one ear before the other, many of the MSO units will have increased discharge rates. The axons from the MSO continue to higher parts of the pathway via the ipsilateral lateral lemniscus tract.(Yost, 2000)

The [[lateral lemniscus]] (LL) is the main auditory tract in the brainstem connecting SOC to the [[inferior colliculus]]. The dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL) is a group of neurons separated by lemniscus fibres, these fibres are predominantly destined for the inferior colliculus (IC). In studies using an unanesthetized rabbit the DNLL was shown to alter the sensitivity of the IC neurons and may alter the coding of interaural timing differences (ITDs) in the IC.(Kuwada et al., 2005) The ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL) is a chief source of input to the inferior colliculus. Research using rabbits shows the discharge patterns, frequency tuning and dynamic ranges of VNLL neurons supply the inferior colliculus with a variety of inputs, each enabling a different function in the analysis of sound.(Batra &amp; Fitzpatrick, 2001) 
In the inferior colliculus (IC) all the major ascending pathways from the olivary complex and the central nucleus converge. The IC is situated in the midbrain and consists of a group of nuclei the largest of these is the central nucleus of inferior colliculus (CNIC). The greater part of the ascending axons forming the lateral lemniscus will terminate in the ipsilateral CNIC however a few follow the commissure of Probst and terminate on the contralateral CNIC. The axons of most of the CNIC cells form the brachium of IC and leave the [[brainstem]] to travel to the ipsilateral [[thalamus]]. Cells in different parts of the IC tend to be monaural, responding to input from one ear, or binaural and therefore respond to bilateral stimulation. 

The spectral processing that occurs in the AVCN and the ability to process binaural stimuli, as seen in the SOC, are replicated in the IC. Lower centres of the IC extract different features of the acoustic signal such as frequencies, frequency bands, onsets, offsets, changes in intensity and localisation.  The integration or synthesis of acoustic information is thought to start in the CNIC.(Yost, 2000)

==Effect of a hearing loss==
A number of studies have looked into the effect of hearing loss on interaural time differences. In their review of localisation and lateralisation studies, Durlach, Thompson, and Colburn (1981), cited in Moore (1996) found a “clear trend for poor localization and lateralization in people with unilateral or asymmetrical cochlear damage.” This is due to the difference in performance between the two ears. In support of this, they did not find significant localisation problems in individuals with symmetrical cochlear losses. 
In addition to this, studies have been conducted into the effect of hearing loss on the threshold for interaural time differences. The normal human threshold for detection of an ITD is up to a time difference of 10μs (microseconds). Studies by Gabriel, Koehnke, &amp; Colburn (1992), Häusler, Colburn, &amp; Marr (1983) and Kinkel, Kollmeier, &amp; Holube (1991)(cited by Moore, 1996) have shown that there can be great differences between individuals regarding binaural performance. It was found that unilateral or asymmetric hearing losses can increase the threshold of ITD detection in patients. This was also found to apply to individuals with symmetrical hearing losses when detecting ITDs in narrowband signals. However, ITD thresholds seem to be normal for those with symmetrical losses when listening to broadband sounds.

The '''Labour Research Department''' ('''LRD''') is an independent [[trade union]] based research organisation, based in London, that provides information to support trade union activity and campaigns.  About 2,000 trade union organisations, including 51 national unions in the UK, representing more than 99% of total [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) membership, are affiliated.

LRD had its beginnings as the Committee of Inquiry into the Control of Industry, set up by the [[Fabian Society]] in 1912. The following year the committee was consolidated as the Fabian Research Department. Its first monthly bulletin was established in 1917, as the ''Monthly Circular''. In 1918 the organisation broadened its membership and changed its name to the Labour Research Department. 

==Publications==
LRD publishes extensively on employment law, including the annual guide Law at Work.  LRD publishes LRD booklets, Labour Research, Workplace Report, Fact Service and Safety Rep.

'''Linguistic diversity index''' ('''LDI''') may refer to either [[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg’s]] (language) Diversity Index&lt;ref name="greenberg1956"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=410659 | title=The Measurement of Linguistic Diversity | journal=Language | year=1956 | volume=32 | issue=1 | pages=109–115 | last=Greenberg | first=Joseph H. | doi=10.2307/410659}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the related Index of Linguistic Diversity (ILD) from [[Terralingua]], which measures changes in the underlying LDI over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harmon |first=David |last2=Loh |first2=Jonathan |date=2010 |title=The Index of Linguistic Diversity: A New Quantitative Measure of Trends in the Status of the World’s Languages |url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4474/harmonloh.pdf |journal=Language Documentation and Conservation |volume=4 |pages=97–151 |archivedate=18 November 2014 |archiveurl=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4474| publisher=http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/ldc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenberg's Diversity Index (LDI) is the probability that two people selected from the population at random will have different mother tongues; it therefore ranges from 0 (everyone has the same mother tongue) to 1 (no two people have the same mother tongue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=country |title=Summary by country |publisher=Ethnologue |date=1999-02-19 |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ILD measures how the LDI has changed over time; a global ILD of 0.8 indicates a 20% loss of diversity since 1970, but ratios above 1 are possible, and have appeared in regional indexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harmon |first=David |last2=Loh |first2=Jonathan |date=2010 |title=The Index of Linguistic Diversity: A New Quantitative Measure of Trends in the Status of the World’s Languages |url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4474/harmonloh.pdf |journal=Language Documentation and Conservation |volume=4 |pages=106–107 |archivedate=18 November 2014 |archiveurl=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4474| publisher=http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/ldc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computation of the diversity index is based on the population of each language as a proportion of the total population.  The index cannot fully account for the vitality of languages.  Also, the distinction between a language and a [[dialect]] is fluid and often political. A great number of languages are considered to be dialects of another language by some experts and separate languages by others.  The index does not consider how different the languages are from each other, nor does it account for second language usage; it considers only the total number of distinct languages, and their relative frequency as mother tongues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terralingua.org/linguisticdiversity/overview/ |title=overview of Linguistic Diversity |publisher=terralingua.org |accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electric music technology''' refers to [[musical instrument]]s and [[Sound recording|recording device]]s that use electrical circuits, which are often combined with mechanical technologies. Examples of electric musical instruments include the electro-mechanical [[electric piano]] (invented in 1929), the [[electric guitar]] (invented in 1931), the electro-mechanical [[Hammond organ]] (developed in 1934) and the [[electric bass]] (invented in 1935). All of these electric instruments do not produce a sound that is audible by the performer or audience in a performance setting unless they are connected to [[instrument amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker cabinet]]s, which made them sound loud enough for performers and the audience to hear. Amplifiers and loudspeakers are separate from the instrument in the case of the electric guitar (which uses a [[guitar amplifier]]), electric bass (which uses a [[bass amplifier]]) and some electric organs (which use a [[Leslie speaker]] or similar cabinet) and most electric pianos. Some electric organs and electric pianos include the amplifier and speaker cabinet within the main housing for the instrument.

Electric sound recording and reproduction are electrical or mechanical techniques and devices for the inscription and re-creation of [[sound]] waves, such as spoken voice, singing, [[instrumental music]], or sound effects. Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a small [[microphone]] diaphragm that can record sound waves on a [[phonograph]] (in which a stylus senses grooves on a record) or [[magnetic tape]]. The first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical [[phonograph cylinder]], invented by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877 and patented in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00200521&amp;idkey=NONE Publication Images&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The next major technical development was the invention of the [[Berliner Gramophone|gramophone disc]] in 1889. For much of the 20th century, records were the most common way of selling sound recordings. The widespread availability of records and the development of [[radio broadcasting]] enabled a much larger proportion of people to listen to songs and pieces performed by the top artists, enabling the development of national and even international musical stars. In the 1970s, the [[compact cassette]] became a major consumer audio format. Advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]], a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979, which allowed consumers to listen to their favourite albums outside of their home.

==Electric instruments==

===Electric piano===
[[File:Rhodes Mk II 73 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Fender Rhodes|Rhodes Mark II Stage 73]] electric piano. It has to be plugged into an [[instrument amplifier]] or [[guitar amp]] to be heard by the performer and audience.]]
An [[electric piano]] is an electric [[musical instrument]] which produces sounds when a performer presses the keys of the [[piano]]-style [[musical keyboard]]. Pressing keys causes mechanical hammers to strike metal strings or tines, leading to vibrations which are converted into electrical signals by [[Pick up (music technology)|magnetic pickups]], which are then connected to an [[instrument amplifier]] and [[loudspeaker]] to make a sound loud enough for the performer and audience to hear. Unlike a [[synthesizer]], the electric piano is not an [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instrument]]. Instead, it is an electro-mechanical instrument. Some early electric pianos used lengths of wire to produce the tone, like a traditional piano. Smaller electric pianos used short slivers of steel, metal tines or short wires to produce the tone. The earliest electric pianos were invented in the late 1920s; the 1929 ''Neo-[[C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik|Bechstein]]'' [[electric grand piano]] was among the first. Probably the earliest stringless model was [[Lloyd Loar]]'s [[Vivi-Tone]] Clavier. A few other noteworthy producers of electric pianos include Baldwin Piano and Organ Company and the [[Wurlitzer]] company.

Early electric piano recordings include [[Duke Ellington]]'s in 1955 and [[Sun Ra]]'s ''India'' as well as other tracks from the 1956 sessions included on his second album ''Super Sonic Jazz'' (aka ''Super Sonic Sounds''). The popularity of the electric piano began to grow in the late 1950s after [[Ray Charles]]'s 1959 hit record "[[What'd I Say]]", reaching its height during the 1970s, after which they were progressively displaced by more lightweight electronic pianos capable of piano-like sounds without the disadvantages of electric pianos' heavy weight and [[moving parts|moving mechanical parts]]. Another factor driving their development and acceptance was the progressive electrification of popular music and the need for a portable keyboard instrument capable of high-volume amplification. Musicians adopted a number of types of domestic electric pianos for rock and pop use. This encouraged their manufacturers to modify them for stage use and then develop models primarily intended for stage use.

Digital electronic [[stage piano]]s have largely replaced most of the original electro-mechanical instruments in the 2000s, due to the small size, low weight and versatility of digital instruments, which can produce a huge range of tones besides piano tones (e.g., emulations of [[Hammond organ]] sounds, synthesizer sounds, etc.). However, some performers still perform and record with vintage electric pianos. In 2009, [[Fender Rhodes]] produced a new line of electro-mechanical pianos, known as the Rhodes Mark 7 followed by an offering from [[Vintage Vibe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keyboardmag.com/article/vintage-vibe-electric-pianos/150018|title=Vintage Vibe Electric Pianos|author=Jon Regen|date=21 November 2012|publisher=[[Keyboard Magazine]]|accessdate=27 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103122218/http://www.keyboardmag.com/article/vintage-vibe-electric-pianos/150018|archivedate=3 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric guitar===
[[File:Kramer_XKG-20_sm.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Kramer Guitars|Kramer]] XKG-20 electric guitar circa 1980.]]
An [[electric guitar]] is a [[guitar]] that uses a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical impulses. The most common guitar pickup uses the principle of direct [[electromagnetic induction]]. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a [[loudspeaker]], so it is [[Guitar amplifier|amplified]] before being sent to a loudspeaker. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add "color" to the sound. Often the signal is modified using [[Effects unit|electronic effect]]s such as [[reverb]] and [[Distortion (music)|distortion]].

Invented in 1931, the electric guitar became a necessity as [[jazz]] guitarists sought to amplify their sound in the [[big band]] format. Early proponents of the electric guitar on record included [[Les Paul]], [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], [[T-Bone Walker]], and [[Charlie Christian]]. During the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in [[pop music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of 20th-Century Technology, Volume 2 |first1=Colin |last1=Hempstead |first2=William E. |last2=Worthington |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005 |isbn=1-57958-464-0|page=793 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wkIlnNjDWcC&amp;pg=PA793}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and styles. It served as a major component in the development of [[electric blues]], [[rock and roll]], [[rock music]], and many other genres of music.

Electric guitar design and construction vary greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups. Guitars have a fixed [[bridge (guitar)|bridge]] or a spring-loaded hinged bridge that lets players bend notes or chords up or down in pitch or perform a [[vibrato]]. The sound of a guitar can be modified by [[extended technique|new playing techniques]] such as [[string bending]], [[tapping]], [[Hammer-on|hammering on]], using [[audio feedback]], or [[slide (guitar technique)|slide]] guitar playing. There are several types of electric guitar, including the solid-body guitar, various types of hollow-body guitars, the seven-string guitar, which typically adds a low B string below the low E, and the twelve-string electric guitar, which has six pairs of strings.

[[Popular music]] and rock groups often use the electric guitar in two roles: as a [[rhythm guitar]], which provides the [[Chord (music)|chord]] sequence or [[Chord progression|progression]] and sets the [[Beat (music)|beat]] (as part of a [[rhythm section]]), and as a [[lead guitar]], which is used to perform [[melody]] lines, melodic [[fill (music)|instrumental fill passages]], and [[guitar solo|solos]].

===Hammond organ===
[[File:Hammond c3 Emilio Muñoz.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Hammond C-3 electric organ.]]

The [[Hammond organ]] is an [[electronic organ#Early electric organs|electric organ]], invented by [[Laurens Hammond]] and John M. Hanert{{sfn|Bush|Kassel|2006|p=168}} and first manufactured in 1935.{{sfn|Corbin|2006|p=151}} Various models have been produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal [[tonewheel]] near an electromagnetic pickup. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured, and it has been described as one of the most successful organs. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the [[Leslie speaker]].

The organ was originally marketed and sold by the Hammond Organ Company to [[Church (building)|churches]] as a lower-cost alternative to the wind-driven [[pipe organ]], or instead of a [[piano]]. It quickly became popular with professional [[jazz]] musicians, who found it a cheaper alternative to the [[big band]]. [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]]'s use of the Hammond B-3, with its additional harmonic percussion feature, inspired a generation of organ players, and its use became more widespread in the 1960s and 1970s in [[rhythm and blues]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[reggae]], as well as being an important instrument in [[progressive rock]].

The Hammond Organ Company struggled financially during the 1970s as they abandoned tonewheel organs and switched to manufacturing instruments using [[integrated circuits]]. These instruments were not as popular with musicians as the tonewheels had been, and the company went out of business in 1985. The Hammond name was purchased by the [[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation]], which proceeded to manufacture digital simulations of the most popular tonewheel organs. This culminated in the production of the "New B-3" in 2002, which provided an accurate recreation of the original B-3 organ using modern digital technology.

Hammond-Suzuki continues to manufacture a variety of organs for both professional players and churches. Other companies, such as [[Korg]], [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] and [[Clavia]], have also achieved success in providing [[Clonewheel organ|emulations]] of the original tonewheel organs. The sound of a tonewheel Hammond can also be emulated using modern software such as [[Native Instruments]] B4.

===Electric bass===
[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Two electric basses and a [[bass amplifier]]. This amplification setup is a "bass stack" approach, in which an amplifier (in this case a Hartke 5000) is plugged into separate speaker cabinets.]]

The [[electric bass]] (or bass guitar) is a [[stringed instrument]] played primarily with the fingers or thumb, by plucking, [[Slapping (music)|slapping]], popping, strumming, tapping, thumping, or [[guitar pick|picking]] with a [[plectrum]], often known as a pick. The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an [[electric guitar]], but with a longer [[neck (music)|neck]] and [[scale (string instruments)|scale]] length, and four to six [[string (music)|strings]] or [[Course (music)|courses]]. The four-string bass, by far the most common, is usually tuned the same as the [[double bass]],&lt;ref&gt;Bass guitar/Double Bass tuning E1=41.20&amp;nbsp;Hz, A1=55&amp;nbsp;Hz, D2=73.42&amp;nbsp;Hz, G2=98&amp;nbsp;Hz + optional low B0=30.87&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to pitches one [[octave]] lower than the four lowest pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G).&lt;ref&gt;Standard guitar tuning E2=82.41&amp;nbsp;Hz, A2=110&amp;nbsp;Hz, D3=146.8&amp;nbsp;Hz, G3=196&amp;nbsp;Hz, B3=246.9&amp;nbsp;Hz, E4=329.6&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;/ref&gt; The bass guitar is a [[transposing instrument]], as it is notated in [[Clef#Bass clef|bass clef]] an octave higher than it sounds (as is the double bass) to avoid excessive [[ledger line]]s. Like the electric guitar, the bass guitar is plugged into an [[Bass instrument amplification|amplifier and speaker]] for live performances.

Since the 1960s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the [[double bass]] in [[popular music]] as the bass instrument in the [[rhythm section]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Jim (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1m2kRBQscfoC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 'How The Fender Bass Changed the World' p. 56] "The surf/instrumental rock genres of the early 1960s were crucial proving grounds of the still-newfangled electric bass&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; While types of [[bass line]]s vary widely from one style of music to another, the bassist usually fulfills a similar role: anchoring the [[chord progression|harmonic framework]] and establishing the beat. Many styles of music utilise the bass guitar, including [[rock music|rock]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[pop music|pop]], [[punk rock]], [[country music|country]], [[reggae]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[blues]], and [[jazz]]. It is often a solo [[musical instrument|instrument]] in jazz, [[jazz fusion]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], [[funk]], [[progressive rock]] and other rock and metal styles.

==Electric sound recording and reproduction==
{{Main article|Sound recording and reproduction}}
Electric sound recording and reproduction are electrical or mechanical techniques and devices for the inscription and re-creation of [[sound]] waves, such as spoken voice, singing, [[instrumental music]], or sound effects. Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a small [[microphone]] diaphragm that can detect changes in atmospheric pressure ([[acoustics|acoustic]] sound waves) and record them as a graphic representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a [[phonograph]] (in which a stylus senses grooves on a record).  In [[magnetic tape]] recording, the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying [[electric current]], which is then converted to a varying [[magnetic field]] by an [[electromagnet]], which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process, with a bigger [[loudspeaker]] diaphragm causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves. Electrically generated signals may also be recorded directly from devices such as an [[Pick up (music technology)|electric guitar pickup]], without the use of acoustic sounds or amplifiers in the recording process (other than the need for musicians to hear herself playing during [[recording session]]).

|description= This 1860 [[phonautogram]] by [[Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville]] is the earliest known recording of a person singing.}}

The first device that could record actual [[sound]]s as they passed through the air (but could not play them back—the purpose was only visual study) was the [[phonautograph]], patented in 1857 by Parisian inventor [[Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville]]. The earliest known recordings of the human voice are phonautograph recordings, called "phonautograms", made in 1857. They consist of sheets of paper with sound-wave-modulated white lines created by a vibrating stylus that cut through a coating of soot as the paper was passed under it.

====Phonograph cylinder====

|title="Kham Hom" ("Sweet Words")
|description= [[Phonograph cylinder]] recording of [[Siam]]ese (Thai) musicians visiting Berlin, Germany in 1900.}}

The first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical [[phonograph cylinder]], invented by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877 and patented in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00200521&amp;idkey=NONE Publication Images&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The invention soon spread across the globe and over the next two decades the commercial recording, distribution and sale of sound recordings became a growing new international industry, with the most popular titles selling millions of units by the early 1900s. The development of mass-production techniques enabled cylinder recordings to become a major new consumer item in industrial countries and the cylinder was the main consumer format from the late 1880s until around 1910.

====Disc phonograph====
[[File:Alexander Graham Bell's Voice.ogg|thumb|Recording of Bell's voice on a wax disc in 1885, identified in 2013 [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau#Bell.27s voice|[more details]]] ]]
[[File:Emile Berliner with phonograph.jpg|thumb|Emile Berliner with disc record gramophone]]
The next major technical development was the invention of the [[Berliner Gramophone|gramophone disc]], generally credited to [[Emile Berliner]] and commercially introduced in the United States in 1889, though others had demonstrated similar disk apparatus earlier, most notably Alexander Graham Bell in 1881.&lt;ref name=smiths1&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Sound Recording Collection and Sound Recovery Project|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/early-sound-recording-collection-and-sound-recovery-project|work=Smithsonian|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discs were easier to manufacture, transport and store, and they had the additional benefit of being louder (marginally) than cylinders, which by necessity, were single-sided. Sales of the [[gramophone record]] overtook the cylinder ca. 1910, and by the end of World War I the disc had become the dominant commercial recording format. In various permutations, the audio disc format became the primary medium for consumer sound recordings until the end of the 20th century, and the double-sided 78 rpm shellac disc was the standard consumer music format from the early 1910s to the late 1950s.

The long-playing 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm microgroove [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] record, or "[[LP record|LP]]", was developed at Columbia Records and introduced in 1948. The short-playing but convenient 7-inch 45 rpm microgroove vinyl [[Single (music)|single]] was introduced by [[RCA Victor]] in 1949. In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs by the end of the 1950s, but in some corners of the world the "78" lingered on far into the 1960s. Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable and the compact "45" format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. If played with a good diamond stylus mounted in a lightweight pickup on a well-adjusted tonearm, it was long-lasting. If protected from dust, scuffs and scratches there was very little noise. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as "unbreakable". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as "unbreakable" compared to wax cylinders.

[[File:Rca44.png|thumb|RCA-44, a classic [[ribbon microphone]] introduced in 1932. Similar units were widely used for recording and broadcasting in the 1940s and are occasionally still used today.]]

Between the invention of the phonograph in 1877 and the advent of digital media, arguably the most important milestone in the history of sound recording was the introduction of what was then called ''electrical recording'', in which a [[microphone]] was used to convert the sound into an electrical signal that was amplified and used to actuate the recording stylus. This innovation eliminated the "horn sound" resonances characteristic of the acoustical process, produced clearer and more full-bodied recordings by greatly extending the useful range of audio frequencies, and allowed previously unrecordable distant and feeble sounds to be captured.

Sound recording began as a purely mechanical process. Except for a few crude telephone-based recording devices with no means of amplification, such as the [[Valdemar Poulsen|Telegraphone]],&lt;ref&gt;The earliest known surviving electrical recording was made on a [[Telegraphone]] magnetic recorder at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It includes brief comments by Emperor Franz Joseph and the audio quality, ignoring dropouts and some noise of later origin, is that of a contemporary telephone.&lt;/ref&gt; it remained so until the 1920s, when several recent radio-related developments in [[electronics]] converged to revolutionize the recording process. These included improved microphones and auxiliary devices such as electronic filters, all dependent on electronic [[Amplifier|amplification]] to be of practical use in recording. In 1906, [[Lee De Forest]] invented the ''Audion'' [[triode]] vacuum tube, an electronic valve that could amplify weak electrical signals. By 1915, it was in use in long-distance telephone circuits that made conversations between New York and San Francisco practical. Refined versions of this tube were the basis of all electronic sound systems until the commercial introduction of the first [[transistor]]-based audio devices in the 1950s.

===Magnetic tape===
{{Main article|Magnetic tape sound recording}}

[[File:Magnetic-tape-acetate-vs-polyester-backing.jpg|thumb|Magnetic audio tapes: acetate base (left) and polyester base (right)]]

An important field of invention during this period was the [[tape recorder]]. [[Magnetic tape]] recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a [[tape head]], which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In playback mode, the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature [[electric generator]] as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Mumma|title=Recording|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/J371600?q=acetate+tape+recording&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=4&amp;_start=1#firsthit|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it. Within a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder—the [[Ampex 200]] model, launched in 1948—American musician-inventor [[Les Paul]] had invented the first [[multitrack tape recorder]], ushering in another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the [[Musique Concrète]] school and avant garde composers like [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], which in turn led to the innovative pop music recordings of artists such as [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Beatles]] and [[The Beach Boys]].

The ease and accuracy of tape editing, as compared to the cumbersome disc-to-disc editing procedures previously in some limited use, together with tape's consistently high audio quality finally convinced radio networks to routinely prerecord their entertainment programming, most of which had formerly been broadcast live. Also, for the first time, broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties were able to undertake comprehensive audio logging of each day's radio broadcasts. Innovations like multitracking and [[Delay (audio effect)|tape echo]] allowed radio programs and advertisements to be produced to a high level of complexity and sophistication. The combined impact with innovations such as the endless loop [[broadcast cartridge]] led to significant changes in the pacing and production style of radio program content and advertising.

===Stereo and hi-fi===
{{See also|Stereophonic sound|High fidelity}}

Magnetic tape enabled the development of the first practical commercial sound systems that could record and reproduce high-fidelity [[stereophonic sound]]. The experiments with stereo during the 1930s and 1940s were hampered by problems with synchronization. A major breakthrough in practical stereo sound was made by [[Bell Laboratories]], who in 1937 demonstrated a practical system of two-channel stereo, using dual optical sound tracks on film. Major movie studios quickly developed three-track and four-track sound systems, and the first stereo sound recording for a commercial film was made by [[Judy Garland]] for the [[MGM]] movie ''[[Listen, Darling]]'' in 1938.

The first commercially released movie with a stereo soundtrack was Walt Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', released in 1940.  The 1941 release of Fantasia used the "[[Fantasound]]" sound system. This system used a separate film for the sound, synchronized with the film carrying the picture. The sound film had four double-width optical soundtracks, three for left, center, and right audio—and a fourth as a "control" track with three recorded tones that controlled the playback volume of the three audio channels. Because of the complex equipment this system required, Disney exhibited the movie as a roadshow, and only in the United States.  Regular releases of the movie used standard mono optical 35&amp;nbsp;mm stock until 1956, when Disney released the film with a stereo soundtrack that used the "[[Cinemascope]]" four-track magnetic sound system.

EMI (UK) was the first company to release commercial stereophonic tapes. They issued their first ''Stereosonic'' tape in 1954. Others quickly followed, under the His Master's Voice and Columbia labels.  161 Stereosonic tapes were released, mostly classical music or lyric recordings. RCA imported these tapes into the US. Two-track stereophonic tapes were more successful in America during the second half of the 1950s.  They were duplicated at real time (1:1) or at twice the normal speed (2:1) when later 4-track tapes were often duplicated at up to 16 times the normal speed, providing a lower sound quality in many cases.  Early American 2-track stereophonic tapes were very expensive.  A typical example is the price list of the Sonotape/Westminster reels:  $6.95, $11.95 and $17.95 for the 7000, 9000 and 8000 series respectively.  Some HMV tapes released in the USA also cost up to $15. Record companies mixed most popular music singles into monophonic sound until the mid-1960s—then commonly released major recordings in both mono and stereo until the early 1970s. Many Sixties pop albums now available only in stereo were originally released only in mono, and record companies produced the "stereo" versions of these albums by simply separating the two tracks of the master tape.

Magnetic tape transformed the recording industry. By the early 1950s, most commercial recordings were mastered on tape instead of recorded directly to disc. Tape facilitated a degree of manipulation in the recording process that was impractical with mixes and multiple generations of directly recorded discs. An early example is [[Les Paul]]'s 1951 recording of ''[[How High the Moon]]'', on which Paul played eight overdubbed guitar tracks. In the 1960s [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]], [[Frank Zappa]], and [[The Beatles]] (with producer [[George Martin]]) were among the first popular artists to explore the possibilities of [[multitrack recording]] techniques and effects on their landmark albums ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', ''[[Freak Out!]]'', and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.

The compact cassette became a major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]], a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979. The Walkman was the first personal music player and it gave a major boost to sales of prerecorded cassettes, which became the first widely successful release format that used a re-recordable medium: the vinyl&lt;!-- avoids BE/AE differences --&gt; record was a playback-only medium and commercially prerecorded tapes for [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape decks]], which many consumers found difficult to operate, were never more than an uncommon niche market item.

{{coord|19.10000|74.05000|type:edu_source:USNO/HMNAO|display=title}}

==History==
The Centre has its roots in the [[Radio Astronomy]] Group of [[TIFR]], set up in the early 1960s under the leadership of [[Govind Swarup]]. The group designed and built the Ooty Radio Telescope. In the early 80's an ambitious plan for a new telescope was proposed - the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. Since the site chosen for this new telescope was close to Pune, a new home for the group was built in the scenic campus of Pune University. The radio astronomy group morphed into the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics around this time.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/ncra1/history A brief history of NCRA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913032757/http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/ncra1/history |date=13 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] (NCRA-TIFR) is the premier institute for radio astronomy in India, and one of the best in this field in the world. Research activities at NCRA-TIFR are centered on low frequency radio astronomy, with research in a wide range of areas, including [[solar physics]], [[pulsars]], [[active galactic nuclei]], the interstellar medium, [[supernova remnants]], the [[Galactic Centre]], nearby [[galaxies]], high-[[redshift]] galaxies, Fundamental Constant Evolution, and the [[epoch of reionization]].  NCRA-TIFR has built and operates the largest steerable [[radio telescope]] in the world, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, as well as the Ooty Radio Telescope, and work at the frontiers of astronomy and astrophysics, as well as in instrumentation development.&lt;ref name="ncra_research"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/research/research-at-ncra-tifr-1 NCRA Research Areas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="details_research"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/research A Details Description of NCRA Research Areas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Facilities==
Research facilities of NCRA includes a well-furnished Library both at NCRA and GMRT, Computing Facilities, Radio Physics Laboratory(A joint initiative of NCRA-TIFR and IUCAA) and above all two radio telescopes GMRT and ORT.

===[[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]] (GMRT)===
NCRA has set up a unique facility for radio astronomical research using the metrewavelengths range of the [[Radio wave|radio spectrum]], known as the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), it is located at a site about 80&amp;nbsp;km north of Pune. GMRT consists of 30 fully steerable gigantic parabolic dishes of 45m diameter each spread over distances of up to 25&amp;nbsp;km. GMRT is one of the most challenging experimental programmes in basic sciences undertaken by Indian scientists and engineers. GMRT is a unique instrument which opens up the [[sky]] at the Metrewave range of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum]] and using the technique of [[Aperture synthesis]] allows to make high sensitive maps of the sky.&lt;ref name="gmrt"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/gmrt/about-gmrt/introducing-gmrt-1 Introducing GMRT]&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is at par with other radio telescopes in the world like the [[Very Large Array|VLA]] in terms of resolution. It complements VLA at the metre-wavelengths.

===[[Ooty Radio Telescope]] (ORT)===
The Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT, as it is known) is a [[cylindrical]] [[paraboloid]] of reflecting surface, 530 m long and 30 m wide, placed on a hill whose slope of about 11 degree in the north-south direction which is the same as the latitude of the location of ORT. This makes it possible to track [[celestial objects]] for about 10 hours continuously from their rising in east to their setting in the west by simply rotating the antenna mechanically along its long axis.The telescope is operated at 326.5&amp;nbsp;MHz (a [[wavelength]] of 0.92 m) with 15&amp;nbsp;MHz usable [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. The large size of the telescope makes it highly sensitive. It has been designed and fabricated fully indigenously.&lt;ref name="ort"&gt;[http://rac.ncra.tifr.res.in/ort.html Radio Astronomy Centre, Ooty]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7062">The '''National Children’s Study''' (NCS) was a longitudinal [[cohort study]] that planned to recruit participants from across the United States of America. It was intended to measure the many factors that contribute to [[health]] and disease from before birth through age 21. This included, but was not limited to, the search for drivers of diseases with prenatal or developmental origins. The Study was closed in December 2014.&lt;ref name=Science121214&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jocelyn Kaiser|title=NIH cancels massive U.S. children’s study|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/funding/2014/12/nih-cancels-massive-u-s-children-s-study|accessdate=December 16, 2014|work=Science|date=December 12, 2014|quote=has too many flaws to be carried out in a tight budget environment, advisers today told National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins.

==Organization==
The NCS was led by the [[National Institutes of Health]], with the [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|''Eunice Kennedy Shriver'' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD) serving as the scientific lead. Within NICHD, the NCS Program Office administered the implementation of day-to-day Study operations. The Program Office was supervised by the Study Director, Steven Hirschfeld, MD, PhD Associate Director for Clinical Research, NICHD.

For advice and recommendations regarding Study framework, content, and methodologies, the NCS Program Office engaged external advisors and scientific groups. These groups included federal partners such as the NCS Federal Advisory Committee and a Federal Consortium with representatives from multiple federal agencies including: the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences|National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of the National Institutes of Health]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. An independent Study Monitoring and Oversight Committee monitored study progress and participant safety.

In addition to these more formal channels, the NCS solicited feedback from subject matter experts from around the world and from individuals, community advocates, and professional societies concerned with child health. The NCS Program Office also provided public forums for input on a variety of initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/organization/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional Mandate==
The "President’s Task Force on Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children" recommended this federal initiative in 1999, after which Congress passed the [[Children's Health Act]] of 2000 (Title X, Section 1004). The Act charged NICHD to:

# plan, develop, and implement a [[prospective cohort study]], from birth to adulthood, to evaluate the effects of both chronic and intermittent exposures on child health and human development; and
# investigate basic mechanisms of developmental disorders and environmental factors, both risk and protective, that influence health and developmental processes.

The Act required this NCS to:
# incorporate behavioral, emotional, educational, and contextual consequences to enable a complete assessment of the physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial environmental influences on children’s well-being;
# gather data on environmental influences and outcomes on diverse populations of children, which may include the consideration of prenatal exposures; and
# consider health disparities among children, which may include the consideration of prenatal exposures&lt;ref&gt;National Institutes of Health [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/html/2011-10500.htm New Proposed Collection; Comment Request; Neuropsychosocial Measures Formative Research Methodology Studies for the National Children's Study] Federal Register, vol 76, No. 84, May 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
The NCS was designed to examine the effects of the environment—broadly defined to include factors such as air, water, diet, sound, family dynamics, community, and cultural influences— and [[genetics]] on the growth, [[child development|development]], and health of children across the United States. The NCS was designed to follow approximately 100,000 children, some from before birth, through age 21 years. The NCS planned to collect comprehensive information to:
# contribute to improving the health and well-being of all children
# deepen our understanding of the contribution of various factors to a range of health and disease outcomes
# understand factors that lead to health disparities.

With this broad perspective, the NCS was designed to contribute to the implementation of health equity, where each individual has an opportunity to realize their health potential.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/overview/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discontinued==
The NCS was in its Vanguard, or [[pilot study|pilot]] phase, which was designed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, cost, and utility of Study scientific output, logistics, and operations prior to initiating the Main Study. The Vanguard Study enrolled about 5,000 children in 40 counties across the United States. General recruitment was completed in July 2013.

On December 12, 2014, the National Children’s Study closed, after an expert review committee advised the NIH Director that moving forward with the larger Main Study would not be the best way to add to the understanding of how environmental and genetic factors influence child health and development.&lt;ref&gt;National Children’s Study (NCS) Working Group [http://acd.od.nih.gov/reports/NCS_WG_FINAL_REPORT.pdf FINAL REPORT – DECEMBER 12, 2014]  National Institutes of Health, Advisory Committee to the Director, 19 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCS will not collect any new information from participants.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The NIH plans to make data already collected available to researchers in late 2015.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''New Breeding Techniques (NBT)''', also named ''New Plant Engineering Techniques,'' are a suite of methods that could increase and accelerate the development of new traits in [[Plant Breeding|plant breeding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Lusser M, Parisi C, Rodriguez Cerezo E, Plan D |title= New plant breeding techniques.

These new techniques, often involve 'genome editing' whose intention is to modify [[DNA]] at specific locations within the plants' [[Gene|genes]] so that new traits and properties are produced in crop plants.

== Methods involved ==
New breeding techniques (NBTs) make specific changes within plant DNA in order to change its [[Phenotypic trait|traits]], and these modifications can vary in scale from altering single [[Nucleobase|base]], to inserting or removing one or more genes.&lt;ref name="POSTNOTE" /&gt; The various methods of achieving these changes in traits include the following:&lt;ref name="POSTNOTE" /&gt;
* Cutting and modifying the genome during the repair process (three tools are used to achieve this: [[Zinc finger nuclease]]; [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]], and [[CRISPR/Cas Tools]])
* Genome editing to introduce changes to just a few [[Base pair|base pairs]] (using a technique called 'oligonucleotide-directed [[Mutagenesis (molecular biology technique)|mutagenesis]]' (ODM)).
* Transferring a gene from an identical or closely related species ([[cisgenesis]])
* Adding in a reshuffled set of regulatory instructions from same species (intragenesis)
* Deploying processes that alter gene activity without altering the DNA itself ([[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] methods)
* [[Grafting]] of unaltered plant onto a genetically modified [[rootstock]]&lt;ref name=ACRE_2013&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/genetically-modified-organisms-new-plant-growing-methods|title=Genetically modified organisms: new plant growing methods - GOV.UK|last=|first=|date=18 July 2013|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential benefits and disbenefits==

Many European environmental organisations came together in 2016 to jointly express serious concerns over new breeding techniques.

== Regulation ==

===OECD===
The [[OECD|Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD) has its own 'Working Group on Harmonization of Regulatory Oversight in Biotechnology' but, as at 2015, there had been virtually no progress in addressing issues around NBTs, and this includes many major food-producing countries like Russia, South Africa, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, China, Japan and India. Despite its huge potential importance for trade and agriculture, as well as potential risks, the majority of food producing countries in the world at that date still had no policies or protocols for regulating or analysing food products derived specifically from new breeding techniques.&lt;ref name="Argentina" /&gt; 

=== South America ===
Argentina introduced regulations and protocols affecting NBTs. These were in place by 2015 &lt;!--date imprecise and needs further checking and follow-up of refs within this citation. This is certainly the latest date--&gt; and gave clarity to plant developers at an early stage so they could anticipate whether or not their products were likely to be regarded as GMOs. The protocols conform to the internationally recognised 2003 [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]].&lt;ref name="Argentina" /&gt;

===North America===
====US====
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] is responsible for determining whether food products derived from NBTs should be regulated, and this is undertaken on a case-by-case manner under the US [[Plant Protection Act]]. As of 2015 there was no specific policy towards NBTs, although in the summer of that year the White House announced plans to update the U.S. Regulatory Framework for Biotechnology.&lt;ref name="OFW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matz|first1=Marshall|last2=Hahn|first2=Robert|name-list-format=vanc|title=The White House Announces Plans to Update the U.S. Regulatory Framework for Biotechnology|url=https://www.ofwlaw.com/2015/07/09/the-white-house-announces-plans-to-update-the-u-s-regulatory-framework-for-biotechnology/|website=www.ofwlaw.com|accessdate=6 January 2018|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Argentina" /&gt;

====Canada====
Canada's food regulatory system differs from those of most other countries, and its procedures already accommodate products from any breeding technique, including NBTs. This is because its 1993 'Biotechnology Regulatory Framework' is based upon a concept of regulatory triggering based upon "Plants with Novel Traits". In other words, if a new trait does not exist within normal cultivated plant populations in Canada, then no matter how it was developed, it will trigger the normal regulatory processes and testing.&lt;ref name="Argentina" /&gt;

'''New Genres''' is an [[artistic movement]] begun in the early 20th century.  The movement is marked by many notable artists who work with a variety of media such as [[video art]], [[body art]], [[Installation art|installation]], [[performance]], and [[sound art]].

==Definition==
New Genres art is commonly identified as [[installation art]], [[Video (disambiguation)|video]], [[film]], [[sound]], [[performance]], [[Digital media]], [[internet art]],&lt;ref&gt;Duron, Julian. Dot Forum: New Genre Art. Fecalface.com. http://www.fecalface.com/SF/component/content/article/138-dot-forum/1434-dot-forum-new-genre-art. Retrieved 2015-6-10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[hybrid genre|hybrid]] and [[emerging art forms]]. New Genres is a practice which begins with ideas and then moves to the appropriate form or media for that particular idea, sometimes inventing entirely new sites of [[cultural production]], new methodologies, technologies, or [[genres]] in the process. New Genres gives emphasis to questioning preconceived notions of the role of art in culture and its relationship to a specific form or [[List of artistic media|medium]].&lt;ref&gt;
University of California, Los Angeles. New Genres Homepage. http://www.art.ucla.edu/newgenres/. Retrieved 2015-6-10.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
While no recognized official date marks the beginning of the New Genre period, many{{quantify|date=September 2014}} believe that the early 20th-century work of the [[Dadaists]] and [[Futurists]] initiated this movement.  Their work laid a foundation for the experimental practice of New Genres.  Duchamp's "Fountain" (1917) introduced the idea of the [[readymade]] object: a non-art object which becomes viewed as art due to the intention and designation of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492875/ready-made |title= ready-made (style of art) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This new use of [[artistic power]] and questioning of the art object opened up the conceptual sphere of New Genres.  These discoveries illuminated the idea that art was possible outside the field of the classical genres like painting and sculpture.

To understand the movement of New Genres, it is important to look at the events occurring simultaneously in the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  In the first half of the century, [[World War I]] broke out and caused devastation to much of Eastern Europe.  In America, the [[Great Depression]] caused a major economic crises that affected many parts of the world.  [[World War II]] quickly followed, splitting the world into two alliances: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]].  This war caused tremendous damage and introduced new tragedies into the world, such as the [[Holocaust]] and the first [[nuclear weapons]].

'''Orality''' is [[thought]] and verbal expression in societies where the technologies of [[literacy]] (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population.  The study of orality is closely allied to the study of [[oral tradition]].  

The term “orality” has been used in a variety of ways, often to describe, in a generalised fashion, the structures of consciousness found in cultures that do not employ, or employ minimally, the technologies of writing. 

[[Walter J. Ong]]’s work was foundational for the study of orality, and reminds us that despite the striking success and subsequent power of written language, the vast majority of languages are never written, and  the basic orality of language is permanent.{{sfn|Cronin|Crosson|Eastlake|2009|p=5}} 

In his later publications Ong distinguishes between two forms of orality: 'primary orality' and 'secondary orality'. Primary orality is thought and expression un-touched by the culture of writing of print; ''[[secondary orality]]'' is explained by Ong as oral culture defined by (implicitly influenced) by the written and printed word, and includes oral culture made possible by technology such as a [[newscaster]] reading a news report on television.

In addition, 'residual orality' is also defined - it is the remnants, legacy, or influence of a predominately oral culture carried over into the written realm - an example might include the use of [[dialogue]] as a philosophical or didactic tool in written literature, such as used by the Greek thinker [[Plato]].

== Origins of philosophy and definition  ==

===Impact of literacy on culture===
Before writing became a way for many [[cultures]] before we had orality. Unfortunately many of the retained orality has been lost or drastically changed. Those that were able to be preserved gives us insight to past cultures and just how much we have evolved since then.&lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Orality and Literacy'' (2nd ed. {{harvnb|Ong|2002}}), Ong sums up his own work over the previous three decades as well as the work of numerous other scholars. With regard to oral tradition and primary orality he  draws on pioneering work by [[Milman Parry]], [[Albert B. Lord]], and [[Eric A. Havelock]]. [[Marshall McLuhan]] was among the first to fully appreciate the significance of the Ong's earlier work about print culture and the [[written and printed word]] as a [[technology]].  In his work ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' {{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}} McLuhan quotes and discusses works by Ong in the 1950s regarding print culture.{{sfn|McLuhan|1962|pp= 104, 129, 146, 159–60, 162–63, 168, 174–76}}; Orality gave us the stepping stones that allowed us to get where we are today, it was a necessity for the growth of civilization. &lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;But using his own examples to amplify Ong's thought, McLuhan shows how each stage in the development of this technology throughout the [[history of communication]] – from the invention of speech (primary orality), to [[pictograms]],  to the [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic alphabet]], to [[typography]], to the electronic communications of today – restructures human consciousness, profoundly changing not only the frontiers of human possibility, but even the frontiers it is possible for humans to imagine.

===Primary orality===
'Primary orality' refers to thought and its verbal expression within cultures "totally untouched by any knowledge of [[writing]] or [[Printing|print]]."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=11}}

All [[sound]] is inherently powerful. If a hunter kills a lion he can see it, touch it, feel it and smell it. But if he hears a lion he must act, fast, because the sound of the lion signals its presence and its power. [[Speech communication|Speech]] is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p= 32}}

Writing is powerful in a different way: it permits people to generate ideas, store them, and retrieve them as needed across time in a highly efficient and accurate way. The absence of this technology in oral societies limits the development of complex ideas and the [[institution]]s that depend on them. Instead, sustained thought in oral settings depends on interpersonal communication, and storing complex ideas over a long period of time requires packaging them in highly memorable ways, generally by using [[mnemonic]] tools.

In his studies of the [[Homeric Question]], [[Milman Parry]] was able to show that the poetic metre found in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' had been 'packaged' by oral [[Greece|Greek]] society to meet its information management needs. These insights first opened the door to a wider appreciation of the sophistication of [[oral tradition]]s, and their various methods of managing information.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first = Adam | editor-last = Parry | title = The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry | publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford| year = 1971|page = 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, ancient and medieval mnemonic tools were extensively documented by [[Frances Yates]] in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]''.{{harv|Yates|1966}}

===Residual orality===
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Socrates in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', quoting the prophecy of [[Amun|Ammon]] (Thamus) : ''"[Writing] will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. [..] You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom.."'' (trans. H.N. Fowler; Line 275)]]
‘Residual orality’ refers to thought and its verbal expression in cultures that have been exposed to writing and print, but have not fully ‘interiorized’ (in McLuhan’s term) the use of these technologies in their daily lives.  As a culture interiorizes the technologies of literacy, the ‘oral residue’ diminishes.

But the availability of a technology of literacy to a society is not enough to ensure its widespread diffusion and use.  For example, [[Eric Havelock]] observed in ''A Preface to Plato'' that after the [[ancient Greeks]] invented writing they adopted a [[scribe|scribal]] culture that lasted for generations.  Few people, other than the scribes, considered it necessary to learn to read or write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Havelock | first = Eric A.| title = A Preface to Plato | publisher =  Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts| year =1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other societies, such as [[ancient Egypt]] or [[medieval Europe]], literacy has been a domain confined to political and religious elites.

Many cultures have experienced an equilibrium state in which writing and mass illiteracy have co-existed for hundreds or even thousands of years.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp= 92–93}}

Oral residue rarely disappears quickly and never vanishes completely.  [[Speech communication|Speech]] is inherently an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts.  Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly shown in the arguments of [[Socrates]] against writing in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]''.  Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman.  It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the [[human mind]] into mere objects in the physical world.  By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what they are able to think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory.  True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds.  And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep saying the same thing over and over again, no matter how often it is refuted.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=78–79}}

The Canadian communications scholar, [[Harold Innis]] argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the cultural and intellectual vitality of ancient Greece in Plato's time. Plato conveyed his ideas by writing down the conversations of Socrates thus "preserving the power of the spoken word on the written page." [[Aristotle]], Innis wrote, regarded Plato's style as "halfway between poetry and prose." Plato was able to arrive at new philosophical positions "through the use of dialogues, allegories and illustrations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harold | first = Innis | title = Empire and Communications | location= Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press | year = 1950 | pages = 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as McLuhan emphasizes, modernization attenuates some oral capabilities.  For example, in medieval Europe silent reading was largely unknown.  This tilted the readers' attention towards the poetic and other auditory aspects of the text.  Educated modern adults may also occasionally long for something like "the capacious medieval memory, which, untrammeled by the associations of print, could learn a strange language with ease and by the methods of a child, and could retain in memory and reproduce lengthy epic and elaborate lyric poems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=McLuhan|edition=1962| first=H.J. | last =Chaytor | title = From Script to Print|publisher=  Heffer and Sons|location= Cambridge| year= 1945| page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McLuhan and Ong also document the apparent re-emergence, in the electronic age, of a kind of '[[secondary orality]]' that displaces written words with audio/visual technologies like [[radio]], [[telephones]], and [[television]].  Unlike primary oral modes of communication, these technologies depend on print for their existence.  Mass Internet collaborations, such as Wikipedia, rely primarily on writing, but re-introduce relationships and responsiveness into the text.

===Importance of the concept===
:''For more details on the social, economic and other effects of literacy or illiteracy see [[Literacy]]''
It has been a habit of literate cultures to view oral cultures simply in terms of their lack of the technologies of writing. This habit, argues Ong, is dangerously misled. Oral cultures are living cultures in their own right. A 1971 study found that of 3,000 extant languages, only 78 had a written [[literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edmonson, Monro E.|title=Lore: An Introduction to the Science of Folklore and Literature|publisher= Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston|location= New York|date= 1971|pages= 323, 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; While literacy extends human possibilities in both thought and action, all literate technologies ultimately depend on the ability of humans to learn oral languages and then translate sound into symbolic imagery.

Understanding between nations may depend to some degree on understanding oral culture. Ong argues that "many of the contrasts often made between 'western' and other views seem reducible to contrasts between deeply interiorized literacy and more or less residually oral states of consciousness."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=29}}

==Theory of the characteristics of oral culture==
Drawing on hundreds of studies from [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]] and the study of [[oral tradition]], Ong summarizes ten key aspects of the '[[psychodynamics]] of orality'. While these are subject to continuing debate, his list remains an important milestone. Ong draws his examples from both primary oral societies, and societies with a very high 'oral residue'.

===Formulaic styling===
To retain complex ideas requires that they be packaged memorably for easy recall.

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| To solve effectively the problem of retaining and retrieving carefully articulated thought, you have to do your thinking in mnemonic patterns, shaped for ready oral recurrence. Your thoughts must come into being in heavily rhythmic, balanced patterns, in repetitions or antithesis, in alliterations or assonances, in epithetic and other formulary expressions… Serious thought is intertwined with memory systems.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=34}}
|}

Anthropologist [[Marcel Jousse]] identifies a close linkage between [[rhythm]] and breathing patterns, gestures and the bilateral symmetry of the human body in several ancient verse traditions.{{sfn|Ong|2002|loc=p.34 citing {{harv|Jousse|1978}} }} This synergy between the body and the construction of oral thought further fuels memory.

===Additive rather than subordinative===
Oral cultures avoid complex 'subordinative' clauses. Ong cites an example from the [[Douay-Rheims]] version of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (1609–10), noting that this basic additive pattern (in ''italics'') has been identified in many oral contexts around the world:{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=37}}

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning God created heaven and earth. ''And'' the earth was void and empty, ''and'' darkness was on the face of the deep; ''and'' the spirit of God moved over the waters. ''And'' God said …
|}

Demonstrating how oral modes of communication tend to evolve into literate ones, Ong additionally cites the [[New American Bible]] (1970), which offers a translation that is grammatically far more complex:

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters. Then God said …
|}

===Aggregative rather than analytic===
Oral expression brings words together in pithy phrases that are the product of generations of evolution: the 'sturdy oak tree', the 'beautiful princess' or 'clever Odysseus'. This does not apply specifically to [[poetry]] or [[song]]; rather the words are brought together out of habit during general communication. 'Analyzing' or breaking apart such expressions is risky: they represent the work of generations and "there is nowhere outside the mind to store them."

Ong cites an American example, noting that in some parts of the [[United States]] with heavy oral residue, until the early twentieth-century it was still considered normal or even obligatory to use the adjective ‘glorious’ when referring to the '[[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]'.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=39}}

===Redundant or 'copious'===
Speech that repeats earlier thoughts or thought-pictures, or shines a different light on them somehow, helps to keep both the speaker and the listener focused on the topic, and makes it easier for all to recall the key points later. "Oral cultures encourage fluency, fulsomeness, volubility. Rhetoricians were to call this [[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style|copia]]"{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=40}}

===Conservative or traditionalist===
Because oral societies have no effective access to writing and print technologies, they must invest considerable energy in basic [[information management]]. Storage of information, being primarily dependent on individual or collective recall, must be handled with particular thrift. It is possible to approximately measure oral residue "from the amount of memorization the culture's educational procedures require."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first =Jack|editor-last =  Goody| at = introduction, pp.13-14 | title = Literacy in traditional societies | publisher =  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge | year = 1968  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This creates incentives to avoid exploring new ideas and particularly to avoid the burden of having to store them. It does not prevent oral societies from demonstrating dynamism and change, but there is a premium on ensuring that changes cleave to traditional formulas, and "are presented as fitting the traditions of the ancestors."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=42}}

===Close to the human lifeworld===
Oral cultures take a practical approach to information storage. To qualify for storage, information must usually concern matters of immediate practical concern or familiarity to most members of the society.

Long after the invention of writing, and often long after the invention of print, basic information on how to perform a society’s most important trades was left unwritten, passed from one generation to the next as it always had been: through [[apprenticeship]], observation and practice.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=43}}

By contrast, only literary cultures have launched phenomenological analyses, abstract classifications, ordered lists and tables, etc. Nothing analogous exists in oral societies.

===Agonistically toned===
[[File:Beowulf and the dragon.jpg|left|thumb|Beowulf fights the dragon: the oral world is agonistic]]
'Agonistic' means 'combative', but Ong actually advances a deeper thesis with this point. Writing and to an even greater extent print, he argues, disengage humans from direct, interpersonal struggle.

Products of "the highly polarized, agonistic, oral world of good and evil, virtue and vice, villains and heroes," the great works of [[oral literature]] from [[Homer]] to [[Beowulf]], from the [[Mwindo epic]] to the [[Old Testament]], are extremely violent by modern standards. They are also punctuated by frequent and intense intellectual combat and tongue-lashings on the one hand, and effusive praise (perhaps reaching its height among [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] [[griot|praise singers]]) on the other.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=43–45}}

===Empathetic and participatory===
In an oral culture the most reliable and trusted technique for learning is to share a "close, empathetic, communal association" with others who know.

Ong cites a study of community decision-making from 12th Century [[England]]. Writing already had a long history in England, and it would have been possible to use texts to establish for example, the age of majority of the heir to an estate. But people were skeptical about texts, noting not only the cost of generating and managing them, but the problems involved in preventing tampering or frauds.

As a result, they retained the traditional solution: gathering together "mature wise seniors of many years, having good testimony", and publicly discussing the age of the heir with them, until agreement was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = M.T. |last = Clanchy | title = From Memory to Written Record, England 1066–1307 | publisher =  Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts | year =  1979 | pages = 230–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hallmark principle of orality, that truth emerges best from communal process, resonates today in the [[jury]] system.

===Homeostatic===
Oral societies conserve their limited capacity to store information, and retain the relevance of their information to the interest of their present members, by shedding memories that have lost their past significance.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|pp=31–34}}

While many examples exist, the classic example was reported by {{harvnb|Goody|Watt|1968}}. Written records prepared by the British in [[Ghana]] in the early 1900s show that [[Ndewura Jakpa]], the seventeenth century founder of the state of the [[Gonja people]], had seven sons, each of whom ruled a territorial division within the state. Six decades later two of the divisions had disappeared for various reasons. The myths of the Gonja had been revised to recount that Jakpa had five sons, and that five divisions were created.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|p=33}} Since they had no practical, present purpose, the other two sons and divisions had evaporated.

===Situational rather than abstract===
In oral cultures, concepts are used in a way that minimizes abstraction, focusing to the greatest extent possible on objects and situations directly known by the speaker. A study by [[Alexander Luria]], a psychologist who did extensive fieldwork comparing oral and literate subjects in remote areas of [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kirghizia]] in 1931–2&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Aleksandr Romanovich | last = Luria | title = Cognitive Development: Its Social and Cultural Foundations| editor-first = Michael |editor-last = Cole| translator-first =Martin | translator-last = Lopez-Morillas |translator-first2 = Lynn | translator-last2= Solotaroff |publisher = Harvard University Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London| year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; documented the highly situational nature of oral thinking.

* Oral subjects always used real objects they were familiar with to refer to geometric shapes; for example a plate or the moon might be used to refer to a circle.
* Asked to select three similar words from the following list "hammer, saw, log, hatchet", oral subjects would reject the literate solution (removing the log to produce a list of 3 tools), pointing out that without the log there wasn't much use for the tools.
* Oral subjects took a practical, not an abstract, approach to syllogisms. Luria asked them this question. ''In the far north, where there is snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zemlya is in the far north and there is always snow there. What colour are the bears?'' Typical response: "I don't know. I've seen a black bear. I've never seen any others. … Every locality has its own animals."
* Oral subjects proved unwilling to analyze themselves. When asked "what sort of person are you?" one responded: "What can I say about my own heart? How can I talk about my character? Ask others; they can tell you about me. I myself can’t say anything."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=49–54}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">{{use dmy dates|date=May 2016}} The '''Organ Reform Movement''' or '''''Orgelbewegung''''' (also called the '''Organ Revival Movement)''' was a mid-20th-century trend in [[pipe organ]] building, originating in Germany. The movement was influential in the United States in the 1930s through 1970s, and began to wane in the 1980s. It arose with early interest in [[historical performance]] and was strongly influenced by [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s championing of historical instruments by [[Gottfried Silbermann]] and others, as well as by Schweitzer's declaration that the criterion for judging an organ is its fitness to perform with clarity the polyphonic [[Baroque]] music of [[J. S. Bach]] (1685–1750). Concert organist [[E. Power Biggs]] was a leading popularizer of the movement in the United States, through his many recordings and radio broadcasts. The movement ultimately went beyond the "Neo-Baroque" copying of old instruments to endorse a new philosophy of [[organ building]], "more Neo than Baroque".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZL4IAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PA56 |title=Deutsche und französische Orgelbaukunst und Orgelkunst |year=1906 |first=Albert |last=Schweitzer |publisher=Breitkopf &amp; Härtel |language=German |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phelps&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence I. |last=Phelps |title=A Short History of the Organ Revival |journal=Church Music |publisher=Concordia |url=http://LawrencePhelps.com/Documents/Articles/Phelps/ashorthistory.shtml |date=Spring 1967 |volume=67 |issue=1 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ambrosino&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan |last=Ambrosino |title=Present Imperfect |journal=The Tracker |publisher=Organ Historical Society |url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2384349/ambrosino/words-writings.html |date=Spring 1999 |volume=43 |issue=2 |accessdate=23 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065215/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2384349/ambrosino/words-writings.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosales.com/instruments/op11/ |title=Rosales Opus 11: The Trinity Cathedral Organ |first=Barbara |last=Owen |publisher=Trinity Episcopal Cathedral (Portland, Oregon) |date=1987 |accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement arose in opposition to the excesses of [[symphonic organ]] building, and eventually symphonic organs regained popularity after the reform movement brought excesses of its own.

The Organ Reform Movement sought to turn away from many of the perceived excesses of [[Aristide Cavaillé-Coll|Romantic]] or [[Symphonic organ]] building and repertoire, in favor of organs understood to be more similar to those of the Baroque Era in Northern Germany, especially those built by [[Arp Schnitger]]. This took the form of a "vertical" style of [[registration (organ)|tonal registration]] in which ensembles were ideally built up with no pitch being duplicated in the same octave, and then the ensembles were crowned with high-pitched [[Mixture (music)|mixture stops]]. The movement endorsed the so-called ''Werkprinzip'', in which each division of the instrument's pipework was based on a [[Flue pipe#Diapasons|principal]]-scale rank of a different octave.&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;

Organ voicers strove for an articulate pipe speech characterized by a short burst of "chiff" sound at the start of each note, and avoided "nicking" the pipe edges and other techniques of achieving symphonic-style "smoothness". Low wind pressures were revived. Casework was sometimes eschewed in favor of open standing pipework, and shuttered [[Expression pedal|swell boxes]] became less common.&lt;ref name=Ambrosino/&gt;

In Europe the movement was indelibly connected with [[tracker action]] (mechanical instruments). In North America this was not the case, and many US and Canadian instruments characteristic of the Organ Reform Movement had [[electro-pneumatic]] or [[direct electric action]].&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;

Some of the leading organ-builders of the movement were:&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;
* (in Northern Europe) [[Rudolf von Beckerath]], [[Dirk Andries Flentrop]], [[Frobenius Orgelbyggeri]], [[Marcussen &amp; Søn]];
* (in North America) [[G.

== Reversals ==
A common criticism of the Organ Reform Movement was that its principles were often taken to extremes that became more dogmatic than musical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Charles |last=Hendrickson |title=Nicking |journal=The American Organist |publisher=American Guild of Organists |url=http://www.enchamade.com/hendricksonorgan/wb/pages/articles/nicking.php |date=1976 |volume=10 |issue= |accessdate=9 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828024634/http://www.enchamade.com/hendricksonorgan/wb/pages/articles/nicking.php |archivedate=28 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ruining many fine symphonic organs and disappointing many listeners.&lt;ref name=Gerber/&gt; Some of the alterations that the movement executed on pre-movement instruments have since been reversed to support a wider range of repertoire, such as on the notable pipe organs of [[Auckland Town Hall#Organ|Auckland Town Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Restored Auckland Town Hall organ ready to sing|date=7 March 2010|journal=City Scene|publisher=[[Auckland City Council]]|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton University Chapel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mander-organs.com/princeton-university-chapel/|title=Princeton University Chapel|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Mander Organs|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chicago's [[Rockefeller Chapel]].&lt;ref name=Gerber&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Gerber |first=James |date=May 2012 |title=Ernest M.

The '''Orlando Science Center''' ('''OSC''') is a private science museum located in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Its purposes are to provide experience-based opportunities for learning about science and technology and to promote public understanding of science.

The Orlando Science Center is accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]] (AAM) and is a member of the [[Association of Science-Technology Centers]] (ASTC). The Orlando Science Center is member supported and sponsored in part by United Arts of Central Florida, Inc., the State of Florida, Department of State, Division of Cultural Affairs and the Florida Arts Council.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.osc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission statement ==
Inspire science learning for life.

== History ==
Incorporated in 1955, the Central Florida Museum (CFM) opened in Orlando Loch Haven Park in 1960. For its first decade, it was an anthropology museum with collections of artifacts relating to [[Florida]] and the [[Caribbean Basin]].

In the early 1970s, the CFM's board of directors voted to change directions and to become a "hands-on" science and technology center. In 1973 the institution was renamed to honor a famous native son and astronaut, [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]].

In 1984, as part of an expansion and change of philosophy, the institution's name was changed to Orlando Science Center. In 1985 another major expansion created a permanent physical sciences hall, a traveling exhibit hall, and Curiosity Corner, a hands-on exhibit area dedicated to pre-school and early primary age children. Its new facility was the setting for the Orlando Children's Museum scenes in ''[[Ernest Saves Christmas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2014/06/20/location-matters-various-points-from-ernest-saves-christmas|title= Location Matters: various points from 'Ernest Saves Christmas'|date= June 10, 2014|work=Orlando Weekly|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the final expansion to the original facility in 1990, NatureWorks, a prototype for OSC's centerpiece natural science exhibit was created.

In May 1992, the Board and staff developed a comprehensive master plan for the Orlando Science Center, including a blueprint for construction of an entirely new science center. Construction of the new science center began in early 1995.

The new {{convert|207000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} Orlando Science Center celebrated its grand opening on February 1, 1997. It is six times larger than the original facility, which closed December 31, 1996. The current president and CEO of the science center is JoAnn Newman.

== Exhibits ==
These are the current exhibits within the Orlando Science Center 
*'''NatureWorks'''  - 1st Floor - Exhibit hall that describes the richness of the natural world, with a focus on the diverse ecosystems of Central Florida. Such as, plants and animals of coral reefs, cypress swamps, mangrove, and other Florida environments. You can learn how living and non-living things interact with each other and their environment.
*'''KidsTown''' - 2nd Floor - Miniature town that introduces science concepts through whole-body experiences, hands-on interactives and  imaginative role-playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/os-orlando-science-center-kids-town-20160909-story.html|title=Orlando Science Center hopes Kids Town can be boom town|date= September 9, 2016|work=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Kinetic Zone''' - 2nd Floor - An eclectic array of hands-on, interactive exhibits, Kinetic Zone lets visitors explore the fundamentals of forces, such as electricity, gravity, Newton's Laws and much more. Visitors can engage in a series of hands-on challenges that invite them to design, build and test their own.

*'''Fusion: A STEAM Gallery''' – 3rd Floor Mezzanine - The Orlando Science Center's art gallery which integrates art into the STEM curriculum. All art displayed has a fusion of art and technology. While the Gallery will remain as a permanent part of the Science Center, the exhibition is updated intermittently
*'''DinoDigs''' - 4th Floor - Exhibit consisting of fossil replicas of dinosaurs and prehistoric sea creatures. Uncover fossils in the giant dig pit "Jurassic Ridge"; examine real, fossilized dino eggs; explore displays that feature ancient land and marine reptiles; compare reptiles and dinosaurs to see similarities and differences; and discover denizens of the ancient oceans such as Elasmosaurus and Tylosaurus.
*'''Our Planet''' - 4th Floor - This exhibit is geared to exploring the strange, curious and odd peculiarities of the universe and our place within it. Discover the dynamic forces and systems that shape Earth and uncover the mysteries of the solar system. Experiences include computer-based interactives and visuals, such as images direct from the NASA Hubble Space Telescope, and hands-on stations that explore some strange and familiar phenomena. There is also a Virtusphere: a 10-foot hollow sphere that rotate freely in any direction based to the user's steps. 
*'''Crosby Observatory''' - 6th Floor - Florida's largest public refractor telescope as well as an array of smaller yet still powerful telescopes strategically placed for star gazing. The Crosby Observatory is open from 3-5pm for SunWatch on the first Saturday of each month, weather permitting, and from 5-9 on the first and third Saturday of the month, weather permitting (exhibit halls are closed during this time).

== Traveling Exhibits ==
The Science Center has a history of hosting traveling exhibits that are displayed for a few months at a time in different galleries.

== Theaters ==
The Science Center has two movie theaters that show both educational and Hollywood films as well as laser light shows. Check the Orlando Science Center website for a current list of movie show times.
*'''Dr. Phillips Cinedome''' - Featuring a giant screen measuring 8,000 square feet, the 300-seat Dr. Phillips CineDome projects films through a fisheye lens, creating an image that surrounds the audience and extends well beyond their peripheral vision. It uses the largest film format in the world, 10 times larger than a conventional film theater. It's commonly called 15/70, meaning 15 perforations (horizontally) on a 70&amp;nbsp;mm print.
*'''Digital Adventure Theater''' - One of the first museums to join a national effort with National Geographic,  the Science Center has special access to one of the world's largest giant-screen film libraries that includes award-winning films in 2D and 3D digital formats.

'''Peter Dingle''' was formerly an associate professor at the School of Environmental Science at [[Murdoch University]], in [[Perth]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=mu-pd-2011/&gt;

In addition he co-presented [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]'s ''Is Your House Killing You''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/learn-from-this-tragedy/story-e6frfhqf-1225881062712 |title=Learn from this tragedy |author=Bolt, Andrew |date=June 18, 2010 |work=[[Herald Sun]] |access-date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s ''Can We Help''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Cancer wife died 'in excruciating pain' |url=http://www.smh.com.au//breaking-news-national/cancer-wife-died-in-excruciating-pain-20100614-y9za.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |access-date=23 February 2016 |author=Bennett, Cortlan |date=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dingle once had a regular spot on 6PR radio Perth advising on health issues but during the inquest on his wife's death at the hands of a homeopath, was sacked by the station, who stated that its "duty of care was with our listeners" and doubted that he would return.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/7410890/6pr-drops-dingle-as-science-expert/ |title=6PR drops Dingle as science expert |work=[[The West Australian]] |date=17 June 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2012 |author=Pownall, Angela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Peter Dingle has Bachelor of Education from the State College of Victoria, and a Bachelor of Science (Hons) and a [[PhD]] from Murdoch University.&lt;ref name=mu-pd-2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.murdoch.edu.au/share/staff/personal/8156.html |title=(Archived) Staff Directory Associate Professor Peter Dingle |work=Murdoch University |date=February 2011 |author=. |archive-date=1 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301123029/http://www.environment.murdoch.edu.au/share/staff/personal/8156.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Dingle's research interests include environmental and nutritional toxicology and health. His honours thesis investigated exposure to and health effects from domestic pesticides and his PhD investigated exposure to and health effects from formaldehyde in the home in 1994. Since 1994 he has been active in research on the role of the environment, nutrition and lifestyle contributors to chronic health conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Publications list for Dingle, Peter at the Murdoch Research Repository |work=Murdoch University Library |date=2016 |accessdate=14 November 2013 |author=. |url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/view/author/Dingle,%20Peter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dingle undertook research into the Mtech (Moletech&lt;ref name=i4u&gt;{{cite news |title=MTech introduces Moletech Fuel Saver |author=Lugmayr, Luigi |url=http://www.i4u.com/17782/mtech-introduces-moletech-fuel-saver |accessdate=27 April 2016 |date=5 January 2008 |work=i4u News}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Fuel Saver with Murdoch University in 2008.

== Time at Murdoch University ==
* Dingle was awarded a 'Teaching Excellence Award' by [[Murdoch University]]'s VC in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VCs Learning and Teaching Awards |url=http://our.murdoch.edu.au/Educational-Development/VCs-Learning-and-Teaching-Awards/List-of-recipients/ |accessdate=27 April 2016 |work=[[Murdoch University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During his time at Murdoch he wrote books about; treating ailments without drugs, nutrition and illness, self-help/memory guidance, medical deceptions and myths, toxic exposure in homes, environmental management and education, bacterial contamination and danger in cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Search/Home?lookfor=author:%22Dingle,%20Peter%22&amp;iknowwhatimean=1 |title=NLA Search Results for author: Dingle, Peter |website=[[National Library of Australia]] |access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Position on autism ==
Dingle says autism is linked to the "(mal)nutrition of our children",&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and has made the claim that it is "apparent that many cases of autism and ADHD can actually be fixed by dietary changes".&lt;ref name=IT2009&gt;{{cite news |title=More nutrients in premium pet food than children's breakfast cereals |author=. |url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/Alumni/_document/Intouch-Magazines/Intouch_Autumn_2009.pdf |accessdate=27 April 2016 |date=Autumn 2009 |work=Intouch alumni magazine |publisher=[[Murdoch University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no scientific basis for this view.

== Controversy ==

=== Penelope Dingle's death ===
Dingle's first wife, Penelope, died in August 2005 from cancer following a failed attempt in 2003 to treat her using [[homeopathy]] and spirituality. Due to the delay in seeking competent medical care, the cancer spread and Penelope's weight dropped to 35 kilograms (77 lb). She eventually had a complete [[bowel obstruction]] forcing her to undergo an emergency operation of a [[Palliative care|palliative]] nature in October 2003, before she died in 2005.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The State Coroner noted that Peter Dingle had not done enough to convince his wife to seek timely medical treatment, and that his inaction had contributed to her death. The Coroner also found that the symptoms had been present from at least as early as October 2001, while Penelope was under the care of a homeopath (whom he described as "not a competent health professional") before finally consulting a doctor in December 2002. In early 2003, her cancer was diagnosed and she was presented with a treatment option which the Coroner found would have given her a "good chance of surviving".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The Coroner also found that her decision to not undergo timely treatment by a competent health professional was "influenced by misinformation and bad science"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.homeowatch.org/news/dingle_finding.pdf |title=Inquest into the death of Penelope DINGLE, No:17/10 |author=AN Hope, W.A.

'''Planetshine''' is the dim illumination, by [[sunlight]] reflected from a [[planet]], of all or part of the otherwise dark side of any [[natural satellite|moon]] orbiting the body. '''Planetlight''' is the [[diffuse reflection]] of sunlight from a planet, whose [[albedo]] can be measured.

The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthshine]] on the [[Moon]], which is most visible from the night side of [[Earth]] when the [[lunar phase]] is crescent or nearly [[new moon|new]],&lt;ref name="NASA earthshine"&gt;{{cite web |title=Earthshine |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=83782 |publisher=[[NASA]] |access-date=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; without the atmospheric [[diffuse sky radiation|brightness]] of the [[daytime]] sky. Typically, this results in the dark side of the Moon being bathed in a faint light.

Planetshine has also been observed elsewhere in the [[Solar System]]. In particular, the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'' space probe]] used [[Saturn]]'s shine to image portions of the [[moons of Saturn|planet's moons]], even when they do not reflect direct sunlight.

==Earthshine==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lunar phase]] --&gt;
{{main|Earthlight (astronomy)}}
[[File:Earthshine diagram.svg|thumb|left|300px|Diagram of planetshine]]

Earthshine is visible [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthlight]] reflected from the [[Moon]]'s night side. It is also known as the Moon's ''ashen glow'' or as "the new Moon with the old Moon in her arm".&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the Scots ballad of [[Sir Patrick Spens]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leonardo-Earthshine.png|left|thumb|150px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s sketch of crescent Moon with earthshine as part of his ''[[Codex Leicester]]'', written between 1506 and 1510]]

Earthshine is most readily visible since a few nights before until a few nights after a [[new moon]], during the (waxing or waning) crescent phase. When the [[lunar phase]] is new as viewed from [[Earth]], Earth would appear nearly fully sunlit from the Moon. [[Sunlight]] is reflected from Earth to the night side of the Moon. The night side appears to glow faintly, and the entire disk of the Moon is dimly illuminated.

[[File:Earth illuminates.jpg|right|thumb|Earthshine reflected from the Moon, as seen through a telescope. The bright region is directly illuminated by the Sun, while the rest of the Moon is illuminated by sunlight reflected from Earth.]]

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] explained the phenomenon in the early 16th century when he realized that both Earth and the Moon reflect sunlight at the same time. Light is reflected from Earth to the Moon and back to Earth as earthshine.

Earthshine is used to help determine the current [[albedo]] of Earth. The data are used to analyze global [[cloud cover]], a climate factor. Oceans reflect the least amount of light, roughly 10%. Land reflects 10–25% of sunlight, and clouds reflect around 50%. Thus, the part of Earth where it is [[daytime]] and from where the Moon is visible determines how bright the earthshine on the Moon appears at any given time.

[[File:Earthshine.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Earthshine reflected from the Moon during [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] with [[Venus]] (left)]]

Studies of earthshine can be used to show how the Earth's cloud cover varies over time.  Preliminary results show a 6.5% dip in cloud cover between 1985 and 1997 and a corresponding increase between 1997 and 2003. This has implications for climate research, especially with regards to [[global warming]]. All clouds contribute to an increased albedo, however some clouds have a net warming effect because they trap more heat than they reflect, while others have a net cooling effect because their increased [[albedo]] reflects more radiation than they trap heat. So while the Earth's albedo is measurably increasing, the uncertainty over the amount of heat trapped means the overall effect on global temperature remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skyandtelescope.com/news/article_1287_1.asp |last=Shiga |first=David |title=Moon Study Tracks Changes in Earth’s Cloud Cover |work=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]] |date=25 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retroreflection==
{{see also|Backscatter|Opposition surge}}

Features on [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], and some other bodies have, to some extent, [[retroreflector|retroreflective]] properties. Light striking them is [[backscatter]]ed, or [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] preferentially back in the direction from which it has come rather than in other directions. If the light comes from the Sun, it is reflected preferentially back toward the Sun and in nearby directions. For example, when [[lunar phase|its phase]] is full, the Moon reflects light preferentially toward the Sun and also Earth, which is in almost the same direction. As viewed from Earth, the [[full Moon]] therefore [[opposition surge|appears brighter]] than it would if it [[scattering|scattered]] light uniformly in all directions. Similarly, near [[new moon]], sunlight that has been backscattered from Earth toward the Sun and also the Moon, which is in almost the same direction, and then backscattered again from the Moon toward Earth appears much brighter, as viewed from Earth, than it would without the retroreflective effects.

The retroreflection is produced by spheres of transparent material on the reflecting surface. When it encounters a transparent sphere, light is preferentially [[heiligenschein|reflected and refracted]] in a path, within the sphere, which exits it in the direction from which it entered. On Earth, the spheres are droplets of water in clouds. On the Moon, large numbers of solid glassy spheres are found on the surface. They are thought to have been formed from drops of molten [[ejecta]], produced by [[impact event]]s, which cooled and solidified before falling back to the surface.

== Ringshine ==

[[File:PIA21055 - Pandora Up Close.jpg|thumb|Very faint ringshine can be seen on [[Pandora (moon)|Pandora]]'s dark side.]]
Ringshine is when sunlight is reflected by a planet's ring system onto the planet or onto the moons of the planet. This has been observed in many of the photos from the [[Cassini orbiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cassini Solstice Mission: Saturn by Ringshine|url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=3236|publisher=NASA|accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search for terrestrial planets==

[[File:The crescent Moon and earthshine over ESO's Paranal Observatory.jpg|thumb|Crescent Moon and earthshine over [[ESO]]'s [[Paranal Observatory]].]]

Scientists at [[NASA]]'s Navigator Program, which specializes in the detection of terrestrial planets, have backed the launch of a [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] (TPF) mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF/tpf_index.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218101411/http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF/tpf_index.cfm |archivedate=18 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; TPF would detect light reflected by planets orbiting stars to investigate whether they could harbor life. It would use advanced telescope technologies to look for life-marks in the light reflected from the planets, including water, oxygen and methane.

The [[European Space Agency]] has a similar mission, named [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]], under consideration. This will also study the light from planets to detect the signatures of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaSC/120382_index_0_m.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many traditional astronomical challenges, the most serious challenge for these missions is not gathering enough photons from the faint planet, but rather detecting a faint planet that is extremely close to a very bright star.  For a terrestrial planet, the contrast ratio of planet to its host stars is approximately ~10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; in the thermal infrared or ~10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; in the optical/near infrared.  For this reason, Darwin and Terrestrial Planet Finder-I will work in the thermal infrared.  However, searching for terrestrial planets in the optical/near infrared has the advantage that the [[diffraction limit]] corresponds to a smaller angle for a given size telescope.  Therefore, [[NASA]] is also pursuing a Terrestrial Planet Finder-C mission that will search for and study terrestrial planets using the optical (and near infrared) wavelengths.  While Terrestrial Planet Finder-C aims to study the light of extrasolar planets, Darwin and Terrestrial Planet Finder-I will search for thermal infrared light that is reradiated (rather than scattered) by the planet.

In preparation for these missions, astronomers have performed detailed earthshine observations, since earthshine has the spectroscopic characteristics of light reflected by the Earth. Astronomers have paid particular attention to whether earthshine measurement can detect the [[red edge]], a spectral feature that is due to plants.  The detection of a similar spectral feature in light from an extrasolar planet would be particularly interesting, since it might be due to a light-harvesting organism.  While the [[red edge]] is almost certainly the easiest way to directly detect life on Earth via earthshine observations, it could be extremely difficult to interpret a similar feature due to life on another planet, since the wavelength of the spectral feature is not known in advance (unlike most atomic or molecular spectral features).

{{For|intensity ratios|Reflectance}}
In [[physics]] and [[electrical engineering]] the '''reflection coefficient''' is a parameter that describes how much of an [[electromagnetic wave]] is reflected by an impedance discontinuity in the transmission medium.  It is equal to the ratio of the [[amplitude]] of the reflected wave to the incident wave, with each expressed as [[phasor]]s.  For example, it is used in [[optics]] to calculate the amount of light that is reflected from a surface with a different index of refraction, such as a glass surface, or in an electrical [[transmission line]] to calculate how much of the [[Reflections of signals on conducting lines|electromagnetic wave]] is reflected by an impedance. The reflection coefficient is closely related to the ''[[transmission coefficient]]''. The [[reflectance]] of a system is also sometimes called a "reflection coefficient".

[[Image:Partial transmittance.gif|right|frame|A wave experiences partial transmittance and partial reflectance when the medium through which it travels suddenly changes.  The reflection coefficient determines the ratio of the reflected wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude.]]

Different specialties have different applications for the term.

== Telecommunications ==
{{see also|Reflections of signals on conducting lines|Signal reflection}}

In [[telecommunication]]s, the reflection coefficient is the [[ratio]] of the [[complex amplitude]] of the reflected wave to that of the incident wave.  In particular, at a discontinuity in a [[transmission line]], it is the [[complex number|complex]] ratio of the [[electric field]] strength of the reflected wave (&lt;math&gt;E^-&lt;/math&gt;) to that of the incident wave (&lt;math&gt;E^+&lt;/math&gt;).  This is typically represented with a &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; (capital [[gamma]]) and can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{E^-}{E^+} &lt;/math&gt;

The reflection coefficient may also be established using other field or [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] quantities. 

The reflection coefficient of a load is determined by its impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_L\,&lt;/math&gt;(load impedance) and the impedance toward the source &lt;math&gt;Z_S\,&lt;/math&gt;(source impedance).

[[Image:Reflection Coefficient Circuit.svg|thumb|right|Simple circuit configuration showing measurement location of reflection coefficient.]]

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = {Z_L - Z_S\over Z_L + Z_S}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that a negative reflection coefficient means that the reflected wave receives a 180°, or &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, phase shift.

The [[Absolute value|magnitude]] (designated by vertical bars) of the reflection coefficient can be calculated from the [[standing wave ratio]], &lt;math&gt;SWR&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;| \Gamma | = {SWR-1 \over SWR+1}&lt;/math&gt;

The reflection coefficient is displayed graphically using a [[Smith chart]].

== Seismology ==

{{main|Reflection seismology}}
Reflection coefficient is used in feeder testing for reliability of medium.

== Optics and microwaves ==
{{main|Fresnel equations}}
In [[optics]] and electromagnetics in general, "reflection coefficient" can refer to either the amplitude reflection coefficient described here, or the [[reflectance]], depending on context. Typically, the reflectance is represented by a capital ''R'', while the amplitude reflection coefficient is represented by a lower-case ''r''.These related concepts are covered by [[Fresnel equations]] in [[Optics#Classical_optics|classical optics]].

== Acoustics ==
{{main|Acoustic wave}}
Acousticians use reflection coefficients to understand the effect of different materials on their acoustic environments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37447">'''Regeneration in humans''' is the regrowth of lost tissues or organs in response to injury. This is in contrast to [[wound healing]], which involves closing up the injury site with a [[scar]]. Some tissues such as skin and large organs including the liver regrow quite readily, while others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration. However ongoing research, particularly in the heart and lungs, suggests that there is hope for a variety of tissues and organs to eventually become regeneration-capable.

==History of human tissue regeneration==

In humans with non-injured tissues, the tissue is naturally regenerated over time; by default these tissues have new cells available to replace expended cells. For example, the body regenerates a full bone within 10 years, while non-injured skin tissue is regenerated within two weeks.&lt;ref name=tedOrgans2009/&gt; With injured tissue, the body usually has a different response – this emergency response usually involves building a degree of scar tissue over a time period longer than a regenerative response, as has been proven clinically&lt;ref name=Cubison2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cubison TC, Pape SA, Parkhouse N |title=Evidence for the link between healing time and the development of hypertrophic scars (HTS) in paediatric burns due to scald injury |journal=Burns |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=992–9 |date=December 2006  |pmid=16901651 |doi=10.1016/j.burns.2006.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and via observation. There are many more historical and nuanced understandings about regeneration processes. In full thickness wounds that are under 2mm, regeneration generally occurs before scarring.&lt;ref name=noScar2mm&gt;{{Cite web|author=Traci A. Wilgus  | title = Regenerative Healing in Fetal Skin: A Review of the Literature| publisher = o-wm.com| date = 9 March 2008| url = http://www.o-wm.com/content/regenerative-healing-fetal-skin-a-review-literature?page=0,11| accessdate = 7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, in full thickness wounds over 3mm, it was found that a wound needed a material inserted in order to induce full tissue regeneration.&lt;ref name=material2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dorin RP, Pohl HG, De Filippo RE, Yoo JJ, Atala A |title= A.

There are some human organs and tissues that regenerate rather than simply scar, as a result of injury. These include the liver, fingertips, and endometrium. More information is now known regarding the passive replacement of tissues in the human body, as well as the mechanics of [[stem cell]]s. Advances in research have enabled the induced regeneration of many more tissues and organs than previously thought possible. The aim for these techniques is to use these techniques in the near future for the purpose of regenerating any tissue type in the human body.

=== Regeneration with materials ===
Generally humans, in vivo, can regenerate injured tissues for limited distances of up to 2mm. The further the wound distance is from 2mm the more the wound regeneration will need inducement. By 2009, via the use of materials, a max induced regeneration could be achieved inside a 1&amp;nbsp;cm tissue rupture.&lt;ref name=tedOrgans2009/&gt; Bridging the wound, the material allowed cells to cross the wound gap; the material then degraded. This technology was first used inside a broken urethra in 1996.&lt;ref name=tedOrgans2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt;  In 2012, using materials, a full urethra was restored in vivo.&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt;

=== Regeneration by 3D printing ===
In 2009, the regeneration of hollow organs and tissues with a long diffusion distance, was a little more challenging. Therefore, to regenerate hollow organs and tissues with a long diffusion distance, the tissue had to be regenerated inside the lab, via the use of a 3D printer.&lt;ref name=tedOrgans2009&gt;{{cite web | last = Atala | first = Anthony| title = Growing new organs| publisher = ted.com | date = October 2009| url = http://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_atala_growing_organs_engineering_tissue?language=en#t-541083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With printing tissues, by 2012, there were four accepted standard levels of regenerative complexity that were acknowledged in various academic institutions: 
* Level one, ''flat tissue'' like skin was the simplest to recreate;&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt; 
* Level two was ''tubular structures'' such as blood vessels;&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt; 
* Level three was ''hollow non-tubular structures'';&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt; 
* Level four was ''solid organs'', which were by far the most complex to recreate due to the vascularity.&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt;

|}

In 2012, within 60 days it was possible, inside the lab, to grow tissue the size of half a postage stamp to the size of a football field; and most cell types could be grown and expanded outside of the body, with the exception of the liver, nerve and pancreas, as these tissue types need stem cell populations.&lt;ref name=organRegen2012&gt;{{cite web | last = McManus| first = Rich | title = Atala Surveys Successes of Regenerative Medicine | website = nihrecord.nih.gov | date = 2 March 2012 | url = http://nihrecord.nih.gov/newsletters/2012/03_02_2012/story1.htm | accessdate = 7 April 2015 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141121112209/http://nihrecord.nih.gov/newsletters/2012/03_02_2012/story1.htm| dead-url = yes| archivedate =2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first organ ever induced and made in the lab was the bladder, which was created in 1999. In 2014, organs that have been various tissues regenerated by the printer; these tissues include the bladder, muscle, vagina, penis and the thymus.

In 2015 researchers developed a proof of principle biolimb inside a laboratory; they also estimated that it would be at least a decade for any testing of limbs in humans. The limb demonstrated, fully functioning skin, muscles, blood vessels and bones.&lt;ref name=limb2015&gt;{{cite web | last = Plaugic | first = Lizzie | title = Researchers have grown a partially functioning rat limb in a lab | website = theverge.com | publisher = washingtonpost.com | date = 4 June 2015 | url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/4/8730453/rat-limb-biolimb-regeneration-decellularization | accessdate = 8 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regeneration with drugs ===
In 2016 scientists could transform a skin cell into any other tissue type via the use of drugs.&lt;ref name="skinStemSept2016"&gt;{{cite web

==Naturally regenerating appendages and organs==

===Heart===
Cardiomyocyte necrosis activates an inflammatory response that serves to clear the injured myocardium from dead cells, and stimulates repair, but may also extend injury. Research suggests that the cell types involved in the process play an important role. Namely monocyte-derived macrophages tend to induce inflammation while inhibiting cardiac regeneration, while tissue resident macrophages may help restoration of tissue structure and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frangogiannis |first=N.G.|title=Inflammation in cardiac injury, repair and regeneration. |journal=Curr Opin Cardiol|date=May 2015|pages=240–245 |pmid=25807226|pmc=4401066|volume=30|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endometrium===
The [[endometrium]] after the process of breakdown via the menstruation cycle, re-epithelializes swiftly and regenerates.&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 = Su | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.2 complete regeneration: | work = Pathology | publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = After the repair process has been completed, the structure and function of the injured tissue are completely normal. This type of regeneration is common in physiological situations. Examples of physiological regeneration are the continual replacement of cells of the skin and repair of the endometrium after menstruation.

===Fingers===
In May 1932, L.H. McKim published a report in ''The Canadian Medical Association Journal'', that described the regeneration of an adult digit-tip following amputation.  A house surgeon in the [[Montreal General Hospital]] underwent amputation of the [[Phalanx bones|distal phalanx]] to stop the spread of an infection.  In less than one month following surgery, x-ray analysis showed the regrowth of bone while macroscopic observation showed the regrowth of nail and skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKim |first=L.H.|title=Regeneration Of The Distal Phalanx |journal=The Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=May 1932|pages=549–550 |pmid=20318716|pmc=402335|volume=26|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the earliest recorded examples of adult human digit-tip regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wicker |first=Jordan |author2=Kenneth Kamler |title=Current concepts in limb regeneration: A hand surgeon's perspective |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |date=August 2009|volume=1172|issue=1 |pages=95–109 |pmid=19735243 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04413.x |bibcode=2009NYASA1172...95W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in the 1970s showed that children up to the age of 10 or so who lose fingertips in accidents can regrow the tip of the digit within a month provided their wounds are not sealed up with flaps of skin &amp;ndash; the de facto treatment in such emergencies. They normally won't have a [[fingerprint]], and if there is any piece of the finger nail left it will grow back as well, usually in a square shape rather than round.&lt;ref name="weintraub"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Weintraub, Arlene |title= The Geniuses Of Regeneration|date=May 24, 2004 |journal=BusinessWeek|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_21/b3884008_mz001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illingworth"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Illingworth Cynthia M | year = 1974 | title = Trapped fingers and amputated fingertips in children | journal = Journal of Pediatric Surgery | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 853–858 | doi=10.1016/s0022-3468(74)80220-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Lee Spievack, then in his early sixties, accidentally sliced off the tip of his right middle finger just above the [[Phalanx bones|first phalanx]]. His brother, Dr. Alan Spievack, was researching regeneration and provided him with powdered [[extracellular matrix]], developed by Dr. Stephen Badylak of the [http://www.mirm.pitt.edu/ McGowan Institute] of [[Regenerative medicine|Regenerative Medicine]]. Mr. Spievack covered the wound with the powder, and the tip of his finger re-grew in four weeks.&lt;ref name=MSNBC_20070219&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=October 24, 2008 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17171083/ |title=Regeneration recipe: Pinch of pig, cell of lizard |agency=Associated Press |publisher=MSNBC |date=February 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news was released in 2007. [[Ben Goldacre]] has described this as "the missing finger that never was", claiming that fingertips regrow and quoted [[Simon Kay]], professor of [[hand surgery]] at the [[University of Leeds]], who from the picture provided by Goldacre described the case as seemingly "an ordinary fingertip injury with quite unremarkable healing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/03/medicalresearch.health |date=May 3, 2008 |work=The Guardian |title=The missing finger that never was |author=Goldacre, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar story was reported by CNN. A woman named [[Deepa Kulkarni]] lost the tip of her little finger and was initially told by doctors that nothing could be done. Her personal research and consultation with several specialists including Badylak eventually resulted in her undergoing regenerative therapy and regaining her fingertip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/09/09/pinky.regeneration.surgery/index.html Woman's persistence pays off in regenerated fingertip] by Elizabeth Cohen.

===Kidney===
Regenerative capacity of the [[kidney]] has been recently explored.&lt;ref&gt;Regeneration and Experimental Orthotopic Transplantation of a Bioengineered Kidney, Nat Med. 2013 May ; 19(5): 646–651 by Jeremy J Song; Jacques Guyette; Sarah Gilpin; Gabriel Gonzalez; Joseph P Vacanti; and Harald C Ott. Harvard Medical School. {{DOI|10.1038/nm.3154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic functional and structural unit of the kidney is [[nephron]], which is mainly composed of four components: the glomerulus, tubules, the collecting duct and peritubular capillaries. The regenerative capacity of the mammalian kidney is limited compared to that of lower vertebrates.

In the mammalian kidney, the regeneration of the tubular component following an acute injury is well known. Recently regeneration of the [[glomerulus]] has also been documented. Following an acute injury, the proximal tubule is damaged more, and the injured epithelial cells slough off the basement membrane of the nephron. The surviving epithelial cells, however, undergo migration, dedifferentiation, proliferation, and redifferentiation to replenish the epithelial lining of the proximal tubule after injury. Recently, the presence and participation of kidney [[stem cell]]s in the tubular regeneration has been shown. However, the concept of kidney stem cells is currently emerging. In addition to the surviving tubular epithelial cells and kidney stem cells, the bone marrow stem cells have also been shown to participate in regeneration of the proximal tubule, however, the mechanisms remain controversial. Recently, studies examining the capacity of bone marrow stem cells to differentiate into renal cells are emerging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kurinji | year = 2009 | title = In Vitro Differentiation of MSC into Cells with a Renal Tubular Epithelial-Like Phenotype | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a913452182~db=all~jumptype=rss | journal = Renal Failure | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 492–502 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1080/08860220902928981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other organs, the kidney is also known to regenerate completely in lower vertebrates such as fish. Some of the known fish that show remarkable capacity of kidney regeneration are goldfish, skates, rays, and sharks. In these fish, the entire nephron regenerates following injury or partial removal of the kidney.

===Liver===
The human [[liver]] is particularly known for its ability to regenerate, and is capable of doing so from only one quarter of its tissue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-04-17 |url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Liver-Regeneration-Unplugged-19988-1/ |title=Liver Regeneration Unplugged |date=2007-04-17 |publisher=Bio-Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; due chiefly to the [[cell potency|unipotency]] of [[hepatocyte]]s.&lt;ref name=AAAAM_Michael_2007&gt;{{cite journal |accessdate=October 24, 2008 |url=http://eesystem.com/docs/AAAAM%202007%20long%20biography%20abstr_.pdf |format=PDF |title=Bio-Scalar Technology: Regeneration and Optimization of the Body-Mind Homeostasis |author=Michael, Sandra Rose |page=2 |journal=15th Annual AAAAM Conference |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120002706/http://eesystem.com/docs/AAAAM%202007%20long%20biography%20abstr_.pdf |archivedate=November 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Resection of liver can induce the proliferation of the remaining hepatocytes until the lost mass is restored, where the intensity of the liver’s response is directly proportional to the mass resected.

Maingot's Text book of Abdominal operations 1997.ASAIO journal 2003, IJEB 2002, Text book of Obst. Gynaec 2010). Complex Genito Urinary Rectal fistula treated successfully by using regenerative techniques, Ind J Urol 1995.

There are now several human tissues that have been successfully or partially induced to regenerate. Many of these examples fall under the topic of [[regenerative medicine]], which includes the methods and research conducted with the aim of regenerating the organs and tissues of humans as a result of injury. The major strategies of regenerative medicine include dedifferentiating injury site cells, transplanting stem cells, implanting lab-grown tissues and organs, and implanting bioartificial tissues.

===Bladder===
In 1999 the bladder was the first regenerated organ to be given to seven patients; as of 2014, these regenerated bladders are still functioning inside the beneficiaries.&lt;ref name=regen2014104&gt;{{cite web | last =Mohammadi | first = Dara| title = Bioengineered organs: The story so far… | publisher = theguardian.com | date = 4 October 2014 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/04/penis-transplants-anthony-atala-interview| accessdate = 9 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart===
[[Cardiovascular disease]]s are the leading cause of death worldwide, and have increased proportionally from 25.8% of global deaths in 1990, to 31.5% of deaths in 2013.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; This is true in all areas of the world except Africa.&lt;ref name=WHO2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mendis|first1=Shanthi|last2=Puska,|first2=Pekka|last3=Norrving|first3=Bo|title=Global atlas on cardiovascular disease prevention and control|date=2011|publisher=World Health Organization in collaboration with the World Heart Federation and the World Stroke Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9789241564373|pages=3–18|edition=1st|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241564373_eng.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition, during a typical [[myocardial infarction]] or heart attack, an estimated one billion cardiac cells are lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Laflamme|first1=MA|last2=Murry|first2=CE|title=Regenerating the heart|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=23|issue=7|pages=845–56|date=July 2005|pmid=16003373|doi=10.1038/nbt1117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The scarring that results is then responsible for greatly increasing the risk of life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms or [[cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmias]]. Therefore, the ability to naturally regenerate the heart would have an enormous impact of modern healthcare. However, while several animals can regenerate heart damage (e.g. the [[axolotl]]), mammalian [[cardiac muscle cell|cardiomyocytes]] (heart muscle cells) cannot proliferate (multiply) and heart damage causes scarring and [[fibrosis]].

Despite the earlier belief that human cardiomyocytes are not generated later in life, a recent study has found that this is not the case. This study took advantage of the nuclear bomb testing during the [[Cold War]], which introduced carbon-14 into the atmosphere and therefore into the cells of nearby inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Bergmann2009"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Bergmann O, etal | title=Evidence for Cariomyocyte Renewal in Humans |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=324 | year=2009 | pages=98–102| doi=10.1126/science.1164680 | pmid=19342590 | pmc=2991140}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  They extracted DNA from the myocardium of these research subjects and found that cardiomyocytes do in fact renew at a slowing rate of 1% per year from the age of 25, to 0.45% per year at the age of 75.&lt;ref name="Bergmann2009" /&gt;  This amounts to less than half of the original cardiomyocytes being replaced during the average lifespan. However, serious doubts have been placed on the validity of this research, including the appropriateness of the samples as representative of normally aging hearts.&lt;ref name="Kajstura2012"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Kajstura J, etal | title=Response to Bergmann et al: Carbon 14 Birth Dating of Human Cardiomyocytes | journal=[[Circulation Research]] | volume=110 | year=2012 | pages=e19-e21| doi=10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.259721| pmc=4159170}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless, further research has been conducted that supports the potential for human cardiac regeneration. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase was found to induce mitosis in adult mammalian cardiomyocytes.&lt;ref&gt;http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/19/10/1175.full&lt;/ref&gt;  While treatment with FGF1 and [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38 MAP kinase]] inhibitors was found to regenerate the heart, reduce scarring, and improve cardiac function in rats with cardiac injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=October 2006 |volume=103 |issue=42 |pmid=17032753 |title=FGF1/p38 MAP kinase inhibitor therapy induces cardiomyocyte mitosis, reduces scarring, and rescues function after myocardial infarction|pmc=1622860 |author=Felix B. Engel, Patrick C. H. Hsieh, Richard T. Lee, Mark T. Keating |doi=10.1073/pnas.0607382103 |pages=15546–15551 |bibcode=2006PNAS..10315546E |last2=Hsieh |last3=Lee |last4=Keating}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most promising sources of heart regeneration is the use of stem cells. It was demonstrated in mice that there is a resident population of stem cells or cardiac progenitors in the adult heart – this population of stem cells was shown to be reprogrammed to differentiate into cardiomyocytes that replaced those lost during a heart tissue death.&lt;ref name="Smart2011"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Smart N, etal | title=De novo cardiomyocytes from within the activated dult heart after injury | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=474 | year=2011 | pages=640–644| doi=10.1038/nature10188 | pmid=21654746 | pmc=3696525}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In humans specifically, a “cardiac mesenchymal feeder layer” was found in the myocardium that renewed the cells with progenitors that differentiated into mature cardiac cells.&lt;ref name="Laugwitz2005"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Laugwitz KL, etal | title=Postnatal isl1+carioblasts enter fully differentiated cardiomyocyte lineages | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=433 | year=2005 | pages=647–653| doi=10.1038/nature03215 | pmid=15703750}}
&lt;/ref&gt; What these studies show is that the human heart contains stem cells that could potentially be induced into regenerating the heart when needed, rather than just being used to replace expended cells.

Loss of the myocardium due to disease often leads to heart failure; therefore, it would be useful to be able to take cells from elsewhere in the heart to replenish those lost. This was achieved in 2010 when mature cardiac [[fibroblasts]] were reprogrammed directly into cardiomyocyte-like cells. This was done using three [[transcription factors]]: [[GATA4]], [[Mef2c]], and [[TBX5 (gene)|Tbx5]].&lt;ref name="Ieda2010"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Ieda M, etal | title=Direct Reprogramming of Fibroblasts into Functional Cardiomyocytes by Defined Factors | journal=[[Cell (journal)|Cell]] | volume=142 | year=2010 | pages=375–386| doi=10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.002 | pmid=20691899 | pmc=2919844}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Cardiac fibroblasts make up more than half of all heart cells and are usually not able to conduct contractions (are not cardiogenic), but those reprogrammed were able to contract spontaneously.&lt;ref name="Ieda2010" /&gt; The significance is that fibroblasts from the damaged heart or from elsewhere, may be a source of functional cardiomyocytes for regeneration.

Simply injecting functioning cardiac cells into a damaged heart is only partially effective. In order to achieve more reliable results, structures composed of the cells need to be produced and then transplanted. Masumoto and his team designed a method of producing sheets of cardiomyocytes and vascular cells from human [[induced pluripotent stem cell|iPSCs]]. These sheets were then transplanted onto infarcted hearts of rats, leading to significantly improved cardiac function.&lt;ref name="Masumoto2014"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Masumoto H, etal | title=Humans iPS cell-engineered cardiac tissue sheets with cardiomyocytes and vascular cells for cardiac regeneration | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6714 | year=2014 | doi=10.1038/srep06716 | pages=6716}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These sheets were still found to be present four weeks later.&lt;ref name="Masumoto2014" /&gt; Research has also been conducted into the engineering of heart valves.  Tissue-engineered heart valves derived from human cells have been created in vitro and transplanted into a non-human primate model. These showed a promising amount of cellular repopulation even after eight weeks, and succeeded in outperforming currently used artificial valves.&lt;ref name="Weber2013"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lung===

[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) is one of the most widespread health threats today. It affects 329 million people worldwide, which makes up nearly 5% of the global population. Having killed over 3 million people in 2012, COPD was the third greatest cause of death.&lt;ref name="WHOTTCD"&gt;{{cite web |title=The 10 leading causes of death in the world, 2000 and 2011 |date=July 2013 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/ |accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worse still is that due to increasing smoking rates and the aging populations in many countries, the number of deaths as a result of COPD and other chronic [[lung]] diseases is predicted to continue increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathers CD, Loncar D |title=Projections of Global Mortality and Burden of Disease from 2002 to 2030 |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=e442 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17132052 |pmc=1664601 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030442 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, developments in the lung’s capacity for regeneration is in high demand.

It has been shown that bone marrow-derived cells could be the source of progenitor cells of multiple cell lineages, and a 2004 study suggested that one of these cell types was involved in lung regeneration.&lt;ref name="Ishizawa2004"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Ishizawa K, etal | title=Bone marrow-derived cells contribute to lung regeneration after elastase-induced pulmonary emphysemal | journal=[[FEBS]] | volume=556 | year=2004 | pages=249–252 | doi=10.1016/s0014-5793(03)01399-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a potential source of cells for lung regeneration has been found; however, due to advances in inducing stem cells and directing their differentiation, major progress in lung regeneration has consistently featured the use of patient-derived iPSCs and bioscaffolds.
The [[extracellular matrix]] is the key to generating entire organs in vitro. It was found that by carefully removing the cells of an entire lung, a “footprint” is left behind that can guide cellular adhesion and differentiation if a population of lung epithelial cells and [[chondrocytes]] are added.&lt;ref name="Balestrini2015"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Balestrini JL, etal | title=Extracellular Matrix as a Driver for Lung Regeneration | journal=Annals of Biomedical Engineering | volume=43 | year=2015 | pages=568–576 | doi=10.1007/s10439-014-1167-5| pmc=4380778 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This has serious applications in regenerative medicine, particularly as a 2012 study successfully purified a population of lung progenitor cells that were derived from embryonic stem cells. These can then be used to re-cellularise a three-dimensional lung tissue scaffold.&lt;ref name="Longmire2012"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Longmire TA, etal | title=Efficient Derivation of Purified Lung and Thyroid Progenitors from Embryonic Stem Cells | journal=[[Cell Stem Cell]] | volume=10 | year=2012 |  pages=398–411 | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2012.01.019}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, in 2008, there was a successful clinical transplantation of a tissue-engineered [[trachea]] in a 30-year-old woman with end-stage [[bronchomalacia]]. An ECM scaffold was created by removing the cells and [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] antigens from a human donated trachea, which was then colonised by epithelial cells and mesenchymal stem cell-derived chondrocytes cultured from cells of the recipient.&lt;ref name="Macchiarini2008"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Macchiarini P, etal | title=Clinical transplantation of a tissue-engineered airway | journal=[[The Lancet]] | volume=372 | year=2008 |  pages=2023–2030 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61598-6 | pmid=19022496}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The graft replaced her left main bronchus, immediately providing a functional airway, and retained its normal appearance and mechanical function after four months.&lt;ref name="Macchiarini2008" /&gt;  Because the graft was generated from cells cultured from the recipient, no anti-donor antibodies or [[immunosuppressive drug]]s were needed – a huge step towards personalised lung regeneration.

A 2010 investigation took this one step further by using the ECM scaffold to produce entire lungs in vitro to be transplanted into living rats.&lt;ref name="Petersen2010"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Petersen TH, etal | title=Tissue-Engineered Lungs for in Vivo Implantation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=329 | year=2010 |  pages=538–541 |doi= 10.1126/science.1189345|pmc=3640463 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; These successfully enabled [[gas exchange]] but for short time intervals only.&lt;ref name="Petersen2010" /&gt; Nevertheless, this was a huge leap towards whole lung regeneration and transplants for humans, which has already taken another step forward with the lung regeneration of a non-human primate.&lt;ref name="Bonvillain2012"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Bonvillain RW, etal | title=A Nonhuman Primate Model of Lung Regeneration: Detergent-Mediated Decellurization and Initial In Vitro Recellularization with Mesenchymal Stem Cells | journal=Tissue Engineering Part A | volume=18 | year=2012 |  pages=23–24 |doi=10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0594 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cystic fibrosis]] is another disease of the lungs, which is highly fatal and genetically linked to a mutation in the [[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR gene]]. Through growing patient-specific lung epithelium in vitro, lung tissue expressing the cystic fibrosis phenotype has been achieved.&lt;ref name="Wong2012"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Wong AP, etal | title=Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into mature airway epithelia expressing functional CFTR protein| journal=[[Nature Biotechnology]] | volume=30 | year=2012 |  pages=876–882 | doi=10.1038/nbt.2328}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This is so that modelling and drug testing of the disease pathology can be carried out with the hope of regenerative medical applications.

===Penis===
The penis has been successfully regenerated in the lab.&lt;ref name=regen2014104/&gt; The penis is a harder organ to regenerate than skin, the bladder and vagina, due to the structural complexity.&lt;ref name=regen2014104/&gt;

===Spinal nerves===
A goal of [[spinal cord injury research]] is to promote [[neuroregeneration]], reconnection of damaged neural circuits.&lt;ref name="Kabu15"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kabu, S.; Gao, Y.; Kwon, B.K.; Labhasetwar, V. |title=Drug delivery, cell-based therapies, and tissue engineering approaches for spinal cord injury |journal=Journal of Controlled Release |volume=219 |issue= |pages=141–54 |year=2015 |pmid=26343846 |doi=10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.08.060 |pmc=4656085}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nerves in the spine are a tissue that requires a stem cell population to regenerate. In 2012 a Polish fireman [[Darek Fidyka]], with [[Paraplegia#Regeneration of the spinal cord|paraplegia]] of the spinal cord, underwent a procedure, which involved extracting [[olfactory ensheathing cell]]s (OECs) from Fidyka's [[olfactory bulb]]s, and injecting these stem cells, in vivo, into the site of the previous injury. Fidyka eventually gained feeling, movement and sensation in his limbs, especially on the side where the stem cells were injected; he also reported gaining sexual function. Fidyka can now drive and can now walk some distance aided by a frame. He is believed to be the first person in the world to recover sensory function from a complete severing of the spinal nerves.&lt;ref name=SpinalReg2014-10-21&gt;{{cite web | last = Quinn | first = Ben | title = Paralysed man Darek Fidyka walks again after pioneering surgery | quote = The 38-year-old, who is believed to be the first person in the world to recover from complete severing of the spinal nerves, can now walk with a frame and has been able to resume an independent life, even to the extent of driving a car, while sensation has returned to his lower limbs. | publisher = theguardian.com | date = 21 October 2014 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/oct/21/paralysed-darek-fidyka-pioneering-surgery| accessdate = 26 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SpinalReg2014-10-21-2&gt;{{cite web | last = Walsh | first = Fergus| title = Paralysed man walks again after cell transplant| publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 21 October 2014 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-29645760| accessdate = 26 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thymus===
Researchers, from University of Edinburgh, have succeeded in regenerating a living organ. Regenerated organ is closely resembled with juvenile [[thymus]] in terms of architecture and gene expression profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blackburn |first=CC |title=Regeneration of the aged thymus by a single transcription factor |journal=Development|date=April 2014 |volume=141 |pages=1627–1637 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/141/8/1627.full |doi=10.1242/dev.103614 |pmid=24715454 |pmc=3978836}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thymus gland is one of the first organs to degenerate in normal healthy individuals.

===Vagina===
Between the years 2005 and 2008 four women with [[vaginal hypoplasia]] due to [[Müllerian agenesis]] were given regenerated vaginas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/11/vagina-grown-lab-implant-girls-disorder&lt;/ref&gt;  Up to eight years after the transplants all organs have normal function and structure.&lt;ref name=regen2014104/&gt;

'''Restoration ecology''' is the scientific study supporting the practice of '''ecological restoration''', which is the practice of renewing and restoring [[environmental degradation|degraded]], damaged, or destroyed [[ecosystem]]s and [[habitat]]s in the [[Natural environment|environment]] by active human intervention and action.

==Definition==

Restoration ecology is the academic study of the process, whereas ecological restoration is the actual project or process by restoration practitioners. The Society for Ecological Restoration defines "ecological restoration" as an "intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Society for Ecological Restoration International Science &amp; Policy Working Group|first=|date=2004|title=The SER International Primer on Ecological Restoration|url=http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.ser.org/resource/resmgr/custompages/publications/ser_publications/ser_primer.pdf|journal=www.ser.org &amp; Tucson: Society for Ecological Restoration International|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological restoration includes a wide scope of projects including [[erosion]] control, [[reforestation]], removal of [[non-native species]] and weeds, [[revegetation]] of disturbed areas, [[daylighting (streams)|daylighting streams]], reintroduction of [[native species]] (preferably native species that have [[local adaptation]]), and habitat and range improvement for targeted species.

[[E. O. Wilson]], a biologist, states, "Here is the means to end the great extinction spasm. The next century will, I believe, be the era of restoration in ecology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/691398594|title=The diversity of life|last=O.|first=Wilson, Edward|date=2010, ©1992|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674058170|edition=  1st Harvard University Press paperback |location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=691398594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of restoration ecology==
'''Restoration ecology''' emerged as a separate field in [[ecology]] in the late twentieth century. "Restoration ecology" was not first formally identified as a distinct scientific field until the late twentieth century. The term was coined by [[John Aber]] and [[Bill Jordan (environmental critic)|William Jordan III]] when they were at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]].&lt;ref name="jordan2011"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/750183084|title=Making nature whole : a history of ecological restoration|last=Jordan, III|first=W. R.|date=2011|publisher=Island Press|isbn=9781610910422|location=Washington, DC|oclc=750183084}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[indigenous peoples]], land managers, stewards, and laypeople have been practicing ecological restoration or ecological management for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="anderson2005"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56103978|title=Tending the wild: Native American knowledge and the management of California's natural resources|last=Anderson|first=K.|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520238567|location=Berkeley|oclc=56103978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered the birthplace of modern ecological restoration, the first tallgrass prairie restoration was the 1936 Curtis Prairie at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum]].&lt;ref name="court2012"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/814694131|title=Pioneers of ecological restoration : the people and legacy of the University of Wisconsin Arboretum|last=Court|first=F.

Greene]], and plant ecologist [[John Thomas Curtis|John T. Curtis]]. Curtis and his graduate students surveyed the whole of Wisconsin, documenting native species communities and creating the first species lists for tallgrass restorations.&lt;ref name="curtis1971"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811410421|title=The vegetation of Wisconsin : an ordination of plant communities|last=Curtis|first=J. T.|date=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299019433|location=Madison|oclc=811410421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing prairie remnants, such as locations within pioneer [[cemeteries]] and railroad rights-of-way, were located and inventoried by Curtis and his team. The UW Arboretum was the center of tallgrass prairie research through the first half of the 20th century, with the development of the nearby Greene Prairie, [[Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm]], and pioneering techniques like [[Controlled burn|prescribed burning]].&lt;ref name="court2012"/&gt;

The latter-half of the 20th century saw the growth of ecological restoration beyond Wisconsin borders. The 285-hectare Green Oaks Biological Field Station at [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]] began in 1955 under the guidance of zoologist Paul Shepard. It was followed by the 40-hectare Schulenberg Prairie at the [[Morton Arboretum]], started in 1962 by Ray Schulenberg and Bob Betz. Betz then worked with [[The Nature Conservancy]] to establish the 260-hectare [[Fermilab|Fermi National Laboratory]] tallgrass prairie in 1974.&lt;ref name="fermi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fermilab History &amp; Archives Project: Natural History - Prairie |url=https://history.fnal.gov/prairie.html |website=fnal.gov |publisher=Fermilab |accessdate=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These major tallgrass restoration projects marked the growth of ecological restoration from isolated studies to widespread practice.

Australia has also been the site of historically significant ecological restoration projects. In 1935 Ambrose Crawford commenced restoring a degraded four acres (1.7 hectares) patch of the Big Scrub (Lowland Tropical Rainforest) at Lumley Park reserve, Alstonville, in northern New South Wales. Clearing of weeds and planting of suitable indigenous flora species were his main restoration techniques. The restored rainforest reserve still exists today and is home to threatened plant and animal species. In 1936 [[Albert Morris]] and his restoration colleagues initiated the Broken Hill regeneration area project, which involved the natural regeneration of indigenous flora on a severely degraded site of hundreds of hectares in arid western New South Wales. Completed in 1958, the successful project still maintains ecological function today as the ''Broken Hill regeneration area''.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, William R. &amp; Lubick, George M.

== Theoretical foundations of restoration ecology ==

Restoration ecology draws on a wide range of ecological concepts.

=== Disturbance ===

[[Disturbance (ecology)|Disturbance]] is a change in environmental conditions that disrupts the functioning of an ecosystem. Disturbance can occur at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and is a natural component of many communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/173134455|title=Assembly rules and restoration ecology : bridging the gap between theory and practice|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Island Press|others=Temperton, Vicky M.|year=|isbn=9781429495134|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=|chapter=Chapter 17: Disturbance, Succession, and Community Assembly in Terrestrial Plant Communities|oclc=173134455}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many forest and grassland restorations implement [[fire ecology|fire as a natural disturbance regime]]. However the severity and scope of anthropogenic impact has grown in the last few centuries. Differentiating between human-caused and naturally occurring disturbances is important if we are  to understand how to restore natural processes and minimize [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] impacts on the ecosystems.

=== Succession ===

[[Ecological succession]] is the process by which a community changes over time, especially following a disturbance. In many instances, an ecosystem will change from a simple level of organization with  a few dominant [[pioneer species]] to an increasingly complex community with many interdependent species. Restoration often consists of initiating, assisting, or accelerating ecological successional processes, depending on the severity of the disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21376331|title=Directing ecological succession|last=1955-|first=Luken, James O.,|date=1990|publisher=Chapman and Hall|isbn=0412344505|edition= 1st |location=London|oclc=21376331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following mild to moderate natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbances, restoration in these systems involves hastening natural successional trajectories. However, in a system that has experienced a more severe disturbance (i.e. physical or chemical alteration of the environment), restoration may require intensive efforts to recreate environmental conditions that favor natural successional processes.

=== Fragmentation ===

[[Habitat fragmentation]] describes spatial discontinuities in a biological system, where ecosystems are broken up into smaller parts through land use changes (e.g. [[agriculture]]) and natural disturbance. This both reduces the size of the populations and increases the degree of isolation. These smaller and isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction. Fragmenting ecosystems decreases quality of the habitat. The [[Edge effects|edge of a fragment]] has a different range of environmental conditions and therefore supports different species than the interior. Restorative projects can increase the effective size of a population by adding suitable habitat and decrease isolation by creating [[wildlife corridor|habitat corridor]]s that link isolated fragments. Reversing the effects of fragmentation is an important component of restoration ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Targeted habitat restoration can reduced extinction rates in fragrmented forests|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/36/9635.abstract|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecosystem function ===
Ecosystem function describes the most basic and essential foundational processes of any natural systems, including [[nutrient cycle]]s and [[Energy flow (ecology)|energy flux]]es. An understanding of the complexity of these ecosystem functions is necessary to address any ecological processes that may be degraded. Ecosystem functions are [[emergent properties]] of the [[Systems theory|system as a whole]], thus monitoring and [[Natural resource management|management]] are crucial for the long-term stability of ecosystems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}A fully functional ecosystem that is completely self-perpetuating is the ultimate goal of restorative efforts.

=== Community assembly ===

Community assembly "is a framework that can unify virtually all of (community) ecology under a single conceptual umbrella".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/894509632|title=Urban ecology : an introduction|last=1936-|first=Douglas, Ian,|others=James, Philip (Professor of ecology),|isbn=9781136266966|location=New York, NY|oclc=894509632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community assembly theory attempts to explain the existence of environmentally similar sites with differing assemblages of species. It assumes that species have similar [[ecological niche|niche]] requirements, so that community formation is a product of random fluctuations from a common [[species pool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Truman P.|last2=Chase|first2=Jonathan M.|last3=Huddleston|first3=Russell T.|date=2001|title=Community Succession and Assembly: Comparing, Contrasting and Combining Paradigms in the Context of Ecological Restoration|jstor=43440887|journal=Ecological Restoration|volume=19|issue=1|pages=5–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, if all species are fairly ecologically equivalent, then random variation in colonization, and migration and extinction rates between species, drive differences in species composition between sites with comparable environmental conditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Population genetics ===
Genetic diversity has shown to be as important as species diversity for restoring ecosystem processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=A. Randall|last2=Inouye|first2=Brian D.|last3=Johnson|first3=Marc T. J.|last4=Underwood|first4=Nora|last5=Vellend|first5=Mark|date=2008-04-08|title=Ecological consequences of genetic diversity|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01179.x|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=11|issue=6|pages=609–623|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01179.x|issn=1461-023X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence ecological restorations are increasingly factoring genetic processes into management practices.  Population genetic processes that are important to consider in restored populations include [[founder effect]]s, [[inbreeding depression]], [[outbreeding depression]], [[genetic drift]], and [[gene flow]]. Such processes can predict whether or not a species successfully establishes at a restoration site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montalvo|first=Arlee M.|last2=Rice|first2=Susan L.

== Applications of restoration ecology ==

=== Soil heterogeneity effects on community heterogeneity ===

Spatial heterogeneity of resources can influence plant community composition, diversity, and assembly trajectory. Baer et al. (2005) manipulated [[soil]] resource heterogeneity in a tallgrass [[prairie restoration]] project. They found increasing resource heterogeneity, which on its own was insufficient to insure [[species diversity]] in situations where one species may dominate across the range of resource levels. Their findings were consistent with the theory regarding the role of ecological filters on community assembly. The establishment of a single species, [[adaptation|best adapted]] to the physical and biological conditions can play an inordinately important role in determining the community structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baer|first=Sara G.|last2=Collins|first2=Scott L|last3=Blair|first3=John M.|last4=Knapp|first4=Alan K.|last5=Fiedler|first5=Anna K.|date=2005-06|title=Soil Heterogeneity Effects on Tallgrass Prairie Community Heterogeneity: An Application of Ecological Theory to Restoration Ecology|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00051.x|journal=Restoration Ecology|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=413–424|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2005.00051.x|issn=1061-2971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Invasion and restoration ===

Restoration is used as a tool for reducing the spread of invasive plant species in a number of ways. The first method views restoration primarily as a means to reduce the presence of invasive species and limit their spread.  As this approach emphasizes control of invaders, the restoration techniques can differ from typical restoration projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epanchin-Niell|first=Rebecca|last2=Englin|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Nalle|first3=Darek|date=November 2009|title=Investing in rangeland restoration in the Arid West, USA: Countering the effects of an invasive weed on the long-term fire cycle|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479709003004|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|volume=91|issue=2|pages=370–379|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2009.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Török|first=Péter|last2=Miglécz|first2=Tamás|last3=Valkó|first3=Orsolya|last4=Kelemen|first4=András|last5=Deák|first5=Balázs|last6=Lengyel|first6=Szabolcs|last7=Tóthmérész|first7=Béla|date=January 2012|title=Recovery of native grass biodiversity by sowing on former croplands: Is weed suppression a feasible goal for grassland restoration?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S161713811100046X|journal=Journal for Nature Conservation|volume=20|issue=1|pages=41–48|doi=10.1016/j.jnc.2011.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of such projects is not necessarily to restore an entire ecosystem or habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_p008/rmrs_p008_001_016.pdf|title=Selecting Plant Species for Ecological Restoration: a Perspective for Land Managers|last=Brown|first=Ray|last2=Amacher|first2=Michael|date=1999|website=USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505022949/https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_p008/rmrs_p008_001_016.pdf|archive-date=2017-05-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects frequently use lower diversity mixes of aggressive native species seeded at high density.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Rob G.|last2=Orloff|first2=Steve B.|last3=Lancaster|first3=Donald L.|last4=Kirby|first4=Donald W.|last5=Carlson|first5=Harry L.|date=2010|title=Integrating Herbicide Use and Perennial Grass Revegetation to Suppress Weeds in Noncrop Areas|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/invasive-plant-science-and-management/article/integrating-herbicide-use-and-perennial-grass-revegetation-to-suppress-weeds-in-noncrop-areas/31659B7952971D35546D9EE56DE9DC5B|journal=Invasive Plant Science and Management|volume=3|issue=1|pages=81–92|doi=10.1614/ipsm-09-008.1|issn=1939-7291|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not always actively managed following seeding.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kettenring|first=Karin M.|last2=Adams|first2=Carrie Reinhardt|date=2011-08-01|title=Lessons learned from invasive plant control experiments: a systematic review and meta-analysis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01979.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|volume=48|issue=4|pages=970–979|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01979.x|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target areas for this type of restoration are those which are heavily dominated by invasive species. The goals are to first remove the species and then in so doing, reduce the number of invasive seeds being spread to surrounding areas. This approach has been shown to be effective in reducing weeds, although it is not always a sustainable solution long term without additional weed control, such as mowing, or re-seeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dana|first=Blumenthal,|last2=Nicholas|first2=Jordan,|last3=Elizabeth|first3=Svenson,|date=2003-03-06|title=Weed Control as a Rationale for Restoration: The Example of Tallgrass Prairie|url=http://www.consecol.org/vol7/iss1/art6/|journal=Conservation Ecology|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.5751/ES-00480-070106|issn=1195-5449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=Dana M.|last2=Jordan|first2=Nicholas R.|last3=Svenson|first3=Elizabeth L.|date=2005-05-20|title=Effects of prairie restoration on weed invasions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880904003603|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=107|issue=2–3|pages=221–230|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2004.11.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restoration projects are also used as a way to better understand what makes an ecological community resistant to invasion. As restoration projects have a broad range of implementation strategies and methods used to control invasive species, they can be used by ecologists to test theories about invasion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Restoration projects have been used to understand how the diversity of the species introduced in the restoration affects invasion.

=== Successional trajectories ===

Progress along a desired successional pathway may be difficult if multiple stable states exist. Looking over 40 years of wetland restoration data, Klötzli and Gootjans (2001) argue that unexpected and undesired vegetation assemblies "may indicate that environmental conditions are not suitable for target communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klotzli|first=Frank|last2=Grootjans|first2=Ab P.|date=2001-06|title=Restoration of Natural and Semi-Natural Wetland Systems in Central Europe: Progress and Predictability of Developments|url=https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009002209.x|journal=Restoration Ecology|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=209–219|doi=10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009002209.x|issn=1061-2971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Succession may move in unpredicted directions, but constricting environmental conditions within a narrow range may rein in the possible successional trajectories and increase the likelihood of a desired outcome.

=== Sourcing material for restoration ===
For most restoration projects it is generally recommend to source material from local populations, to increase chance of restoration success and minimize the effects of [[maladaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breed|first=Martin F.|last2=Stead|first2=Michael G.|last3=Ottewell|first3=Kym M.|last4=Gardner|first4=Michael G.|last5=Lowe|first5=Andrew J.|date=2013-02-01|title=Which provenance and where?

For example, sourcing for ''Castilleja levisecta'' found that farther source populations that matched similar environmental variables were better suited for the restoration project than closer source populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Beth A.|last2=Kaye|first2=Thomas N.|date=2011-03-01|title=Reintroduction of Castilleja levisecta: Effects of Ecological Similarity, Source Population Genetics, and Habitat Quality|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2009.00549.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=19|issue=2|pages=166–176|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2009.00549.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of ecological restoration==
[[File:Regenerated habitat for superb parrot on the abandoned Boroowa railway line.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Ecosystem restoration for the [[superb parrot]] on an abandoned railway line in Australia]]

===Rationale===
There are many reasons to restore ecosystems.  Some include:

*Restoring [[natural capital]] such as drinkable water or wildlife populations 
*Mitigating [[climate change]] (e.g. through [[carbon sequestration]])
*Helping threatened or [[endangered species]]&lt;ref&gt;Silva, S., Lowry, M., Macaya-Solis, C., Byatt, B., &amp; Lucas, M. C. (2017). Can navigation locks be used to help migratory fishes with poor swimming performance pass tidal barrages? A test with lampreys. Ecological engineering, 102, 291-302&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aesthetic reasons &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris JA, Hobbs RJ, Higgs ES, and Aronson JA.|first=|year=2006|title=Ecological restoration and climate change|url=|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=14|pages=170–76.|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2006.00136.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Moral reasons: Human intervention has unnaturally destroyed many habitats, and there exists an innate obligation to restore these destroyed habitats

[[File:Restoration in action at Buffelsdraai.jpg|250px|right|thumb|alt=Buffelsdraai Community Reforestation Project.|Forest restoration in action at the [[Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project]] in South Africa]]

There exist considerable differences of opinion in how to set restoration goals and how to define their success among conservation groups. Some urge active restoration (e.g. eradicating invasive animals to allow the native ones to survive) and others who believe that protected areas should have the bare minimum of human interference, such as [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]]. Ecosystem restoration has generated controversy. Skeptics doubt that the benefits justify the economic investment or who point to failed restoration projects and question the feasibility of restoration altogether. It can be difficult to set restoration goals, in part because, as Anthony Bradshaw claims, "ecosystems are not static, but in a state of dynamic equilibrium…. [with restoration] we aim [for a] moving target."

Some conservationists argue that, though an ecosystem may not be returned to its original state, the functions of the ecosystem (especially ones that provide services to us) may be more valuable than its current configuration (Bradshaw 1987).  One reason to consider ecosystem restoration is to mitigate climate change through activities such as afforestation. [[Afforestation]] involves replanting forests, which remove carbon dioxide from the air. [[Carbon dioxide]] is a leading cause of [[global warming]] (Speth, 2005) and capturing it would help alleviate climate change. Another example of a common driver of restoration projects in the United States is the legal framework of the Clean Water Act, which often requires mitigation for damage inflicted on aquatic systems by development or other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/cwa-404/compensatory-mitigation-methods|title=Compensatory Mitigation Methods|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological restoration challenges ==
Some view ecosystem restoration as impractical, partially because restorations often fall short of their goals.  Hilderbrand et al. point out that many times uncertainty (about ecosystem functions, species relationships, and such) is not addressed, and that the time-scales set out for 'complete' restoration are unreasonably short, while other critical markers for full-scale restoration are either ignored or abridged due to feasibility concerns.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Hilderbrand, R. H., A. C. Watts, and A. M. Randle 2005. The myths of restoration ecology. Ecology and Society 10(1): 19. [online] URL: http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol10/iss1/art19/&lt;/ref&gt;  In other instances an ecosystem may be so degraded that abandonment (allowing a severely degraded ecosystem to recover on its own) may be the wisest option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HOLL|first=KAREN D.|last2=HAYES|first2=GREY F.|date=2006-02-27|title=Challenges to Introducing and Managing Disturbance Regimes for Holocarpha macradenia, an Endangered Annual Grassland Forb|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00416.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1121–1131|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00416.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Local communities sometimes object to restorations that include the introduction of large predators or plants that require [[disturbance regimes]] such as regular fires, citing threat to human habitation in the area.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macdonald|first=David|date=2002|title=The ecological context: a species population perspective|url=|journal=Handbook of ecological restoration|volume=1|pages=47–65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  High economic costs can also be perceived as a negative impact of the restoration process.

Public opinion is very important in the feasibility of a restoration; if the public believes that the costs of restoration outweigh the benefits they will not support it.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Many failures have occurred in past restoration projects, many times because clear goals were not set out as the aim of the restoration, or an incomplete understanding of the underlying ecological framework lead to insufficient measures. This may be because, as Peter Alpert says, "people may not [always] know how to manage natural systems effectively".&lt;ref&gt;Alpert, P. 2002. Managing the wild: should stewards be pilots? Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 9(2): 494-499.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, many assumptions are made about myths of restoration such as [[carbon copy]], where a restoration plan, which worked in one area, is applied to another with the same results expected, but not realized.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Science-practice gap ===
One of the struggles for both fields is a divide between restoration ecology and ecological restoration in practice. Currently, many restoration practitioners as well as scientists feel that science is not being adequately incorporated into ecological restoration projects.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dickens|first=Sara Jo M.|last2=Suding|first2=Katharine N.|date=2013-06-01|title=Spanning the Science-Practice Divide: Why Restoration Scientists Need to be More Involved with Practice|url=http://er.uwpress.org/content/31/2/134|journal=Ecological Restoration|volume=31|issue=2|pages=134–140|doi=10.3368/er.31.2.134|issn=1522-4740}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabin|first=Robert J.|last2=Clewell|first2=Andre|last3=Ingram|first3=Mrill|last4=McDonald|first4=Tein|last5=Temperton|first5=Vicky|date=2010-11-01|title=Bridging Restoration Science and Practice: Results and Analysis of a Survey from the 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International Meeting|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00743.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=18|issue=6|pages=783–788|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2010.00743.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Erica|last2=Dixon|first2=Kingsley W.|last3=Menz|first3=Myles H.

There are a variety of theories about the cause of this gap. However, it has been well established that one of the main issues is that the questions studied by restoration ecologists are frequently not found useful or easily applicable by land managers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabin|first=Robert J.|date=2007-03-01|title=Science-Driven Restoration: A Square Grid on a Round Earth?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00183.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2006.00183.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, many publications in restoration ecology characterize the scope of a problem in depth, without providing concrete solutions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally many restoration ecology studies are carried out under controlled conditions and frequently at scales much smaller than actual restorations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Whether or not these patterns hold true in an applied context is often unknown. There is evidence that these small-scale experiments inflate type II error rates and differ from ecological patterns in actual restorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duc|first=M. G.

There is further complication in that restoration ecologists who want to collect large-scale data on restoration projects can face enormous hurdles in obtaining the data. Managers vary in how much data they collect, and how many records they keep. Some agencies keep only a handful of physical copies of data that make it difficult for the researcher to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernhardt|first=Emily S.|last2=Sudduth|first2=Elizabeth B.|last3=Palmer|first3=Margaret A.|last4=Allan|first4=J.

== Contrasting restoration ecology and conservation biology ==

Restoration ecology may be viewed as a sub-discipline of [[conservation biology]], the scientific study of how to protect and restore biodiversity. Ecological restoration is then a part of the resulting [[conservation movement]].

Both restoration ecologists and conservation biologists agree that protecting and restoring habitat is important for protecting biodiversity. However, [[conservation biology]] is primarily rooted in [[population biology]]. Because of that, it is generally organized at the [[Population genetics|population genetic]] level and assesses specific species populations (i.e. [[endangered species]]). Restoration ecology is organized at the [[Community (ecology)|community]] level, which focuses on broader groups within ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Truman P|date=2000-01|title=Restoration ecology and conservation biology|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320799000579|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=92|issue=1|pages=73–83|doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(99)00057-9|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, conservation biology often concentrates on [[vertebrate]] animals because of their salience and popularity, whereas restoration ecology concentrates on [[plant]]s. Restoration ecology focuses on plants because restoration projects typically begin by establishing plant communities. Ecological restoration, despite being focused on plants, may also have "poster species" for individual ecosystems and restoration projects.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, the [[Monarch butterfly]] is a poster species for conserving and restoring [[Asclepias|milkweed]] plant habitat, because Monarch butterflies require milkweed plants to reproduce. Finally, restoration ecology has a stronger focus on [[soil]]s, [[soil structure]], [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[microorganism]]s because soils provide the foundation of functional terrestrial ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Craig D|date=2002|title=Ecological restoration of southwestern Ponderosa pine ecosystems: A broad perspective|url=|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1418–1433|doi=10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1418:EROSPP]2.0.CO;2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=J.

==Natural Capital Committee's recommendation for a 25-year plan==
The UK [[Natural Capital Committee]] (NCC) made a recommendation in its second State of Natural Capital report published in March 2014 that in order to meet the Government's goal of being the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than it was inherited, a long-term 25-year plan was needed to maintain and improve England's natural capital.  The UK Government has not yet responded to this recommendation.

The Secretary of State for the UK's [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], [[Owen Paterson]], described his ambition for the natural environment and how the work of the Committee fits into this at an NCC event in November 2012:  "I do not, however, just want to maintain our natural assets; I want to improve them. I want us to derive the greatest possible benefit from them, while ensuring that they are available for generations to come. This is what the NCC's innovative work is geared towards".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/owen-paterson-s-speech-to-royal-society-on-natural-capital-committee|title=Owen Paterson’s speech to Royal Society on Natural Capital Committee|last=Paterson|first=Owen|date=27 November 2012|work=gov.uk|access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reverse engineering''', also called '''back engineering''', is the [[process (engineering)|process]] by which a man-made object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture, or to extract knowledge from the object; similar to [[scientific research]], the only difference being that scientific research is about a [[natural phenomenon]].&lt;ref name="Eilam"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Eilam, Eldad |title=Reversing: secrets of reverseengineering|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7645-7481-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

Reverse engineering is applicable in the fields of [[mechanical engineering]], [[electronic engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[chemical engineering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ken|first1=Thayer|title=How Does Reverse Engineering Work?|url=https://insights.globalspec.com/article/7367/how-does-reverse-engineering-work|website=globalspec|publisher=IEEE Global Spec|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alejandro|first1=F. Villaverde|last2=Julio R|first2=Banga|title=Reverse engineering and identification in systems biology: strategies, perspectives and challenges|journal=Journal of The Royal Society Interface|date=6 February 2014|volume=11|issue=91|doi=10.1098/rsif.2013.0505|pmc=3869153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are many reasons for performing reverse engineering in various fields. Reverse engineering has its origins in the analysis of hardware for commercial or military advantage.&lt;ref name="Chikofsky"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1109/52.43044 |first=E. J. |last=Chikofsky |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=J. H., II |last2=Cross |title=Reverse Engineering and Design Recovery: A Taxonomy |journal=IEEE Software |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=13–17 |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} However, the reverse engineering process in itself is not concerned with creating a copy or changing the artifact in some way; it is only an [[analysis]] in order to [[Deductive reasoning|deduce]] design features from products with little or no additional knowledge about the procedures involved in their original production.&lt;ref name="Chikofsky"/&gt;{{rp|15}} In some cases, the goal of the reverse engineering process can simply be a [[Documentation|redocumentation]] of [[legacy system]]s.&lt;ref name="Chikofsky"/&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;ref name="Nelson96"&gt;A Survey of Reverse Engineering and Program Comprehension. Michael L. Nelson, April 19, 1996, ODU CS 551&amp;nbsp;– Software Engineering Survey.{{ arxiv|cs/0503068v1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the product reverse engineered is that of a competitor, the goal may not be to copy them, but to perform [[competitor analysis]].&lt;ref name="RajaFernandes2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vinesh Raja|author2=Kiran J. Fernandes|title=Reverse Engineering: An Industrial Perspective|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-84628-856-2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverse engineering may also be used to create [[Interoperability|interoperable products]] and despite some narrowly tailored United States and European Union legislation, the legality of using specific reverse engineering techniques for this purpose has been hotly contested in courts worldwide for more than two decades.&lt;ref name="BandKatoh2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan Band|author2=Masanobu Katoh|title=Interfaces on Trial 2.0|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-29446-1|page=136, }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software reverse engineering can help to improve the understanding of the underlying source code for the maintenance and improvement of the software, relevant information can be extracted in order to make a decision for software development and graphical representations of the code can provide alternate views regarding the source code, which can help to detect and fix a software bug or vulnerability. Frequently, as some software develops, its design information and improvements are often lost over time, but this lost information can usually be recovered with reverse engineering. This process can also help to cut down the time required to understand the source code, reducing the overall cost of the software development.&lt;ref name="IEEE 1990"/&gt; Reverse engineering can also help to detect and eliminate a malicious code written to the software with better code detectors. Reversing a source code can be used to find alternate uses of the source code, such as to detect unauthorized replication of the source code where it wasn't intended to be used, or to reveal how a competitors product was built.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt; This process is commonly used for [[Software cracking|"cracking" software and media]] to remove their [[copy protection]],&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|7}} or to create a (possibly improved) [[Copying|copy]] or even a [[knockoff]], which is usually the goal of a competitor or a hacker.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|8}} [[Malware]] developers often use reverse engineering techniques to find vulnerabilities in an [[operating system]] (OS), in order build a [[computer virus]] that can exploit the system vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|5}} Reverse engineering is also being used in [[cryptanalysis]] in order to find vulnerabilities in [[substitution cipher]], [[symmetric-key algorithm]] or [[public-key cryptography]].&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

* '''Interfacing'''. Reverse engineering can be used when a system is required to interface to another system and how both systems would negotiate is to be established. Such requirements typically exist for [[interoperability]].
* '''Military or commercial [[espionage]]'''. Learning about an enemy’s or competitor’s latest research by stealing or capturing a prototype and dismantling it, which may result in development of similar product, or a better countermeasure against it.
* '''Obsolescence'''. [[Integrated circuit]]s are often designed on proprietary systems, and built on production lines which become obsolete in only a few years.  When systems using these parts can no longer be maintained (since the parts are no longer made), the only way to incorporate the functionality into new technology is to reverse engineer the existing chip and then [[Remake (computing)|redesign]] it using newer tools, using the understanding gained as a guide. Another obsolescence originated problem which can be solved by reverse engineering is the need to support (maintenance and supply for continuous operation) existing, legacy devices which are no longer supported by their [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM). This problem is particularly critical in military operations.
* '''Product security analysis'''. To examine how a product works, what are specifications of its components, estimate costs and identify potential [[patent infringement]]. Acquiring sensitive data by disassembling and analysing the design of a system component.&lt;ref name=rfc2828&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 2828 Internet Security Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; Another intent may be to remove [[copy protection]], or circumvention of access restrictions.
* '''Competitive technical intelligence'''. Understand what one's competitor is actually doing, versus what they say they are doing.
* '''Saving money''', when one finds out what a piece of electronics is capable of, it can spare a user from purchase of a separate product.
* '''[[Repurposing]]''', when obsolete objects are reused in a different but useful manner.

== Common situations ==
===Reverse engineering of machines===
As [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) has become more popular, reverse engineering has become a viable method to create a 3D virtual model of an existing physical part for use in 3D CAD, [[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]], [[computer-aided engineering|CAE]] or other software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0010-4485(96)00054-1|url=http://ralph.cs.cf.ac.uk/papers/Geometry/RE.pdf|title=Reverse engineering of geometric models–an introduction|year=1997|last1=Varady|first1=T|last2=Martin|first2=R|last3=Cox|first3=J|journal=Computer-Aided Design|volume=29|issue=4|pages=255–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse-engineering process involves measuring an object and then reconstructing it as a 3D model. The physical object can be measured using [[3D scanner|3D scanning]] technologies like [[coordinate-measuring machine|CMMs]], [[3D scanner#Triangulation|laser scanners]], [[3D scanner#Structured light|structured light digitizer]]s, or [[Industrial CT Scanning]] (computed tomography). The measured data alone, usually represented as a [[point cloud]], lacks topological information and is therefore often processed and modeled into a more usable format such as a triangular-faced mesh, a set of [[Nonuniform rational B-spline|NURBS]] surfaces, or a [[computer assisted design|CAD]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://haman-co.com|title = Haman Engineering Solutions|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid Modelling is commonly used term when NURBS and [[Solid modeling|Parametric modelling]] are implemented together. Using a combination of geometric and freeform surfaces can provide a powerful method of 3D modelling. Areas of freeform data can be combined with exact geometric surfaces to create a hybrid model. A typical example of this would be the reverse engineering of a cylinder head, which includes freeform cast features, such as water jackets and high tolerance machined areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicaldigital.com/services/reverse-engineering/|title=Reverse Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse engineering is also used by businesses to bring existing physical geometry into digital product development environments, to make a digital 3D record of their own products, or to assess competitors' products. It is used to analyse, for instance, how a product works, what it does, and what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential [[patent]] infringement, etc.

[[Value engineering]] is a related activity also used by businesses. It involves de-constructing and analysing products, but the objective is to find opportunities for cost cutting.

===Reverse engineering of software===
In 1990, [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) defined ''reverse engineering'' as "the process of analyzing a
subject system to identify the system's components and their interrelationships and to create representations of the system in another form or at a higher
level of abstraction", where the "subject system" is the end product of software development. Reverse engineering is a process of examination only: the software system under consideration is not modified (which would make it [[reengineering (software)|re-engineering]] or restructuring). Reverse engineering can be performed from any stage of the product cycle, not necessarily from the functional end product.&lt;ref name="IEEE 1990"/&gt;

There are two components in reverse engineering: redocumentation and design recovery. Redocumentation is the creation of new representation of the computer code so that it is easier to understand. Meanwhile, design recovery is the using of deduction or reasoning from general knowledge or personal experience of the product in order to fully understand the product functionality.&lt;ref name="IEEE 1990"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chikofsky | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Cross | first2 = J. H. | doi = 10.1109/52.43044 
| title = Reverse engineering and design recovery: A taxonomy | journal = IEEE Software | volume = 7 | pages = 13–17 |date=January 1990 | url = http://win.ua.ac.be/~lore/Research/Chikofsky1990-Taxonomy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as "going backwards through the development cycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Warden | first=R. | title=Software Reuse and Reverse Engineering in Practice | year=1992 | publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall | location=London, England | pages=283–305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the output of the implementation phase (in source code form) is reverse-engineered back to the analysis phase, in an inversion of the traditional [[waterfall model]]. Another term for this technique is [[program comprehension]].&lt;ref name="Nelson96"/&gt; Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE) has been held yearly to explore and expand the techniques of reverse engineering.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE)|url=http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wcre/index.html|website=http://dblp.uni-trier.de|publisher=Computer Science bibliography|accessdate=22 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314150255/http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wcre/index.html|archivedate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer-aided software engineering]] (CASE) and automated code generation have contributed greatly in the field of reverse engineering.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;

[[Software anti-tamper]] technology like [[Obfuscation (software)|obfuscation]] is used to deter both reverse engineering and re-engineering of proprietary software and software-powered systems. In practice, two main types of reverse engineering emerge. In the first case, source code is already available for the software, but higher-level aspects of the program, perhaps poorly documented or documented but no longer valid, are discovered. In the second case, there is no source code available for the software, and any efforts towards discovering one possible source code for the software are regarded as reverse engineering. This second usage of the term is the one most people are familiar with. Reverse engineering of software can make use of the [[clean room design]] technique to avoid copyright infringement.

On a related note, [[black box testing]] in [[software engineering]] has a lot in common with reverse engineering. The tester usually has the [[application programming interface|API]], but their goals are to find bugs and undocumented features by bashing the product from outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/3659140732 | title=Reverse Engineering and Testing of Black-Box Software Components: by Grammatical Inference techniques | publisher=LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing | author=Shahbaz, Muzammil | year=2012 | isbn=978-3659140730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other purposes of reverse engineering include security auditing, removal of copy protection ("[[software cracking|cracking]]"), circumvention of access restrictions often present in [[consumer electronics]], customization of [[embedded systems]] (such as engine management systems), in-house repairs or retrofits, enabling of additional features on low-cost "crippled" hardware (such as some graphics card chip-sets), or even mere satisfaction of curiosity.

====Binary software====
Binary reverse engineering is performed if source code for a software is unavailable.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt; This process is sometimes termed ''Reverse Code Engineering'', or RCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chuvakin | first=Anton |author2=Cyrus Peikari  | edition=1st | title=Security Warrior | publisher=O'Reilly |date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, decompilation of binaries for the [[Java platform]] can be accomplished using Jad. One famous case of reverse engineering was the first non-[[International Business Machines|IBM]] implementation of the [[IBM PC|PC]] [[BIOS]] which launched the historic [[IBM PC compatible]] industry that has been the overwhelmingly dominant computer hardware platform for many years. Reverse engineering of software is protected in the U.S. by the [[fair use]] exception in [[copyright|copyright law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/797533 |authorlink=Pamela Samuelson |first=Pamela |last=Samuelson |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Suzanne |last2=Scotchmer |title=The Law and Economics of Reverse Engineering |volume=111 |journal=[[Yale Law Journal]] |issue= 7|pages=1575–1663 |year=2002 |url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal/content-pages/the-law-and-economics-of-reverse-engineering/|jstor=797533 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Samba software]], which allows systems that are not running [[Microsoft Windows]] systems to share files with systems that are, is a classic example of software reverse engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Samba: An Introduction | url=http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/SambaIntro.html | date=2001-11-27 | accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Samba project had to reverse-engineer unpublished information about how Windows file sharing worked, so that non-Windows computers could emulate it. The [[Wine (software)|Wine]] project does the same thing for the [[Windows API]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] is one party doing this for the [[Microsoft Office]] file formats. The [[ReactOS]] project is even more ambitious in its goals, as it strives to provide binary (ABI and API) compatibility with the current Windows OSes of the NT branch, allowing software and drivers written for Windows to run on a clean-room reverse-engineered  [[Free Software]] ([[GPL]]) counterpart.  [[WindowsSCOPE]] allows for reverse-engineering the full contents of a Windows system's live memory including a binary-level, graphical reverse engineering of all running processes.

Another classic, if not well-known example is that in 1987 [[Bell Laboratories]] reverse-engineered the [[Mac OS]] System 4.1, originally running on the Apple [[Macintosh SE]], so they could run it on RISC machines of their own.&lt;ref name="Lee2013"&gt;{{cite book|first=Newton|last=Lee|title=Counterterrorism and Cybersecurity: Total Information Awareness (2nd Edition)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Counterterrorism-Cybersecurity-Total-Information-Awareness/dp/1461472040/|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|date=2013|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Binary software techniques=====
Reverse engineering of software can be accomplished by various methods.
The three main groups of software reverse engineering are
#Analysis through observation of information exchange, most prevalent in protocol reverse engineering, which involves using [[bus analyzer]]s and [[packet sniffer]]s, for example, for accessing a [[computer bus]] or [[computer network]] connection and revealing the traffic data thereon. Bus or network behavior can then be analyzed to produce a stand-alone implementation that mimics that behavior. This is especially useful for reverse engineering [[device driver]]s. Sometimes, reverse engineering on [[embedded system]]s is greatly assisted by tools deliberately introduced by the manufacturer, such as [[JTAG]] ports or other debugging means. In [[Microsoft Windows]], low-level debuggers such as [[SoftICE]] are popular.
#[[Disassembly]] using a [[disassembler]], meaning the raw [[machine language]] of the program is read and understood in its own terms, only with the aid of machine-language [[mnemonic]]s. This works on any computer program but can take quite some time, especially for someone not used to machine code. The [[Interactive Disassembler]] is a particularly popular tool.
#Decompilation using a [[decompiler]], a process that tries, with varying results, to recreate the source code in some high-level language for a program only available in machine code or [[bytecode]].

====Software classification====
Software classification is the process of identifying similarities between different software binaries (for example, two different versions of the same binary) used to detect code relations between software samples. This task was traditionally done manually for several reasons (such as patch analysis for vulnerability detection and [[copyright infringement]]) but nowadays can be done somewhat automatically for large numbers of samples.

This method is being used mostly for long and thorough reverse engineering tasks (complete analysis of a complex algorithm or big piece of software). In general, [[statistical classification]] is considered to be a hard problem and this is also true for software classification, therefore there aren't many solutions/tools that handle this task well.

===Source code===
A number of [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] tools refer to the process of importing and analysing source code to generate UML diagrams as "reverse engineering". See [[List of UML tools]].

Although UML is one approach to providing "reverse engineering" more recent advances in international standards activities have resulted in the development of the [[Knowledge Discovery Metamodel]] (KDM). This standard delivers an ontology for the intermediate (or abstracted) representation of programming language constructs and their interrelationships.  An [[Object Management Group]] standard (on its way to becoming an ISO standard as well), KDM has started to take hold in industry with the development of tools and analysis environments which can deliver the  extraction and analysis of source, binary, and byte code. For source code analysis, KDM's granular standards' architecture enables the extraction of software system flows (data, control, &amp; call maps), architectures, and business layer knowledge (rules, terms, process). The standard enables the use of a common data format (XMI) enabling the correlation of the various layers of system knowledge for either detailed analysis (e.g. root cause, impact) or derived analysis (e.g. business process extraction).  Although efforts to represent language constructs can be never-ending given the number of languages, the continuous evolution of software languages and the development of new languages, the standard does allow for the use of extensions to support the broad language set as well as evolution. KDM is compatible with UML, BPMN, RDF and other standards enabling migration into other environments and thus leverage system knowledge for efforts such as software system transformation and enterprise business layer analysis.

===Reverse engineering of protocols===

[[Communications protocol|Protocols]] are sets of rules that describe message formats and how messages are exchanged (i.e., the protocol [[Finite-state machine|state-machine]]). Accordingly, the problem of protocol reverse-engineering can be partitioned into two subproblems; message format and state-machine reverse-engineering.

The message formats have traditionally been reverse-engineered through a tedious manual process, which involved analysis of how protocol implementations process messages, but recent research proposed a number of automatic solutions.&lt;ref&gt;W. Cui, J. Kannan, and H. J. Wang. Discoverer: Automatic protocol reverse engineering from network traces.

There has been less work on reverse-engineering of state-machines of protocols. In general, the protocol state-machines can be learned either through a process of [[offline learning]], which passively observes communication and attempts to build the most general state-machine accepting all observed sequences of messages, and [[online machine learning|online learning]], which allows interactive generation of probing sequences of messages and listening to responses to those probing sequences. In general, offline learning of small state-machines is known to be [[NP-complete]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0019-9958(78)90562-4|title=Complexity of automaton identification from given data|year=1978|last1=Gold|first1=E|journal=Information and Control|volume=37|issue=3|pages=302–320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while online learning can be done in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D.

Other components of typical protocols, like encryption and hash functions, can be reverse-engineered automatically as well. Typically, the automatic approaches trace the execution of protocol implementations and try to detect buffers in memory holding unencrypted packets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/polyglot_ccs07_av.pdf Polyglot: automatic extraction of protocol message format using dynamic binary analysis].

===Reverse engineering of integrated circuits/smart cards===
Reverse engineering is an invasive and destructive form of analyzing a smart card. The attacker grinds away layer after layer of the smart card and takes pictures with an [[electron microscope]]. With this technique, it is possible to reveal the complete hardware and software part of the smart card. The major problem for the attacker is to bring everything into the right order to find out how everything works. The makers of the card try to hide keys and operations by mixing up memory positions, for example, [[bus scrambling]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rankl, Wolfgang Effing, Smart Card Handbook (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Welz: [https://archive.is/20120724013648/http://www.crypto.rub.de/its_seminar_ws0708.html Smart cards as methods for payment] (2008), Seminar ITS-Security Ruhr-Universität Bochum&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, it is even possible to attach a probe to measure voltages while the smart card is still operational. The makers of the card employ sensors to detect and prevent this attack.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Musker: [http://www.jenkins.eu/articles-general/reverse-engineering.asp Protecting &amp; Exploiting Intellectual Property in Electronics], IBC Conferences, 10 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This attack is not very common because it requires a large investment in effort and special equipment that is generally only available to large chip manufacturers. Furthermore, the payoff from this attack is low since other security techniques are often employed such as shadow accounts.  It is uncertain at this time whether attacks against CHIP/PIN cards to replicate encryption data and consequentially crack PINS would provide a cost effective attack on multifactor authentication.

===Reverse engineering for military applications===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}
Reverse engineering is often used by people in order to copy other nations' technologies, devices, or information that have been obtained by regular troops in the fields or by [[military intelligence|intelligence]] operations. It was often used during the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]]. Well-known examples from WWII and later include:
* [[Jerry can]]: British and American forces noticed that the Germans had gasoline cans with an excellent design. They reverse-engineered copies of those cans. The cans were popularly known as "Jerry cans".
*[[Panzerschreck]]: The Germans captured an American [[Bazooka]] during World War II, and reverse engineered it to create the larger Panzerschreck.
* [[Tupolev Tu-4]]: In 1944, three American [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] bombers on missions over [[Japan]] were forced to land in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The Soviets, who did not have a similar strategic bomber, decided to copy the B-29. Within three years, they had developed the Tu-4, a near-perfect copy.
* [[SCR-584 radar]]: copied by [[Soviet Union|USSR]] after the Second World War. Known in the form a few modifications - СЦР-584, Бинокль-Д.
* [[V-2]] rocket: Technical documents for the V2 and related technologies were captured by the Western Allies at the end of the war. The American side focused their reverse engineering efforts via [[operation Paperclip]], which led to the development of the [[PGM-11 Redstone]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/REDSTONE/DI149.htm |title=Redstone rocket |publisher=centennialofflight.net |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet side used captured German engineers to reproduce technical documents and plans, and work from captured hardware in order to make their clone of the rocket, the [[R-1 (missile)|R-1]]. Thus began the postwar Soviet rocket program that led to the [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] and the beginning of the [[space race]].
* [[Vympel K-13|K-13/R-3S]] missile ([[NATO reporting name]] '''AA-2 Atoll'''), a Soviet reverse-engineered copy of the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], was made possible after a Taiwanese AIM-9B hit a Chinese [[MiG-17]] without exploding in September 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"The Chinese Air Force: Evolving Concepts, Roles, and Capabilities", Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs (U.S), by National Defense University Press, pg. 277&lt;/ref&gt; The missile became lodged within the airframe, and the pilot returned to base with what Russian scientists would describe as a university course in missile development.
* [[BGM-71 TOW]] Missile: In May 1975, negotiations between Iran and Hughes Missile Systems on co-production of the TOW and Maverick missiles stalled over disagreements in the pricing structure, the subsequent [[1979 revolution]] ending all plans for such co-production. Iran was later successful in reverse-engineering the missile and are currently producing their own copy: the [[Toophan]].
* China has [[Intellectual property in the People's Republic of China|reversed engineered many examples]] of Western and Russian hardware, from fighter aircraft to missiles and [[HMMWV]] cars.
* During the Second World War, Polish and British cryptographers studied captured German [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|"Enigma"]] message encryption machines for weaknesses. Their operation was then simulated on electro-mechanical devices called "[[Bombe]]s" that tried all the possible scrambler settings of the "Enigma" machines to help break the coded messages sent by the Germans.
* Also during the Second World War, British scientists analyzed and defeated a [[Battle of the Beams|series of increasingly sophisticated radio navigation systems]] being used by the German Luftwaffe to perform guided bombing missions at night. The British countermeasures to this system were so effective that in some cases German aircraft were led by signals to land at RAF bases, believing they were back in German territory.

=== Overlap with patent law===
Reverse engineering applies primarily to gaining understanding of a process or artifact, where the manner of its construction, use, or internal processes is not made clear by its creator.

[[Patent|Patented items]] do not of themselves have to be reverse-engineered to be studied, since the essence of a patent is that the inventor provides detailed public disclosure themselves, and in return [[intellectual property rights|receives legal protection]] of the [[invention]] involved. However, an item produced under one or more patents could also include other technology that is not patented and not disclosed. Indeed, one common motivation of reverse engineering is to determine whether a competitor's product contains [[patent infringement]]s or [[copyright infringement]]s.

==Legality==
===United States===
In the United States even if an artifact or process is protected by [[trade secret]]s, reverse-engineering the artifact or process is often lawful as long as it has been legitimately obtained.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asme.org/career-education/articles/management-professional-practice/trade-secrets-101 "Trade Secrets 101," Feature Article, March 2011]. ASME. Retrieved on 2013-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse engineering of [[computer software]] in the US often falls under both [[contract law]] as a [[breach of contract]] as well as any other relevant laws. This is because  most [[EULA]]s (end user license agreement) specifically prohibit it, and U.S. courts have ruled that if such terms are present, they override the copyright law which expressly permits it (see ''[[Bowers v. Baystate Technologies]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utsystem.edu/ogc/intellectualproperty/baystatevbowersdiscussion.htm Baystate v. Bowers Discussion]. Utsystem.edu. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Grant. (2003-06-26) [http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/contract-case-could-hurt-reverse-engineering-337 Contract case could hurt reverse engineering | Developer World]. InfoWorld. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;). Sec. 103(f) of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201- 17 U.S.C. § 1201 (f)]) says that a person who is in legal possession of a program, is permitted to reverse-engineer and circumvent its protection if this is necessary in order to achieve "interoperability" — a term broadly covering other devices and programs being able to interact with it, make use of it, and to use and transfer data to and from it, in useful ways. A limited exemption exists that allows the knowledge thus gained to be shared and used for interoperability purposes.&lt;ref&gt;The section states:&lt;br&gt;(f) Reverse Engineering.—&lt;br&gt;(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement under this title.&lt;br&gt;(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a person may develop and employ technological means to circumvent a technological measure, or to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure, in order to enable the identification and analysis under paragraph (1), or for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, if such means are necessary to achieve such interoperability, to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title.&lt;br&gt;(3) The information acquired through the acts permitted under paragraph (1), and the means permitted under paragraph (2), may be made available to others if the person referred to in paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, provides such information or means solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title or violate applicable law other than this section.&lt;br&gt;(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term 「interoperability」 means the ability of computer programs to exchange information, and of such programs mutually to use the information which has been exchanged.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===

[[Computer Programs Directive|EU Directive 2009/24]] on the legal protection of computer programs, which superseded an earlier (1991) directive,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0250:EN:HTML Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer programs]. Eur-lex.europa.eu. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; governs reverse engineering in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1435057541496&amp;uri=CELEX:32009L0024 DIRECTIVE 2009/24/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The directive states:{{quote|The unauthorised reproduction, translation, adaptation or transformation of the form of the code in which a copy of a computer program has been made available constitutes an infringement of the exclusive rights of the author. Nevertheless, circumstances may exist when such a reproduction of the code and translation of its form are indispensable to obtain the necessary information to achieve the interoperability of an independently created program with other programs. It has therefore to be considered that, in these limited circumstances only, performance of the acts of reproduction and translation by or on behalf of a person having a right to use a copy of the program is legitimate and compatible with fair practice and must therefore be deemed not to require the authorisation of the rightholder. An objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together. Such an exception to the author's exclusive rights may not be used in a way which prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder or which conflicts with a normal exploitation of the program.}}

The '''Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange'''&lt;ref name=mainref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = NAS Announces Initiative to Connect Entertainment Industry With Top Experts
  | publisher =  National Academies
  | year = 2008
  | url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=11192008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a program run and developed by
the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) to increase public awareness, knowledge, and understanding of science and advanced science technology through its representation in television, film, and other media. It serves as a pro-science movement with the main goal of re-cultivating how science and scientists truly are in order to rid the public of false perceptions on these topics. The Exchange provides entertainment industry professionals with access to credible and knowledgeable scientists and engineers who help to encourage and create effective representations of science and scientists in the media, whether it be on television, in films, plays, etc. The Exchange also helps the science community understand the needs and requirements of the entertainment industry, while making sure science is conveyed in a correct and positive manner to the target audience.

Officially launched in November 2008, the Exchange can be thought of as a partnership between NAS and Hollywood, as it arranges direct consultations between scientists and entertainment professionals who develop science-themed content. This collaboration allows for industry professionals to accurately portray the science that they wish to capture and include in their media production. It also provides scientists and science organizations with the opportunity to communicate effectively with a large audience that may otherwise be hard to reach such as through innovative [[physics outreach]]. It also provides a variety of other services, including scheduling briefings, brainstorming sessions, screenings, and salons. The Exchange is based in [[Los Angeles]], California.

==Examples==

===''Watchmen''===
In one of its first acts of business, The Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange connected [[Alex McDowell]], the production designer for the 2009 film adaptation of the graphic novel ''[[Watchmen]]'', with University of Minnesota physics professor [[James Kakalios]].
&lt;ref name=aboutkaklios&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Putting the Science into 'Watchmen'
  | publisher =  MSNBC
  | year = 2009
  | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29531732/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kakalios is the author of the book ''[[The Physics of Superheroes]]'', and was selected as a science consultant in part because of his extensive experience incorporating comic book superheroes into his writings and lectures as a way to motivate the public to take an interest in science.
&lt;ref name=sciacc&gt;{{cite web

  | publisher =  Scientific American
  | year = 2009
  | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=how-accurate-is-watchmen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the run up to the theatrical release of ''Watchmen,'' Kakalios and the [[University of Minnesota]] produced a short video (with more than 1,500,000 views as of April 29, 2009) explaining the science behind Dr. Manhattan's super powers to increase public awareness of the science behind the film.

===''Fringe''===
The TV series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' is using the Exchange to identify scientists able to address technical questions regarding scripts in development. A rapid-response team of specialists in neuroscience, epidemiology, and genetics—themes frequently featured in the series—has been gathered to assist the scriptwriters.&lt;ref name=laboutloud&gt;{{cite web

=== Thor ===

[[Thor (film)|Thor]] screenwriters connected through The Exchange with Kevin Hand from [[Caltech]]'s Jet Propulsion Lab, who helped them turn the comic book's mythological worlds into believable cinematic scenery.&lt;ref name="scienceandentertainmentexchange"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/article/scientist-spotlight-kevin-hand|title=Scientist Spotlight: Kevin Hand &amp;#124; The Science &amp;amp; Entertainment Exchange|publisher=scienceandentertainmentexchange.org|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the collaboration resulted in the film featuring [[Natalie Portman]] as Jane Foster, a female physicist. This worked towards eliminating the stereotype that many hold viewing scientists strictly as men. This action also served to portray scientists in a positive, relatable manner which so many other media productions miss the mark on completely by making scientists out to be mean, evil, and cruel. This outcome illustrates a main goal of the Exchange, to use popular entertainment media to better communicate to the public about the true realities of scientists and science information in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Science as social context==
{{Tone|date=March 2012}}
Since long before [[C. P. Snow]]'s "[[Two Cultures]]" essay, science has struggled to overcome negative stereotypes; communicating science's tremendous importance and appeal to a general audience is an enormous challenge. Traditional entertainment media have portrayed scientists, over and over, as evil, mean, and cruel in the past. These ubiquitous and consonant mass media messages served to cultivate a false perception of scientists, and science in general, in the public. With movies and television shows constantly portraying scientists in this false manner it led  people to believe it was an accurate portrayal. This effect that the media can have can be described by cultivation theory. Cultivation theory was first formulated by George Gerbner in 1976.&lt;ref name="uky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/~drlane/capstone/mass/cultivation.htm|title=CULTIVATION THEORY-Mass Communication Context|first=Stephanie|last=Caldwell|publisher=uky.edu|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies television (and now film) as a main source of information and storytelling in today's world. The theory of cultivation makes several assumptions which function to explain how false perceptions, such as those about science, are created. First, the theory assumes that media are controlled by a few, powerful corporate interests. Next, it believes that these players create ubiquitous and consonant messages that the lay public witnesses repeatedly. Finally, it assumes that the effects of these redundant and constant messages will occur over time to slowly cultivate false perceptions of reality in the public.&lt;ref&gt;Gerbener, George. Science on Television: How it Affects Public Conceptions. Issues in Science and Technology, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the cultivated beliefs about science that have formed over the past 30 years or so, science is currently not an area of interest or importance to the majority of the lay public and thus this area of research is not understood accurately by many; the majority of the public lacks basic scientific knowledge and understanding. However, the Exchange is working to effectively change this. Entertainment media that portray scientists and their work in a positive light have been found to have direct educational and socializing influences on audiences. For example, survey analyses show that some science fiction portrayals appear to boost public evaluations of science. After controlling for education and other background variables, studies find that heavier viewers of science fiction television hold greater belief in the promise of science, and are more supportive of controversial topics such as therapeutic cloning.&lt;ref name=pubeval&gt;{{cite journal

In a study of the audience effects for the 2004 blockbuster ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'', viewers of the film, after controlling for education, gender, age, and political views, were significantly more concerned about global climate change, more likely to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and more trusting of government agencies such as [[NASA]] and [[NOAA]].&lt;ref name=dayafter&gt;{{cite journal

As news agenda-setters, film and television can also have an important indirect influence. These films provide dramatic "news pegs" for journalists seeking to either sustain or generate new coverage of an issue. For example, studies comparing the news attention sparked by the 2001 release of the Third [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|IPCC report]] on [[climate change]] with the amount of coverage generated by the 2004 release of ''The Day After Tomorrow'' and the 2006 release of [[Al Gore]]'s ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', find that both films far surpassed the IPCC report in media publicity.&lt;ref name=ipcc&gt;{{cite web

This illustrates the great power that the entertainment media industry has in communicating with a lay audience. Science is a topic that most laymen seem to disregard, and do not show great interest or concern in. By incorporating it into a more mainstream media environment, such as television series and films versus scientific journals and newspapers, the Exchange allows scientific information and news to be communicated in an accurate and clear manner to those that would otherwise ignore the subject.

In another example, the 1998 releases of the blockbusters ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' and ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' galvanized news attention to the potential problem of [[Near Earth Object]]s, a science policy issue that otherwise rarely, if ever, receives news attention.&lt;ref name="kirby1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kirby|first=David A.|author-link=David A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3050">'''Selig Hecht''' (1892 – 1947) was an American physiologist who studied [[photochemistry]] in [[photoreceptor cell]]s. Hecht was born in Austria, and immigrated to the USA at an early age. His studies and talents led to [[Columbia University]] making him [[professor]] of [[biophysics]] in 1928.

Hecht began his study into light sensitivity with clams (''[[Mya arenaria]]'') and insects. His specialty was [[photochemistry]], the kinetics of the reactions initiated by light in the receptors. He made contributions to the knowledge of [[dark adaptation]], [[visual acuity]], brightness discrimination, [[color vision]], and the mechanism of the visual threshold.

According to biographer Pirenne, Hecht was a "brilliant lecturer and expositor." Pirenne continues, 
:The lack of synthesis discernible in present-day knowledge and teaching perturbed him, and he took an active interest in all the human implications of science. He dealt with persons and ideas on the basis of their intrinsic worth,...
==Explaining the atom==
When [[World War II]] ended with the use of [[atomic weapon]]s which had been developed in secret by the [[Manhattan Project]], Hecht was concerned that the American public was uninformed about the development of this new source of energy. He wrote a book ''Explaining the Atom'' (1947), to educate the public. He wrote,
:So long as one supposes this business is mysterious and secret, one cannot have a just evaluation of our possessions and security. Only by understanding the basis and development of atomic energy can one judge the legislation and foreign policy that concern it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hecht |first=Selig |title=Explaining the Atom |year= 1947 |publisher= The Viking Press |page=X |place= New York |accessdate= 12 June 2018 |url= https://archive.org/stream/explainingatom00hech#page/n7/mode/2up/search/|via =Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by F.W.S. (9 August 1947) "Atoms Away", ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review in the [[New York Times]] (4/27/1947), Stephen Wheeler wrote that it was "by all odds the best book on atomic energy so far to be published for the ordinary reader." Similarly, James J. Jelinek&lt;ref&gt;[[Scientific Monthly]] 65(2):166,7&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that it was an "invaluable contribution to the layman." He credits Hecht with "conveying to the layman the intellectual drama" of the development. Jelinek asserts that the book is "profoundly provocative in its political and sociological implications."

After Hecht died, a second edition was issued in 1959 by [[Eugene Rabinowitch]].

The '''Shemer Art Center and Museum''' is an art education facility and gallery in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. The center was founded in 1984 by Martha Shemer, who purchased a [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|mission-style]] house and three acres not only to preserve the property but to donate it to the City of Phoenix to be used for art education. Budget constraints nearly closed the center in 2010, but citizens founded the Shemer Art Center and Museum Association to help manage and preserve the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12719">'''Socioemotional selectivity theory''' ('''SST'''; developed by Stanford psychologist [[Laura L. Carstensen]]) is a life-span theory of motivation. The theory maintains that as time horizons shrink, as they typically do with age, people become increasingly selective, investing greater resources in emotionally meaningful goals and activities. According to the theory, motivational shifts also influence cognitive processing. Aging is associated with a relative preference for positive over negative information in attention and memory (called the "[[positivity effect]]").

==Overview==
Because they place a high value on emotional satisfaction, older adults often spend more time with familiar individuals with whom they have had rewarding relationships.&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;Santrock, J.W. (2008). ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development''. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.{{page needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This selective narrowing of social interaction maximizes positive emotional experiences and minimizes emotional risks as individuals become older. According to this theory, older adults systematically hone their social networks so that available  social partners satisfy their emotional needs.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

The theory also focuses on the types of goals that individuals are motivated to achieve. Knowledge-related goals aim at knowledge acquisition, career planning, the development of new social relationships and other endeavors that will pay off in the future. Emotion-related goals are aimed at emotion regulation, the pursuit of emotionally gratifying interactions with  social partners and other pursuits whose benefits can be realized in the present.

When people perceive their future as open ended, they tend to focus on future-oriented and development- or knowledge-related goals, but when they feel that time is running out and the opportunity to reap rewards from future-oriented goals' realization is dwindling, their focus tends to shift towards present-oriented and emotion- or pleasure-related goals.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;  Research on this theory often compares age groups (''e.g.'', young adulthood vs. old adulthood), but the shift in goal priorities is a gradual process that begins in early adulthood.  Importantly, the theory contends that the cause of these goal shifts is not age itself, ''i.e.'', not the passage of time itself, but rather an age-associated shift in time perspective.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

This justified shift in perspective is the rational equivalent of the psychological perceptual disorder known as "foreshortened future," in which an individual, usually a young and physically healthy individual, unreasonably believes (either consciously or unconsciously) that his/her time horizons are more limited than they actually are, with the effect that the individual undervalues long-term goals and long-run pleasure and instead disproportionately pursues short-term goals and pleasure, thereby [[Opportunity cost|diverting resources from investment for the future]] and often even actively reducing his/her long-term prospects.

==Cross-cultural incidence==
Researchers have found that across diverse samples – ranging from [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]]s to [[Catholic nun]]s to [[African-American]]s to [[Chinese American]]s{{clarify|date=February 2013}} to [[European-American]]s – older adults report better control of their emotions and fewer negative emotions than do younger adults.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt; At the same time, culture seems to color how aging-related effects impact one's emotional life: Whereas older Americans were shown to de-emphasize negative experiences more than younger Americans, no such effect has been observed in Japan. Instead, older Japanese were shown to assign a greater value to positive aspects of otherwise negative experiences than younger Japanese, whereas no such effect has been observed in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0036041|pmid=24749641|title=A cultural perspective on emotional experiences across the life span|journal=Emotion|volume=14|issue=4|pages=679|year=2014|last1=Grossmann|first1=Igor|last2=Karasawa|first2=Mayumi|last3=Kan|first3=Chiemi|last4=Kitayama|first4=Shinobu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positivity effect in older adults==

=== In perception ===
Studies have found that older adults are more likely than younger adults to pay attention to positive than negative stimuli (as assessed by the [[dot-probe paradigm]] and eye-tracking methods). However, the effect also differs across cultures. For example, Hong Kong Chinese looked away from happy stimuli and more towards fearful stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fung | first1 = H. H. | last2 = Lu | first2 = A. Y. | last3 = Goren | first3 = D. | last4 = Isaacowitz | first4 = D. M. | last5 = Wadlinger | first5 =  | last6 = Wilson | first6 = H.

H. | last2 = Isaacowitz | first2 = D. M. | last3 = Lu | first3 = A.

=== In recall ===
The term ''positivity effect'' also refers to age differences in emotional attention and memory. As people get older, they experience fewer negative emotions and they tend to look to the past in a positive light.{{sfn|Mather|Carstensen|2005}} In addition, compared with younger adults' memories, older adults' memories are more likely to consist of positive than negative information and more likely to be distorted in a positive direction. This version of the positivity effect was coined by Laura L. Carstensen's research team.&lt;ref name="Carstensen2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carstensen|first1=L. L.|title=The Influence of a Sense of Time on Human Development|journal=Science|date=2006|volume=312|issue=5782|pages=1913–1915|doi=10.1126/science.1127488|pmid=16809530|pmc=2790864|bibcode=2006Sci...312.1913C}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a debate about the cross-cultural generalizability of the aging-related positivity effect, with some evidence for different types of emotional processing among Americans as compared to Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A cultural perspective on emotional experiences across the life span|journal=Emotion|date=2014|doi=10.1037/a0036041 |pmid=24749641 |volume=14 |issue=4|pages=679–92|last1=Grossmann|first1=I|last2=Karasawa|first2=M|last3=Kan|first3=C|last4=Kitayama|first4=S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hypothesized causes====
One theory of the positivity effect in older adults' memories is that it is produced by cognitive control mechanisms that improve and decrease negative information due to older adults' greater focus on emotional regulation.{{sfn|Mather|Carstensen|2005}} Research shows an age-related reversal in the valence of information processed within the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (MPFC). In younger adults, more MPFC activity was found in the presence of negative stimuli compared to positive stimuli whereas in older adults this was reversed.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

However, the positivity effect may be different for stimuli processed automatically (pictures) and stimuli processed in a more controlled manner (words). Compared to words, pictures tend to be processed more rapidly and they engage emotion processing centres earlier. Automatic stimuli are processed in the [[amygdala]] and dorsal MPFC, whereas controlled stimuli are processed in the temporal pole and ventral MPFC. Compared to younger adults, older adults showed less amygdala activation and more MPFC activation for negative than positive pictures. Increased motivation to regulate emotion leads older adults to actively engage the mPFC differently from younger adults, which in turn yields diverging amygdala activation patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid =  18455837| pmc =  3541693| year =  2010| last1 =  St. Jacques| first1 =  P| title =  Effects of aging on functional connectivity of the amygdala during negative evaluation: A network analysis of fMRI data| journal =  Neurobiology of Aging| volume =  31| issue =  2| pages =  315–327| last2 =  Dolcos| first2 =  F| last3 =  Cabeza| first3 =  R| doi =  10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2008.03.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite pattern was observed for words. Although older adults showed a positivity effect in memory for words, they did not display one for pictures. Thus, the positivity effect may arise from ageing differences in MPFC use during encoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leclerc | first1 = C. | last2 = Kensinger | first2 = E. | year = 2011 | title = Neural processing of emotional pictures and words: A comparison of young and older adults | url = | journal = Developmental Neuropsychology | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 519–538 | doi = 10.1080/87565641.2010.549864 | pmid = 21516546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terribilità''', the spelling in modern Italian, or '''terribiltà''', as [[Michelangelo]]'s 16th century contemporaries tended to spell it, is a quality of provoking  terror (the literal meaning), awe, or a sense of the sublime, in the viewer, that is ascribed to his art.  It is perhaps especially applied to his [[sculpture]]s, such as his figures of [[David (Michelangelo)|''David'']] or in [[Moses (Michelangelo)|''Moses'']].

[[Pope Julius II]] was apparently the first to describe Michelangelo as a ''uomo terribile'' ("terror-inducing man"), apparently describing his difficult character as much as his art. This ''terribilità'', also references the [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonics]] of humanists such as [[Marsilio Ficino]], who had known Michelangelo in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Lleó Cañal, Vicente, Revista de Libros:Tintoretto 2, 2 Abril 2007, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelangelo's friend and collaborator [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] reported in a letter to him of 15 October 1520 on a private audience with [[Pope Leo X]].  After praising Michelangelo's work, the pope continued "But he is ''terribile'', as you see; one cannot deal with him".  Sebastiano responded "that your ''terribile'' character did not harm anyone, and that you appear ''terribile'' for love of the great works you carry out."&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition handlist for "Michelangelo &amp; Sebastiano", 2017, National Gallery.

'''''The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight''''' ({{lang-ar|الروض العاطر في نزهة الخاطر}} ''Al-rawḍ al-ʿāṭir fī nuzhaẗ al-ḫāṭir'') by [[Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Nafzawi]] is a fifteenth-century [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[sex manual]] and work of [[erotic literature]].

The book presents opinions on what qualities men and women should have to be attractive, gives advice on sexual technique, warnings about [[sexual health]], and recipes to remedy sexual maladies. It gives lists of names for the [[Human penis|penis]] and [[vagina]], has a section on the interpretation of dreams, and briefly describes sex among animals. Interspersed with these there are a number of stories which are intended to give context and amusement.
[[File:The Perfumed Garden book cover.jpg|right|thumb]]

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}

According to the introduction of Colville's English translation, Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Nafzawi probably wrote ''The Perfumed Garden'' sometime during the twelfth century. Sheikh Nefzawi, full name Abu Abdullah Muhammad ben Umar Nafzawi,&lt;ref&gt;أبو عبدالله محمد ابن عمر النفزاوي&lt;/ref&gt; was born among the [[Berbers|Berber]] Nefzawa tribe in the south of present-day [[Tunisia]]. He compiled at the request of the [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid]] ruler of [[Tunis]], Abū Fāris ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Mutawakkil, the present work. The reputation acquired by this work in the Arab world was similar to that of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]''.

==Translations==

===1886: Burton English translation===
''The Perfumed Garden'' first became widely known in the English-speaking world through a translation from the French in 1886 by Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]]. Burton mentions that he considers that the work can be compared to those of [[Pietro Aretino|Aretin]] and [[Rabelais]], and the French book ''Conjugal Love'' by Nicolas Venette. But what he believes makes ''The Perfumed Garden'' unique in the genre is "the seriousness with which the most lascivious and obscene matters are presented." Burton points out that not all of the ideas in ''The Perfumed Garden'' are original: "For instance, all the record of Moçama and of Chedja is taken from the work of [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Mohammed ben Djerir el Taberi]]; the description of the different positions for coition, as well as the movements applicable to them, are borrowed from Indian works; finally, the book ''Birds and Flowers'' by Azeddine el Mocadecci (Izz al-Din al-Mosadeqi) seems to have been consulted with respect to the interpretation of dreams."

The French manuscript that Burton translated from was one printed by Isidore Liseux in 1886. This manuscript's last chapter — Chapter 21 — was incomplete, apparently because it contained material on homosexuality and pederasty which had been removed. When Burton died in late 1890, he was working on a new translation of the original manuscript, including this missing chapter. The revised translation, due to be retitled ''The Scented Garden'', was never published as Burton's wife Isabel burned the manuscript soon after his death.

=== 1976: Khawam French translation ===
A new French translation by [[René R. Khawam]] was published in 1976.

=== 1999: Colville English translation ===
In 1999, Jim Colville published the first English ''Perfumed Garden'' translated directly from the Arabic original.  Of the Burton translation, he says, "details were expanded, episodes introduced and whole sections incorporated from other, non-Arabic, sources.  The text is dressed up in a florid prose alien to the style of the original and many of the notes are sheer speculation.  The result is a consistently exaggerated and bizarre misrepresentation of the original".

Exaggeration on the part of Burton is vividly illustrated in Chapter 6, titled "Sexual Technique" in Colville's translation and "Concerning Everything That Is Favourable to the Act of Coition" in Burton's.  Burton's translation is perhaps 25 pages long, lists 39 sex positions as well as 6 types of sexual movement, and gives creative names to many of these.  Colville's translation is 2½ pages long, and lists 12 unnamed sex positions.

==Inspiration for musical works==
In 1923 the English composer [[Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji]] wrote ''Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mus.ulaval.ca/roberge/srs/04-sourc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RAH Band]] released a single entitled “Perfumed Garden” in 1982.

Omnium Gatherum, a Finnish [[melodic death metal|melodic death metal band]], also wrote a song called "The Perfumed Garden", released on their "Spirits and August Light" album in 2003.

[[Ray Manzarek]], inspired by this, recorded a track called Perfumed Garden for his solo album The Whole Thing Started With Rock &amp; Roll, Now It's Out Of Control.

[[File:Portrait tattoo.jpg|thumb|Tattoos are common examples of tie signs that signify a relationship between the wearer and the subject of the tattoo.]]'''Tie signs''' are signs, signals, and symbols, that are revealed through people's actions as well as objects such as engagement rings, wedding bands, and photographs of a personal nature that suggest a relationship exists between two people.  For romantic couples, [[Public display of affection|public displays of affection (PDA)]] including things like holding hands, an arm around a partner’s shoulders or waist, extended periods of physical contact, greater-than-normal levels of physical proximity, grooming one’s partner, and “sweet talk” are all examples of common tie signs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Manwatching: A Field Guide to Human Behavior|last1=Morris|first1=Desmond|date=1977|publisher=H.N. Abrams|isbn=0810913100|location=New York, NY|pages=86–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tie signs inform the participants, as well as outsiders, about the nature of a relationship, its condition, and even what stage a relationship is in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Young couple standing in a field, the man with right arm around the woman's shoulder LCCN2015650129.jpg|thumb|Holding someone close is an example of a tie sign, as are photographs of such actions]]

== Background ==
Origination of the term "tie sign" has been attributed to [[Desmond Morris]], an English zoologist and author, by at least one source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803104617120|title=Oxford Reference|website=oxfordreference.com|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Erving Goffman]] is also credited with employing the term in 1959, almost two decades earlier&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Relationships|last=Duck|first=Steve|publisher=Sage|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4129-5876-9|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Usage ==
[[File:Holding hands (34305602934).jpg|thumb|Couples holding hands in public is a common tie sign]]
Nearly anything can be a tie sign, whether it is an action or an object, depending on the context in which it is observed. The majority of the time, the term tie sign is directed toward relational couples, but it can also apply to groups like families and friends. Additionally, "name-dropping" is an example a type of non-romantic tie sign&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; wherein someone attempts to communicate to others that a relationship exists between the speaker and the person he or she has named.

=== Dependence on context ===
Morris relates that one of the difficulties associated with understanding tie signs is that almost anything can qualify as one, depending on the circumstances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, even though holding hands is a common tie sign, there is an obvious difference between a man and a woman holding hands as they stand on the alter at a wedding when compared to a female physician holding a male patient's hand in a doctor's office. Goffman echoes this sentiment when he says, "a tie-sign is in fact dependent on the context for its meaning."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1433020|title=Relations in public; microstudies of the public order|last=Erving|first=Goffman|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1972|isbn=0060902760|location=New York,|oclc=1433020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Facebook Like React.png|thumb|"Liking" someone's Facebook page is an example of tie sign via social media]]

=== Use of tie signs in social media ===
The advent of social media has created a newer conduit for tie signs.  In addition to broadcasting images of a couple exhibiting traditional tie signs like kissing, holding hands, hugging, pictures of weddings, and engagement rings, etc., social media provides the opportunity for other signals such as "liking" someone's page or tagging another person in a picture. Additionally, although observers may not witness the act of "liking" as it occurs, evidence of such actions persist on the recipient's page for others to see over time.

There is some evidence that ceasing to use social media for relational maintenance purposes could contribute to "alienation and relational de-escalation", while it would not have been a problem in the past simply because the opportunity to communicate via social media was not an option.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sosik|first=Victoria Schwanda|last2=Bazarova|first2=Natalya N.|year=2014|title=Relational maintenance on social network sites: How Facebook communication predicts relational escalation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.02.044|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=35|pages=124–131|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.02.044|issn=0747-5632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Afifi and Johnson ===
Walid A. Afifi and Michelle L. Johnson researched cross-sex friendships (those between a man and a woman) and how the use of tie signs in less-than-romantic relationships differ from the same tie signs when they are used in romantic cross-sex relationships.  For example, hugging as a greeting is an accepted tie sign for both cross-sex friendship as well as cross-sex romantic relationships.  Afifi and Johnson note some differences between sexes in the meanings behind tie signs in certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Afifi|first=Walid A.|last2=Johnson|first2=Michelle L.|year=1999|title=The Use and Interpretation of Tie Signs in a Public Setting: Relationship and Sex Differences|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0265407599161002|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=16|issue=1|pages=9–38|doi=10.1177/0265407599161002|issn=0265-4075}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, women, more often than men, stated their use of tie signs was intended to "express inclusion and intimacy."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Afifi and Johnson also suggest that less-than-overt tie signs are often ambiguous even with knowledge of the context and the present state of the relationship.  It is for this reason that [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] argues that a tie sign is informative in nature and not a type of communication or language that can stand on its own.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Goffman===
Like Morris, Goffman's work on tie signs, copyrighted in 1971,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; was more descriptive than it was research-based because he was defining a new concept.  In so doing, Goffman focuses on relationships between two people (dyadic), and refers to the participants as both "pegs" and "ends" that are joined in "anchored relations,"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as well as the way intentional and unintentional actions that are exhibited by the pair reflect the current state of their relationship.  Goffman argues that tie signs are "ritual idioms"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; that contain information as opposed to a particular message, in large part because tie signs are often susceptible to incorrect interpretations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In turn, third party observers tend to look for additional tie signs in order to confirm or deny their suspicions regarding the subjects they are observing. Goffman breaks tie-signs into three distinct categories:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# Rituals:  These are inward-facing tie signs between those in a relationship.  For example, in a new relationship, where the parties exhibit increased attentiveness toward one another by holding hands, maintaining prolonged eye contact, etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Ritual ties signs can be subtle or overt, but, although they may be perceptible to outsiders, they are directed inward between the participants.
# Markers:  As the name suggests, these types of tie signs are more overt and intended by at least one of the participants in a relationship to be interpreted by others that a relationship of some kind does exist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Change signals:  Things like weddings and births are examples of change signals. Change signals also generally involve a participant in the relationship taking a good bit for granted, or as Goffman puts it, "the taking of liberty."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  For example, handing a partner one's coat or purse without asking, and not giving the action a second thought, is an example of one relational "peg"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; demonstrating that a relationship exists with another.

=== Guerrero and Anderson ===
Laura K. Guerrero and Peter A. Andersen researched how touch avoidance informs on the various stages of romantic relationships.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero|first=Laura K.|last2=Andersen|first2=Peter A.|year=1991|title=The Waxing and Waning of Relational Intimacy: Touch as a Function of Relational Stage, Gender and Touch Avoidance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0265407591082001|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=8|issue=2|pages=147–165|doi=10.1177/0265407591082001|issn=0265-4075}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guerrero and Anderson's results quite clearly suggest a marked decrease in touching between couples once their relationship reaches a "stable" stage.  The authors' research does not determine whether the decrease in touch after reaching a "stable" condition it is no longer needed as much as when the relationship is still forming, or if need, or desire, for public touching is replaced by an increase in physical contact while in private,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; or by less overt communications and gestures such as knowing looks between pairs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Guerrero and Anderson's work supports Morris' contention that tie-signs decrease in frequency and intimacy as relationships mature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] refers to this trend as “taking liberty.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Perhaps somewhat counter intuitively on its face, a lack of touching between an “anchored pair”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is also a tie sign that can signal a pair’s relationship is in a mature and stable stage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  
[[File:Desmond Morris (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Desmond Morris]]]]

===Morris===
Like Goffman, [[Desmond Morris]]'s work with tie signs, was more descriptive in nature as he was describing a new concept, in contrast with others’research that followed. Morris defines a tie sign as "any action which indicates the existence of a personal relationship".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, he broadens and clarifies his definition by including objects such as engagement rings, family pictures, and tattoos, as well as "indirect tie signs"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; such as a couple sharing a desert after dinner, and "direct ties signs"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; such as maintaining close proximity to one another, finishing each other’s sentences, and prolonged and frequent body contact.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Sosick and Bazarova ===
Victoria Schwanda Sosik and Natalya Bazarova researched relational maintenance through social networking including an increasing sense of “staying in touch” and frequency of contact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Even while noting a reduction in effort, or "relational maintenance cost"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; required to maintain a relationship via a social media conduit, the authors argue that activity on an acquaintance's social media page still serves to signal a shared relationship.  Sosik and Bazarova also argue there is a hierarchy of signals available including more personal, written comments posted either publicly or privately, “liking” something on the other person’s social media page, tagging the other person when active on other pages, etc.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Two differences between an in-person tie sign and a tie sign in a social media setting are first - the potentially greater size of the audience, and second - the lingering of tie signs that were generated in the past creating, in turn, a prolonged signal to any who see it that a relationship exists.

=== Tong and Walther===
In Wright and Webb's book ''Computer-Mediated Communication in Personal Relationships'',&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/667213140|title=Computer-mediated communication in personal relationships|date=2011|publisher=Peter Lang|others=Wright, Kevin B., Webb, Lynne M.|isbn=9781433110818|location=New York|oclc=667213140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephanie Tom Tong and [[Joseph Walther]] explore whether social media activity is additive to relational maintenance between people that are not dispersed geographically and otherwise have social contact with one another.  Even thought people may have a relationship outside of social media, they still often choose to demonstrate to others that a relationship exists with tie signs that are delivered via social media platforms.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Critique ==
In "Relations in Public", Goffman concedes that his review of tie-signs is focused on Western society of the time.  And, specifically to "middle-class American[s]."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There may be some benefit for future research on the effects of broadcasting tie signs through social media, and what impact they may have on relationships.  Such as, whether the larger number of witnesses and lingering representation of a tie sign that is preserved in social media might be perceived as magnifying the significance of what is otherwise a seemingly small gesture.

'''''Uriel's Machine: The Prehistoric Technology That Survived the Flood''''' is a bestselling book published in 1999 by [[Christopher Knight (author)|Christopher Knight]] and [[Robert Lomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Books: Best-sellers|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=11 July 1999|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's name is derived from a character of the same name in the ''[[Book of Enoch]]''.  In Knight and Lomas's interpretation of the ''Book of Enoch'', [[Uriel]] warns [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] about the impending [[Deluge (mythology)|flood]], giving him instructions for building a form of solar observatory for the purpose of preserving advanced knowledge into a time of global disaster by teaching him the movement of the Sun against the horizon over a period of time, which Enoch then records in detail in the ''[[Book of Enoch#The Astronomical Book|Book of the Courses of the Heavenly Luminaries]]''.

== Summary ==
In [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] mythology there are many references to seven, which the authors speculate could refer to seven cometary fragments. These seven cometary fragments are described in the book as hitting the earth in prehistory causing [[tsunami]]s. The authors link this speculation to [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide|the work of geologists Edith and Alexander Tollmann]].&lt;ref name="Kristan-TollmannOthers1994"&gt;Kristan-Tollmann, E. and A. Tollmann, 1994, ''The youngest big impact on Earth deduced from geological and historical evidence''. Terra Nova. v. 6, no. 2, pp. 209-217.&lt;/ref&gt; Their work proposes a series of meteors hitting the earth over the last 10,000 years, especially circa 7640 BC. Their evidence and counter-evidence is discussed in the article [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide]].

The book proposes that what the authors believe to have been stellar observatories (such as the first wooden [[Stonehenge]]) in Britain, and structures in the [[Boyne Valley]] in Ireland, show sufficient knowledge to be able to predict prescribed solar, lunar and venusian events and cycles, such as solstices and equinoxes. If rituals at Stonehenge involved stargazing, there is then the opportunity for an anomalous object to be spotted far more quickly if the cycles of observed celestial objects are known.

The authors quote textual evidence from the [[book of Enoch]], noting other coincidences made between Enoch and astronomy; for example, it is said he lived 365 years, which could be a reference to a year (365.25 days).
 
The authors suggest that chambers ([[souterrain]]s) found in Britain might have been attempts to build shelters to be sealed against [[tsunamis]] that would have been caused by a cometary impact in the sea. However, the souterrains have been dated to the late Iron Age, thousands of years after the supposed impact event.

Archaeologists and astronomers have been extremely sceptical about this idea. Prof Archie Roy (an astronomer and psychic researcher) and [[Robert Lomas]] gave a joint talk about technological possibilities in Megalithic society at the 2000 Orkney International Science.

== Critical response ==
[[Tim Schadla-Hall]], archaeologist and editor of the journal ''[[Public Archaeology]]'', has cited the book as an example of [[pseudoscience]], in which the authors "quote established academics in such a way as to make it seem as though they support their arguments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The comforts of unreason: the importance and relevance of alternative archaeology|editor-last=Merriman|editor-first=Nick|title=Public Archaeology|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|date=2004|page=260|isbn=9780415258890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geology in the book is based on [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide]] which has been rejected by specialists in [[meteorite]] and [[comet]] impacts.&lt;ref name="DeutschOthers1993"&gt;Deutsch, A., C. Koeberl, J.D. Blum, B.M. French, B.P. Glass, R. Grieve, P. Horn, E.K. Jessberger, G. Kurat, W.U. Reimold, J. Smit, D. stoffler, and S.R. Taylor, 1994, ''The impact-flood connection: Does it exist?'' Terra Nova. v. 6, pp. 644-650.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Tonkin, author and astronomer, said: "I believe that the astronomical basis of this book is sufficiently flawed as to render any conclusions that the authors draw from it to be highly suspect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tonkin|first=Stephen|date=2003|url=http://astunit.com/astrocrud.php?topic=uriel|title=Uriel's Machine – a Commentary on some of the Astronomical Assertions|work=The Astronomical Unit|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Pitts (archaeologist)|Mike Pitts]], archaeologist and journalist, says that the book contains "what we might politely call a radically alternative approach to Grooved Ware pottery" and notes that the book's bibliography contains "such items as Myths and Legends of Australia, Robert the Bruce ''and'' The Pleistocene Elephants of Siberia, but not a single primary archaeological source for England (where, it has to be said, a great deal of Grooved Ware has been found)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitts|first=Mike|authorlink=Mike Pitts (archaeologist)|date=2000|title=Hengeworld|publisher=[[Random House|Century]]|location=London|isbn=9780099278757}}&lt;/ref&gt;
