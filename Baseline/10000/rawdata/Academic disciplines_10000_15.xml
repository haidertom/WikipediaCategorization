*Develop students' skill in object-oriented software design methods and data management systems.
Provide professional training to students by combining information technology with managerial skills.
*Prepare students to proceed on to post graduate level study in information management within and outside the country.

==Careers==
Graduating with a bachelors in Information Management highly beneficial as it opens up a plethora of career options and routes for students. This is manly due to the fact that employers now-a-days show a growing interest for applicants with both a business management education as well as an IT background. Paul Matthews from the Institute of IT Professionals stated that "Employers tell me the key thing holding them back is the ability to get skilled people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gifford|first1=Adam|title=Surge in demand for IT graduates|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10902070|website=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This degree would be beneficial as it is employable all over world. Every company has an IT department, which even in non-tech firms, play an essential role in the company's daily functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surfing a digital wave, or drowning?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21591201-information-technology-everywhere-companies-it-departments-mixed|website=The Economist|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fine combination of IT and management that this degree offers, has shown career prospects in fields such as:
* Software Designers and Engineers
* Advertising and Marketing Executives
* IT Consultants and Planners
* Sales and retail assistants
* Chartered Accountants
* Computer programmers and programmer developers
* As well as many others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top destinations for "Information Management" graduates |url=http://wlgd.thecareersgroup.co.uk/Destinations/Subject/Information+Management |website=University of London |accessdate=29 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029133917/http://wlgd.thecareersgroup.co.uk/Destinations/Subject/Information%2BManagement |archivedate=29 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates from these types of degrees have also found themselves working for some of the world's top organisations including Ernst and Young, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, and Bruder Mannesmann &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Management for Business BSc|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/undergraduate/degrees/ubsinfsbus05|website=UCL|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post Graduate Programs==
Keep in mind that although you can start a career straight after your bachelors, you may also be interested in furthering your study by enrolling in a masters program. Employers seem to be finding that business management undergraduates are too keen on starting work immediately, without actually having attained the essential skills need for a professional workplace. This may be in terms of general maturity and also the students ability to 'hit the ground running'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What makes a business graduate more employable?|url=http://theconversation.com/what-makes-a-business-graduate-more-employable-31800|website=The Conversation|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where masters students have the greater advantage.

There are many different masters programs available to graduates from an Information Management degree. However at this point, the studies tend to narrow down to more specific areas. As you have a solid background in both Business Management and IT, you have a large range to choose from.

If after studying you seem to be more keen in IT then perhaps you should consider doing a masters in either computer science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No. 2 Best Master's Degree For Jobs: Computer Science|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45ifij/no-2-best-masters-degree-for-jobs-computer-science/|website=Forbes|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or information systems.These two programs are some of the best for finding postgraduate jobs with high earning salaries.

==Student life==
Information Management students enrolled in a full-time degree generally have 8–13 hours a week in class, whether its lectures, tutorials, or seminars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BA in Information Management|url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/study/bachelor/ba-in-information-management/student-life|website=Copenhagen Business School|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However time must be spend outside of class working on coursework and assignments as well as doing prerequisite readings for certain modules.

One of the hardest parts about being a student is learning how to survive on a budget. To compensate for this, many students choose to get a part-time job while studying. In the United States, about 50% of students have a part-time job whilst enrolled in a full-time degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orszag|first1=Jonathan|title=LEARNING AND EARNING: WORKING IN COLLEGE|url=http://www.brockport.edu/career01/upromise|website=Brockport|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it becomes increasing difficult to balance a part-time job along with course work, classes, good grades, self study time, and social life. Often self study time suffers the most from part-time jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Richardson|first1=Mark|title=Academic plate spinning: The difficulties of balancing full time degree study with a part-time job |publisher=University of Worcester}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore it would be recommended to work no more than 10 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BA in Information Management|url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/study/bachelor/ba-in-information-management/student-life|website=Copenhagen Business School|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental orientation==
In the definition provided by the U.S. Army Medical Command 
{{quote|text="Battlemind is the Soldier's inner strength to face fear and adversity with courage. Key components include: 
# Self confidence: taking calculated risks and handling challenges.
# Mental toughness: overcoming obstacles or setbacks and maintaining positive thoughts during times of adversity and challenge."&lt;ref name=behavioralhealth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.behavioralhealth.army.mil/battlemind/index.html |title=Battlemind Information |date=May 15, 2008 |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |publisher=U.S. Army Medical Command| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080529053857/http://www.behavioralhealth.army.mil/battlemind/index.html| archivedate= 29 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The significance of Battlemind in the Medical Command's context is that ''"Battlemind skills helped you survive in combat, but may cause you problems if not adapted when you get home."''&lt;ref name=behavioralhealth/&gt;

Initial writings on the subject focused on the utility of battlemind while in service,&lt;ref name=saint&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Crosbie E. Saint]] |title=Battlemind guidelines for battalion commanders |publisher= Headquarters, U.S. Army, Europe and Seventh Army |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; while several recent works focus on treatment and self-help.&lt;ref name=whealin1&gt;{{cite book |author1=Julia M. Whealin |author2=Lorie T. DeCarvalho |author3=Edward M. Vega |title=Clinician's Guide to Treating Stress After War: Education and Coping Interventions for Veterans |publisher=Wiley |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-470-25777-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whealin2&gt;{{cite book |author1=Julia M.

Vega |title=Strategies for Managing Stress After War: Veteran's Workbook and Guide to Wellness |publisher=Wiley |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-470-25776-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program==
The first Battlemind product was a mental health post-deployment briefing. It quickly became a training system supporting soldiers and families across the seven phases of the deployment cycle.&lt;ref name=huseman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=48567 |title='Battlemind' Prepares Soldiers for Combat, Returning Home |author=Huseman, Susan |date=Jan 3, 2008 |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |publisher=defenselink.mil| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080520122624/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=48567| archivedate= 20 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Battlemind system now includes separate pre-deployment training modules for soldiers, unit leaders, health care providers and spouses. Psychological debriefings are given in theater and upon redeployment. There is also a post-deployment module for spouses and several post-deployment modules for soldiers.

==Controversy==
Some veteran groups have expressed concern or curiosity about the effectiveness of the Battlemind program in addressing [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name=vawatchdog&gt;{{cite web |title=A LOOK AT DoD's "BATTLEMIND" PROGRAM |url=http://www.vawatchdog.org/08/nf08/nfJAN08/nf010408-1.htm |author=Scott, Larry |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |publisher=VA Watchdog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioanalysis''' is a sub-discipline of [[analytical chemistry]] covering the [[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative]] measurement of [[xenobiotics]] (drugs and their [[metabolite]]s, and [[Biomolecule|biological molecules]] in unnatural locations or concentrations) and biotics ([[macromolecule]]s, [[protein]]s, [[DNA]], large molecule drugs, metabolites) in [[biological systems]].

==Modern bioanalytical chemistry==
Many scientific endeavors are dependent upon accurate quantification of drugs and endogenous substances in biological samples; the focus of bioanalysis in the [[pharmaceutical]] industry is to provide a quantitative measure of the active drug and/or its metabolite(s) for the purpose of [[pharmacokinetics]], [[toxicokinetics]], [[bioequivalence]] and exposure–response (pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics studies). Bioanalysis also applies to drugs used for illicit purposes, [[Forensic science|forensic]] investigations, anti-[[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] testing in sports, and environmental concerns.

Bioanalysis was traditionally thought of in terms of measuring small molecule drugs. However, the past twenty years has seen an increase in [[biopharmaceuticals]] (e.g. [[proteins]] and [[peptides]]), which have been developed to address many of the same diseases as small molecules. These larger biomolecules have presented their own unique challenges to quantification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Welcome to ''Bioanalysis'' | journal = Bioanalysis | date = 2009-04-03 | first = Brian P | last = Booth | coauthors = | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–2 | id = | url = http://www.future-science.com/doi/pdf/10.4155/bio.09.4 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-05-13 | doi=10.4155/bio.09.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first studies measuring drugs in biological fluids were carried out to determine possible overdosing as part of the new science of forensic medicine/[[toxicology]]. 

Initially, nonspecific assays were applied to measuring drugs in biological fluids. These were unable to discriminate between the drug and its metabolites; for example, [[aspirin]] (circa 1900) and [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]] (developed in the 1930s) were quantified by the use of [[Colorimetry (chemical method)|colorimetric]] assays. [[Antibiotic]]s were quantified by their ability to inhibit bacterial growth. The 1930s also saw the rise of pharmacokinetics, and as such the desire for more specific assays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Development of bioanalysis: a short history | journal = Bioanalysis | date = 2009-04-03 | first = Howard | last = Hill | coauthors = | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–7 | id = | url = http://www.future-science.com/doi/pdf/10.4155/bio.09.3 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-05-13 | doi=10.4155/bio.09.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern drugs are more potent, which has required more sensitive bioanalytical assays to accurately and reliably determine these drugs at lower concentrations. This has driven improvements in technology and analytical methods.

==Bioanalytical techniques==
Some techniques commonly used in bioanalytical studies include:

*''Hyphenated techniques''
**[[Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC–MS]] (liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry)
**[[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry|GC–MS]] (gas chromatography–mass spectrometry)
**LC–DAD (liquid chromatography–diode array detection)
**[[Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry|CE–MS]] (capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry)
*''Chromatographic methods''
**[[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] (high performance liquid chromatography)
**[[Gas chromatography|GC]] (gas chromatography)
**UPLC (ultra performance liquid chromatography)
**Supercritical fluid chromatography
*''[[Electrophoresis]]''
*''Ligand binding assays''
**[[Dual polarisation interferometry]]
**[[ELISA]] (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)
**[[Magnetic immunoassay|MIA]] (magnetic immunoassay)
**[[Radioimmunoassay|RIA]] (radioimmunoassay)
*''[[Mass spectrometry]]''
*''[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]]''

The most frequently used techniques are: liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ([[Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC–MS/MS]]) for 'small' molecules and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]) for macromolecules.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Sample preparation and extraction==
The bioanalyst deals with complex biological samples containing the analyte alongside a diverse range of chemicals that can have an adverse impact on the accurate and precise quantification of the analyte. As such, a wide range of techniques are applied to extract the analyte from its matrix. These include:

*[[Protein precipitation]]
*[[Liquid–liquid extraction]]

Bioanalytical laboratories often deal with large numbers of samples, for example resulting from clinical trials. As such, automated sample preparation methods and liquid-handling robots are commonly employed to increase efficiency and reduce costs.

==Bioanalytical organisations==
There are several national and international bioanalytical organisations active throughout the world. Often they are part of a bigger organisation, e.g. Bioanalytical Focus Group and Ligand Binding Assay Bioanalytical Focus Group, which are both within the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) and FABIAN, a working group of the Analytical Chemistry Section of the [[KNCV|Royal Netherlands Chemical Society]]. The [[European Bioanalysis Forum]] (EBF), on the other hand, is independent of any larger society or association. Hanover Search Partners based in San Diego, California is the leading recruitment firm in the Bioanalytical space and contracts with many of the world's leading Bioanalytical companies in recruiting the top executive and scientific talent worldwide.

The '''Blackstone Legal Fellowship''' is an American legal training and internship program developed and facilitated by Christian legal group [[Alliance Defending Freedom]] (ADF). Since its inception in 2000, more than 1,900 law students have participated in the program. Its main campus is in Scottsdale, Arizona. Notable faculty have included U.S. Court of Appeals Judge [[Amy Coney Barrett]].

==Overview==
[[File:SirWilliamBlackstone.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sir William Blackstone in 1774]]

Blackstone Legal Fellowship is a highly competitive, nine week intensive summer legal training program which spans June though August. It was founded in 2000 for the purpose of preparing Christian law students for professional legal careers. The first class comprised 24 interns.&lt;ref name="dexter" /&gt; Since its inception Blackstone has trained more than 1,900 Christian law students.&lt;ref name="adf blackstone"/&gt; In an interview, ADF co-founder [[Alan Sears]] said in 2000 Blackstone was created in response to his observation, "There’s got to be a better way for law students in America and for young lawyers than we currently have."&lt;ref name="mcfeely"/&gt; The program is made up of interns, called Fellows, from a diverse selection of law schools as well as elite institutions such as Harvard and Yale.&lt;ref name="dexter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dexter|first1=Duggan|title=How tomorrow’s legal activists start the journey with a trip to Arizona|url=https://arizonadailyindependent.com/2014/02/16/how-tomorrows-legal-activists-start-the-journey-with-a-trip-to-arizona/|work=Arizona Daily Independent|accessdate=January 31, 2018|date=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is named for [[Sir William Blackstone]], the famed eighteenth century English legal scholar and jurist whose influential commentaries on the common law had a profound impact on the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].&lt;ref name="Bailyn"&gt;Bailyn, Bernard, ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (2017 edition).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2012, Sears was asked about the major achievements of ADF. He said "among the things I am most thankful for are our Blackstone Legal Fellowship graduates."&lt;ref name="mcfeely"&gt;McFeely, Tom (January 18, 2012). "[http://m.ncregister.com/daily-news/alliance-defense-funds-chief-convert#.WeI8BIUpDYV Alliance Defense Fund's Chief Convert]". ''[[National Catholic Register]]''. Retrieved February 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, President [[Donald Trump]]'s nominee to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], [[Amy Coney Barrett]], was criticized by Senator [[Al Franken]] for teaching constitutional law at Blackstone. In her Senate committee hearing he referred to ADF as a "hate group". Barrett responded that the hate group label is "controversial". Barrett was confirmed to the court by the full Senate.&lt;ref name="gottry" /&gt;

==Program information==
The Blackstone Fellowship consists of three phases described as Learn, Lead, and Defend. Fellows spend the first two weeks of the program in the classroom studying in areas such as ethics, theology and jurisprudence. Sessions consist of lectures as well as hands-on interactive presentations.&lt;ref name="dexter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grebing"&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Grebing|editor1-first=Karen|title=Blackstone Legal Fellowship Preparing AMSL Students to be Leaders of the Future|journal=Ave Maria School of Law Advocate|issue=Fall 2013|pages=22–23|url=https://issuu.com/avemarialaw/docs/final_fall_2013_advocate/22|accessdate=February 5, 2018|publisher=Ave Maria School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second phase of the program focuses on six-week field placements at a variety of venues across the United States and abroad including "public-interest law firms, attorneys, law professors, think tanks, and public-policy organizations." Placements are selected based on students' aptitude and career goals.&lt;ref name="dexter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grebing"/&gt;

Finally, the Fellows return to ADF in Scottsdale for a week long series of presentations focusing on career development and professional networking. Speakers include legal academics, members of the judiciary, elected representatives, and practicing attorneys. Interns are given an orientation to the Blackstone alumni network.&lt;ref name="dexter"/&gt;

==Cost==
The cost of attendance at Blackstone is $6,300. Most Blackstone Fellows receive a scholarship to attend the program. In addition, stipends are available to cover expenses during the placement phase of the program.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dexter"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16535">'''The Curriculum Open-Access Resources in Economics Project''' ('''CORE Project''') is an organisation that creates and distributes teaching material for [[economics]] curriculum reform. Its textbook is taught as an introductory course at more than 100 universities. It provides its materials online, at no cost to users. It is registered as a charity&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title=CORE Economics Education|url=https://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1175143&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|website=The Charity Commission|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CORE Economics Education) in England and Wales.

==Origins==

CORE was conceived in late 2012, by Professors [[Wendy Carlin]] of University college London and [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] of the Santa Fe Institute, and [[:es:Óscar_Landerretche_Moreno|Oscar Landerretche]], who at that time was Director of the School of Economics and Business of the University of Chile&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/olanderretche|title=Oscar Landerretche|website=Institute for New Economic Thinking|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At the time, Professor Carlin wrote to colleagues to suggest they collaborate to revise the curriculum, noting that "altering the course of the undergraduate curriculum is like turning around a half a million ton super tanker. But I think that the time may be right for the initiative I am inviting you to join me in proposing."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rajivsethi.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/the-core-project.html?spref=tw|title=The CORE Project|website=rajivsethi.blogspot.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Global economic crisis of 2008-09|global economic crisis of 2008]], students had formed groups, such as the [[International Student Initiative for Pluralist Economics]] (ISIPE) and [[Rethinking Economics]], to demand improvements to the mainstream economics curriculum. ISIPE, for example, argued that "teaching in economics departments is too narrowly focused and more effort should be made to broaden the curriculum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inman|first1=Philip|title=Economics students call for shakeup of the way their subject is taught|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/may/04/economics-students-overhaul-subject-teaching|accessdate=4 May 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Professor Carlin has written that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The textbook model is definitely broken. In it, economic actors are amoral and self-interested, [[perfectly competitive]] market prices equate supply to demand implementing “optimal” outcomes, while [[environmental degradation]], [[instability]], and [[Inequality in economics|inequality]] are afterthoughts at best … Yet it continues as the backbone of much undergraduate teaching. However remote from what economists really do and the way we think, this is the “economics” imprinted on the public’s mind."&lt;ref name="CarlinProspect"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlin|first1=Wendy|title=How a new economics syllabus is preparing students for the real-world economy|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/new-economics-model-teaching-syllabus|publisher=Prospect Magazine|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Launched in October 2013 at [[HM Treasury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Rob|title=Institute for New Economic Thinking Launches Project to Reform Undergraduate Syllabus|url=https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/institute-for-new-economic-thinking-launches-project-to-reform-undergraduate-syllabus|website=Institute for New Economic Thinking|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, CORE said its mission was to address these issues by creating a textbook incorporating contributions from many academics with different points of view that was "humbler, more empirical and more topical".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f015a3ac-4aed-11e3-ac3d-00144feabdc0|title=‘Dismal science’ seeks fresh thinking after failure in crisis|date=2013-11-11|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Carlin wrote that students "are embarrassed when they are no more able to explain the eurozone crisis or persistent unemployment than their fellow students in engineering or archaeology", and that CORE would ensure that "digital technology and interactive teaching methods will introduce students to an [[Empirical research|empirical]] discipline. They will learn to use evidence from history, experiments and other data sources to test competing explanations and policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/74cd0b94-4de6-11e3-8fa5-00144feabdc0#axzz2kwVkkxys|title=Economics explains our world – but economics degrees don’t|last=Carlin|first=Wendy|date=17 November 2013|work=Financial Times|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course material==

CORE's courses are offered through [[open access]] online [[E-book|ebooks]] published on [http://core-econ.org its web site]. Its ebooks use a [[Creative Commons]] license&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; so that "any user can customize, translate, or improve it for their own use or the use of their students."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===''The Economy''===

''[http://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/ The Economy]'' was designed as the source material for taught courses in the first year of an undergraduate degree, although it has also been used in schools, and for advanced courses in public policy. In 2017, a print version of ''The Economy'' was published by Oxford University Press.&lt;ref name="Economy book" /&gt;

===''Economy, Society and Public Policy (ESPP)''===

In 2018, CORE posted the first units of ''[http://www.core-econ.org/espp/ ESPP]'', an ebook designed to introduce the economics to non-specialists, particularly students from outside economics courses who were taking economics as a minor. Like ''The Economy'', it focuses on topics such as inequality, power, and environmental economics. ESPP is funded by the [[Nuffield Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/economy-society-and-public-policy-quantitative-economics-course-non-specialists-core-project|title=Economy, Society and Public Policy - new course from coreecon {{!}} Nuffield Foundation|website=www.nuffieldfoundation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Doing Economics''===

Also in 2018, CORE posted the first beta units of ''[http://www.core-econ.org/doing-economics/ Doing Economics]'', a collection of empirical projects designed to teach [[Quantitative Methods|quantitative methods]] in economics using real-world data, also funded by the Nuffield Foundation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Structure and contributors==

CORE Economics Education is registered as a charity in England and Wales, with a board of trustees.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The day-to-day running of the project is based at [[University College London]]. The course and support materials have been created by academic economists who volunteer their time, including [[Yann Algan]] ([[Sciences Po]], Paris), [[Timothy Besley]] ([[London School of Economics]]), [[Diane Coyle]] ([[University of Manchester]]), [[Cameron Hepburn]] ([[University of Oxford]]), and [[Kevin O'Rourke|Kevin O’Rourke]] ([[University of Oxford]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.core-econ.org/contributors/?filter%5B0%5D=2&amp;search=|title=Contributors - CORE|work=CORE|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The steering group is [[Wendy Carlin]] ([[University College London]]), [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] ([[Santa Fe Institute]]), [https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/faculty/margaret-stevens Margaret Stevens] (head of the Department of Economics, [[University of Oxford]]), and [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93scar_Landerretche_Moreno Oscar Landerretche], the president of [[Codelco]]. In 2017, [http://www.core-econ.org/project/core-usa/ CORE USA], based at [[Barnard College]], was set up to improve outreach in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.core-econ.org/project/core-usa/|title=CORE USA - CORE|work=CORE|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prominent economists have contributed to the published material&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.core-econ.org/contributors/?filter%5B0%5D=contributors&amp;search=|title=Contributors - CORE|work=CORE|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including Nobel laureates [[James Heckman]], [[Alvin E. Roth|Alvin Roth]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], who recorded videos for it on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X83gk4PvIRc inequality in education], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7vzgexzXOk matching markets] and the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_W9SsstO9Y&amp;t=2s financial crisis].

===Funding===
CORE funds its projects through grants. Startup funding was provided by the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]]. Current Funders include the [[Nuffield Foundation]], [[HM Treasury]], [http://www.friendsprovidentfoundation.org/ Friends Provident Foundation], [[Bank of England|The Bank of England]], and the [[International Economic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.core-econ.org/funders/|title=Funders - CORE|work=CORE|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from existing economics teaching==

CORE's authors claim that popular textbooks such as ''Principles of Economics'' by [[Greg Mankiw]] are little different in content to the first modern text book, ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'' by [[Paul Samuelson]], which was published in 1948.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/new-paradigm-introductory-course-economics|title=A new paradigm for the introductory course in economics|last=Bowles|first=Samuel|last2=Carlin|first2=Wendy|date=2017-09-07|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, meaning that these textbooks have ignored many of the innovations in economics since then:&lt;blockquote&gt;"What we teach [students] in our intro classes bears little resemblance to how we do economics ourselves. The great mid-20th century thinkers – [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]] – initiated a process that eventually transformed how we now understand the economy, in three ways. Only one of these [Keynes] made it into today's principles course."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;CORE argues that concepts developed in the second half of the 20th century, such as [[asymmetric information]], strategic [[social interactions]] and [[incomplete contracts]] should be given greater prominence in undergraduate teaching. It claims that in most universities these ideas are "mentioned, if at all, at the end of the introductory course, or as special topics."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Critical reception===
''The Economy'' has been received favourably. ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote that "[e]arly results are promising":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Economy'' does not dumb down economics; it uses maths readily, keeping students engaged through the topicality of the material. Quite early on, students have lessons in the weirdness in economics—from game theory to power dynamics within firms—that makes the subject fascinating and useful but are skimmed over in most introductory courses.&lt;ref name="CORE Economist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Economist|first1=The|title=The teaching of economics gets an overdue overhaul|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21729443-students-are-forced-grapple-real-world-very-beginning-their|website=Free Exchange|accessdate=4 May 2018|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In [[The New Yorker]], [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] wrote that "The members of the core team deserve credit for responding to the critics of economics without pandering to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-new-way-to-learn-economics|title=A New Way to Learn Economics|last=Cassidy|first=John|date=2017-09-11|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Times Higher Education Supplement]] called the course "a bold revamp" and wrote that taking CORE in year 1 had improved results in year 2 for students at [[University College London]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The proportion of students gaining a first in the second-year [[microeconomics]] module rose from 22 per cent in 2014-15 to 32 per cent in 2015-16, while the proportion awarded third-class honours fell from 28 per cent to 11 per cent. ... In [[macroeconomics]], the proportion gaining firsts was unchanged, but the number who attained a 2:1 rose from 21 per cent in 2014-15 to 36 per cent in 2015-16."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/students-thrive-thanks-freakonomics-revamp-economics|title=Students thrive thanks to ‘Freakonomics revamp’ of economics|date=2017-01-05|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Criticism of approach===

Some curriculum reform campaigners have criticised CORE for being too narrow and prescriptive, and not acknowledging competing schools of thought. Daniel Lapedus, the [[Rethinking Economics]] welcomed CORE’s "incorporation of a variety of thinkers in their curriculum, as well as their efforts to make economics more real and engaging for economics students ... But real critical [[Pluralism in economics|pluralism]] that reflects the true diversity of real-world perspectives is still a long way off. There is plenty more rethinking yet to be done."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/neweconomics/will-real-rethinkers-please-stand/|title=Will the real rethinkers please stand up? - New thinking for the British economy|website=www.opendemocracy.net|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuan Yang, one of the founders of [[Rethinking Economics]], told [[Financial Times|The Financial Times]] that: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Core is not a pluralist curriculum ... It presents one paradigm, while students should be able to choose among different schools of thought.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/fc2eb464-d93d-11e4-b907-00144feab7de|title=Students weigh the value of new economics course|last=Guigliano|first=Ferdinando|date=10 April 2015|work=The Financial Times|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The central theme of the book is [[state formation]]. Tilly writes about the complex history of European state formation from the [[Middle Ages]] to the 1990s - a thousand-year time span. While examining political, social, and technological change, Tilly attempts to explain the unprecedented success of the European [[Nation state|nation-state]] as the dominant [[polity]] in the world,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990-1990|last = Tilly|first = Charles|publisher = B.

== Overview ==
[[File:Jacques Bertaux - Prise du palais des Tuileries - 1793.jpg|thumb|According to Tilly, the [[French Revolution]] unfolded from protests against the high taxes the French rulers imposed to balance for the expensive [[American Revolutionary War|American War]].]]
Tilly asks a double question in ''Coercion, Capital, and European States'', namely: "What accounts for the great variation over time and space in the kinds of states that have prevailed in Europe since AD 990, and why did European states eventually converge on different variants of the national state?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to Tilly's theory, military innovation in pre-modern Europe, especially the use of gunpowder and mass armies, made war considerably more expensive. In order to continue to fund warfare, conquest, and security, only states with sufficient capital and a large population could afford paying for their security and ultimately surviving in a hostile environment. Those in power were forced to develop a means of extraction by, for example, introducing taxation and conscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.so.17.080191.002515|title = Comparative Perspectives on the State|last = Barkey|first = Karen|date = August 1991|journal = Annual Review of Sociology|doi = 10.1146/annurev.so.17.080191.002515|pmid = |access-date = January 25, 2016|first2 = Sunita|last2 = Parikh|issue = 17|pages = 523–549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, these means of extraction resulted in the creation of state bureaucracies and a centralized state.

The type of state that develops is dependent on the structure of the area. In areas where merchants and capital were the predominant class, city states arose, such as Venice. In areas where independent landlords were the predominant class, centralized absolutism arose, such as Russia. If an area would have both classes more or less equal, a combination of state forms would develop, for example as happened in France and England, according to Tilly. Eventually, all states will develop into the type of state form that Tilly calls the [[nation state]].

With this theory, Tilly questions previous formulations of state development in Europe, arguing that they are unsuccessful in explaining the great variety in kinds of states that have prevailed at different stages of European history since AD 990. He say that they fail "because they locate explanations of state-to-state variation in individual characteristics of states rather than relations among them, and because they assume implicitly a deliberate effect to construct the sorts of substantial, centralized states that come to dominate European life during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Unlike other theories, like the idea of the [[social contract]], Tilly stated that "[w]ar wove the European network of national states, and preparation for war created the internal structures of states within it."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isnblog.ethz.ch/international-relations/charles-tilly-ad-990-1992-twenty-years-on|title=Charles Tilly, AD 990-1992: Twenty Years On|last=Lindberg|first=Marten|date=November 2011|website=The International Relations and Security Work|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interaction between the rulers on the hand and the manipulators of capital on the other, resulted in three state formations, Tilly argues. These state formations are tribute-taking empires, systems of fragmented sovereignty, and national states.

=== From Militarization to Civilianization ===
Tilly notes a "central paradox" in his theory of European state building: "the pursuit of war and military capacity, after having created national states as a sort of by-product, led to a civilianization of government and domestic politics".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Tilly, this transfer of power from armed forces to civilian entities was not so much a tug-of-war but rather happened incrementally. The ''nature'' of power—coercion—did not change, but the individuals that wielded it did. Tilly provides five main reasons for this incremental transition (p.&amp;nbsp;206):
# The building up and maintenance of military forces required massive extractive structures that were run by civilians, eventually forming a counterweight to the same military forces;
# War making forced states to legitimize civilian input since it had to bargain for necessary resources with civilian entities;
# War making dramatically expanded the state and did not downsize its capacities at the end of conflicts;
# Individuals involved in war making were promised dues at the end of the war, and thus legitimately claimed their dues at demobilization;
# Borrowing during conflicts led to bureaucracies being created to service the skyrocketing state debts, which in turn encouraged states to intervene in the local economy.

=== State Building in the Developing World ===
[[Jeffrey Herbst]] is an example of a scholar that builds on Tilly's theory. Herbst explains the relative failure of state building in Africa by the lack of external threats that forced European leaders to concentrate capital and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = War and the State in Africa|jstor = 2538753|journal = International Security|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 117–139|volume = 14|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/2538753|first = Jeffrey|last = Herbst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tilly concludes his book, however, emphasizing caution in applying his model to contemporary [[state-building]]. the Tilly argues that the militarization of politics in many developing countries should not be understood as a step towards the development of a stable nation state. He asserts that current conditions of state formation today (at the time of writing, in 1990) are vastly different from what they were in Europe over his study period. First, Tilly notes that the military apparatus in developing countries today is not generally concerned with conquering or defending territory, as opposed to European armies (p.&amp;nbsp;207). Thus, they turn their full capacity to internal control, so that the objective is not to control territory but populations. Second, Tilly writes that the Cold War has led to a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to arm, fund and control developing countries, especially their militaries. Thus, military groups thrived as other organizations withered. Progressively, the military was better able to control the state, whereas civilian organizations could not rival its strength. In other words, Tilly argues that the military groups that run contemporary developing states have little in common with their European counterparts.

He further proposes three hypothesis to start to theorize the lack of civilianization in developing countries (p.&amp;nbsp;220):
# Failure of civilian institutions that lead to military intervention;
# Disproportionate external support for the military;
# No institutional tool to bargain and contain the military since it is artificially funded externally.
Tilly's main claim is thus that the European nation-state as it was constructed is certainly not a ''de facto'' endgame, or ideal polity model. In fact, Tilly argues that it is improbable that current Third World states follow exactly the same processus of state building- and we should not expect them to do so.

== Reception ==

=== Academic discussion ===

==== Tarrow, 2008 ====
American sociologist [[Sidney Tarrow]] discussed the book during a 2008 conference organized by the [[Social Science Research Council]] in honor of Charles Tilly. During his talk, he addressed what he saw as four gaps in the book:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# '''The scope conditions of Tilly's theory'''. War is seen by Tilly as the "prime mover of early modern European state-making, because its requisites led to processes of extraction, protection, production, and distribution."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Tarrow wonders how that can explain non-European states and states that formed more recently, such as post-colonial states. There is a lot of literature on "correcting Tilly" on state-building in the [[North–South divide|global South]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00746.x/abstract|title = Tilly Tally: War-Making and State-Making in the Contemporary Third World|last = Taylor|first = Brian D.|date = March 2008|journal = International Studies Review|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00746.x|pmid = |access-date = January 25, 2016|last2 = Botea|first2 = Roxana|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''The theory's internal validity'''. In the 1975 book ''The Formation of National States in Western Europe'', Tilly critiques [[Joseph Strayer]]'s model of state formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State|last = Strayer|first = Joesph R.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1970|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''Coercion, Capital, and European States'', "the successful cases looked remarkably like Strayer's model."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# '''There is no attention for the role of religion and capitalism in European state development''', while Tarrow argues "[w]e know how deeply Catholic/Protestant conflicts divided Europe in the [[Thirty Years' War|Thirty Year's War]], and how the settlement of that conflict produced the European state system after the [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]]." Concerning capitalism, Tarrow said that "not all European states were equally in need of domestic capital to finance their wars", referring to Sweden under King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]]. 
# '''The role of rights in state development in the United States''', characterized by the so-called "[[War on Terrorism – Timeline|War on Terror]]". According to Tarrow, Tilly "saw his country at risk of abandoning its devotion to its regime of rights."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Leander, 2012 ====
French/Swedish sociologist [[Anna Leander]] examined Tilly's relevance twenty years later in her article ''Wars and the Un-Making of States: Taking Tilly Seriously in the Contemporary World''. Leander argues that the "war makes states"  no longer holds for four reasons:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/ebooks/files/338105247.pdf|title = Wars and the Un-Making of States: Taking Tilly Seriously in the Contemporary World|last = Leander|first = Anna|date = 2012|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[State-building]]'''. While rulers' competition for controlling coercion is a crucial element of Tilly's hypothesis, today's rulers "take increasingly minor roles in the organization of coercion".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; State-building is not a product of interstate conflict anymore but rather of diplomacy and high-politics.
# '''Privatization of coercion'''. Another crucial element - the rulers' monopoly on legitimate violence - is disappearing. Europe and North America have seen a growth of 10 per cent per years in private security companies taking over the state prerogatives since the 1970s, a ''[[Peace Research Institute Frankfurt]]'' report shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Private Security Companies and the State Monopoly on Violence|url = http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?id=113632|website = www.isn.ethz.ch|access-date = 2016-01-25|first = ISN|last = Editors}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Privatization of capital'''. Just like coercion, controlling capital is a crucial element in Tilly's hypothesis, as wars are expensive. However, national economics is a function of international economics and subject to international norms, rules, and regulations in the modern world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# '''Different interest groups'''. Tilly concludes that the civilianization of government evolved through the bargaining between rulers and their citizens. However, "the privatization of coercion and capital and the decentralization of political power has left rulers as brokers between different [...] interest groups rather than ''ruling them'' from a national center".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== 1992 Edition ==
A revised edition of the book was published in 1992 with the title ''Coercion, Capital, and European States AD 990-1992''. For that edition, Tilly made minor revisions throughout the book and added an extra section discussing the rapid changes in Central and Eastern Europe after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

{{Anthropology |theories}}

'''Cross-cultural studies''', sometimes called '''holocultural studies''' or '''comparative studies''', is a specialization in [[anthropology]] and sister sciences ([[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[political science]]) that uses field data from many [[Society|societies]] to examine the scope of [[human behavior]] and test hypotheses about human behavior and culture. Cross-cultural studies is the third form of cross-cultural comparisons. The first is comparison of case studies, the second is controlled comparison among variants of a common derivation,{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} and the third is comparison within a sample of cases. Unlike comparative studies, which examines similar characteristics of a few societies, cross-cultural studies uses a sufficiently large sample so that statistical analysis can be made to show relationships or lack of relationships between the traits in question. These studies are surveys of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] data.

Cross-cultural studies are applied widely in the [[social science]]s, particularly in [[cultural anthropology]] and [[psychology]].

==History==
The first cross-cultural studies were carried out by 19th-century anthropologists such as [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and [[Lewis H. Morgan]]. One of Edward Tylor's first studies gave rise to the central statistical issue of cross-cultural studies: [[Galton's problem]]. In the recent decades historians and particularly historians of science started looking at the mechanism and networks by which knowledge, ideas, skills, instruments and books moved across cultures, generating new and fresh concepts concerning the order of things in nature. In ''Cross-Cultural Scientific Exchanges in the Eastern Mediterranean 1560–1660'' Avner Ben-Zaken has argued that cross-cultural exchanges take place at a cultural hazy locus where the margins of one culture overlaps the other, creating a "mutually embraced zone" where exchanges take place on mundane ways. From such a stimulating zone, ideas, styles, instruments and practices move onward to the cultural centers, urging them to renew and update cultural notions.&lt;ref&gt;Avner Ben-Zaken, "From "Incommensurability of Cultures" to Mutually Embraced Zones" in ''Cross-Cultural Scientific Exchanges In the Eastern Mediterranean 1560-1660'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010)], pp. 163-167. {{ISBN|9780801894763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era of cross-cultural studies==

The modern era of cross-cultural studies began with [[George Murdock]] (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Whiting (1986:305)&lt;/ref&gt; Murdock set up a number of foundational data sets, including the [[Human Relations Area Files]], and the ''Ethnographic Atlas.'' Together with [[Douglas R. White]], he developed the widely used [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]], currently maintained by the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] electronic journal [[World Cultures]].

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
The {{Nihongo|'''''dangibon'''''|談義本|}} was a pre-modern Japanese literary genre. Texts were written in a humorous, satirical sermon-style with the purpose of educating the masses. It is type of [[gesaku]].

==Developments==
{{Nihongo|Masuho Zankō|増穂残口|}} and {{Nihongo|Issai Chozan|佚斎樗山|}} are credited with establishing the early foundations upon which the genre rests. In 1715, Masuho wrote {{Nihongo|''Endō Tukugan''|艶道通鑑|}}, and in 1727 Issai wrote {{Nihongo|''Inaka Sōji''|田舎荘子|}}. These two texts are early forerunners of the genre. However, the genre is not fully realized until several decades later. In 1752, {{Nihongo|Jōkanbō Kōa|静観房好阿|}} wrote {{Nihongo|''Imayō Heta Dangi''|当世下手談義||"A Clumsy Sermon in the Modern Manner"}}, which is identified as the first true example of the dangibon genre.

The genre existed between the 1752 c. 1800, reaching "the height of their popularity in the 1750s."&lt;ref&gt;Keene (1976: 412)&lt;/ref&gt; It gradually evolved into the [[kokkeibon]] genre at the start of the 19th century.

{{Postmodernism}}

'''Deconstructivism''' is a movement of [[postmodern architecture]] which appeared in the 1980s, which gives the impression of the fragmentation of the constructed building.  It is characterized by an absence of harmony, continuity, or symmetry. {{Sfn|Taschen|Taschen|2016|page=148}}   Its name comes from the idea of "[[Deconstruction]]", a form of [[semiotic]] analysis developed by the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]].  Architects whose work is often described as deconstructionism (though in many cases the architects themselves reject the label)  include [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], and [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]. {{Sfn|Taschen|Taschen|2016|page=148}}    

Besides fragmentation,  Deconstructivism often manipulates the structure's surface skin and creates by non-[[Rectilinear polygon|rectilinear]] shapes which appear to distort and dislocate [[Design principles and elements|elements of architecture]]. The finished visual appearance is characterized by unpredictability and controlled chaos.

==History, context and influences==

Deconstructivism came to public notice with the 1982 [[Parc de la Villette]] [[architectural design competition]], in particular the entry from [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Peter Eisenman]]&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman, ''Chora L Works'' (New York: Monacelli Press, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; and the winning entry by [[Bernard Tschumi]], as well as the [[Museum of Modern Art]]’s 1988 ''Deconstructivist Architecture'' exhibition in New York, organized by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Mark Wigley]]. Tschumi stated that calling the work of these architects a "movement" or a new "style" was out of context and showed a lack of understanding of their ideas, and believed that Deconstructivism was simply a move against the practice of [[Postmodernism]], which he said involved "making doric temple forms out of plywood".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tschumi.com/news/33/ Rem Koolhaas and Bernard Tschumi in Conversation, 18 May 2001, ETH Zürich.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influential exhibitions include the 1989 opening of the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], designed by Peter Eisenman. The New York exhibition has featured works by [[Frank Gehry]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]], and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Since their exhibitions, some architects associated with Deconstructivism have distanced themselves from it; nonetheless, the term has stuck and has come to embrace a general trend within contemporary architecture.

===Modernism and postmodernism===
[[File:Seattle Central Library, Seattle, Washington - 20060418.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Seattle Central Library]] by [[Rem Koolhaas]] and [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture|OMA]]]]

The term "Deconstructivism" in [[contemporary architecture]] is opposed to the ordered rationality of [[Modern architecture|Modernism]] and [[postmodern architecture|Postmodernism]]. Though postmodernist and nascent deconstructivist architects both published in the journal ''[[Oppositions]]'' (between 1943 and 1954), that journal's contents mark a decisive break between the two movements. Deconstructivism took a confrontational stance to [[architectural history]], wanting to "disassemble" architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Tschumi, ''Architecture and Disjunction''&lt;/ref&gt; While postmodernism returned to embrace the historical references that modernism had shunned, possibly ironically, deconstructivism rejected the postmodern acceptance of such references, as well as the idea of ornament as an after-thought or decoration.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In addition to ''Oppositions'', a defining text for both deconstructivism and postmodernism was [[Robert Venturi]]'s ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'' (1966). It argues against the purity, clarity and simplicity of modernism. With its publication, [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] and [[Rationalism (architecture)|rationalism]], the two main branches of modernism, were overturned as paradigms. The reading of the postmodernist Venturi was that ornament and historical allusion added a richness to architecture that modernism had foregone. Some Postmodern architects endeavored to reapply ornament even to economical and minimal buildings, described by Venturi as "the decorated shed." Rationalism of design was dismissed but the functionalism of the building was still somewhat intact. This is close to the thesis of Venturi's next major work,&lt;ref&gt;Venturi, ''Learning From Las Vegas''&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and ornament can be applied to a pragmatic architecture, and instill the philosophic complexities of [[Semiotics|semiology]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The deconstructivist reading of ''Complexity and Contradiction'' is quite different. The basic building was the subject of problematics and intricacies in deconstructivism, with no detachment for ornament. Rather than separating ornament and function, like postmodernists such as Venturi, the functional aspects of buildings were called into question. Geometry was to deconstructivists what ornament was to postmodernists, the subject of complication, and this complication of geometry was in turn, applied to the functional, structural, and spatial aspects of deconstructivist buildings. One example of deconstructivist complexity is [[Frank Gehry]]'s [[Vitra Design Museum]] in Weil-am-Rhein, which takes the typical unadorned white cube of modernist [[art gallery|art galleries]] and deconstructs it, using geometries reminiscent of cubism and abstract expressionism. This subverts the functional aspects of modernist simplicity while taking modernism, particularly the international style, of which its white stucco skin is reminiscent, as a starting point. Another example of the deconstructivist reading of ''Complexity and Contradiction'' is [[Peter Eisenman]]'s [[Wexner Center for the Arts]]. The Wexner Center takes the archetypal form of the [[castle]], which it then imbues with complexity in a series of cuts and fragmentations. A three-dimensional grid, runs somewhat arbitrarily through the building. The grid, as a reference to modernism, of which it is an accoutrement, collides with the medieval antiquity of a castle. Some of the grid's columns intentionally don't reach the ground, hovering over stairways creating a sense of neurotic unease and contradicting the structural purpose of the [[column]]. The Wexner Center deconstructs the archetype of the castle and renders its spaces and structure with conflict and difference.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Deconstructivist philosophy===
[[File:ImperialWarMuseumNorth01.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Daniel Libeskind|Libeskind]]'s [[Imperial War Museum North]] in [[Trafford]], [[Greater Manchester]] (2002). An archetype of deconstructivist architecture, it comprises three fragmented, intersecting curved volumes, symbolizing the destruction of war.]]

Some Deconstructivist architects were influenced by the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]. Eisenman was a friend of Derrida, but even so his approach to architectural design was developed long before he became a Deconstructivist. For him Deconstructivism should be considered an extension of his interest in radical formalism. Some practitioners of deconstructivism were also influenced by the formal experimentation and geometric imbalances of Russian [[Constructivist architecture|constructivism]]. There are additional references in deconstructivism to 20th-century movements: the [[modernism]]/[[postmodernism]] interplay, [[Expressionist architecture|expressionism]], [[cubism]], [[minimalism]] and [[contemporary art]]. Deconstructivism attempts to move away from the supposedly constricting 'rules' of modernism such as "[[form follows function]]," "[[purism (arts)|purity of form]]," and "[[truth to materials]]."{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The main channel from deconstructivist philosophy to [[architectural theory]] was through the philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]'s influence with [[Peter Eisenman]]. Eisenman drew some philosophical bases from the literary movement [[Deconstruction]], and collaborated directly with Derrida on projects including an entry for the [[Parc de la Villette]] competition, documented in ''Chora l Works''. Both Derrida and Eisenman, as well as [[Daniel Libeskind]]&lt;ref&gt;Libeskind, Daniel. [http://www.daniel-libeskind.com/projects/show-all/imperial-war-museum-north/ "Imperial War Museum North Earth Time"] quote ''"This project develops the realm of the in between, the inter-est.... Pointing to that which is absent"''. Retrieved April, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; were concerned with the "[[metaphysics of presence]]," and this is the main subject of deconstructivist philosophy in architecture theory. The presupposition is that architecture is a language capable of communicating meaning and of receiving treatments by methods of linguistic philosophy.&lt;ref name="Curl"&gt;{{cite book|last=Curl|first=James Stevens|title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|year=2006|type=Paperback|edition=Second|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialectic of presence and absence, or solid and void occurs in much of Eisenman's projects, both built and unbuilt. Both Derrida and Eisenman believe that the locus, or place of presence, is architecture, and the same dialectic of presence and absence is found in construction and deconstructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman and Derrida, ''Choral Works''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Derrida, readings of texts are best carried out when working with classical narrative structures. Any architectural deconstructivism requires the existence of a particular archetypal ''con''struction, a strongly-established conventional expectation to play flexibly against.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, ''Of Grammatology''&lt;/ref&gt; The design of [[Frank Gehry]]’s own [[Santa Monica]] residence, (from 1978), has been cited as a prototypical deconstructivist building. His starting point was a prototypical suburban house embodied with a typical set of intended social meanings. Gehry altered its massing, spatial envelopes, planes and other expectations in a playful subversion, an act of "de"construction"&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, Robert (1994).[http://www.mindyourownweb.co.uk/hosted/index.php?view=mattaclarking&amp;pageid=85&amp;PHPSESSID=c5e9dc8f3f4a6cfd3bc3216856fe17d8 "Mattaclarking"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517013252/http://www.mindyourownweb.co.uk/hosted/index.php?view=mattaclarking&amp;pageid=85&amp;PHPSESSID=c5e9dc8f3f4a6cfd3bc3216856fe17d8 |date=2007-05-17 }} Dissertation Exploring the work of Gordon Matta-Clark. Retrieved April, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Derrida's concepts of the metaphysics of presence and deconstructivism, his notions of trace and erasure, embodied in his philosophy of writing and arche-writing&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, ''Of Grammatology'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; found their way into deconstructivist [[memorial]]s. Daniel Libeskind envisioned many of his early projects as a form of writing or discourse on writing and often works with a form of [[concrete poetry]]. He made architectural sculptures out of books and often coated the models in texts, openly making his architecture refer to writing. The notions of trace and erasure were taken up by Libeskind in essays and in his project for the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]]. The museum is conceived as a trace of the erasure of the [[Holocaust]], intended to make its subject legible and poignant. Memorials such as [[Maya Lin]]'s [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] and Peter Eisenman's [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]] are also said to reflect themes of trace and erasure.

===Constructivism and Russian Futurism===
Another major current in deconstructivist architecture takes inspiration from the Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] and [[Russian futurism|Futurist]] movements of the early twentieth century, both in their graphics and in their visionary architecture, little of which was actually constructed.

Artists [[Naum Gabo]], [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], and [[Alexander Rodchenko]], have influenced the graphic sense of geometric forms of deconstructivist architects such as [[Zaha Hadid]] and [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]. Both Deconstructivism and Constructivism have been concerned with the tectonics of making an abstract assemblage. Both were concerned with the radical simplicity of geometric forms as the primary artistic content, expressed in graphics, sculpture and architecture. The Constructivist tendency toward [[purism (arts)|purism]], though, is absent in Deconstructivism: form is often deformed when construction is deconstructed. Also lessened or absent is the advocacy of [[socialism|socialist]] and [[collectivism|collectivist]] causes.

The primary graphic motifs of constructivism were the rectangular bar and the triangular wedge, others were the more basic geometries of the square and the circle. In his series ''Prouns'', El Lizzitzky assembled collections of geometries at various angles floating free in space. They evoke basic structural units such as bars of steel or sawn lumber loosely attached, piled, or scattered. They were also often [[Technical drawing|drafted]] and share aspects with [[technical drawing]] and [[engineering drawing]]. Similar in composition is the deconstructivist series ''Micromegas'' by Daniel Libeskind.

{{Quotation|The symbolic breakdown of the wall effected by introducing the Constructivist motifs of tilted and crossed bars sets up a subversion of the walls that define the bar itself. ... This apparent chaos actually constructs the walls that define the bar; it is the structure. The internal disorder produces the bar while splitting it even as gashes open up along its length.|Phillip Johnson and Mark Wigley|Deconstructive Architecture|p. 34}}

===Contemporary art===
Two strains of modern art, [[minimalism]] and [[cubism]], have had an influence on deconstructivism. [[Analytical cubism]] had a sure effect on deconstructivism, as forms and content are dissected and viewed from different perspectives simultaneously. A synchronicity of disjoined space is evident in many of the works of [[Frank Gehry]] and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. [[Synthetic cubism]], with its application of [[found object]] art, is not as great an influence on deconstructivism as [[Analytical cubism]], but is still found in the earlier and more vernacular works of Frank Gehry. Deconstructivism also shares with minimalism a disconnection from cultural references. &lt;!---It also often shares with minimalism, notions of [[conceptual art]].{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} ---&gt;

With its tendency toward deformation and dislocation, there is also an aspect of [[expressionism]] and [[expressionist architecture]] associated with deconstructivism. At times deconstructivism mirrors varieties of expressionism, [[neo-expressionism]], and [[abstract expressionism]] as well. The angular forms of the Ufa Cinema Center by Coop Himmelb(l)au recall the abstract geometries of the numbered paintings of [[Franz Kline]], in their unadorned masses. The UFA Cinema Center also would make a likely setting for the angular figures depicted in urban German street scenes by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]]. The work of [[Wassily Kandinsky]] also bears similarities to deconstructivist architecture. His movement into abstract expressionism and away from figurative work,&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, "Point and Line to Plane"&lt;/ref&gt; is in the same spirit as the deconstructivist rejection of ornament for geometries.

Several artists in the 1980s and 1990s contributed work that influenced or took part in deconstructivism. [[Maya Lin]] and [[Rachel Whiteread]] are two examples. Lin's 1982 project for the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], with its granite slabs severing the ground plane, is one. Its shard-like form and reduction of content to a minimalist text influenced deconstructivism, with its sense of fragmentation and emphasis on reading the monument. Lin also contributed work for Eisenman's Wexner Center. Rachel Whiteread's cast architectural spaces are another instance where [[contemporary art]] is confluent with architecture. ''Ghost'' (1990), an entire living space cast in plaster, solidifying the void, alludes to Derrida's notion of architectural presence. [[Gordon Matta-Clark]]'s ''Building cuts'' were deconstructed sections of buildings exhibited in art galleries.

===1988 MoMA exhibition===
[[Mark Wigley]] and [[Philip Johnson]] curated the 1988 [[Museum of Modern Art]] exhibition ''Deconstructivist architecture'', which crystallized the movement, and brought fame and notoriety to its key practitioners. The architects presented at the exhibition were [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Coop Himmelblau]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Mark Wigley wrote the accompanying essay and tried to show a common thread among the various architects whose work was usually more noted for their differences.

{{Quotation|The projects in this exhibition mark a different sensibility, one in which the dream of pure form has been disturbed.

It is the ability to disturb our thinking about form that makes these projects deconstructive.

The show examines an episode, a point of intersection between several architects where each constructs an unsettling building by exploiting the hidden potential of modernism.
|Phillip Johnson and Mark Wigley, excerpt from the MoMA ''Deconstructivist Architecture'' catalog}}

===Computer-aided design===
[[Computer aided design]] is now an essential tool in most aspects of contemporary architecture, but the particular nature of deconstructivism makes the use of computers especially pertinent. Three-dimensional modelling and animation (virtual and physical) assists in the conception of very complicated spaces, while the ability to link computer models to manufacturing jigs (CAM - [[Computer-aided manufacturing]]) allows the mass production of subtly different modular elements to be achieved at affordable costs. In retrospect many early deconstructivist works appear to have been conceived with the aid of a computer, but were not; [[Zaha Hadid]]'s sketches for instance. Also, Gehry is noted for producing many physical models as well as computer models as part of his design process. Though the computer has made the designing of complex shapes much easier, not everything that looks odd is "deconstructivist."

==Critical responses==
Since the publication of [[Kenneth Frampton]]'s ''Modern Architecture: A Critical History'' (first edition 1980) there has been a keen consciousness of the role of criticism within architectural theory. Whilst referencing Derrida as a philosophical influence, deconstructivism can also be seen as having as much a basis in [[critical theory]] as the other major offshoot of postmodernism, [[critical regionalism]]. The two aspects of critical theory, urgency and analysis, are found in deconstructivism. There is a tendency to re-examine and critique other works or precedents in deconstructivism, and also a tendency to set aesthetic issues in the foreground. An example of this is the [[Wexner Center]]. [[Critical Theory]], however, had at its core a critique of capitalism and its excess, and from that respect many of the works of the Deconstructivists would fail in that regard if only they are made for an elite and are, as objects, highly expensive, despite whatever critique they may claim to impart on the conventions of design.

The difference between criticality in deconstructivism and criticality in critical regionalism, is that critical regionalism ''reduces'' the overall level of complexity involved and maintains a clearer analysis while attempting to reconcile modernist architecture with local differences. In effect, this leads to a modernist "vernacular." Critical regionalism displays a lack of self-criticism and a [[utopia]]nism of place. Deconstructivism, meanwhile, maintains a level of self-criticism, as well as external criticism and tends towards maintaining a level of complexity. Some architects identified with the movement, notably [[Frank Gehry]], have actively rejected the classification of their work as deconstructivist.&lt;ref&gt;Said Frank Gehry of Eisenman's [[Aronoff Center]], "The best thing about Peter's buildings is the insane spaces he ends up with.... All that other stuff, the philosophy and all, is just bullshit as far as I'm concerned." Quoted in Peter Eisenman, ''Peter Eisenman: 1990-1997'', ed. Richard C. Levene and Fernando Márquez Cecilia (Madrid: El Croquis Editorial, 1997), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of deconstructivism see it as a purely formal exercise with little social significance. [[Kenneth Frampton]] finds it "elitist and detached".&lt;ref&gt;Frampton, Kenneth. ''Modern Architecture: A Critical History''. Thames &amp; Hudson, 3rd edition, 1992, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikos Salingaros]] calls deconstructivism a "viral expression" that invades design thinking in order to build destroyed forms; while curiously similar to both Derrida's and Philip Johnson's descriptions, this is meant as a harsh condemnation of the entire movement.&lt;ref&gt;Salingaros, Nikos. "Anti-Architecture and Deconstruction", Umbau-Verlag, 3rd edition, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms are similar to those of deconstructivist philosophy—that since the act of deconstructivism is not an empirical process, it can result in whatever an architect wishes, and it thus suffers from a lack of consistency. Today there is a sense that the philosophical underpinnings of the beginning of the movement have been lost, and all that is left is the aesthetic of deconstructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Chakraborty, Judhajit; Deconstruction: From Philosophy to Design]. Arizona State University, retrieved June 2006. "Today, in the mid 90s the term 'deconstructivism' is used casually to label any work that favours complexity over simplicity and dramatises the formal possibilities of digital production."&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms reject the premise that architecture is a language capable of being the subject of linguistic philosophy, or, if it was a language in the past, critics claim it is no longer.&lt;ref name="Curl"/&gt; Others question the wisdom and impact on future generations of an architecture that rejects the past and presents no clear values as replacements and which often pursues strategies that are intentionally aggressive to human senses.&lt;ref name="Curl"/&gt;

The '''Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic''' ('''ASNC''' or, informally, '''ASNaC''') is one of the constituent departments of the [[University of Cambridge]], and focuses on the history, material culture, languages and literatures of the various peoples who inhabited [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]] and the extended [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian world]] in the early Middle Ages (5th century to 12th century). It is based on the second floor of the Faculty of English at [[West Road, Cambridge|9 West Road]]. In Cambridge University jargon, its students are called ''ASNaCs''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Shakespeare]], [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27731725 'A Point of View: Taking England back to the Dark Ages'], ''BBC News Magazine'', 6 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains the only university faculty or department in the world to focus entirely on the early Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hugh Magennis, ''The Cambridge Introduction to Anglo-Saxon Literature'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The study of Anglo-Saxon England and its neighbouring regions has deep roots at Cambridge, beginning with the sixteenth-century Archbishop [[Matthew Parker]]. The first half of the seventeenth century saw [[Abraham Wheelocke]] hold a readership in Anglo-Saxon, and in 1657 [[John Spelman]] bestowed on [[William Somner]] the annual stipend of the Anglo-Saxon lecture founded by his father, [[Sir Henry Spelman]], at Cambridge, enabling him to complete the first Old English dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum, voces, phrasesque praecipuas Anglo-Saxonicas. . . cum Latina et Anglica vocum interpretatione complectens. . . Aecesserunt Aelfrici Abbatis Grammatica Latino-Saxonica cum glossario suo ejusdem generis,' 2 pts, Oxford, 1659; 2nd edit, with additions by [[Thomas Benson (scholar)|Thomas Benson]], 1701.&lt;/ref&gt; After a lull in interest in Old English, in the nineteenth century, [[John Mitchell Kemble]] developed the study of Old English and Anglo-Saxon archaeology at Trinity College, and [[Joseph Bosworth]], another Anglo-Saxonist who was associated with Trinity, endowed the [[Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon|Elrington and Bosworth Chair]] in Anglo-Saxon, established in 1878, and first held by [[Walter William Skeat]]. Strengths at Cambridge in Old Norse were built up by [[Eiríkr Magnússon|Eiríkur Magnússon]] (1833–1913) and in Celtic studies by [[Edmund Crosby Quiggin]] (1875–1920).

The ASNaC Department as such has its origins in the work and ideas of Skeat's successor as Elrington and Bosworth Professor, [[Hector Munro Chadwick]], of Clare College. Chadwick took a leading role in integrating the philological study of Old English with archaeology and history and, by bringing the study of Old English from the Faculty of English to Archaeology and Anthropology in 1928, founded what was to become the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic:&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the University of Cambridge'', ed. by [[Christopher N. L. Brooke|Christopher Brooke]], 4 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988–2004), IV (Peter Searby, ''1890–1990''), 445. See further [[Allen Frantzen]], 'By the Numbers: Anglo-Saxon Scholarship at the Century's End', in ''A Companion to Anglo-Saxon Literature'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano and Elaine Treharne (Oxford: Blackwell, 2001), DOI: 10.1111/b.9780631209041.2001.00030.x (pp. 478-80).&lt;/ref&gt; 'Chadwick's aim ... was to keep Old English studies free from philology (as it was then practised), but also from the dominance of English Literature'.&lt;ref&gt;John Walmesley, ' "A Term of Opprobrium": Twentieth Century Linguistics and English Philology', in ''History of Linguistics 2008'', ed. by Gerda Hassler, Studies in the History of the Language Sciences, 115 (Amsterdam: Benjamins, 2008), pp. 35-47 (at p. 39).&lt;/ref&gt; However, 'the alliance of Anglo-Saxon and archaeology suited the professor and not the students; and in the 1960s Professor [[Dorothy Whitelock]] led the Saxon flock back into the English fold'--specifically in 1967, though the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology continues to sustain strengths in Anglo-Saxon and early medieval archaeology, with relevant archaeology papers being available to ASNaCs.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the University of Cambridge'', ed. by Christopher Brooke, 4 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988–2004), IV (Peter Searby, ''1890–1990''), 445, 202; Jana K. Schulman, 'An Anglo-Saxonist at Oxford and Cambridge: Dorothy Whitelock (1901–1982)', in ''Women Medievalists and the Academy'', ed. by [[Jane Chance]] (Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), pp. 553-62 (at pp. 559-60).&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglo-Saxon and Kindred Studies Tripos was introduced as a single-part (two-year) Tripos in 1957, the class list being published under the title 'Anglo-Saxon'; in 1971 this was relabelled 'Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic' under [[Peter Clemoes]].&lt;ref&gt;E. S. Leedham-Green, ''A Concise History of the University of Cambridge'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), pp. 226-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, under the leadership of [[Michael Lapidge]], ASNC became a two-part (three-year) Tripos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/about/history.htm Departmental History, Department of ASNC]&lt;/ref&gt; The Elrington and Bosworth Professor was customarily the head of the ASNaC Department, until a rotating headship system was introduced during the professorship of [[Simon Keynes]] in the early twenty-first century.

The name ASNC or ASNaC is pronounced /{{IPA|'æznæk}}/, and originally denoted members of the ASNC Society rather than of the Department. It was coined as a pun on an early poster for the ASNC Society Lunches: 'A Snack for ASNACs'.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Harvey, ''The Origin of ASNaC'', Chadwick Lecture Addendum 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Students in the department were referred to in English as Asnackers, in French as Asnaciennes or Asnaques, and in German as Asnäckische.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later the simpler term 'Asnacs' came into common use.

In 2015 the department was the subject of the scholarly article collection ''H M Chadwick and the Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge'', edited by [[Michael Lapidge]] (CMCS Publications).

== Major research projects ==

In the 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] the department was rated as the top Celtic Studies department in the UK, and one of the top departments and faculties within the University of Cambridge, with 75% of its submitted research rated internationally excellent (3*) or world-leading (4*).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Because of its strongly interdisciplinary nature, elements of the Department's research were considered by the panels for History, English and Classics as well as Celtic Studies.

In collaboration with [[King's College London]], since 2005 the department has developed and organised the free-access [[Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet L. Nelson, 'From Building Site to Building: The ''Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England'' (''PASE'') Project', in ''Collaborative Research in the Digital Humanities'', ed. by Marilyn Deegan, Willard McCarty (Farnham: Ashgate, 2012), pp. 123-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Languages taught ==

Language-study is central to ASNaC degree programmes, and the Department is a major training ground in these skills for researchers in early medieval history. The Department provides ''ab initio'' tuition in Old English, Old Norse, Old Irish, Middle Welsh, and Latin.

Despite the Department's medieval focus, its pre-eminence as a UK centre of Scandinavian and Celtic studies has led both the Irish and Icelandic governments to provide grants for the teaching of Modern Irish and Icelandic (respectively) to members of Cambridge University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/currentstudents/icelandic/, http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/currentstudents/irish/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Students==
=== Applications and admissions ===

Between 1900 and 1999, around 860 students studied in the Department or its precursor institutions. Between 1900 and 1946, 68% were women; thereafter there was a slight majority of men until 1980; and rough gender parity 1980-1999.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lapidge, 'Introduction: The Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge, 1878-1999', in ''H. M. Chadwick and the Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge'', ed. by Michael Lapidge (Aberystwyth: Department of Welsh, Abersytwyth University, 2015), pp. 1-58 {{ISBN|9780955718298}} [=''Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies'', 69/70], pp. 1-58 (p. 41).&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2012, between 50 and 60 applicants applied for the ASNC BA per year; about 53% were offered places; and about 43% (20-25 students) accepted their offers.&lt;ref name="cam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/apply/statistics/.|title=Undergraduate Study|publisher=study.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undergraduate student body is majority female (⅔ for the 2011 admissions cycle) and has a strong preponderance of state-school leavers (84% of home students for the 2011 admissions cycle).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/apply/statistics/archive/admissionsstatistics2011.pdf, pp. 12, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===ASNaC Society===

The department has an affiliated student society, the ASNaC Society. It is recorded as hosting academic papers as early as 1971.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. W. Hunter, 'The Study of Anglo-Saxon Architecture Since 1770: An Evaluation', ''Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society'', 66 (1975-76), 129-39 (p. 129).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Clement, '[https://www.oenewsletter.org/OEN/archive/OEN13_1.pdf University of Cambridge Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic Society', ''Old English Newsletter'', 13.1 (Fall 1979), 8.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Rollason, 'The Cults of Murdered Royal Saints in Anglo-Saxon England', ''Anglo-Saxon England'', 11 (1982), 1-22 (p. 1 fn 1), {{DOI|10.1017/S0263675100002544}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael Lapidge]], &lt;blockquote&gt;From the mid-1980s onward, the combined number of undergraduate nd graduate students reached (which might be described as) a critical mass, with the result that there was a very palpable surge in corporate spirit and concomitant pride in being an 'ASNaC', a member of a small but elite group of students distinguished throughout the University for its academic attainments.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Society organises a weekly 'ASNaC Lunch', field trips, punting expeditions, dinners, and ASNaC mugs and sweatshirts.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lapidge, 'Introduction: The Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge, 1878-1999', in ''H. M. Chadwick and the Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge'', ed. by Michael Lapidge (Aberystwyth: Department of Welsh, Abersytwyth University, 2015), pp. 1-58 {{ISBN|9780955718298}} [=''Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies'', 69/70], pp. 1-58 (pp. 44-45, quoting p. 44).&lt;/ref&gt; The Society is also noted for producing the (mostly) twice yearly ''Gesta Asnacorum'', founded by [[Tom Shakespeare]], which satirises the life of the Department and the medieval texts and modern scholarship it studies.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Asnacorum. 'Gesta Asnacorum', 1985–1995: The First Ten Years'', ed. by Richard Fairhurst (Cambridge: The Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, 1997), p. 7; http://www.srcf.ucam.org/asnac/data/gesta.php.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the ''Gesta Asnacorum'' is merely a scurrilous student rag, it does feature the [[juvenilia]] of many alumni of the department who have gone on to become prominent historians.

=== Alumni ===

ASNaCs have gone into many walks of life, but a significant proportion of academics in the fields of early medieval European literature and history, particularly in Celtic studies, have studied or taught at the department, making it a historically highly influential institution in its field. Academically prominent alumni of the department or its forerunner institutions who are not listed above as staff include:

*[[Florence Harmer]] (matriculated before 1920)
*[[Audrey Meaney]] (graduated 1959)
*[[David Denison]]
*[[Philip Jenkins]] (matriculated c. 1970)
*[[Sarah Foot]] (matriculated 1979)
* [[Julia Crick]] (matriculated 1982)

Other noted alumni include:

* [[Jane Stevenson]], historian and novelist (matriculated c. 1980)
* [[Tom Shakespeare]], academic and disability campaigner (matriculated 1984)
* [[Stephan Grundy]], novelist (graduated 1995)
* [[Elin Manahan Thomas]], opera singer (matriculated 1995)
* [[Dan Starkey (actor)]], actor (matriculated 1996)
* [[Rebecca Dowbiggin]], rower (matriculated c. 2001)

== Appearances in popular culture ==

Maria, the protagonist of Thomas Thurman's children's book ''Not Ordinarily Borrowable; or, Unwelcome Advice'', is an Asnac (there characterised as 'a person who studies the way people lived a long, long time ago, far longer ago than the time when Maria lived, and looks at the things they made and the writings they left behind').&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Thurman, ''Not Ordinarily Borrowable; or, Unwelcome Advice'' ([n.p.]: CreateSpace, 2009), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Musicology''' is an institute of [[Palacký University]] [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]], which conducts research and provides education in the fields of [[musicology]] and [[Fine art#Academic study|fine art]]. While the Faculty of Philosophy dates back to 1576 and has provided education for a number of [[Aesthetics|art theorists]], the separate Department of Musicology was established in 1946. It is sited in the building of University Art Centre (former Jesuit College), together with other two art departments of Faculty of Philosophy and two art departments of [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Education|Faculty of Education]].

Established in 1573, the [[Palacký University of Olomouc]] has a long history of musical scholarship. Olomouc prominently excels in the sphere of [[classical music]] ([[Jacobus Gallus|J. H. Gallus]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|W. A. Mozart]], [[Antonín Dvořák|A. Dvořák]], [[Gustav Mahler|G. Mahler]], [[Jan Kubelík|J. Kubelík]], [[Ema Destinová|E. Destinová]], who all spent some part of their lives in Olomouc). Among the Olomouc University graduates are both [[Aesthetics|art theorists]] ([[Karel Slavíček]], [[Raphael Georg Kiesewetter]], [[Rudolf Eitelberger]], etc.) as well as composers ([[Pavel Vranický]], [[Pavel Křížkovský]], [[Eduard Schön]], [[Emil Viklický]], etc.).

The modern tradition of musicological research and education goes back to 1946 when the ''Institute of Music Education and Science'' was established at the [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] by [[Robert Smetana]] (1904–1988). 1960’s &amp; 70’s saw a strong growth of the department (since 1972 led by [[Vladimír Hudec]]; however, the institute was  transformed into the ''Department of Music Education'' and transferred to the [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Education|Faculty of Education]] in 1980 by the decision of the Ministry of Education.

Soon after the [[Velvet revolution|fall of the communist régime]] in 1989, the [[musicology]] returned to the ground of Philosophical Faculty, this time as part of the ''Department of Combined Art Studies''. Independent '''Department of Musicology''' was renewed in 1992 and through the enthusiasm of excellent professionals grew into a modern academic institution. Since 2002 it is sited in the ''University Art Centre'', former Jesuit College building, together with another two art departments of the Faculty of Philosophy and two art departments of the Faculty of Education.

==Current Research Objectives &amp; Other Activities==
Research has a fundamental role for the Department. The Department hosts the annual ''International Musicological Conference'' (usually late November) and regular public workshops and seminars which are enriched by occasional activities such as conference on ''Zdeněk Fibich - the 19th Century Middle European Composer'' held in spring 2010.

The Department’s activities embrace a wide variety of modes of research (Regional and [[History|Historical Studies]], [[Organology]], [[Critical Edition of Musical Sources]], [[Jazz]], [[Art Rock]], [[Film Music]], and so on). Department’s research is  supported by a major funds from the [[European Union]] and [[Politics of the Czech Republic|Czech Government]] (principal among these are the ''Correspondence of Vítězslav Novák between 1890-1905'', ''Correspondence of Vítězslav Novák between 1906-1949'', ''Zdeněk Fibich’s 19th century Operas'', ''Moravia and the World'' ...). Department participated on ''Music Media Training Programme For the Czech Republic (1995 - 1998)'' and ''Musical Life in Europe (1997 - 2001)''. Since 1997 the Department is linked to [[Saint Cloud State University]] through the ''Art and Music in the Czech Republic Programme''.

The Department also benefits from a number of collaborative research and educational partnerships, including those with

Miller]], [[Christopher Shultis]] and others).

As part of the University's [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]], the Department of Musicology offers [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]], [[Master's degree|Master's]] and [[Ph.D.|Doctoral]] degrees in the fields of [[Musicology]] and [[Arts integration]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4763">The '''Diderot effect''' is a social phenomenon related to [[consumer goods]] that comprises two ideas. The first posits that goods purchased by consumers will be cohesive to their sense of identity, and as a result, will be complementary to one another. The second states that the introduction of a new possession that is deviant from the consumer's current complementary goods can result in a process of spiraling consumption. The term was coined by [[anthropologist]] and scholar of consumption patterns [[Grant McCracken]] in 1988, and is named after the French philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784), who first described the effect in an [[essay]].

The term has become common in discussions of [[sustainable consumption]] and [[green consumerism]], in regard to the process whereby a purchase or gift creates dissatisfaction with existing possessions and environment, provoking a potentially spiraling pattern of consumption with negative environmental, psychological and social impacts. 

==Origin==
The effect was first described in Diderot's essay "Regrets on Parting with My Old Dressing Gown". Here he tells how the gift of a beautiful scarlet dressing gown leads to unexpected results, eventually plunging him into debt. Initially pleased with the gift, Diderot came to rue his new garment. Compared to his elegant new dressing gown, the rest of his possessions began to seem tawdry and he became dissatisfied that they did not live up to the elegance and style of his new possession. He replaced his old straw chair, for example, with an armchair covered in Moroccan leather; his old desk was replaced with an expensive new writing table; his formerly beloved prints were replaced with more costly prints, and so on. "I was absolute master of my old dressing gown", Diderot writes, "but I have become a slave to my new one … Beware of the contamination of sudden wealth. The poor man may take his ease without thinking of appearances, but the rich man is always under a strain".

==Usage==
In McCracken's usage the Diderot effect is the result of the interaction between objects within "product complements", or "Diderot unities", and consumers. A Diderot unity is a group of objects that are considered to be culturally complementary, in relation to one another. For example, items of clothing, furniture, vehicles, etc. McCracken describes that a consumer is less likely to veer from a preferred Diderot unity in order to strive towards unity in appearance and representation of one's social role. However, it can also mean that if an object that is somehow deviant from the preferred Diderot unity is acquired, it may have the effect of causing the consumer to start subscribing to a completely different Diderot unity.

Sociologist and economist [[Juliet Schor]] uses the term in her best selling 1992 book ''The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don't Need'' to describe processes of competitive, status-conscious consumption driven by dissatisfaction. Schor's 2005 essay "Learning Diderot’s Lesson: Stopping the Upward Creep of Desire" describes the effect in contemporary consumer culture in the context of its negative environmental consequences.

The '''Tech Partnership''' (formerly "e-skills UK") is the United Kingdom (UK)'s [[Sector Skills Councils|sector skills council]] for the [[Information technology|IT]] industry, also known as "Business and Information Technology" or "IT &amp; Telecoms."
It is based in [[central London]]. Karen Price [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] is the chief executive officer.&lt;ref name=price/&gt;

The [[Nonprofit organization|not-for-profit organisation]] works to co-operatively address technology-related skills issues through [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based]] advice, services and programmes.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt; It is led by its [[Advocacy group|constituency]], to operate in the interests of employers by ensuring that the UK is equipped to compete in the worldwide [[digital economy]].&lt;ref name="business"&gt;{{cite web|title=About e-skills UK|url=http://www.businessitguide.com/page/about-us/|work=Business IT Guide – IT explained|publisher=e-skills UK|accessdate=30 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2000–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

e-skills UK aims to address the current and future needs of the Business and Information Technology sector in the UK, including [[skills shortage]]s and [[gender inequality]] in the UK IT industry. The group publishes the ''e-skills Bulletin'', and the ''Regional Gap-UK'' report on [[skills gap]]s. The ''Technology Insights'' report details which skills are most needed.

The group has also developed sets of qualifications for IT workers. The group devised the e-skills passport and IT User Qualification (ITQ) qualifications, as its [[National Occupational Standards]].  

==History==
e-skills UK existed in name before 2003 as one of the [[National Training Organisation]]s (NTO). Their website was launched in 2000.

The National Training Organisations became the Sector Skills Councils (SSC) in April 2003. SSCs were started by the [[Sector Skills Development Agency]], under the leadership of chief executive being Christopher Duff. The numbers of the organisations reduced to 23, and funding was increased. e-skills UK was one of the first Councils to be formed. e-skills UK was initially given a five-year licence to be the SSC for the IT and Telecoms industry, under the leadership of Karen Price.&lt;ref name=price/&gt; In March 2005 e-skills UK was one of four SSCs to publish their first Sector Skills Agreement, outlining what they hoped to realistically achieve; the other councils to publish agreements at that time were the Sector Skills Council for Science, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies (SEMTA), [[Skillset]] and [[ConstructionSkills]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Computer Clubs for Girls, or CC4G, began in [[South East England]] in 2002, designed to educate girls about the potential of technology. The pilot scheme started in 280 schools, with £2.8&amp;nbsp;million funding by SEEDA, and run by Melody Hermon. Computer Clubs for Girls was launched nationwide on 14 June 2005 for girls aged 10–14 at 3,600 schools, and cost £8.5&amp;nbsp;million. By 2006, around 1,000 schools had registered and 58,000 girls were in the scheme.

In the [[2006 Birthday Honours]] Karen Price, chief executive officer of e-skills UK, received an [[Order of the British Empire|Order of the British Empire (OBE)]].&lt;ref name="price"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/58014/supplement/1|title=Birthday Honours List 2006|last=|first=|date=17 June 2006|website=The Gazette Official Public Record|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, e-skills UK was rated 'outstanding'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100806153725/http://www.ukces.org.uk//upload/pdf/090422%20Final%20e-skills%20UK%20Recommendation%20UPDATED%20WITH%20INTRO.pdf|title=SSC Relicensing Panel Recommendation - e-skills UK|last=|first=|date=16 July 2009|website=The National Archives - UKCES|publisher=UK Government|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the process to re-license Sector Skills Councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100806151741/http://www.ukces.org.uk/sector-skills-councils/ssc-relicensing-process/relicensing-decisions/|title=SSC Relicensing Decisions|last=|first=|date=6 August 2010|website=The National Archives - UKCES|publisher=UK Government|access-date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, e-skills UK developed a £5.6&amp;nbsp;million scheme with the [[Open University]] called ''Vital'', to train school teachers on technology in a form of [[continuing professional development]] (CPD). Vital was launched at the annual [[BETT]] [[Trade fair|trade show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.vital.ac.uk|work=vital|publisher=Open University|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 e-skills UK, [[Google]] and [[BT Group]] formed the [[Getting British Business Online]] project (GBBO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.gbbo.co.uk|work=Getting British Business Online|publisher=Google|accessdate=30 May 2012|date=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the group reported that the UK IT industry was around 8% of the UK economy,&lt;ref name=eskills-insights&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.e-skills.com/insights2010 | title = IT &amp; Telecoms Insights 2010 | publisher = e-skills UK | accessdate = 13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and covered 5.7% of the working population (IT and telecoms). 860,000 persons worked in the IT industry, plus another approximately 680,000 in IT-related positions. The report concluded that "continued adoption and exploitation of IT &amp; Telecoms technologies could generate an additional £35&amp;nbsp;billion to the UK economy."&lt;ref name=eskills-insights/&gt;

'''Environmental adult education''' is recognized as a "hybrid outgrowth of the [[environmental movement]] and [[adult education]], combining an [[ecology|ecological]] orientation with a learning paradigm to provide a vigorous educational approach to environmental concerns" (Sumner, 2003).

In laymen's terms, environmental adult education refers to efforts in teaching environmental issues and how individuals and businesses can manage or change their lifestyles and their [[ecosystem]]s in order to achieve sustainable existence. The overarching goal of this field of study is to educate global citizens in order for them to gain sustainable lives within their respective societies. The content could also include [[Environmental justice|ecological justice]], integrating social concerns such as poverty, race, gender, and sexual orientation, among others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of Adult Education|last=English|first=Leona|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|isbn=9780230201712|location=New York|pages=218-219}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is demonstrated in the impact of the excesses of global capitalism and its insatiable need for resources on people such as the polarization of power and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecojustice Adult Education|last=Dentith|first=Audrey|last2=Griswold|first2=Wendy|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2017|isbn=9781119383833|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Environmental adult education is a relatively new and unique field of study and practice. Using a community-based method, educators listen and respect the input of learners and all participants are considered essential.&lt;ref name=Haugen/&gt;

Although for more than a century, environmental and conservation organizations taught adults environmental education with very little structure, it has actually evolved during the last thirty years.

The [[United States]] was one of the first countries to officially recognize environmental education. During a joint House–Senate session in 1968, Congress acknowledged the importance of environmental education, and in 1970 passed the [[Environmental Education Act]], which established the [[Office of Environmental Education]].&lt;ref&gt;American Geological Institute 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, this framework began to emerge in Asia and Latin America, where it is considered a stream of adult education and sometimes referred to as environmental popular education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The United Nations, for its part, began integrating the concept of environmental sustainability to the [[Education For All|Education for All]] initiative, which is a set of UN policies with a goal of meeting learning needs of all people, as well as the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millenium Development Goals (MDGs)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Adult and Continuing Education|last=Kasworm|first=Carol|last2=Rose|first2=Amy|last3=Ross-Gordon|first3=Jovita|publisher=SAGE|year=2010|isbn=9781412960502|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the UN-organized Earth Summit in 1992, prompted the [[International Council for Adult Education]] to develop the Learning for Environmental Action Programme (LEAP) which took the initiative of facilitating the dialogue that connect environmental issues and adult learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Timeline===
*Mid-1970s: EAE recognized as distinct field of study
*Late 1980s: EAE focus on learner experience
*Late 1990s, Early 2000: Focus shifted to how to teach EAE
*1997: United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) hosted conference on adult education with EAE being one of the 33 workshops presented

== Earlier environmental education initiatives ==
According to the UNESCO Web site,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} in 1968 it organized the first intergovernmental conference aimed at reconciling the environment and development, now known as "sustainable development". In the following years, UNESCO and the [[United Nations Environment Program]] (UNEP) initiated three major declarations that defined environmental education. Those included:
*1972: [[Stockholm Declaration]]. This document included seven proclamations and 26 principles "to inspire and guide the peoples of the world in the preservation and enhancement of the human environment."
*1975: [[Belgrade Charter]]. The product of the International Workshop on Environmental Education, this charter built upon the Stockholm Declaration by adding goals, objectives and principles for environmental education programs.
*1977: [[Tbilisi Declaration]]. This document updated and clarified the Stockholm Declaration and the Belgrade Charter by including new goals, objectives, characteristics, and guiding principles of environmental education.

== Methods ==

Educators in this field of study consider environmental problems with a [[holistic]] approach that combines social, political and environmental concerns into community dilemmas.&lt;ref name=Haugen&gt;Haugen 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Participatory methods allow learners to make connections between social issues and environmental problems. This connection allows adult learners to understand the core causes of major environmental issues and the resulting social inequalities. This method also allows educators to stress the importance of instilling environmental awareness so that learners do not forget their relationship with the natural world.

To summarize the methods of adult environmental education training, environmental adult educators strive to instil learners with: 
* a knowledge of environmental problems and their causes
* the skills to engage in social activism to combat those problems
* the attitude of respect and connection to the natural world
* a desire to change current practices to protect the Earth

Environmental adult education generally takes place in a nonformal education setting. This means that the organized learning can take place in many forms including vocational education, literacy education and on the job training.&lt;ref name=Haugen/&gt; There are, however, examples of formal learning such as the degree programs and courses in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sustainability in Higher Education: Stories and Strategies for Transformation|last=Barlett|first=Peggy|last2=Chase|first2=Geoffrey|publisher=MIT Press|year=2013|isbn=9780262019491|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could also be a combination of these methods of environmental educational program delivery as demonstrated in the case of [[El Salvador]]'s National Environmental Education Strategy, which covered all aspect of education via a private-public partnership. The government - through its Ministry of Education - integrated environmental education in schools, including tertiary education institutions, while partners such as media outfits deliver meaningful environmental concepts to targeted audiences and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education and Sustainability: Responding to the Global Challenge|last=Tilbury|first=Daniella|last2=Stevenson|first2=Robert|last3=Fien|first3=John|last4=Schreuder|first4=Danie|publisher=IUCN|year=2002|isbn=2831706238|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs and organizations that encourage adult environmental education ==
{{globalize|date=February 2011}}

* Conservation education and governmental agencies such as the [[Forestry Service]] and the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) were established to educate adults in broad areas of the environment.
* The [[Nature Conservancy]], originally the Ecological Society of America, was formed in 1915 with the missions of supporting ecologists and preserving natural ecosystems.
* The [[4-H Organization]] was also established to reach adults by educating youth in areas of new agricultural technology and environmental awareness.
*The [[Peace Corps]], established in 1961, has worked to incorporate adult environmental education and conservation practices into its international programming. Volunteers assist in:
* Environmental education
* [[Recycling]]
* [[Wildlife protection]]
* [[Park management]]
* Alleviating water-borne diseases
* Providing potable water
* [[Project WET]] (Water Education for Teachers) is a nonprofit water education program and publisher. This program "promotes awareness, appreciation, knowledge and stewardship of water resources through the dissemination of classroom-ready teaching aids and the establishment of internationally sponsored Project WET programs." Committed to global water education that is implemented at the community level, the mission of Project WET is to reach children, parents, educators, and communities of the world with water education.&lt;ref&gt;Project WET&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Project WILD]] is a conservation and environmental education program for educators of students in kindergarten through high school. Project WILD addresses the need for human beings to develop as responsible citizens of the planet. It is based on the belief that young adults and educators have an interest in learning about the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Project WILD&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Project Learning Tree]], a program of the American Forest Foundation, is an award winning, multi-disciplinary environmental education program for educators and students in PreK–Grade 12.
* ''[[Gobar Times]]'' a monthly environmental education magazine for the young adult.

'''Film studies''' is an academic discipline that deals with various [[film theory|theoretical]], [[history of film|historical]], and [[film criticism|critical]] approaches to [[film]]s.  It is sometimes subsumed within [[media studies]] and is often compared to [[television studies]]. Film studies is less concerned with advancing proficiency in [[Filmmaking|film production]] than it is with exploring the narrative, artistic, cultural, economic, and political implications of the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Richard. "Introduction." Film Studies: Critical Approaches. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2000. 1-8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In searching for these social-ideological values, film studies takes a series of critical approaches for the analysis of production, theoretical framework, context, and creation.&lt;ref&gt;Sikov, Ed. "Introduction." Introduction pg.1-4. Film Studies: an Introduction. New York: Columbia UP, 2010. Print. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zbCK8ETCWzwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=film+studies&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BwjJTJG1GsH7lwef1Yn3Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the film studies discipline exists as one in which the teacher does not always assume the primary educator role; the featured film itself serves that function. Also, in studying film, possible careers include critic or production. [[Film theory]] often includes the study of conflicts between the aesthetics of visual Hollywood and the textual analysis of screenplay. Overall the study of film continues to grow, as does the industry on which it focuses. Academic journals publishing film studies work include ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'', ''[[Screen (journal)|Screen]]'', ''[[Cinema Journal]]'', ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' and ''[[Journal of Film and Video]]''.

==History==
Film studies as an academic discipline emerged in the twentieth century, decades after [[History of film technology#First_motion_pictures|the invention of motion pictures]]. Not to be confused with the technical aspects of film production, film studies exists only with the creation of [[film theory]]—which approaches film critically as an art—and the writing of [[film historiography]]. Because the modern film became an invention and industry only in the late nineteenth century, a generation of film producers and [[Film director|directors]] existed significantly before the academic analysis that followed in later generations.

Early [[film school]]s focused on the production and subjective critique of film rather than on the critical approaches, history and theory used to study academically. Since the time film was created, the concept of film studies as a whole grew to analyze the formal aspects of film as they were created. Established in 1919 the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|Moscow Film School]] was the first school in the world to focus on film. In the United States the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]], established in 1929, was the first cinematic based school, which was created in agreement with the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]. They were also the first to offer a major in film in 1932 but without the distinctions that are assumed in film studies. Universities began to implement different forms of cinema related curriculum without, however, the division between the abstract and practical approaches.

The ''Deutsche Filmakademie Babelsberg'' (i.e. German Film Academy Babelsberg) was founded in the Third Reich in 1938. Among the lecturers were e.g. [[Willi Forst]] and [[Heinrich George]]. To complete the studies at the Academy a student was expected to create his own film.

A movement away from [[Hollywood]] productions in the 1950s turned cinema into a more artistic [[independent films|independent]] endeavor. It was the creation of the [[auteur theory]], which asserted film as the director's vision and art, that prompted film studies to become truly considered academically worldwide in the 1960s. In 1965, film critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]], in his writings on [[Alfred Hitchcock]], declared that Hitchcock's films contained the same complexities of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Study in the Undergraduate Curriculum''. New York: Modern Language Association of America, 1983.15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Jean Luc Godard]], a contributor to the influential magazine ''[[Cahiers du Cinema]]'' wrote, “Jerry Lewis...is the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn’t falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles. ...Lewis is the only one today who’s making courageous films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Hillier, ed.|title=Cahiers du Cinema 1960–1968 New Wave, New Cinema, Re-evalutating Hollywood (Godard in interview with Jacques Bontemps, Jean-Louis Comolli, Michel Delahaye, and Jean Narboni)|year=1987|page=295|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674090651}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With stable enrollment, proper budgets and interest in all [[humanities]] numerous universities contained the ability to offer distinct film studies programs.

There were no individuals that created the criteria for film studies; rather the growing community of the [[film industry]] and academics began to criticize, document and analyze films, eventually conforming the concepts of film studies that pertain to artistic academia. With the success in first half of the twentieth century, prominent persons in the film industry could become an endowment source for schools focusing primarily on film, creating the location for film studies as a discipline to form. An example is [[George Lucas]]' US$175 million donation to the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="la"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/education/highered/la-125highed-11,0,2054908,full.story?coll=la-home-right2 |title=LA's Screen Gems |first=Rachel |last=Abramowitz |authorlink= |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |year=2010 |accessdate=18 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124180156/http://www.latimes.com/news/education/highered/la-125highed-11,0,2054908,full.story?coll=la-home-right2 |archivedate=24 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern film studies==
Today film studies exists worldwide as a discipline with specific schools dedicated to it. The aspects of film studies have grown to encompass numerous methods for teaching history, culture and society. Many [[liberal arts]] colleges and universities and contain courses specifically geared toward the analysis of film.&lt;ref name="colbo"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate= 18 October 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Also exemplifying the increased diversity of film studies is the fact that high schools across the United States offer classes on [[film theory]]. Many programs conjoin film studies with media and television studies, taking knowledge from all parts of visual production in the approach. With the growing technologies such as [[3-D film]] and [[YouTube]], films are now concretely used to teach a reflection of culture and art around the world as a primary medium. Due to the ever-growing dynamic of film studies, a wide variety of curricula have emerged for analysis of critical approaches used in film.&lt;ref&gt;Grieveson, Lee. "Cinema Studies." ''Inventing Film Studies''. Durham: Duke UP, 2008. 67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Although each institution has the power to form the study material, students are usually expected to grasp a knowledge of conceptual shifts in film, a vocabulary for the analysis of film form and style, a sense of ideological dimensions of film, and an awareness of extra textual domains and possible direction of film in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Dix, Andrew. ''Beginning Film Studies''. Manchester UP. 2-14.

==Common curriculum==

The curriculum of [[tertiary education|tertiary level]] film studies programs often include but are not limited to:
* Introduction to film studies
* Modes of film studies
* Close analysis of film
* History of film/media
* Analysis with emphasis
# Attention to time period
# Attention to regional creation
# Attention to genre
# Attention to creators
* Methods of film production
With diverse courses that make up for film studies majors or minors come to exist within schools.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite web

==United States film studies==
In the United States, [[universities]] offer courses specifically toward film studies, and schools committed to minor/major programs. Currently 144 different [[tertiary institutions]] nationwide offer a major program in film studies.&lt;ref name="colbo"/&gt; This number continues to grow each year with new interest in the film studies discipline. Institutions offering film degrees as part of their arts or communications curriculum differ from institutions with a dedicated film program. The curriculum is in no way limited to films made in the United States; a wide variety of films can be analyzed. With the United States' film industry second worldwide only to India, the attraction for film studies is high. To obtain a degree in the United States, a person is likely to pursue careers in the production of film, especially [[Film director|directing]] and [[Film producer|producing]] films.&lt;ref&gt;Polan, Dana, and Haidee Wasson. "Young Art, Old Colleges." Inventing Film Studies. Durham: Duke UP, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Often classes in the United States will combine new forms of media, such as television or [[New media]], in combination with film study.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Film Studies in the United States and at Berkeley." Film Studies. Web. 11 Nov. 2010. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://filmstudies.berkeley.edu/About_us.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824061159/http://filmstudies.berkeley.edu/About_us.html |archivedate=24 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who study film want to be able to analyze the numerous films released in the United States every year in a more academic setting, or to understand the history of cinema as an art form. Films can reflect the culture of the period not only in the United States but around the world.

==World film studies==
Film studies throughout the world exist in over 20 countries. Due to the high cost of film production [[Third World|third world countries]] are left out of the film industry especially in the academic setting. Despite this fact more prosperous countries have the ability to study film in all the aspects of film studies.   Discourse in film can be found in the schools around the world; often, international attention to the aesthetics of film emerge from [[film festival]]s. For example, the [[Cannes Film Festival]] is the most prestigious in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/cannes_international_film_festival/index.html|title = Cannes International Film Festival|work = New York Times | first=Manohla | last=Dargis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this discourse revolves around the film industry and promotion and does not exist within an academic school setting, numerous aspects of analysis and critical approaches are taken into account on this international stage.

==Prominent persons in film studies==
The prominent persons that have influenced the study of film range from [[teachers]] to [[movie producers]] but can be subsumed into two major categories: persons in film production and persons in film criticism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11043">[[File:Frog's leg galvanoscope.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Frog's-leg galvanoscope]]
The '''frog galvanoscope''' was a sensitive electrical instrument used to detect [[voltage]]&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  It consists of skinned frog's leg with electrical connections to a nerve.  The instrument was invented by [[Luigi Galvani]] and improved by [[Carlo Matteucci]].

The frog galvanoscope, and other experiments with frogs played a part in the dispute between Galvani and [[Alessandro Volta]] over the nature of electricity.  The instrument is extremely sensitive and continued to be used well into the nineteenth century, even after [[electromechanical]] meters came into use.

==Terminology==
Synonyms for this device include '''galvanoscopic frog''', '''frog's leg galvanoscope''', '''frog galvanometer''', '''rheoscopic frog''', and '''frog electroscope'''.  The device is properly called a ''galvanoscope'' rather than ''galvanometer'' since the latter implies accurate measurement whereas a galvanoscope only gives an indication.&lt;ref name="Hackmann, p. 257"&gt;Hackmann, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern usage a [[galvanometer]] is a sensitive laboratory instrument for measuring current, not voltage.  Everyday current meters for use in the field are called [[ammeter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hackmann, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar distinction can be made between [[electroscope]]s, [[electrometer]]s, and [[voltmeter]]s for voltage measurements.

==History==
Frogs were a popular subject of experiment in the laboratories of early scientists.  They are small, easily handled, and there is a ready supply.  [[Marcello Malpighi]], for instance, used frogs in his study of lungs in the seventeenth century.  Frogs were particularly suitable for the study of muscle activity.  Especially in the legs, the muscle contractions are readily observed and the nerves are easily dissected out.  Another desirable feature for scientists was that these contractions continued after death for a considerable time.  Also in the seventeenth century, [[Leopoldo Caldani]] and [[Felice Fontana]] subjected frogs to electric shocks to test [[Albrecht von Haller]]'s [[Hallerian physiology|irritability theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luigi Galvani]], a lecturer at the [[University of Bologna]], was researching the [[nervous system]] of frogs from around 1780.  This research included the muscular response to [[opiate]]s and [[static electricity]], for which experiments the spinal cord and rear legs of a frog were dissected out together and the skin removed.  In 1781,&lt;ref&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; an observation was made while a frog was being so dissected.  An [[Electrostatic generator|electric machine]] discharged just at the moment one of Galvani's assistants touched the [[crural nerve]] of a dissected frog with a scalpel.  The frog's legs twitched as the discharge happened.&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvani found that he could make the prepared leg of a frog (see the [[#Construction|''Construction'']] section) twitch by connecting a metal circuit from a nerve to a muscle, thus inventing the first frog galvanoscope.&lt;ref&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvani published these results in 1791 in ''De viribus electricitatis''.&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative version of the story of the frog response at a distance has the frogs being prepared for a soup on the same table as a running electric machine.  Galvani's wife notices the frog twitch when an assistant accidentally touches a nerve and reports the phenomenon to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  This story originates with [[Jean-Louis Alibert]] and, according to Piccolino and Bresadola, was probably invented by him.&lt;ref&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, p. 5, citing [[Adolphe Ganot]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Galvani, and his nephew [[Giovanni Aldini]], used the frog galvanoscope in their electrical experiments.  [[Carlo Matteucci]] improved the instrument and brought it to wider attention.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvani used the frog galvanoscope to investigate and promote the theory of ''animal electricity'', that is, that there was a [[vitalism|vital life force]] in living things that manifested itself as a new kind of electricity.  [[Alessandro Volta]] opposed this theory, believing that the electricity that Galvani and other proponents were witnessing was due to metal [[contact electrification]] in the circuit.  Volta's motivation in inventing the [[voltaic pile]] (the forerunner of the common [[zinc–carbon battery]]) was largely to enable him to construct a circuit entirely with non-biological material to show that the vital force was not necessary to produce the electrical effects seen in animal experiments.  Matteucci, in answer to Volta, and to show that metal contacts were not necessary, constructed a circuit entirely out of biological material, including a [[frog battery]].  Neither the animal electricity theory of Galvani nor the contact electrification theory of Volta forms part of modern electrical science.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Clarke &amp; Jacyna, p. 199|Clarke &amp; O'Malley, p. 186|Hellman, pp. 31–32|Bird (1848), pp. 344–345|Matteucci (1845), pp.284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Alan Hodgkin]] in the 1930s showed that there is indeed an [[ion]]ic current flowing in nerves.&lt;ref name=Picc75&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Matteucci used the frog galvanoscope to study the relationship of electricity to muscles, including in freshly amputated human limbs.  Matteucci concluded from his measurements that there was an electric current continually flowing from the interior, to the exterior of all muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;  Matteucci's idea was widely accepted by his contemporaries, but this is no longer believed and his results are now explained in terms of [[injury potential]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; Jacyna, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
An entire frog's hind leg is removed from the frog's body with the [[sciatic nerve]] still attached, and possibly also a portion of the [[spinal cord]].  The leg is skinned, and two electrical connections are made.  These may be made to the nerve and the foot of the frog's leg by wrapping them with metal wire or foil,&lt;ref name="Hare, p. 4"&gt;Hare, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; but a more convenient instrument is Matteucci's arrangement shown in the image.  The leg is placed in a glass tube with just the nerve protruding.  Connection is made to two different points on the nerve.&lt;ref name=Bird345&gt;Bird, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Matteucci, the instrument is most accurate if direct electrical contact with muscle is avoided.  That is, connections are made only to the nerve.  Matteucci also advises that the nerve should be well stripped and that contacts to it can be made with wet paper in order to avoid using sharp metal probes directly on the nerve.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; O'Malley, pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
When the frog's leg is connected to a circuit with an [[electric potential]], the muscles will contract and the leg will twitch briefly.  It will twitch again when the circuit is broken.&lt;ref name="Hare, p. 4"/&gt;  The instrument is capable of detecting extremely small [[voltage]]s, and could far surpass other instruments available in the first half of the nineteenth century, including the electromagnetic [[galvanometer]] and the [[gold-leaf electroscope]].  For this reason, it remained popular long after other instruments became available.  The galvanometer was made possible in 1820 by the discovery by [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] that electric currents would deflect a compass needle, and the gold-leaf electroscope was even earlier ([[Abraham Bennet]], 1786).&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet [[Golding Bird]] could still write in 1848 that "the irritable muscles of a frog's legs were no less than 56,000 times more delicate a test of electricity than the most sensitive condensing electrometer."&lt;ref&gt;Bird, p. 345 citing Wilkinson, 1845&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''condenser'' used by Bird here means a coil, so named by [[Johann Poggendorff]] by analogy with Volta's term for a [[Capacitor#Condenser|capacitor]].&lt;ref name="Hackmann, p. 257"/&gt;

The frog galvanoscope can be used to detect the direction of [[electric current]].  A frog's leg that has been somewhat desensitised is needed for this.  The sensitivity of the instrument is greatest with a freshly prepared leg and then falls off with time, so an older leg is best for this.  The response of the leg is greater to currents in one direction than the other and with a suitably desensitised leg it may only respond to currents in one direction.  For a current going into the leg from the nerve, the leg will twitch on making the circuit.  For a current passing out of the leg, it will twitch on breaking the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

The major drawback of the frog galvanoscope is that the frog leg frequently needs replacing.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; Jacyna, citing Matteucci&lt;/ref&gt;  The leg will continue to respond for up to 44 hours, but after that a fresh one must be prepared.&lt;ref name="Picc75"/&gt;

'''Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE)''' is a laboratory of the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO). Located in [[Bangalore]], its primary function is research and development of aero gas-turbines for military aircraft. As a spin-off effect, GTRE has been developing marine gas-turbines also.

==Products==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
Principal achievements of Gas Turbine Research Establishment include:
* Design and development of India's "first centrifugal type 10kN thrust engine" between 1959-61.
* Design and development of a "1700K reheat system" for the Orpheus 703 engine to boost its power. The redesigned system was certified in 1973.
* Successful upgrade of the reheat system of the Orpheus 703 to 2000K.
* Improvement of the Orpheus 703 engine by replacing "the front subsonic compressor stage" with a "transonic compressor stage" to increase the "basic dry thrust " of the engine.
* Design and development of a "demonstrator" gas turbine engine—GTX 37-14U—for fighter aircraft. Performance trials commenced in 1977 and the "demonstrator phase" was completed in 1981. The GTX 37-14U was "configured" and "optimized" to build a "low by-pass ratio jet engine" for "multirole performance aircraft. This engine was dubbed GTX 37-14U B.

===GTX Kaveri===

[[GTRE GTX-35VS Kaveri|GTX-35VS Kaveri]] Engine was intended to power production models of [[HAL Tejas]].&lt;ref name="JAE2006"&gt;Gunston, Bill (Ed.) (June 15, 2006).  "GTRE Kaveri" in ''Jane’s Aero-Engines'', Issue 14.  Coulsdon, Surrey, UK:  Jane's Information Group Limited.  {{ISBN|0-7106-1405-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defending the program GTRE mentioned reasons for delay including:
* Non availability of state of the art wind tunnel facility in India
* The technology restrictions imposed by US by placing it in "entities" list

Both hurdles having been cleared, GTRE intended to continue work on the AMCA (future generation fighter craft).

This program was abandoned in 2014.

===Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine (KMGT)===

Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine is a design spin-off from the Kaveri engine, designed for Indian combat aircraft. Using the core of the Kaveri engine, GTRE added low-pressure compressor and turbine as a gas generator and designed a free power turbine to generate shaft power for maritime applications.&lt;ref name="GTRE develops engine for navy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEH20080717034427 |title=DRDO develops marine gas turbine engine for Indian Navy |publisher=Newindpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement of [[Indian Navy]] in the development and testing of the engine has given a tremendous boost to the programme

'''Generative adversarial networks''' ('''GANs''') are a class of [[artificial intelligence]] algorithms used in [[unsupervised machine learning]], implemented by a system of two [[neural network]]s contesting with each other in a [[zero-sum game]] framework. They were introduced by [[Ian Goodfellow]] ''et al.'' in 2014.&lt;ref name="GANs"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1406.2661|title=Generative Adversarial Networks|first1=Ian |last1=Goodfellow |first2=Jean |last2=Pouget-Abadie |first3=Mehdi |last3=Mirza |first4=Bing |last4=Xu |first5=David |last5=Warde-Farley |first6=Sherjil |last6=Ozair |first7=Aaron |last7=Courville |first8=Yoshua |last8=Bengio |class=cs.LG |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This technique can generate photographs that look at least superficially authentic to human observers, having many realistic characteristics (though in tests people can tell real from generated in many cases).&lt;ref name="ITT_GANs"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1606.03498|title=Improved Techniques for Training GANs|last1=Salimans |first1=Tim |last2=Goodfellow |first2=Ian |last3=Zaremba |first3=Wojciech |last4=Cheung |first4=Vicki |last5=Radford |first5=Alec |last6=Chen |first6=Xi |class=cs.LG |year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
One network [[Generative model|generates]] candidates (generative) and the other [[Discriminative model|evaluates them]] (discriminative).&lt;ref name="MyUser_Arxiv.org_April_7_2016c"&gt;{{cite arXiv|class=stat.ML|first2=Jean|last2=Pouget-Abadie|title=Generative Adversarial Networks|eprint=1406.2661|last1=Goodfellow|first1=Ian J.|last3=Mirza|first3=Mehdi|last4=Xu|first4=Bing|last5=Warde-Farley|first5=David|last6=Ozair|first6=Sherjil|last7=Courville|first7=Aaron|last8=Bengio|first8=Yoshua|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DAGUI"&gt;Thaler, SL, US Patent 05659666, Device for the autonomous generation of useful information, 08/19/1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DABUI"&gt;Thaler, SL, US Patent, 07454388, Device for the autonomous bootstrapping of useful information, 11/18/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia of creativity"&gt;Thaler, SL, The Creativity Machine Paradigm, Encyclopedia of Creativity, Invention, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship, (ed.) E.G. Carayannis, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the generative network learns to map from a [[Latent variable|latent space]] to a particular data distribution of interest, while the discriminative network discriminates between instances from the true data distribution and candidates produced by the generator. The generative network's training objective is to increase the error rate of the discriminative network (i.e., "fool" the discriminator network by producing novel synthesised instances that appear to have come from the true data distribution).&lt;ref name="MyUser_Arxiv.org_April_7_2016c" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luc|first=Pauline|last2=Couprie|first2=Camille|last3=Chintala|first3=Soumith|last4=Verbeek|first4=Jakob|date=2016-11-25|title=Semantic Segmentation using Adversarial Networks|journal=NIPS Workshop on Adversarial Training, Dec , Barcelona, Spain|volume=2016|arxiv=1611.08408|bibcode=2016arXiv161108408L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, a known dataset serves as the initial training data for the discriminator. Training the discriminator involves presenting it with samples from the dataset, until it reaches some level of accuracy. Typically the generator is seeded with a randomized input that is sampled from a predefined latent space&lt;ref name = "DAGUI"/&gt; (e.g. a [[multivariate normal distribution]]). Thereafter, samples synthesized by the generator are evaluated by the discriminator. [[Backpropagation]] is applied in both networks &lt;ref name = "DABUI"/&gt; so that the generator produces better images, while the discriminator becomes more skilled at flagging synthetic images.&lt;ref name="OpenAI_com"&gt;{{citation |url=http://openai.com/blog/generative-models/ |title=Generative Models |publisher=[[OpenAI]] |date=  |authors=[[Andrej Karpathy]], [[Pieter Abbeel]], Greg Brockman, Peter Chen, Vicki Cheung, Rocky Duan, Ian Goodfellow, Durk Kingma, Jonathan Ho, Rein Houthooft, Tim Salimans, John Schulman, Ilya Sutskever, And Wojciech Zaremba|accessdate= April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generator is typically a deconvolutional neural network, and the discriminator is a [[convolutional neural network]].

The idea to infer models in a competitive setting (model versus discriminator) was proposed by Li, Gauci and Gross in 2013.&lt;ref name="Li-etal-GECCO2013"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their method is used for behavioral inference. It is termed Turing Learning,&lt;ref name="TuringLearning2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Wei|last2=Gauci|first2=Melvin|last3=Groß|first3=Roderich|title=Turing learning: a metric-free approach to inferring behavior and its application to swarms|journal=Swarm Intelligence|date=30 August 2016|volume=10|issue=3|pages=211–243|doi=10.1007/s11721-016-0126-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the setting is akin to that of a [[Turing test]]. Turing Learning is a generalization of GANs.&lt;ref name="Gross-etal-NIPS2017"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models other than neural networks can be considered. Moreover, the discriminators are allowed to influence the processes from which the datasets are obtained, making them active interrogators as in the Turing test. The idea of adversarial training can also be found in earlier works, such as Schmidhuber in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jürgen|date=November 1992|title=Learning Factorial Codes by Predictability Minimization|journal=Neural Computation|language=en|volume=4|issue=6|pages=863–879|doi=10.1162/neco.1992.4.6.863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
GANs have been used to produce samples of [[photorealistic]] images for the purposes of visualizing new [[interior design|interior]]/[[industrial design]], shoes, bags and [[clothing]] items or items for [[PC game|computer game]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s' scenes.{{Citation needed|reason=No source provided.

The system focused on realistic textures rather than pixel-accuracy. The result was a higher image quality at high magnification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Sajjadi|first=Mehdi S.

GANs were used to create the 2018 painting ''[[Edmond de Belamy]]'' which sold for $432,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/arts/design/ai-art-sold-christies.html | title=AI Art at Christie's Sells for $432,500| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2018-10-25| last1=Cohn| first1=Gabe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, a [[deepfake]] video of [[Donald Trump]] chastising Belgium citizens to abandon the [[Paris Agreement]] was circulated in an attempt to prioritize [[climate change]].  The video, produced using GAN technology, had been commissioned by Belgian political party [[Socialistische Partij Anders]] (sp.a) and uploaded to their [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] accounts.   Widely believed true, the video provoked hundreds of comments on social media until sp.a owned up to their forgery.&lt;ref name="schwartz-2018"&gt;

==History==
In 1987 Hans Lehrach and Günther Zehetner founded the ''Reference Library / Primary Database (RLDB)'' at the [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]] (ICRF) in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;The Reference Library System - sharing biological material and experimental data. Günther Zehetner and Hans Lehrach (3 February 1994). ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', vol 367, pp. 489-491&lt;/ref&gt; The RLDB distributed [[Molecular biology#Arrays|macroarrays]] generated at the ICRF to research groups worldwide. The macroarrays consisted of [[Cloning|clones]] of [[genomic library|genomic]] and [[cDNA library|cDNA]] libraries transferred to 22 × 22&amp;nbsp;cm nylon filters with the help of robots which have been developed by Zehetner at the ICRF. Experimental results done with the standardized materials were reported back by researches and collected in the ''Primary Database''.&lt;ref&gt;Preparation and screening of high-density cDNA arrays with Genomic Clones (Methods in Molecular Biology, vol 175:. Genomics Protocols, edited by: MP Starkey and R. Elaswarapu, Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ), Günther Zehetner, Maria Pack, and Katja Schäfer (2001), pp. 169-188&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1995 the RLDB was moved to Berlin to the [[Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics]], where it continued its work.&lt;ref&gt;''Max-Planck-Institut will Gen-Bank einrichten'', [[Die Welt]], 31 May 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1995, the Resource Centre was established as part of the German [[Human Genome Project]] (DHGP) by Hans Lehrach (Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics (MPIMG), [[Berlin-Dahlem]]), Günther Zehetner (MPIMG, until July 2000 Scientific Director of the Berlin Resource Center) and Annemarie Poustka ([[German Cancer Research Center]] (DKFZ), Heidelberg). As ''Resource Center/Primary Database'' (RZPD) it took over the work of the RLDB. It was funded by the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] (BMBF) in order to provide the materials free of charge to the members of the DHGP, while they were available to other researchers at cost prize. The RZPD became the largest [[database]] for genetic clones worldwide and was associated with many of the major national and international gene and genome research projects.
[[File:Microtiter plates, Wash U Human YAC Library, 1993.JPG|thumb|110px|left|Frozen microtiter plates with library clones]]
The RZPD was one of only two distributors in Europe for [[IMAGE cDNA clones]] and also constructed its own [[plasmid]], [[cosmid]], [[Yeast artificial chromosome|YAC]] and cDNA [[Library (biology)|libraries]]. Each clone was stored in a well of a 96 or 384 well [[microtiter plate]], which were kept, while not used for spotting, in deep freezers at -80&amp;nbsp;°C.

On 1 July 2000 the RZPD was converted into a [[non-profit organization|Non-Profit]]-[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]] (gGmbH). This [[Limited liability company|company with limited liability]] was supported by three of the most important research companies in Germany: the [[Max Planck Society]], the [[German Cancer Research Center]] and the [[Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine]] (MDC [[Berlin-Buch]]). As scientific company members served Hans Lehrach (MPIMG), Annemarie Poustka (DKFZ), [[Jens Reich]] (MDC) Matthias Uhlen ([[Karolinska Institute]], [[Stockholm]]) and [[Harald zur Hausen]] (DKFZ).

On 31 July 2007 the non-profit company was disbanded. A large part of the existing services was taken over by two new companies. ''ImaGenes'' (a start-up company by the former managing directors of the RZPD) and ''ATLAS Biolabs GmbH'', which was co-founded by Lehrach with the former department heads of the RZPD, Uwe Radelof und Bernd Drescher.&lt;ref&gt;''RZPD wird ImaGenes – Wirtschaftlicher Erfolg ermöglicht Änderung der Rechtsform'' GenomXPress 3/07, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
[[Image:Heubnerweg(7).JPG|thumb | 250px | right | Neo-baroque institute building in Berlin]]
The scope of services was constantly expanded and included the provision of genomic cell clones and cDNA databases, [[cell culture]]s, [[microarray]]s, [[gene expression|expression]] profiles, [[Affymetrix]] services and [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] offers. Data collected in the ''Primary Database'' were made available to compare experimental results by researches using the globally standardized material provided by the center.&lt;ref&gt;''Development and perspectives of scientific services offered by genomic biological resource centers'', Oxford Journals, briefings in Functional Genomics and Proteomics 2007, Volume 6, Number 3, pp. 163-170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
[[File:Royal College of Surgeons and Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Lincoln's Inn Fields (120853269).jpg|left|thumb|200px|Royal College of Surgeons (centre) and Imperial Cancer Research Fund (right), London]]
The RLDB office in London was located in the main ICRF building at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], [[Holborn]] and later moved to bigger premises in the adjacent [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] building.

In Berlin the RZPD was first located at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin-Dahlem and then moved to a nearby site at the Harnack road (which today is the site of the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]]) before the center relocated to its final location at the former building of the ''[[Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein|Empress Auguste Viktoria]] Infant Home'' in Heubnerweg in Berlin-Charlottenburg. The [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-baroque]] building was constructed in the years 1907–1909 under the leadership of [[architect]] and Berlin City Commissioner for City Planning [[Ludwig Hoffmann (architect)|Ludwig Hoffmann]] established, while the planning was significantly influenced by the architect [[Alfred Messel]]. The small Heidelberg component of the center was located within the DKFZ.

'''''Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science''''' is a 1994 book by [[biologist]] [[Paul R. Gross]] and [[mathematician]] [[Norman Levitt]].

==Summary==
Levitt states he is a leftist trying to save the "academic left" from itself by exposing misuses and abuses of science to advance political goals.

==Reception and influence==
The book inspired the 1996 [[Sokal affair|Sokal hoax]], in which [[Alan Sokal]] published a bogus paper to a [[postmodernist]] journal that did not [[Peer review|peer-review]] submissions.&lt;ref name="postmodernism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/824-postmodernism-disrobed |date=2007-04-01 |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=Postmodernism Disrobed |accessdate=2010-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120082759/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/824-postmodernism-disrobed |archivedate=2011-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokal stated in an interview that while he was initially skeptical about ''Higher Superstition'', he concluded after reading the works Gross and Levit criticized that they were describing them fairly in "about 80 percent of the cases".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Anatomy-of-a-Hoax/238728?key=bB4GOexLsAk2KfnFOkgPCI0O5azbXR52m3YJxfcw-igptJkoKi_rn3RCDgSQfq6pc3g5NWVSMTIzSXBPNlRyc3YyVnBuczlCYV82MUNMWXdMY2gxYnNKdEN4NA|title=Bait and Switch: How the physicist Alan Sokal hoodwinked a group of humanists and why, 20 years later, it still matters.|first=Jennifer |last=Ruark |date=1 January 2017 |accessdate=7 January 2017 |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ibadah''''' ({{lang-ar|{{large| عبادة}}}},&amp;nbsp;''‘ibādah'', also spelled '''''ibada''''') is an [[Arabic]] word meaning service or servitude.&lt;ref name=OEIW&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Tariq al-Jamil|title=Ibadah|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001/acref-9780195305135-e-1162|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], ''ibadah'' is usually translated as "worship", and ''ibadat''—the plural form of ''ibadah''—refers to Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') of Muslim religious rituals.&lt;ref name="BORW"/&gt;

==Ibadah==
In Arabic ''ibadah'' is connected with related words such as "Ubudiyyah" ("[[slavery]]"), and has connotations of obedience, submission, and humility. The word linguistically means "obedience with submission".&lt;ref&gt;al-Qamoos al-Muhit&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], ''ibadah'' is usually translated as "worship"  and means  obedience, submission, and devotion to [[God in Islam|God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Qur'an 51:56|url=http://quran.com/51/56}} [http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-51/verse-56/ Quran Surah Adh-Dhaariyat ( Verse 56 )]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt;

==Ibadat==
{{Fiqh |ritual}}

''Ibadat'' (عبادات ) is the plural form of ''ibādah''.  In addition to meaning more than one ''ibādah'',&lt;ref name=wehr/&gt; it refers to Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') on "the rules governing worship in Islam"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowker|first1=John|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192800947.001.0001/acref-9780192800947-e-3317 |website=oxfordreference.com|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "religious duties of worship incumbent on all Muslims when they come of age and are of sound body and mind".&lt;ref name=OIS&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e911|title=Ibadah - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from other subjects of jurisprudence in Islam which are usually known as ''[[Muamalat|muʿāmalāt]]'' (interpersonal transactions).&lt;ref name="BORW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ibadat-SIM_3014|website=Brill Online Reference Works|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oxford International Encyclopedia of Legal History|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195134056.001.0001/acref-9780195134056-e-857|website=Oxford Reference|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=9 April 2017|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wehr&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ejtaal.net/aa/#hw4=699,ll=2022,ls=5,la=2773,sg=683,ha=461,br=618,pr=102,aan=391,mgf=579,vi=254,kz=1551,mr=409,mn=886,uqw=1040,umr=690,ums=573,umj=512,ulq=1175,uqa=279,uqq=228,bdw=h576,amr=h414,asb=h629,auh=h1008,dhq=h355,mht=h575,msb=h154,tla=h70,amj=h504,ens=h1,mis=h1|title=Mawrid Reader.

Ibadat include what are known as the "[[Five Pillars of Islam|pillars of Islam]]": 
* profession of faith ([[Shahada|shahadah]]), translated as "''There is no god other than [[Allah]]. Muhammad is the messenger of [[Allah]]"'';&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt;
* ritual prayer ([[Salah|salat]]), observed five times every day at prescribed times, with prescribed preparations (ritual cleaning), prescribed movements (standing, bowing, prostrating, sitting) and prescribed verses, phrases;&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt;
* alms giving ([[Zakat|zakah]]) -- customarily 2.5% of a Muslim's total savings and wealth above a minimum amount  known as&amp;nbsp;''[[nisab]]'',&amp;nbsp;which is based on income and the value of all of one's possessions;&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt;
* fasting ([[Fasting in Islam|sawm]]) -- the obstention from eating and drinking during daylight hours -- especially during the&amp;nbsp;[[Islamic holy month]]&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;[[Ramadan]];&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt; 
* pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] ([[hajj]])&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt; -- the annual&amp;nbsp;[[Islam|Islamic]]&amp;nbsp;[[pilgrimage]] to the most holy city of the Muslims, and a&amp;nbsp;[[Fard|mandatory religious duty]]&amp;nbsp;for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult&amp;nbsp;[[Muslim|Muslims]]&amp;nbsp;who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey, and can support their family during their absence.  
According to Oxford Islamic Studies, "because they are of central importance to the Muslim community, the ibadat form the first subject matter of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] and most collections of prophetic traditions ([[hadith]])."&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt; The subject of ibadat is especially important in Islam (according to author Faleel Jamaldeen) because without these religious laws, "Muslims would likely create their own rituals and prayers, and the religion of Islam would falter and eventually disappear."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Islamic_Finance_For_Dummies.html?id=T7ImTjBd1gQC|title=Islamic Finance For Dummies|last=Jamaldeen|first=Faleel|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Israel Meteorological Service''' ({{lang-he|השירות המטאורולוגי הישראלי}}, ''HaSherut HaMete'orologi HaYisra'eli'') is a unit of the Israeli Ministry of Transportation that is responsible for forecasting weather, meteorological data supply and climate research in Israel. Its origins begin in 1930's in a meteorological unit established by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government mainly as a support to the evolving aviation needs at the time. After establishment of the state of Israel, it was incorporated into the newly established ministry of transport. It is a member of the [[World Meteorological Organization]] since 1949. the Israeli Meteorological Service runs more than 150 measuring stations across Israel. Located between [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Mishmar HaShiva]], and [[Holon]], it is traditionally identified with also nearby [[Beit Dagan]].

Founded in 1986 as the '''Jerome Levy Economics Institute''', the '''Levy Economics Institute''' of [[Bard College]] is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy think tank. The purpose of its research and other activities is to enable scholars and leaders in business, labor, and government to work together on problems of common interest. Its findings are disseminated—via publications, conferences, seminars, congressional testimony, and partnerships with other nonprofits—to a global audience of public officials, private sector executives, academics, and the general public. Through this process of scholarship, analysis, and informed debate, the Levy Institute generates effective public policy responses to economic problems that profoundly influence the quality of life in the United States and abroad.

The Levy Institute is housed on the campus of Bard College in [[Annandale-on-Hudson]], [[New York (state)|New York]], located 90 miles north of New York City. Blithewood, a Georgian-style manor at the campus's western edge, is the Institute's main research and conference facility. Designed as a private residence by [[McKim, Mead and White]] alumnus Francis L. V. Hoppin, it was completed in 1900.  The house and grounds, which includes an Italianate garden overlooking the [[Hudson River]], were incorporated as part of Bard College in 1951.

==Current research==

The Levy Institute has 18 scholars and 50 research associates. Their research focuses on such issues as stock-flow consistent macro modeling, monetary policy and financial structure, financial instability, income and wealth distribution, [[financial regulation]] and governance, gender equality and time poverty, and immigration/ethnicity and social structure.&lt;ref&gt;http://levy.org/scholar.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

The board of directors includes [[Leon Botstein]], the president of Bard College; Bruce C. Greenwald and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], both of [[Columbia University]]; [[Lakshman Achuthan]], managing director of the [[Economic Cycle Research Institute]]; [[Martin L. Leibowitz]], managing director of [[Morgan Stanley]]; William Julius Wilson of [[Harvard University]];&lt;ref&gt;http://levy.org/about.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dimitri B. Papadimitriou]], president of the Levy Institute, Jerome Levy Professor of Economics and executive vice president of Bard College, and managing director of [[Bard College Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bard.edu/about/contacts/#quickref About Bard | Contacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masters Program==

In the Autumn of 2014 the first class of students was admitted to the Institute's Masters of Science in Economic Theory and Policy.  The new program is directed by [[Jan Kregel]] and is taught by Research Scholars at the Institute.

It uses various scientific [[research]]-based [[principles]], [[strategies]], and [[analytical method]]s including  [[mathematical model]]ing, [[statistics]] and [[numerical algorithm]]s to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and accurate [[management]] decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems.  Management sciences help businesses to achieve goals using various scientific methods. 

The field was initially an outgrowth of [[applied mathematics]], where early challenges were problems relating to the [[optimization]] of systems which could be modeled linearly, i.e., determining the optima ([[Maxima and minima|maximum]] value of [[profit (accounting)|profit]], assembly line performance, [[crop yield]], bandwidth, etc. or [[Maxima and minima|minimum]] of loss, risk, costs, etc.) of some objective function. Today, management science encompasses any organizational activity for which the problem can be structured as a functional system so as to obtain a solution set with identifiable characteristics.

== Overview ==
Management science is concerned with a number of different areas of study: One is developing and applying [[scientific modeling|model]]s and [[concept]]s that may prove useful in helping to illuminate [[management]] issues and solve managerial problems. The models used can often be represented mathematically, but sometimes computer-based, [[visual]] or [[Speech|verbal]] representations are used as well or instead.&lt;ref name= "LS"&gt; [http://www.lums.lancs.ac.uk/departments/ManSci/DeptProfile/WhatisManSci/ What is Management Science?] Lancaster University, 2008. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Another area is designing and developing new and better models of organizational excellence. 

Management science research can be done on three levels:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/mphil_mgtscience/mgtresearch.html What is Management Science Research?] University of Cambridge 2008. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fundamental level lies in three mathematical disciplines: [[probability]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], and [[dynamical systems theory]].
* The modeling level is about building models, analyzing them mathematically, gathering and analyzing data, implementing models on computers, solving them, experimenting with them&amp;mdash;all this is part of management science research on the modeling level. This level is mainly instrumental, and driven mainly by [[statistics]] and [[econometrics]]. 
* The application level, just as in any other [[engineering]] and [[economics]] disciplines, strives to make a practical impact and be a driver for change in the real world.

The management scientist's mandate is to use rational, systematic, science-based techniques to inform and improve decisions of all kinds. The techniques of management science are not restricted to business applications but may be applied to [[military]], medical, [[public administration]], charitable groups, political groups or community groups.

== History ==
Its origins can be traced to [[operations research]], which made its debut during [[World War II]] when the Allied forces recruited scientists of various disciplines to assist with military operations. In these early applications, the scientists utilized simple mathematical models to make efficient use of limited technologies and resources. The application of these models within the corporate sector became known as management science.&lt;ref name="UTK"&gt; [http://bus.utk.edu/soms/information/whatis_msci.html What is Management Science?] The University of Tennessee, 2006. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1967 [[Stafford Beer]] characterized the field of management science as "the business use of operations research".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stafford Beer]] (1967). ''Management Science: The Business Use of Operations Research''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Some of the fields that management science involves include:  
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
* [[Data mining]]
* [[Decision analysis]] 
* [[Engineering]]
* [[Forecasting]] 
* [[Game theory]]
* [[Industrial engineering]]
* [[Logistics]]
* [[Mathematical modeling]]
* [[Optimization (mathematics)|Optimization]]
* [[Probability and statistics]]
* [[Project management]]
* [[Psychology]]
* [[Simulation]]
* [[Social network]] / [[Transportation forecasting]] models
* [[Sociology]]
* [[Supply chain management]] 
* [[Management Consulting]] 
{{div col end}}
as well as many others.

== Applications ==
Applications of management science are abundant in industry as [[airlines]], manufacturing companies, [[service organization]]s, military branches, and in [[government]]. The range of problems and issues to which management science has contributed insights and solutions is vast. It includes:.&lt;ref name= "LS"/&gt;
* [[scheduling]] airlines, both planes and crew 
* deciding the appropriate place to site new facilities such as a warehouse or factory 
* managing the flow of water from reservoirs 
* identifying possible future development paths for parts of the telecommunications industry 
* establishing the information needs and appropriate systems to supply them within the health service 
* identifying and understanding the strategies adopted by companies for their [[information system]]s

Management science  is also concerned with so-called "soft-operational analysis", which concerns methods for [[strategic planning]], strategic [[decision support]], and [[problem structuring methods]] (PSM). At this level of abstraction, mathematical modeling and simulation will not suffice. Therefore, during the past 30 years, a number of non-quantified modelling methods have been developed. These include [[morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]] and various forms of [[influence diagram]]s.

A '''manifesto''' is a published declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of the issuer, be it an individual, group, political party or government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifesto Merriam-Webster online dictionary definition of Manifesto].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seophonist-wahl.de/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912054800/http://www.seophonist-wahl.de/ |archivedate=September 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}  {{de icon}}, article on "Wahlprogramm", literally "election programme".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/manifesto Dictionary.com definition of Manifesto].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Robertson, ''The Routledge Dictionary of Politics'',
Edition 3, Psychology Press, 1890 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WcIkEz3a4nIC&amp;pg=PA295 p. 295], {{ISBN|0415323770}}, 9780415323772&lt;/ref&gt;  A manifesto usually accepts a previously published opinion or [[Consensus decision-making|public consensus]] or promotes a new idea with prescriptive notions for carrying out changes the author believes should be made. It often is [[Politics|political]] or [[Art manifesto|artistic]] in nature, but may present an individual's [[life stance]]. Manifestos relating to [[religious belief]] are generally referred to as [[creed]]s.

== Etymology ==

It is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''manifesto'', itself derived from the [[Latin]] ''manifestum'', meaning clear or conspicuous. Its first recorded use in English is from 1620, in [[Nathaniel Brent]]'s translation of [[Paolo Sarpi]]'s ''History of the Council of Trent'': "To this citation he made answer by a Manifesto" (p.&amp;nbsp;102). Similarly, "They were so farre surprised with his Manifesto, that they would never suffer it to be published''" (p.&amp;nbsp;103).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational Manifestos ==
{{Undue weight section|date=May 2018}}{{Refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Democracy and Education title page.jpg|thumb|322x322px|An Early Manifesto on Education]]
Educational manifestos are documents proposing a change or changes to a current education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thekeysupport.com/insights/2017/05/20/manifesto-summaries-what-do-they-say-about-education/|title=Manifesto summaries: what do they say about education? {{!}} The Key|last=Edwards|first=Mark|date=2017-05-20|work=The Key|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2018}} They can be written by governing bodies, organizations, or individuals involved in education as parents, student, administrators, or other stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/education|title=Better Education for better Democracies|website=Education|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|reason=This just goes to a homepage|date=May 2018}} The writer or writers are positioned as a minority group, with manifestos aimed at a majority group. Educational manifestos include personal or group beliefs about what is important or right in education, make statements about the current state of education, differentiate common terms in education, and make suggestions for changing current education systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://davinebanks.com/teaching/|title=A Teaching Manifesto - DAVIN EBANKS|work=DAVIN EBANKS|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}} 

They can often include observations about society and whether or not students are prepared to participate fully in it when they are finished with mandatory schooling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetattooedprof.com/2016/07/06/radical-hope-a-teaching-manifesto/|title=Radical Hope: A Teaching Manifesto|date=2016-07-06|work=The Tattooed Professor|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}} These observations can include a perceived misalignment between mandatory school and society, an unjust, unfair, or right aspect of education, or perceived lack of personalization in learning. Other topics that are frequently addressed in educational manifestos include curriculum, funding, personalization, class size, teacher burnout, and standardized testing, among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}}
[[File:ManifestoforTeachingOnline.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Digital Humanities Education Manifesto]]
These manifestos may offer a reflection or rethinking of some aspect of education or teaching and learning.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://claireboonstra.com/manifesto/|title=manifesto for education {{!}} A movement from status to value|date=2012-11-05|work=Claire Boonstra|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}} These may include personal stories, quotes, anecdotes, or experiences in the classroom or administration. The reflection or rethinking serves to illustrate how or why an aspect of an educational system requires change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/rsa-blogs/2017/06/education-manifestos|title=Education Manifestos 2017 – Testing, Testing, 123…|last=RSA|first=|date=|website=[[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reflections often remind readers of the importance of positive, consistent teacher-student relationships in a good education system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}}

Educational manifestos call for reflection or ‘rethinking' on the part of the majority in education, offer a reason to hope for change, and make recommendations to put change into action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}} Reasons for hope can include anecdotes from students, teachers, or parents, or a callback to what motivates teachers and students to teach and learn together. Manifestos written by individuals frequently conclude by sharing techniques, tactics, or philosophies that the writer has found helpful in their own teaching or administrative practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tomprof.stanford.edu/posting/711|title=A Teaching Manifesto {{!}} Tomorrow's Professor Postings|website=tomprof.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Reliable source?|date=May 2018|reason=This looks like it's a message sent out by staff to students, so not sure if it can be used}} Those written by groups or organizations include recommendations for initiating or continuing change in appropriate areas.

'''Multi-messenger astronomy''' is [[astronomy]] based on the coordinated observation and interpretation of disparate "messenger" signals.  The four extrasolar messengers are [[electromagnetic radiation]], [[gravitational wave]]s, [[neutrino]]s, and [[cosmic ray]]s.  They are created by different astrophysical processes, and thus reveal different information about their sources.

The main multi-messenger sources outside the [[heliosphere]] are expected to be compact binary pairs ([[black hole]]s and [[neutron star]]s), [[supernovae]], irregular neutron stars, [[gamma-ray burst]]s, [[active galactic nuclei]], and [[relativistic jet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartos|first1=Imre|last2=Kowalski|first2=Marek|title=Multimessenger Astronomy|year=2017|publisher=IOP Publishing|doi=10.1088/978-0-7503-1369-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multimessenger Astronomy with Neutrinos|first=Anna|last=Franckowiak|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume=888|issue=12009|page=012009|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012009|year=2017}}

The [[Supernova Early Warning System]] (SNEWS), established in 1999 at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and automated since 2005, combines multiple neutrino detectors to generate supernova alerts.

The Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network (AMON),&lt;ref&gt;[http://amon.gravity.psu.edu/ AMON home page]&lt;/ref&gt; created in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network (AMON) |first1=M.W.E. |last1=Smith |display-authors=etal |journal=Astroparticle Physics |volume=45 |date=May 2013 |pages=56–70 |doi=10.1016/j.astropartphys.2013.03.003 |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140006956.pdf|arxiv=1211.5602 |bibcode=2013APh....45...56S }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a broader and more ambitious project  to facilitate the sharing of preliminary observations and to encourage the search for "sub-threshold" events which are not perceptible to any single instrument.  It is based at Pennsylvania State University.

==Milestones==

* '''1940s''': Some [[cosmic ray]]s are identified as forming in [[solar flare]]s.&lt;ref name="solarflare"&gt;{{cite book|title=Particles and Astrophysics: A Multi-Messenger Approach| first=Maurizio |last=Spurio| year= 2015|publisher=Springer|page=46|isbn=978-3-319-08050-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-08051-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1987''': Supernova [[SN 1987A]] emitted neutrinos that [[SN 1987A#Neutrino emissions|were detected]] at the [[Kamiokande]]-II, [[Irvine–Michigan–Brookhaven (detector)|IMB]] and [[Baksan Neutrino Observatory|Baksan]] neutrino observatories, a couple of hours before the supernova light was detected with optical telescopes.

* '''August 2017''': A [[Neutron star merger|neutron star collision]] in the galaxy [[NGC 4993]] produced the gravitational wave signal [[GW170817]], which was observed by the [[LIGO]]/[[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]] collaboration. After 1.7 seconds, it was observed as the [[gamma ray burst]] GRB 170817A by the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] and [[INTEGRAL]], and its optical counterpart SSS17a was detected 11 hours later at the [[Las Campanas Observatory]], then by the [[Hubble space telescope]] and the [[Dark Energy Camera]].  Ultraviolet observations by the [[Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory]], X-ray observations by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and [[Radio astronomy|radio]] observations by the [[Very Large Array|Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array]] complemented the detection. This was the first gravitational wave event observed with an electromagnetic counterpart, thereby marking a significant breakthrough for multi-messenger astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Landau |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Chou |first2=Felicia |last3=Washington |first3=Dewayne |last4=Porter |first4=Molly |title=NASA Missions Catch First Light from a Gravitational-Wave Event|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6975 |date=16 October 2017 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-observation of neutrinos was attributed to the jets being strongly off-axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Search for high-energy neutrinos from binary neutron star merger GW170817 with ANTARES, IceCube, and the Pierre Auger Observatory| journal=The Astrophysical Journal| volume=850| issue=2| pages=L35| last1=Albert|first1=A.|collaboration=ANTARES, IceCube, and the Pierre Auger Observatory|date=16 Oct 2017|arxiv=1710.05839| doi=10.3847/2041-8213/aa9aed}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December 2017, astronomers reported a brightening of X-ray emissions from GW170817/GRB 170817A/SSS17a.&lt;ref name="AST-20171209"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Haggard |first1=Daryl |last2=Ruan |first2=John J. |last3=Nynka |first3=Melania |last4=Kalogera |first4=Vicky |last5=Evans |first5=Phil |title=LIGO/Virgo GW170817: Brightening X-ray Emission from GW170817/GRB170817A/SSS17a - ATel #11041 |url=http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=11041 |date=December 9, 2017 |work=[[The Astronomer's Telegram]] |accessdate=December 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AST-20171207"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Margutti |first1=R. |last2=Fong |first2=W. |last3=Eftekharl |first3=T. |last4=Alexander |first4=E. |last5=Chornock |first5=R. |title=LIGO/Virgo GW170817: Chandra X-ray brightening of the counterpart 108 days since merger - ATel #11037 |url=http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=11037 |date=December 7, 2017 |work=[[The Astronomer's Telegram]] |accessdate=December 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''Neo-Theosophy''' is a term, originally derogatory, used by the followers of [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]] to denominate the system of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] ideas expounded by [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] following the death of Madame Blavatsky in 1891. This material differed in major respects from Blavatsky's original presentation, but it is accepted as genuinely Theosophical by many Theosophists around the world. 

==Overview==
After Blavatsky died in 1891, [[William Quan Judge]] became involved in a dispute with [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and [[Annie Besant]] over Judge allegedly forging letters from the Mahatmas. As a result, he ended his association with Olcott and Besant during 1895 and took most of the Society's American Section with him. He managed his new organization for about a year until his death in [[New York City]], whereupon [[Katherine Tingley]] became manager. The organization originating from the faction of Olcott and Besant is based in India and known as the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society - Adyar]], while the organization managed by Judge is known nowadays simply as the [[Theosophical Society Pasadena|Theosophical Society]], but often with the specification, "international headquarters, [[Pasadena, California]]."  The ''Theosophical Society - Adyar'' is the group denounced as ''Neo-Theosophy'' by those who are followers of William Q. Judge and the original teachings of Madame Blavatsky; they do not accept what they regard as the ''Neo-Theosophical'' teachings of Annie Besant, Henry Olcott, and [[C. W. Leadbeater]]. 

The term ''Neo-Theosophy'' was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912 in a book called ''Neo Theosophy Exposed'', the second part of an earlier book called ''The Theosophical Society and its Esoteric Bogeydom''.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Lewis, Jesper Aagaard Petersen, ''Controversial New Religions'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0-19-515682-X}}  Page 292&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1924, Margaret Thomas published a book called ''Theosophy Versus Neo-Theosophy''. This book, now available online,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/thomas/index.htm Theosophy vs. Neo-Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt; presents a detailed critical comparison of Blavatskyian Theosophy and Neo-Theosophy.

[[G. R. S. Mead]] who was also highly critical of the clairvoyant researches of Besant and Leadbeater, remaining loyal to Blavatskyian Theosophy,&lt;ref&gt;by [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], Clare Goodrick-Clarke  ''G. R. S. Mead and the Gnostic Quest'' North Atlantic Books {{ISBN|1-55643-572-X}} Page 22&lt;/ref&gt; also used the term Neo-Theosophy to refer to Besant's movement.  For him "Theosophy" meant the wisdom element in the great world religions and philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;cited in Demetres P. Tryphonopoulos, ''The Celestial Tradition: A Study of Ezra Pound's the Cantos'' , Wilfrid Laurier University Press 1992 {{ISBN|0-88920-202-8}} Page 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the term Neo-Theosophical came to be used outside Theosophical circles to refer to groups formed by former Theosophists as well as groups whose central premises borrow heavily from Blavatskyian Theosophy. Robert S. Ellwood, in his 1973 book ''Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America'' referred to organizations that had been formed by former Theosophists as "devolutions of Theosophy" and included in his survey "Neo-Gnostic groups and Neo-Rosicrucian groups [...] the [[Anthroposophy]] of [[Rudolf Steiner]], [...] [[Alice Bailey]]'s groups, ([[Guy Ballard]]'s) [["I AM" Activity]] and [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|Rosicrucianism]].&lt;ref&gt; Robert S. Ellwood, Jr., "Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America", Prentice-Hall, 1973 {{ISBN|0-13-773317-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later book, ''Alternative Altars'' (1979) Professor Ellwood added;

{{quote|Alice Bailey (1880 - 1949), founder of the Arcane School and the Full Moon Meditation Groups, and Guy Ballard (1878 - 1930), of the "I AM" movement, are representative of those who have started activities based on new and special communications from Theosophical Masters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Ellwood, Jr., Alternative Altars: Unconventional and Eastern Spirituality in America, University of Chicago Press, 1979 {{ISBN|0-226-20618-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The author Daryl S. Paulson associates "neo-Theosophy" with Alice Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;Daryl S. Paulson, "The Near-Death Experience: An Integration of Cultural, Spiritual, and Physical Perspectives", ''Journal of Near-Death Studies'', Springer, Netherlands, ISSN 0891-4494 (Print) 1573-3661 (Online) Issue Volume 18, Number 1 / September, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Other neo-Theosophists include [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]]'s contemporary [[Peter Deunov]] and [[Samael Aun Weor]], who introduced theosophical teachings to Latin America.  [[Dion Fortune]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] were also influencers of (and influenced by) the leading edge of the theosophical movement, which in turn influenced [[Anton LaVey]]'s [[LaVeyan Satanism|Satanism]], [[L.

== What ''type'' of thing is social science? ==

Social science can be described as all of the following:
* Branch of [[science]] &amp;ndash; systematic enterprise that builds and organizes [[knowledge]] in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the [[universe]].&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Wilson |first1 = Edward O. |title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge |edition=1st |publisher = Vintage Books |location = New York, NY |year = 1998 |isbn = 0-679-45077-7 |pages=49–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heilbron&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by [[mathematics]]; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions."&amp;nbsp;—p.vii, [[J. L. Heilbron]], (2003, editor-in-chief). ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science''.

* [[List of academic disciplines and sub-disciplines#Social sciences|Major category]] of [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]] &amp;ndash; an academic discipline is focused study in one academic field or profession. A discipline incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with academic areas of study or areas of professional practice. For example, the branches of science are commonly referred to as the scientific disciplines. For instance, gravitation is strongly associated with the discipline of physics, and is considered to be part of that disciplinary knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7453">'''Parallelism''' is a rhetorical device that compounds words or phrases that have equivalent meanings so as to create a definite pattern. This structure is particularly effective when "specifying or enumerating pairs or series of like things".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; A scheme of balance, parallelism represents "one of the basic principles of grammar and rhetoric".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelism as a [[rhetorical device]] is used in many languages and cultures around the world in poetry, epics, songs, written prose and speech, from the folk level to the professional. It is very often found in Biblical poetry and in proverbs in general. 

==Examples==

The following sentences and verses possess "similarity in structure" in words and phrases:

{{quote |''She tried to make the law clear, precise and equitable.''&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;}}

In the quote above, the compounded adjectives serve as parallel elements and support the noun "law".

{{quote |''Her purpose was to impress the ignorant, to perplex the dubious, and to confound the scrupulous.''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

In the above quote, three prepositional phrases produce the parallel structure supporting the noun "purpose". Note that this rhetorical device requires that the coordinate elements agree with one another grammatically: "nouns with nouns, prepositional phrases with prepositional phrases and adverb clauses with adverb clauses."&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the coordinate elements possess that same number of words (or in the example below, the same number of syllables) the scheme is termed [[Isocolon|isocolon]]:

{{quote |''I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,&lt;br/&gt;My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,&lt;br/&gt;My gay apparel for an almsman's gown&lt;br/&gt;My figured goblets for a dish of wood.''&lt;br/&gt;

 – [[William Shakespeare|Shakepeare]], [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]&lt;ref&gt; Baldick,2008. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Forms of parallelism==
Parallelisms of various sorts are the chief [[rhetoric]]al device of [[Biblical poetry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Parallelism}} [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11473a.htm Online version of article].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Tristich]] and in multiples of [[Distich]] parallels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11902-parallelism-in-hebrew-poetry | title=PARALLELISM IN HEBREW POETRY | publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com | accessdate=December 7, 2011 | author=Casanowicz, I. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the poetry of many other cultures around the world, particularly in their oral traditions.&lt;ref&gt;p. 216. James J. Fox. 1971. Semantic Parallelism in Rotinese Ritual Language. ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' Deel 127, 2de Afl., pp. 215-255.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Lowth]] coined the term ''parallelismus membrorum'' (parallelism of members, i.e. poetic lines) in his 1788 book, ''Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrew Nation''. [[Roman Jakobson]] pioneered the secular study of parallelism in poetic-linguistic traditions around the world, including his own Russian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, Roman. 1987. "The Poetry of Grammar and the Grammar of Poetry." In Language in Literature. K. Pomorska and S. Rudy, eds. Pp. 121-144. Cambridge, MA: The Belnap Press of Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese and Vietnamese classical poetry and prose have frequently made use of parallelism. Conversations between learned men in many cases involved exchanging single [[:zh:对偶|parallel couplets]] as a form of playing with words, as well as a kind of mental duel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ann Huss|first1=Ann|last2=Liu|first2=Jianmei|title=The Jin Yong Phenomenon: Chinese Martial Arts Fiction and Modern Chinese Literary History|date=2007|publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=9781934043080|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2j5o95IZZAMC&amp;pg=PA223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nguyen|first1=Tai Thu|title=The History of Buddhism in Vietnam|date=2008|publisher=CRVP|isbn=9781565180987|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUN8tC0ftJcC&amp;pg=PA200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a parallel couplet, not only must the content, the parts of speech, the mythological and historico-geographical allusions, be all separately matched and balanced, but most of the tones must also be paired reciprocally. Even tones are conjoined with inflected ones, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinavista.com/culture/letters/poetry/home.html Chinese Poetic Literature] ChinaVista, 1996-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelisms in artistic speech are common in some languages of Mesoamerica, such as [[Nahuatl]] (Aztec).&lt;ref&gt;William Bright. 1990. "With one lip, with two lips": Parallelism in Nahuatl. ''Language'' 66.3:437-452.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been observed in a language of Indonesia (that Fox imprecisely referred to as "Rotinese")&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James J. Fox. 1971. Semantic Parallelism in Rotinese Ritual Language. ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' Deel 127, 2de Afl., pp. 215-255.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Navajo language|Navajo]].&lt;ref&gt;Coyote Poems: Navajo Poetry, Intertextuality, and Language Choice. Anthony K. Webster. 2004. Coyote Poems: Navajo Poetry, Intertextuality, and Language Choice. ''American Indian Culture and Research Journal'' 28.4:69-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found parallelisms in the languages of the Ural-Altaic area (including Finnish-Karelian folk poetry and the epics and songs of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples) and [[Toda language|Toda]], suggesting wider distribution among Dravidian languages.&lt;ref name="James" /&gt;

== In proverbs ==
Parallelisms in [[Proverb|proverbs]] are very common in languages around the world. Parallel structures in short passages such as proverbs help direct the listener or reader to compare the parallel elements and thereby more easily deduce the point. 
*''Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.'' ([[English language|English]] proverb)
*''Wounds caused by knives will heal, wounds caused by words will not heal.'' ([[Mongolian culture|Mongolian]] proverb)
*''The truth has legs and ran away; the lie has no legs and must stay.'' ([[Yiddish culture|Yiddish]] proverb)
*''When there is food in the house, what matter if a guest arrives? When there is faith, what is death?'' ([[Afghan proverbs|Pashto proverb]])&lt;ref&gt;p. 181.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school was moved to the {{convert|60|acre|m2|sing=on}} plot at the confluence of the [[Potomac River]] and [[St. George's Creek]]&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt; at the Piney Point location in 1991,&lt;ref name="amo"/&gt; and at the same time renamed after former SIU president [[Paul Hall (labor leader)|Paul Hall]].

According to SIU, "Tens of thousands of rated and licensed seamen have completed upgrading classes at the training center. Additionally, more than 21,000 men and women from every state in the U.S., Puerto Rico and several U.S. territories have graduated from the trainee program for those just beginning their maritime careers."&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt;

The center features a number of buildings, including:&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt;
* The Joseph Sacco Fire Fighting and Safety School
* The Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship
* The Thomas B. Crowley Sr. Education Center
* The Paul Hall Library and Maritime Museum
* The Romeo Lupinacci Culinary lab

Prior to the opening of the Paul Hall Center, SIU maintained training facilities at five different ports.  In 1966, the union bought the Piney Point site.  The program grew to include other offerings, such as a reading skills program, a  high-school equivalency program, an adult basic skills program, and English as a Second Language program.&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt;

In 1978, SIU entered into an arrangement with [[Charles County Community College]] of Maryland which allows participants to earn an Associates of Arts degree.  In 1993, the Maryland Higher Education Commission authorized the college program to change its degree award to an Associate of Applied Science degree and to a certificate program in Maritime Technology.&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt;

== Training programs ==
Professional training begins with basic or entry-level vocational education programs. 
* Unlicensed Apprentice Program

The upgrading programs provide experienced seafarers the opportunity to advance their professional skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edumaritime.com/maryland/paul-hall-center-for-maritime-training-and-education Paul Hall Center Maritime Training]&lt;/ref&gt;

== NCL America ==
In 2004, [[Norwegian Cruise Lines|Norwegian Cruise Lines' ''NCL America'']] division began operating the [[Pride of Aloha]] in [[Hawaii]].  The cruise line was plagued by customer complaints which prompted them to seek out a training program for new employees.&lt;ref name="ncl bootcamp"&gt;{{cite web

'''PetroSkills''' is a competency based training provider for the Oil and Gas Industry that offers training in disciplines that range from [[upstream (petroleum industry)|upstream]], [[downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]], to [[occupational safety and health]].  PetroSkills was founded in 1963 and is based out of Tulsa, Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of PetroSkills LLC|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=31072180|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 PetroSkills began the [[PetroSkills Alliance]] by partnering with BP and Shell to involve large oil and gas companies directly into the design of course material, instructor review, and competency analysis.

In 2008 PetroSkills expanded their number of courses through the acquisition of PetrEX International, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PetroSkills Snags New Drilling Training, Consulting Company|url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=65040|publisher=RigZone|date=2008-08-04|accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 PetroSkills was acquired by BV Investment Partners. Previous owners, Ford Brett and Dennis Wing retained a minority ownership position during the acquisition. BV partner Justin Harrison was quoted as saying, "We share management's view that long-term demand drivers for oil and gas resources, the increasing technological complexity of finding and extracting oil and gas, and a demographic shift in the industry's workforce composition will drive a growing and sustainable need for quality technical training and competency-based solutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marino |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/bv-investment-partners-petroskills-211433-1.html |title=Mergers &amp; Acquisitions |publisher=Themiddlemarket.com |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Also in 2010 PetroSkills partnered with the [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology]] and began providing training to operations and maintenance technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petrocomputing.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/petroskills-announces-new-om-jv/ |title=PetroSkills Announces New O&amp;M JV " PetroComputing |publisher=Petrocomputing.wordpress.com |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership was a "response to the bigger crew change that will be occurring across operator ranks over the next decade. The demographic changes impacting the engineering ranks within E&amp;P represent a small percentage of the numbers that will be impacted in the operations and maintenance ranks.” With the introduction of PetroSkills O&amp;M, a specific focus was placed on both operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) technicians employed in upstream, midstream and downstream roles, PetroSkills O&amp;M offers companies training through both instructor-led training and e-learning content.

In 2011 PetroSkills opened its own 325,000 square foot Conference Center on January 14.  The center is located in Katy, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katyconfidential.com/2011/08/petroskills/ |title=PetroSkills Conference Center |publisher=Katy Confidential |date=2011-08-11 |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011 PetroSkills launched PetroCore, a browser-based application offering technical professionals in the oil and gas industry anytime, online access to PetroSkills course materials and other technical knowledge resources.

In 2012 PetroSkills opened a training facility in Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/3496/news/read/647737/1.html |title=Minister of Energy Opens Regional Office for PetroSkills |publisher=Al Wasat News |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2012, PetroSkills announced that it acquired John M. Campbell &amp; Co., a training provider that's focus was heavily on the facilities side of the Oil and Gas industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/122508/PetroSkills_Acquires_Training_Consulting_Businesses |title=PetroSkills Acquires Training, Consulting Businesses |publisher=RigZone |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pub quiz''' is a [[quiz]] held in a [[pub]] or [[Bar (drinking establishment)|bar]]. These events are also called '''quiz nights'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiadaynt.com.au/fun/fun.html |title=Australia Day Fun Stuff |publisher=Australiadaynt.com.au |date= |accessdate=2009-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531140132/http://www.australiadaynt.com.au/fun/fun.html |archivedate=May 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''trivia nights'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.championsforchildrenfoundation.ca/index.php?page=130 |title=World Trivia Night 2009 |publisher=Championsforchildrenfoundation.ca |date= |accessdate=2009-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809011148/http://www.championsforchildrenfoundation.ca/index.php?page=130 |archive-date=2009-08-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, or '''bar trivia''' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.triviamafia.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and may be held in other settings.  Pub quizzes may attract customers to a pub who are not found there on other days. The pub quiz is a modern example of a [[pub game]]. Although different pub quizzes can cover a range of formats and topics, they have many features in common. The pub quiz was established in the UK in the 1970s by [[Burns and Porter]] and became part of [[British culture]].&lt;ref name="Pub challenge"&gt;{{cite news|title=Q: What is one of Britain’s fast-growing pastimes? A: The pub quizzes that are seeing big screens switched for answer sheets|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/q-what-is-one-of-britain-s-fast-growing-pastimes-a-the-pub-quizzes-that-are-seeing-big-screens-8507761.html|publisher=The Independent|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great British Pub Quiz challenge is an annual event.&lt;ref name="Pub challenge"/&gt; In continental Europe, pub quizzes are a staple event at [[Irish pubs]], where they are usually held in English.

In the U.S., trivia nights are sometimes used as fundraisers for nonprofit organizations, and these are very common in the [[Greater St. Louis]] area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/st-louis-non-profits-turn-to-trivia-fundraisers/63-523843338 St. Louis non-profits turn to trivia fundraisers]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
The pub quiz was established in the UK in the 1970s, mainly by a company called [[ Burns and Porter]], to get people in to pubs on quieter nights. Popularity grew and grew over the next few years from just 30 teams to 10,000 playing each week in a Burns and Porter quiz. &lt;ref name="Pub challenge"/&gt; Redtooth runs an annual Great British Pub Quiz challenge, with more than 600 pubs taking part in 2012.&lt;ref name="Pub challenge"/&gt;

A 2009 study put the number of regular weekly pub quizzes in the UK at 22,445,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpquiz.co.uk/special-features/399-pub-quiz-statistics.html |title=Pub quiz Statistics |publisher=dpquiz.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one website has counted approximately 2,000 regular weekly quizzes in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triviareviews.com |title=TriviaReviews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May 2017 the first ever online pub quiz took place, run by Primordial Radio in the United Kingdom. It used existing technologies of a [[YouTube]] live stream and the answer sheet by survey monkey.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

== Format ==
Pub quizzes (also known as live trivia, or table quizzes) are often weekly events and will have an advertised start time, most often in the evening.

While specific formats vary, most pub quizzes depend on answers being written in response to questions which may themselves be written or announced by a quizmaster.

One format for quizzing is called "[[infinite bounce]]". This format is generally used when the number of teams in the quiz is large – usually around 8–10. Every question is addressed to the team succeeding the team that answered the previous question. If no team answers the question, the next question is addressed to the team succeeding the team to whom the previous question was addressed.

Generally someone (either one of the bar staff or the person running the quiz) will come around with pens and quiz papers, which may contain questions or may just be blank sheets for writing the answers on.  A mixture of both is common, in which case often only the blank sheet is to be handed in.  Traditionally a member of the team hands the answers in for adjudication to the quiz master or to the next team along for marking when the answers are called.

=== Teams ===
It is up to the quizzers to form teams, which are generally based on tables, though if one table has a large group around it they may decide to split up. Some pubs insist on a maximum team size (usually between six and ten).  The team members decide on a team name, often a supposedly humorous phrase or pun, which must be written on all papers handed in.

People often have to pay to participate – ranging from around 50p to £5 per person. This is often pooled to provide prize money. Many pub quizzes require no payment at all, as the event is simply a way to get paying customers into the venue, typically on less busy nights of the week.

=== Questions ===
The person asking the questions is known as the quizmaster. Quizmasters also mark and score answers submitted by teams, although formats exist where teams will mark each other's answer sheets.

The questions may be set by the bar staff or landlord, taken from a quiz book, bought from a specialist trivia company, or be set by volunteers from amongst the contestants. In the latter case, the quiz setter may be remunerated with drinks or a small amount of money.

Often questions may be drawn from the realm of 'everybody knows' trivia, therefore leading to controversies when the answers are false or unverifiable. In addition, as the quizzes are not formal affairs, slight errors in wording may lead to confusion and have led to a 2005 court case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winterman |first=Denise |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4168275.stm |title=Not just a trivia matter |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-01-13 |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK.

=== Rounds ===
There may be between one and more than half a dozen rounds of questions, totalling anything from 10 to upwards of 80 questions. Rounds may include the following kinds (most common first):

* Factual rounds – these are usually spoken, either over a [[public address]] system or just called out.  Common topics include:
** General knowledge – covering the topics listed below (if they are not in a separate round) and also topics such as history, [[geography]] and [[science]] and [[nature]]. There may well be more than one of these rounds.
** [[Sport]] – comprising the statistics and minutiae of popular, well-known sports and general facts about others.
** [[Entertainment]] – [[film|movies]], [[television|TV]] shows and music (see also below).
** True or False – questions to which the answer is True or False.
* Picture round – these use [[photocopy|photocopied]] or computer-printed hand-outs and consist of pictures to be identified, such as photos of famous people (possibly snapped out of context, or else partially obscured) or logos of companies (without tell-tale lettering), famous places or objects pictured from a strange angle.
* Who Am I? – A series of clues to the identity of a famous person (or thing). Clues are given in order of descending difficulty. The earlier a team can identify the correct answer, the more points they are awarded.
* [[Music]] round – these consist of excerpts (often only the [[introduction (music)|intro]] or other non-vocal segment) of songs played over the PA system. Usually the teams must identify the song and also the singer or band (sometimes the year the song was released is also required). Variations include the inclusion of film [[soundtrack]]s and TV theme tunes (requiring the title), and/or [[classical music]] (also requiring the composer). Some venues cannot play a music round because they do not have the proper licensing from performers rights organizations such as Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI), the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), Society of European Stage Authors and Composers (SESAC) and Global Music Rights (GMR)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.restaurant.org/Manage-My-Restaurant/Operations/Regulatory-back-office/11-questions-about-music-licensing&lt;/ref&gt;.  
* Audio round - similar to music rounds, but sound clips are played from movies, television shows, [[YouTube]] videos, etc. 
* [[Puzzle]] rounds – generally on a hand-out sheet. These may consist of [[crossword puzzle]]s, [[anagram]]s, [[Ditloid]]s, [[Rebus|Dingbats]] and basic [[mathematics]] problems.
* Novelty rounds – themed round a specific word or name (e.g. all the questions relate to a famous Norman); 'connections', where the last answer in the round provides a link to all the previous answers; true or false; and various others to break up the general stream of questions.

=== Bonus rounds ===
In some quizzes teams are able to select one or two rounds as "jokers", in which their points will be doubled (or otherwise multiplied). Teams  usually select their joker rounds before the start of the quiz, although some rounds may be excluded. Teams who consider themselves to be particularly strong on certain subjects can improve their chances with a good joker round, but risk wasting the joker if the questions are unexpectedly difficult. The idea of using a joker in a game may come from the BBC television programme ''[[It's a Knockout]]''.

Some quizzes include a bonus question, in which a single answer is required with one or more clues given each round making the answer progressively easier to solve. In some variants, the first team to hand in the correct answer wins either a spot prize or additional points to their total score. In others, the questions continue until all teams have the correct answer with each team been given progressively fewer  additional points the longer it takes them to submit the correct answer.

=== Jackpots ===
Some quizzes add a small, separate round of questions to the end of a regular quiz, with the chance to win a jackpot. Each week an amount of money is added to the jackpot, and if no team answers the questions correctly, the money rolls over to the next quiz. The maximum amount of the jackpot may be limited by local gaming regulations.

Cash jackpots may be won by a variety of methods including one-off questions and dance-offs.

=== Marking ===

In some cases, the papers are marked  by the bar staff.  Alternatively, teams may have to mark their own answers and the handed-in papers are consulted only to check that prize claimants have not cheated by altering their answers. Another method is to have teams swap papers before marking, though this can be divisive.

One or two points are scored for each correct answer; some quizzes allow half marks for "nearly right" answers (such as a celebrity's surname when their full name was required). In some quizzes, certain questions score higher marks, particularly if they are unusually difficult.

=== Cheating ===

With the mass use of [[mobile phone]]s and mobile internet access, cheating has become a problem for some pub quizzes, with covert calls and texts made in the toilets, recent newspapers and magazines brought along especially for the event, [[List_of_sports_idioms#R|ringers]] and so on. Though a maximum number of members set for teams may help to prevent large numbers of people collaborating, groups posing as several distinct teams are quite common. Some quizzes now ban the use of mobiles and nullify the score of any team found to be cheating. Though more prevalent where large sums of money are at stake, cheating can be observed even for relatively low stakes.

Some quizzes also now ban re-entry to the pub after the quiz has started, in order to prevent team members from using public internet stations, public telephones and mobile devices out of sight of the quizmaster. Generally, though, a pub runs its quiz alongside its normal operation, making such a measure impractical.

=== Prizes ===

Prizes are awarded to the highest scoring team, and often to runners-up. Prizes are usually one of the following:

* alcoholic drinks: a case of [[beer]] or some money on a bar tab to spend at that pub are common.
* cash: if money was charged for entry into the quiz, this is often pooled to form prize money. This may all go to the winning team. Alternatively, there may be a separate short set of questions or even a single 'jackpot' question to win the cash; if no team gets the right answer, the money is typically rolled over, making a larger prize the next week.
* vouchers: such as cinema discount-coupons, food discounts, or even drinks vouchers for use at the bar holding the quiz.
* drink-related promotional items from a [[brewery]], such as [[t-shirt]]s and [[pint glass|beer glass]]es advertising their products.
* miscellaneous or novelty prizes, such as chocolate or cheap toys. The winning team may get first choice to pick a prize from a range on offer.

== Technology ==
In a digital pub quiz wireless handsets replace the more usual pen and paper. A computer receives and records the answers from each team's handset and the results are exported to a spreadsheet at the end of the quiz. A time limit can be set for each question (e.g. 60 seconds) and it is possible to determine which team answers in the fastest time for spot prizes and tiebreaks.

== Commercial projects ==
As the pub quiz concept spread to the US in the 1990s, several companies formed to provide services to bars and restaurants organizing quizzes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stumptrivia.com/stump-trivia-news.html |title=Stump! Trivia News |publisher=StumpTrivia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831034701/http://www.stumptrivia.com/stump-trivia-news.html |archivedate=2011-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different from the [[quiz league]] in the UK, US commercial pub quizzes typically involve more than just two teams and can have as many as 25–35 teams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triviakings.com/locations/?l=ujballston |title=Trivia Kings Union Jack's Ballston |publisher=TriviaKings.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing in a single location, with up to 6 people per team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triviatryst.com/gameplay |title=TriviaTryst Gameplay |publisher=TriviaTryst.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Quiz companies charge bars a fee for hosting the quiz, which may range from $80 per week&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/40744/how-pub-quizzes-became-big-business/full/ |title=How Pub Quizzes Became Big Business |publisher=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com |date=2011-04-22 |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211231503/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/40744/how-pub-quizzes-became-big-business/full/ |archivedate=2011-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to $175 or more depending on attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smallbusinessnaked.com/2011/01/23/geeks-who-drink-interview/ |title=Small Business Podcast with Geeks Who Drink owner John Dicker |publisher=http://www.smallbusinessnaked.com |date=2011-01-23 |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121205056/http://www.smallbusinessnaked.com/2011/01/23/geeks-who-drink-interview/ |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least 20 different pub quiz companies currently exist in the US, with most operating events concentrated in major metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.triviareviews.com/hosts/ |title=TriviaReviews.com Listing of Hosts |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204010719/http://www.triviareviews.com/hosts/ |archivedate=2011-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leagues and competitions ==

A [[quiz league]] is an organisation that runs quizzes, normally in pubs, though such competitions are distinct from the standard pub quiz as they will normally involve two teams and often include a number of individual questions. No prizes are normally awarded at such a league match, but prizes and kudos may go to the quiz team winning a league or a [[Wiktionary:Knockout|knockout]] competition. The National Trivia Association runs a nationwide contest involving various pub trivia games played around the US.

Teams from throughout a region, county, state or country meet annually for more prestigious competitions, with greater prizes. Representative teams may either be the best team from each pub, or a team selected from the best individuals.

Believe it or Not Quiz Events in New Zealand have held an annual Champion of Champions quiz in [[Auckland]] since 1999. Initially open to teams from pubs within the greater Auckland region, it is now open to teams from throughout New Zealand. In practice, travel costs prevent most teams from the lower [[North Island]] and the [[South Island]] participating, although [[Christchurch]], [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Wellington]] have all provided teams.

The Australasian Pub Quiz Championships takes place annually since 2018. Open to teams from pubs and clubs from across Australia and New Zealand, the 2018 Championships is simultaneously run in Sydney, Canberra and Wellington in late April.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

In the United States National Trivia Association presents "The Riddle", a finals event open to eligible teams who play the official NTA "Quizzo!" live trivia game. Approximately a thousand players attended the 2008 event in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

== World record ==
The largest pub quiz, according to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]'', was the "Quiz for Life", held at the Flanders Expo Halls in [[Ghent]], Belgium, on 11 December 2010 with 2,280 participants.

== In popular culture ==
*Pub quizzes have appeared in the [[British sitcoms]] ''[[Minder (TV series)]]'', ''[[Bottom (TV series)| Bottom]]'', ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]'', ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' and ''[[Early Doors]]'', amongst others.

'''Religious literacy''' is the knowledge of, and ability to understand, [[religion]]. The importance of being religiously literate is increasing as [[globalisation]] has created greater links and [[human migration|migration]] between societies of different faiths and cultures. It has been proposed that including religious literacy as an aspect of public education would improve [[social cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ780618&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ780618 Comprehensive Religious Studies in Public Education: Educating for a Religiously Literate Society].

'''Residency''' or '''postgraduate training''' is a stage of graduate [[medical education]]. It refers to a qualified physician, [[podiatrist]], or [[dentist]] (one who holds the degree of [[Doctor of medicine|MD]], [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine|DPM]], [[Doctor of Dental Surgery|DDS]], [[Doctor of Dental Medicine|DMD]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]] or [[Bachelor of Medicine|MB; BS, MBChB, or BMed]], [[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS]],
[[Bachelor of Dentistry|BDent]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/about/legislation/medical_act.asp#2|title=Our role and the Medical Act 1983|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/education-careers/becoming-physician/frequently-asked-questions.page?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ada.org/en/education-careers/dental-student-resources/career-options-after-dental-school/understanding-advanced-dental-education/program-options-and-descriptions|title=Advance Education Program Options and Descriptions|website=www.ada.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bda.org/students/careers-education/spheres/hospital-dentistry|title=Hospital dentistry|website=bda.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/physician|title=Definition of PHYSICIAN|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who practises [[medicine]], usually in a hospital or clinic, under the direct or indirect supervision of a senior clinician registered in that specialty such as an [[attending physician]] or [[consultant (medicine)|consultant]]. In many jurisdictions, successful completion of such training is a requirement in order to obtain an unrestricted license to practise medicine, and in particular a license to practise a chosen [[specialty (medicine)|specialty]]. An individual engaged in such training may be referred to as a '''resident''', '''house officer''', '''registrar''' or '''trainee''' depending on the jurisdiction. Residency training may be followed by [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] or [[sub-specialty]] training.

Whereas [[medical school]] teaches physicians a broad range of medical knowledge, basic clinical skills, and supervised experience practicing medicine in a variety of fields, medical residency gives in-depth training within a specific branch of medicine.

==Terminology==
A ''resident physician'' is more commonly referred to as a ''resident'', ''senior house officer'' (in Commonwealth countries), or alternatively as a ''senior resident medical officer'' or ''house officer''. Residents have graduated from an accredited medical school and hold a medical degree (MD, DO, MBBS, MBChB). Residents are, collectively, the ''house staff'' of a hospital. This term comes from the fact that resident physicians traditionally spend the majority of their training "in house," i.e., the hospital.  

Duration of residencies can range from three years to seven years, depending upon the program and specialty. A year in residency begins between late June and early July depending on the individual program, and ends one calendar year later. In the United States, the first year of residency is known as an internship with those physicians being termed "interns." Depending on the number of years a specialty requires, the term ''junior resident'' may refer to residents that have not completed half their residency. ''Senior residents'' are residents in their final year of residency, although this can vary. Some residency programs refer to residents in their final year as ''chief residents'' (typically in surgical branches). Alternatively, a ''chief resident'' may describe a resident who has been selected to extend his or her residency by one year and organize the activities and training of the other residents (typically in internal medicine and pediatrics). 

If a physician finishes a residency and decides to further his or her education in a fellowship, he or she is referred to as a "fellow." Physicians who have fully completed their training in a particular field are referred to as ''[[attending physician]]s,'' or ''[[Consultant (medicine)|consultants]]'' (in Commonwealth countries). However, the above nomenclature applies only in educational institutes in which the period of training is specified in advance. In privately owned, non-training hospitals, in certain countries, the above terminology may reflect the level of responsibility held by a physician rather than their level of education.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}

Residency as an opportunity for advanced training in a medical or surgical specialty evolved in the late 19th century from brief and informal programs for extra training in a special area of interest. The first formal residency programs were established by Sir [[William Osler]] and [[William Stewart Halsted]] at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Residencies elsewhere then became formalized and institutionalized for the principal specialties in the early 20th century. But even mid-century, residency was not seen as necessary for general practice and only a minority of primary care physicians participated. By the end of the 20th century in North America though, very few new doctors went directly from medical school into independent, unsupervised medical practice, and more state and provincial governments began requiring one or more years of postgraduate training for [[Medical license|medical licensure]].

Residencies are traditionally hospital-based, and in the middle of the twentieth century, residents would often live (or "reside") in hospital-supplied housing. "Call" (night duty in the hospital) was sometimes as frequent as every second or third night for up to three years. Pay was minimal beyond room, board, and laundry services. It was assumed that most young men and women training as physicians had few obligations outside of medical training at that stage of their careers.

The first year of practical patient-care-oriented training after medical school has long been termed "internship." Even as late as the middle of the twentieth century, most physicians went into primary care practice after a year of internship. Residencies were separate from internship, often served at different hospitals, and only a minority of physicians did residencies.

== Afghanistan ==
In Afghanistan, the residency ([[Dari language|Dari]], ''تخصص'') consists of a three to seven years of practical and research activities in the field selected by the candidate. The graduate medical students do not need to complete the residency because they study medicine in six years (three years for clinical subjects, three years clinical subjects in hospital) and one-year internship and they graduate as general practitioner. Most of students do not complete residency because it is too competitive.

==Argentina==
In Argentina, the residency (Spanish, ''residencia'') consists of a three to four years of practical and research activities in the field selected by both the candidate and already graduated [[Physician|medical practitioners]].  Specialized fields such as neurosurgery or cardio-thoracic surgery require longer training. Through these years, consisting of internships, social services, and occasional research, the resident is classified according to their residency year as an R1, R2, R3 or R4. After the last year, the "R3 or R4 Resident" obtains the specialty (''especialidad'') in the selected field of medicine.

==Australia==
In Australia, specialist training is undertaken as a [[Medical education in Australia#Registrarship / Speciality Training Programs|registrar]]. Entry into a specialist training program occurs after completing 1 year as an intern (post-graduate year 1 or "PGY1"), then at least 1 year as a resident (PGY2 onwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ama.com.au/careers/doctors-training-and-career-advancement|title=Doctors in training and career advancement|date=2018-03-01|work=Australian Medical Association|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training lengths can range from 3 years for general practice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racgp.org.au/education/registrars/fellowship-pathways/australian-general-practice-training-program-agpt/vocational-training-pathway|title=Royal Australian College of General Practitioners|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 7 years for paediatric surgery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/chw/future-paediatricians/paedsurgeon.php|title=Becoming a Paediatric Surgeon - CHW Clinical School - The University of Sydney|last=Office|first=Publications|website=sydney.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Colombia==
In Colombia, fully licensed physicians are eligible to compete for seats in residency programs. To be fully licensed, one must first finish a medical training program that usually lasts five to six years (varies between universities), followed by one year of medical and surgical internship. During this internship a national medical qualification exam is required, and, in many cases, an additional year of unsupervised medical practice as a social service physician. Applications are made individually program by program, and are followed by a postgraduate medical qualification exam. The scores during medical studies, university of medical training, curriculum vitae, and, in individual cases, recommendations are also evaluated. The acceptance rate into residencies is very low (~1–5% of applicants in public university programs), physician-resident positions do not have salaries, and the tuition fees reach or surpass US$10,000 per year in private universities, and $2,000 in public universities.{{fact|date=May 2018}} For the reasons mentioned above, many physicians travel abroad (mainly to Argentina, Brazil, Spain and the United States) to seek postgraduate medical training. The duration of the programs varies between three and six years. In public universities, and some private universities, it is also required to write and defend a medical thesis before receiving a specialist degree.

==France==
{{See also|Medical school in France#Third cycle of the medical studies}}
In France, students attending clinical practice are known as "externes" and newly qualified practitioners training in hospitals are known as "internes". The residency, called "Internat", lasts from three to six years and follows a competitive national ranking examination. It is customary to delay submission of a thesis. As in most other European countries, many years of practice at a junior level may follow.
French residents are often called "doctor" during their residency. Literally speaking, they are still students and become M.D. only at the end of their residency and after submitting and defending a thesis before a jury.

==Greece==
In Greece, licensed physicians are eligible to apply for a position in a residency program. To be a licensed physician, one must finish a medical training program which in Greece lasts for six years. A one-year obligatory rural medical service (internship) is necessary to complete the residency training.&lt;ref name="dasta.auth.gr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dasta.auth.gr/cmsitem.aspx?sid=2&amp;id=139|title=To obtain medical specialty|website=Resources office Aristotle University of Thessaloniki|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications are made individually in the prefecture where the hospital is located, and the applicants are positioned on first-come, first-served basis.&lt;ref name="dasta.auth.gr"/&gt; The salary of a physician-resident is 10,000 euro per year. The duration of the residency programs varies between three and seven years.

==Mexico==

In Mexico physicians need to take the ENARM (National Test for Aspirants to Medical Residency) (Spanish, ''Examen Nacional de Aspirantes a Residencias Medicas'') in order to have a chance for a medical residency in the field he or she wishes to specialize. The physician is allowed to apply to only one speciality each year. Some 35,000 physicians apply and only 8000 are selected. The selected physicians bring their certificate of approval to the hospital that they wish to apply (Almost all the hospitals for medical residency are from government based institutions). The certificate is valid only once per year and if the resident decides to drop residency and try to enter to a different speciality she will need to take the test one more time (no limit of attempts). All the hosting hospitals are affiliated to a public/private university and this institution is the responsible to give the degree of "specialist". This degree is unique but equivalent to the MD used in the UK and India. In order to graduate, the trainee is required to present a thesis project and defend it.

The length of the residencies is very similar to the American system. The residents are divided per year (R1, R2, R3, etc.). After finishing the trainee may decide if he wants to subspecialize (equivalency to fellowship) and the usual length of sub-specialty training ranges from two to four years. In Mexico the term "fellow" is not used.

The residents are paid by the hosting hospital, about US$1000–$1100 (paid in Mexican pesos). Foreign physicians do not get paid and indeed are required to pay an annual fee of $1000 to the university institution that the hospital is affiliated with. 
All the specialties in Mexico are board certified and some of them have a written and an oral component, making these boards ones of the most competitives in Latin America.

==Pakistan==

In [[Pakistan]], after completing [[MBBS]] degree and further completing one year [[Internship (medicine)|house job]], doctors can enroll in two types of postgraduate residency programs. First is [[Master of Surgery|MS]]/[[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] program run by various medical universities throughout the country. It is a 4–5-year program depending upon the [[specialty (medicine)|specialty]]. Second is fellowship program which is called [[Fellow of College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan]] (FCPS) by the [[College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan]] (CPSP). It is also a 4–5-year program depending upon the [[specialty (medicine)|specialty]].

There are also post-fellowship programs offered by the [[College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan]] as a second fellowship in sub specialties.

==Spain==
All Spanish medical degree holders need to pass a competitive national exam (named 'MIR') in order to access the specialty training program. This exam gives them the opportunity to choose both the specialty and the hospital where they will train, among the hospitals in the Spanish Healthcare Hospital Network. Currently, medical specialties last from 4 to 5 years.

There are plans to change the training program system in a similar way the UK does. There have been some talks between [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Ministry of Health]], the Medical College of Physicians and the Medical Student Association but it is not clear how this change process is going to be.

==Sweden==
===Prerequisites for applying to a specialist training program===

A physician practicing in [[Sweden]] may apply to a specialist training program ({{lang-sv|Specialisttjänstgöring}}) after being licensed as a [[Doctor of Medicine]] by [[National_Board_of_Health_and_Welfare_(Sweden)|The National Board of Health and Welfare]].&lt;ref name="Swe01"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://legitimation.socialstyrelsen.se/en/educated-outside-eu-and-eea/doctor-of-medicine |title=Application for a license in health care |author=Socialstyrelsen |date=23 August 2016 |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain a license through the [[Education_in_Sweden|Swedish education system]] a candidate must go through several steps. First the candidate must successfully finish a five-and-a-half-year [[Undergraduate_education|undergraduate program]], made up of two [[year]]s of pre-clinical studies and three and a half years of clinical postings, at one of [[List_of_medical_schools_in_Europe#Sweden|Sweden's seven medical schools]]—[[Uppsala University]], [[Lund University]], [[Karolinska_Institute|The Karolinska Institute]], [[University_of_Gothenburg|The University of Gothenburg]], [[Umeå University]], or [[Örebro University]]—after which a [[Academic_degree|degree]] of [[Master of Science]] in Medicine ({{lang-sv|Läkarexamen}}) is awarded.&lt;ref name="Swe02"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uu.se/utbildning/utbildningar/selma/program/?pKod=MME2Y |title=Läkarprogrammet 2018/2019 |author=Uppsala universitet |access-date=24 April 2018 |language=Swedish |trans-title=The Medical Program 2018/2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree makes the physician applicable for an [[Internship_(medicine)|internship]] ({{lang-sv|Allmäntjänstgöring}}) ranging between 18–24 [[month]]s, depending on the [[Workplace|place of employment]].

The internship is regulated by the National Board of Health and Welfare and regardless of place of employment it is made up of four main postings with a minimum of nine months divided between [[internal medicine]] and surgery—with no less than three months in each posting—three months in [[psychiatry]], and six months in [[general practice]].&lt;ref name="Swe03"&gt;{{cite book |author=Socialstyrelsen |date=June 2006 |title=Tjänstgöringsbok för AT-läkare |trans-title=Posting Registration Book for Intern Physicians |url=https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/Lists/Artikelkatalog/Attachments/9607/2006-119-1_20061191_omtryck.pdf |language=Swedish |location=Lindesberg, Sweden |publisher=Bergslagens Grafiska AB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is customary for many hospitals to post interns for an equal amount of time in surgery and internal medicine (e.g. six months in each of the two). An intern is expected to care for patients with a certain degree of independence but is under the supervision of more [[Attending_physician|senior physicians]] who may or may not be on location.

During each clinical posting the intern is evaluated by senior colleagues and is, if deemed having [[skill]]s corresponding to the [[goal]]s set forth by The National Board of Health and Welfare, passed individually on all four postings and may go on to take a written exam in multiple-choice format on common [[Case_presentation|case presentations]] in surgery, internal medicine, psychiatry, and general practice.&lt;ref name="Swe03" /&gt;

After passing all four main postings of the internship and the written exam, the physician may apply to The National Board of Health and Welfare to be licensed as a Doctor of Medicine. Upon application the physician has to pay a licensing fee of [[Swedish_krona|SEK]] 2,300&lt;ref name="Swe04"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://legitimation.socialstyrelsen.se/sv/utbildad-i-sverige/lakare/ansok-om-legitimation |title=Ansök om legitimation |trans-title=Apply for a License |language=Swedish |author=Socialstyrelsen |date=29 August 2017 |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—approximately equivalent to [[Euro|EUR]] 220 or [[United_States_dollar|USD]] 270, as per exchange rates on 24 April 2018—out of pocket, as it is not considered to be an expense directly related to [[medical school]] and thus is not covered by the state.

[[International_medical_graduate|Physicians who have a foreign medical degree]] may apply for a license through different paths, depending on whether they are licensed in another [[European_Union|EU]] or [[European_Economic_Area|EEA]] country or not.&lt;ref name="Swe05"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://legitimation.socialstyrelsen.se/en/educated-outside-eu-and-eea/doctor-of-medicine |title=Doctor of Medicine |author=Socialstyrelsen |date=23 August 2016 |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialty Selection===

The Swedish medical specialty system is, as of 2015, made up of three different types of specialties; base specialties, subspecialties, and add-on specialties. Every physician wishing to specialize starts by training in a base specialty and can thereafter go on to train in a subspecialty specific to their base specialty. Add-on specialties also require previous training in a base specialty and/or subspecialty but are less specific in that they, unlike subspecialties, can be entered into through several different previous specialties.&lt;ref name="Swe06"&gt;{{cite act |title=Läkarnas specialiseringstjänstgöring |trans-title=Physicians' Speciality Training |language=Swedish |date=17 February 2015 |url=http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/Lists/Artikelkatalog/Attachments/19743/2015-3-1.pdf |accessdate=24 April 2018 |article=2015-3-1 |issn=0346-6000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the base specialties are grouped into eight [[Class_(set_theory)|classes]]—pediatric specialties, imaging and functional medicine specialties, independent base specialties, internal medicine specialties, surgical specialties, laboratory specialties, neurological specialties, and psychiatric specialties.&lt;ref name="Swe06" /&gt;

It is a requirement that all base specialty training programs are at least five years in length.&lt;ref name="Swe06" /&gt; Common reasons for base specialty training to take longer than five years is paternity or maternity leave and/or simultaneous PhD studies.

=====Geriatric psychiatry=====
To train in the add-on specialty of [[geriatric psychiatry]] a physician must first be a specialist in geriatrics and/or psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Swe06" /&gt;

===Application process===

There is no centralized selection process for internship or residency positions. The application process is more similar to that of other jobs on the market—i.e. application via cover letter and curriculum vitae. Both types of positions are however usually publicly advertised and many hospitals have nearly synchronous recruitment processes once or twice per year—mainly depending on hospital size—for their internship positions.

====Factors====

Apart from the requirement that candidates are graduates from approved medical programs and, in the case of residency, licensed as medical doctors, there are no specific criteria an employer has to consider in hiring for an internship or residency position. This system for recruiting has been criticized by [[Swedish_Medical_Association|The Swedish Medical Association]] for lacking transparency&lt;ref name="Swe07"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cederberg |first1=Jesper |date=20 March 2017 |title=Sylfs certifiering ska göra AT-rekryteringen schysstare |trans-title=Sylf's Certification Will Make Recruitment of Intern Physicians More Just |language=Swedish |url=http://lakartidningen.se/Aktuellt/Nyheter/2017/03/Sylfs-certifiering-ska-gora-AT-rekryteringen-schysstare/ |journal=Läkartidningen |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for delaying time to specialist certification of physicians&lt;ref name="Swe08"&gt;{{cite report |author=Sveriges yngre läkares förening |date=October 2017 |title=SYLF:s väntetidsrapport 2017 |trans-title=SYLF's Wait Time Report 2017 |language=Swedish |url=https://www.slf.se/upload/SYLF/SYLF.se/Publikationer/AT-ranking/SYLFs-vantetidsrapport-2017.pdf |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There are nevertheless factors that most employers will consider, the most important being how long a doctor has been in active practice.&lt;ref name="Swe08" /&gt; After completing nine out of a total of eleven semesters of medical school a student may work as a physician on a temporary basis—e.g. during [[Summer_vacation|summer breaks]] from university.&lt;ref name="Swe09"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/ansokaomlegitimationochintyg/forarbetsgivare/anstallalakareutanlegitimation |title=Anställa läkare utan legitmation |author=Socialstyrelsen |access-date=24 April 2018 |language=Swedish |trans-title=Hiring Physicians without a License}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule enables medical graduates to start working as physicians upon graduating from university without yet being licensed, as a way of building [[experience]] to be able to eventually be hired into an internship. According to a 2017 survey by The Swedish Medical Association, interns in the country as a whole had worked an average of 10.3 months as physicians before starting their internships, ranging from an average of 5.1 months for interns in the [[Dalarna]] region to an average of 19.8 months for interns in the [[Stockholm]] region.&lt;ref name="Swe08" /&gt;

In recruitment for residency positions less emphasis is often placed on the number of months a candidate has worked after finishing their internship, but it is common for physicians to work for some time in between internship and residency, much in the same way as between medical school and internship.

==United Kingdom==

===History===
In the United Kingdom, house officer posts used to be optional for those going into general practice, but almost essential for progress in hospital medicine. The Medical Act of 1956 made satisfactory completion of one year as house officer necessary to progress from provisional to full registration as a medical practitioner. The term "intern" was not used by the medical profession, but the general public were introduced to it by the US television series about "[[Dr Kildare]]." They were usually called " housemen" but the term resident was also used unofficially. However, in some hospitals the "resident medical officer" (RMO) (or "resident surgical officer" etc.) was the most senior of the live-in medical staff of that specialty.

The pre-registration house officer posts lasted six months, and it was necessary to complete one surgical and one medical post. Obstetrics could be substituted for either. In principle, general practice in a "Health Centre" was also allowed, but this was almost unheard of. The posts did not have to be in general medicine: some teaching hospitals had very specialised posts at this level, so it was possible for a new graduate to do [[neurology]] plus [[neurosurgery]] or [[orthopedic surgery|orthopaedics]] plus [[rheumatology]], for one year before having to go onto more broadly based work. The pre-registration posts were nominally supervised by the General Medical Council, which in practice delegated the task to the medical schools, who left it to the consultant medical staff. The educational value of these posts varied enormously.

On call work in the early days was full-time, with frequent night shifts and weekends on call. One night in two was common, and later one night in three. This meant weekends on call started at 9&amp;nbsp;am on Friday and ended at 5&amp;nbsp;pm on Monday (80 hours). Less acute specialties such as dermatology could have juniors permanently on call. The European Union's controversial [[Working Time Directive]]&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald JEF, Caesar B, 2012 399–403"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fitzgerald JE, Caesar BC | title = The European working time directive: A practical review for surgical trainees | journal = International Journal of Surgery | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = 399–403 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22925631 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijsu.2012.08.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; conflicted with this: at first the UK negotiated an opt-out for some years, but working hours needed reform. On call time was unpaid until 1975 (the year of the house officers' one-day strike), and for a year or two depended on certification by the consultant in charge – a number of them refused to sign. On call time was at first paid at 30% of the standard rate. Before paid on call was introduced, there would be several house officers "in the house" at any one time and the "second on call" house officer could go out, provided they kept the hospital informed of their telephone number at all times.

A "pre-registration house officer" would go on to work as a "senior house officer" for at least one year before seeking a registrar post. SHO posts could last six months to a year, and junior doctors often had to travel around the country to attend interviews and move house every six months while constructing their own training scheme for general practice or hospital specialisation. Locum posts could be much shorter. Organised schemes were a later development, and do-it-yourself training rotations became rare in the 1990s. Outpatients were not usually a junior house officer's responsibility, but such clinics formed a large part of the workload of more senior trainees, often with little real supervision.

Registrar posts lasted one or two years, and sometimes much longer outside an academic setting. It was common to move from one registrar post to another. Fields such as psychiatry and radiology used to be entered at the registrar stage, but the other registrars would usually have passed part one of a higher qualification, such as a Royal College membership or fellowship before entering that grade. Part two (the complete qualification) was necessary before obtaining a senior registrar post, usually linked to a medical school, but many left hospital practice at this stage rather than wait years to progress to a consultant post.

Most British clinical diplomas (requiring one or two years' experience) and membership or fellowship exams were not tied to particular training grades, though the length of training and nature of experience might be specified. Participation in an approved training scheme was required by some of the royal colleges. The sub-specialty exams in surgery, now for [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons]], were originally limited to senior registrars. These rules prevented many of those in non-training grades from qualifying to progress.

Once a Senior Registrar, depending on specialty, it could take anything from one to six years to go onto a permanent consultant and/or senior lecturer appointment. It might be necessary to obtain an MD or ChM degree and to have substantial published research. Transfer to general practice or a less favoured specialty could be made at any stage along this pathway: [[Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran|Lord Moran]] famously referred to [[general practitioner]]s as those who had "fallen off the ladder."

There are also permanent non-training posts at sub-consultant level: previously senior hospital medical officer and medical assistant (both obsolete) and now staff grade, specialty doctor and associate specialist. The regulations do not call for much experience or any higher qualifications, but in practice both are common, and these grades have high proportions of overseas graduates, ethnic minorities and women.

Research fellows and PhD candidates are often clinical assistants, but a few were senior or specialist registrars. A large number of "Trust Grade" posts have been created by the new NHS trusts for the sake of the routine work, and many juniors have to spend time in these posts before moving between the new training grades, although no educational or training credit is given for them. Holders of these posts may work at various levels, sharing duties with a junior or middle grade practitioner or with a consultant.

===Post 2005===
The structure of medical training was reformed in 2005 when the [[Modernising Medical Careers|Modernising Medical Careers (MMC)]] reform programme was instituted. House officers and the first year of senior house officer jobs were replaced by a compulsory two-year foundation training programme, followed by competitive entry into a formal specialty-based training programme. Registrar and Senior Registrar grades had been merged in 1995/6 as the specialist registrar (SpR) grade (entered after a longer period as a senior house officer, after obtaining a higher qualification, and lasting up to six years), with regular local assessments panels playing a major role. Following MMC these posts were replaced by StRs, who may be in post up to eight years, depending on the field.

The structure of the training programmes vary with specialty but there are five broad categories:
* Themed core specialties (A&amp;E, ITU and anaesthetics)
* Surgical specialties
* Medical specialties
* Psychiatry
* Run-Through Specialties (e.g. General Practice, Clinical Radiology, Pathology, Paediatrics)

The first four categories all run on a similar structure: the Trainee first completes a two-year structured and broad-based core training programme in that field (such as core medical training) which makes them eligibile for competitive entry into an associated specialty training scheme (e.g.  gastroenterology if core medical training has been completed). The Core training years are referred to as CT1 and CT2, and the specialist years are ST3 onwards until completing training. Core training and the first year or two of speciality training are equivalent to the old Senior House Officer jobs.

It is customary for trainees in these areas to sit their Membership examinations (such as the [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians|Royal College of Physicians (MRCP)]], or the [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS)]]) in order to progress and compete for designated sub-specialty training programmes that attract a national training number as specialty training year 3 (ST3) and beyond – up to ST 9 depending on the particular training specialty.

In the 5th category, the trainee immediately starts specialty training (ST1 instead of CT1) progressing up to Consultant level without break or further competitive application process (run-through training). Most of the run-through schemes are in stand-alone specialties (such as radiology, public health or histopathology), but there are also a few traditionally surgical specialities which can be entered directly without completing core surgical training – neurosurgery, obstetrics &amp; gynaecology and ophthalmology. The length of this training varies, for example general practice is 3 years while radiology is 5 years.

The UK grade equivalent of a US fellow in medical/surgical sub-specialties is the specialty registrar (ST3–ST9) grade of sub-specialty training, but note that while US fellowship programmes are generally 2–3 years in duration after completing the residency, UK trainees spend 4–7 years. This generally includes service provision in the main specialty; this discrepancy lies in the competing demands of NHS service provision and UK postgraduate training stipulating that even specialist registrars must be able to accommodate the general acute medical take—almost equivalent to what dedicated attending internists perform in the United States (they still remain minimally supervised for these duties).

==United States==
In some states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fsmb.org/licensure/usmle-step-3/state_specific|title=FSMB - State-Specific Requirements For Initial Medical Licensure|website=www.fsmb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the United States, physicians may usually obtain a general [[medical license]] to practice medicine without supervision after completing one year of internship in the state of their license. Many residents have medical licenses and do legally practice medicine without supervision ("moonlight") in settings such as urgent care centers and rural hospitals. However, in most residency-related settings, residents are supervised by [[attending physician]]s who must approve of their decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.staffcare.com/medical-moonlighting-for-residents-pros-and-cons/|title=Medical Moonlighting for Residents: The Pros and Cons|website=www.staffcare.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialty selection===
Different specialties differ in length of training, competitiveness-size, and options. Programs range from three years for family medicine to 7 years for neurosurgery.&lt;ref&gt;http://residency.wustl.edu/Choosing/SpecDesc/Pages/Neurosurgery.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This time is not including a potential [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] which can be completed after residency to further sub-specialize. In 2015 there were almost 7000 positions for internal medicine compared to around 400 positions for dermatology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://residency.wustl.edu/Choosing/SpecDesc/Pages/Dermatology.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018230120/http://residency.wustl.edu/Choosing/SpecDesc/Pages/Dermatology.aspx |archive-date=18 October 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally in regards to options, specialties can range from having over 400 training programs nationally (internal medicine) to just 26 programs for integrated thoracic surgery.

===Application process===

====Factors====
There are many factors that can go into what makes an applicant more or less competitive. According to a survey of residency program directors by the NRMP in 2012, the following three factors were mentioned by directors over 71% of the time as having the most impact:
* Step 1 score (82%)
* Letters of recommendation in specialty (81%)
* Personal statement (77%)

Between 50% and 71% also mentioned other factors such as core clerkship grades/ Step 2 score/ specialty clerkship grades/ allopathic medical school attendance/ MSPE-dean's letter.&lt;ref name="nrmp.org"&gt;http://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/programresultsbyspecialty2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These factors often come as a surprise to many students in the preclinical years, who often work very hard to get great grades, but do not realize that only 45% of directors cite basic science performance as an important measure.&lt;ref name="nrmp.org"/&gt;

====Written====
Applicants begin the application process with ERAS (regardless of their matching program) at the beginning of their fourth and final year in medical school.

At this point, students choose specific residency programs to apply for that often specifies both specialty and hospital system, sometimes even subtracks (e.g. Internal Medicine Residency Categorical Program at Mass General or San Francisco General Primary Care Track).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medicine.ucsf.edu/education/residency/|title=UCSF - Department of Medicine - Residency Programs - Residency Programs|website=medicine.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massgeneral.org/medicine/education/residency.aspx?id=47|title=Internal Medicine Residency Program - Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA|website=www.massgeneral.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After they apply to programs, programs review applications and invite selected candidates for interviews held between October and February. As of 2016, schools can view applications starting 1 Oct.&lt;ref&gt;https://students-residents.aamc.org/attending-medical-school/how-apply-residency-positions/applying-residencies-eras/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interviews====
The interview process involves separate interviews at hospitals around the country. Frequently, the individual applicant pays for travel and lodging expenses, but some programs may subsidize applicants' expenses. Generally, an interview begins with a dinner the night before in a relaxed, "meet-and-greet" setting with current residents and/or staff. Formal interviews with attendings and senior residents are then held the next day, and the applicant tours the program's facilities.

Interview questions are primarily related to the applicant's interest in the program and specialty. The purpose of these tasks is to force an applicant into a pressured setting and less to test his or her specific skills.

To defray the cost of residency interviews, social networking sites have been devised to allow applicants with common interview dates to share travel expenses. Nonetheless, additional loans are often required for "residency and relocation".

[[international medical graduate|International medical students]] may participate in a residency program within the United States as well but only after completing a program&lt;!-- not sure of this word, there was one missing here prior --&gt; set forth by the [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]] (ECFMG). Through its program of certification, the ECFMG assesses the readiness of international medical graduates to enter residency or fellowship programs in the United States that are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). The ECFMG does not have jurisdiction over Canadian M.D. programs, which the relevant authorities consider to be fully equivalent to U.S. medical schools. In turn, this means that Canadian M.D. graduates, if they can obtain the required visas (or are already U.S. citizens or permanent residents), can participate in U.S. residency programs on the same footing as U.S. graduates.

====The match====
{{Main|National Resident Matching Program}}
{{See also|Comparison of MD and DO in the United States#Residency Training}}
{{See also|Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges}}

=====Ranking=====
Access to graduate medical training programs such as residencies is a competitive process known as "the Match." After the interview period is over, students submit a "rank-order list" to a centralized matching service that depends on the residency program they are applying for:

* most specialties – currently{{When|date=September 2014}} the [[National Resident Matching Program]], abbreviated NRMP) by February
* Urology Residency Match Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.auanet.org/education/urology-and-specialty-matches.cfm|title=American Urological Association - Urology and Specialty Matches|website=www.auanet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* SF Match (Ophth/ Plastics)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfmatch.org/Specialty.aspx|title=Residency and Fellowship Match|website=www.sfmatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* American Osteopathic Association Match&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/Education/students/match-program/Pages/match-results.aspx|title=2018 AOA Match Results|website=www.osteopathic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, residency programs submit a list of their preferred applicants in rank order to this same service. The process is blinded, so neither applicant nor program will see each other's list. Aggregate program rankings can be found here, and are tabulated in real time based on applicants' anonymously submitted rank lists.

The two parties' lists are combined by an NRMP computer, which creates stable (a proxy for optimal) matches of residents to programs using an [[Stable marriage problem|algorithm]]. On the third Friday of March each year ("[[Match Day (medicine)|Match Day]]") these results are announced in Match Day ceremonies at the nation's 155 U.S. medical schools. By entering the Match system, applicants are contractually obligated to go to the residency program at the institution to which they were matched.  The same applies to the programs; they are obligated to take the applicants who matched into them.

=====Match Day=====
On the Monday of the week that contains the third Friday in March, candidates find out from the NRMP whether (but not where) they matched. If they have matched, they must wait until Match Day, which takes place on the following Friday, to find out where. In 2019, Match Day will be March 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nrmp.org/residency/main-match-events/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929004259/http://www.nrmp.org/residency/main-match-events/ |archive-date=29 September 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====SOAP=====
Informally called the scramble, the Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program (SOAP) is process for applicants that did not secure a position through the Match, the locations of remaining unfilled residency positions are released to unmatched applicants the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrmp.org/residency/soap/|title=SOAP for Applicants Video - The Match, National Resident Matching Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These applicants are given the opportunity to contact the programs about the open positions. This frantic, loosely structured system forces soon-to-be medical school graduates to choose programs not on their original Match list. In 2012, the NRMP introduced an "organized scramble" system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrmp.org/|title=NRMP TO IMPLEMENT MATCH WEEK CHANGES|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2014}} As part of the transition, Match Day was also moved from the third Thursday in March to the third Friday.

=====Changing Residency=====
Inevitably, there will be discrepancies between the preferences of the student and programs. Students may be matched to programs very low on their rank list, especially when the highest priorities consist of competitive specialties like [[radiology]], [[neurosurgery]], [[plastic surgery]], [[dermatology]], [[ophthalmology]], [[orthopedics]], [[otolaryngology]], [[radiation oncology]], and [[urology]]. It is not unheard of for a student to go even a year or two in a residency then switching to a new program.

A similar but separate osteopathic match exists which announces its results in February, before the NRMP. [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Osteopathic physicians]] ([[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]]s) may participate in either match, filling either M.D. positions (traditionally obtained by physicians with the [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree or international equivalent including the [[MBBS|MBBS or MBChB degree]]) accredited by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] (ACGME), or DO positions accredited by the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA).

Military residencies are filled in a similar manner as the NRMP however at a much earlier date (usually mid-December) to allow for students who did not match to proceed to the civilian system.

In 2000–2004 the matching process was attacked as [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive]] by resident physicians represented by [[class-action]] lawyers. ''See, e.g., [[Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges]] et al.,'' [[Case citation|300 F.Supp.2d 119]] ([[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|DDC]] 2004).  Congress reacted by carving out a specific exception in [[antitrust]] law for medical residency. ''See'' [[Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004]] § 207, Pub. L. No. 108-218, 118 Stat. 596 (2004) (codified at {{UnitedStatesCode|15|37b}}). The lawsuit was later dismissed under the authority of the new act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/14/us/antitrust-lawsuit-over-medical-residency-system-is-dismissed.html |first=S. |last=Robinson |title=Antitrust Lawsuit Over Medical Residency System Is Dismissed |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=14 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The matching process itself has also been scrutinized as limiting the employment rights of medical residents, namely where upon acceptance of a match, medical residents pursuant to the matching rules and regulations, are required to accept any and all terms and conditions of employment imposed by the health care facility, institution or hospital.&lt;ref name="Robert N. Wilkey pg. 705"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkey|first=Robert N.|title=The Non-Negotiable Employment Contract: Diagnosing the Employment Rights of Medical Residents|journal=Creighton Law Review|date=April 2011|page=705|volume=44|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=44+Creighton+L.+Rev.+705&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=502ed991cce7e63ca2636692e6e58e0f|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE Step 1]] or [[Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination|COMLEX Level 1]] score is just one of many factors considered by residency programs in selecting applicants. Although it varies from specialty to specialty, [[Alpha Omega Alpha]] membership, clinical clerkship grades, letters of recommendation, class rank, research experience, and school of graduation are all considered when selecting future residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrmp.org/data/programresultsbyspecialty2010v3.pdf|title=Results of the 2010 NRMP Program Director Survey|accessdate=2011-04-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721091632/http://www.nrmp.org/data/programresultsbyspecialty2010v3.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of long hours===
''See main article on [[Medical resident work hours]]''

Medical residencies traditionally require lengthy hours of their trainees. Early residents literally resided at the hospitals, often working in unpaid positions during their education. During this time, a resident might always be "on call" or share that duty with just one other practitioner. More recently, 36-hour shifts were separated by 12 hours of rest, during 100+ hour weeks.  The American public, and the medical education establishment, recognized that such long hours were counter-productive, since [[sleep deprivation]] increases rates of [[medical error]]s.  This was noted in a landmark study on the effects of sleep deprivation and error rate in an [[Intensive-care unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{note|Landrigan}}{{cite journal |vauthors=Landrigan CP, Rothschild JM, Cronin JW, Kaushal R, Burdick E, Katz JT, Lilly CM, Stone PH, Lockley SW, Bates DW, Czeisler CA | title = Effect of reducing interns' work hours on serious medical errors in intensive care units | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 351 | issue = 18 | pages = 1838–48 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15509817 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa041406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Drazen JM | title = Awake and informed | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 351 | issue = 18 | page = 1884 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15509822 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMe048276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] (ACGME) has limited the number of work-hours to 80 hours weekly (averaged over 4 weeks), overnight call frequency to no more than one overnight every third day, and 10 hours off between shifts. Still, a review committee may grant exceptions for up to 10%, or a maximum of 88 hours, to individual programs. Until early 2017, duty periods for postgraduate year 1 could not exceed 16 hours per day, while postgraduate year 2 residents and in those in subsequent years can have duty periods up to a maximum of 24 hours of continuous duty. After early 2017, all years of residents may work up to 24-hour shifts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/730579?src=mp&amp;spon=25&amp;uac=149266AJ New ACGME Standards for Resident Duty Become Effective July 2011] Article written by Laurie Barclay, 14 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; While these limits are voluntary, adherence has been mandated for the purposes of accreditation, though lack of adherence to hour restrictions is not uncommon.

Most recently, the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) built upon the recommendations of the ACGME in the December 2008 report ''Resident Duty Hours: Enhancing Sleep, Supervision and Safety''. While keeping the ACGME's recommendations of an 80-hour work week averaged over 4 weeks, the IOM report recommends that duty hours should not exceed 16 hours per shift, unless an uninterrupted five-hour break for sleep is provided within shifts that last up to 30 hours. The report also suggests residents be given variable off-duty periods between shifts, based on the timing and duration of the shift, to allow residents to catch up on sleep each day and make up for chronic sleep deprivation on days off.

Critics of long residency hours trace the problem to the fact that a resident has no alternatives to positions that are offered, meaning residents must accept all conditions of employment, including very long work hours, and that they must also, in many cases, contend with poor supervision. This process, they contend, reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours.&lt;ref name="Robert N. Wilkey pg. 705"/&gt;

Supporters of traditional work hours contend that much may be learned in the hospital during the extended time. Some argue that it remains unclear whether patient safety is enhanced or harmed by a reduction in work hours which necessarily lead to more transitions in care. Some of the clinical work traditionally performed by residents has been shifted to other healthcare workers such as ward clerks, nurses, laboratory personnel, and [[phlebotomists]]. It has also resulted in a shift of some resident work towards home work, where residents will complete paperwork and other duties at home as to not have to log the hours.

===Adoption of working time restrictions===
United States federal law places no limit on resident work hours.  Regulatory and legislative attempts at limiting resident work hours have been proposed, but have yet to be passed.  Class action litigation on behalf of the 200,000 medical residents in the US has been another route taken to resolve the matter.

Dr. Richard Corlin, president of the [[American Medical Association]], has called for re-evaluation of the training process, declaring "We need to take a look again at the issue of why the resident is there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gupta |first=Sanjay |title=AMA expected to take up resident work hours |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html |accessdate=28 August 2012 |newspaper=CNN |date=15 June 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527031017/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html |archivedate=27 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2002, an 80-hour work limit went into effect in residencies accredited by the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). The decision also mandates that interns and residents in AOA-approved programs may not work in excess of 24 consecutive hours exclusive of morning and noon educational programs. It does allow up to six hours for inpatient and outpatient continuity and transfer of care. However, interns and residents may not assume responsibility for a new patient after 24 hours.

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) rejected a petition filed by the [[Committee of Interns &amp; Residents]]/SEIU, a national union of medical residents, the [[American Medical Student Association]], and [[Public Citizen]] that sought to restrict medical resident work hours. OSHA instead opted to rely on standards adopted by ACGME, a private trade association that represents and accredits residency programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Residents' Work Hours|url=http://www.citizen.org/hrg/article_redirect.cfm?ID=6666|publisher=Public Citizen|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 2003, the ACGME instituted standards for all accredited residency programs, limiting the work week to 80 hours a week averaged over a period of four weeks.  These standards have been voluntarily adopted by residency programs.

Though re-accreditation may be negatively impacted and accreditation suspended or withdrawn for program non-compliance, the number of hours worked by residents still varies widely between specialties and individual programs. Some programs have no self-policing mechanisms in place to prevent 100+ hour work-weeks while others require residents to self-report hours. In order to effectuate complete, full and proper compliance with maximum hour work hour standards, there are proposals to extend U.S. federal whistle-blower protection to medical residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkey|first=Robert N|title=Federal Whistleblower Protection: A Means to Enforcing Maximum Hour Legislation for Medical Residents|journal=William Mitchell Law Review|year=2003|volume=30|issue=1|url=http://open.wmitchell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&amp;context=wmlr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2F|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404012642/http://open.wmitchell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&amp;context=wmlr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2F|archivedate=4 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of limiting the work week include disruptions in continuity of care and limiting training gained through involvement in patient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowe, MD|first=Merlin C|title=Have Resident Work Hour Restrictions Compromised Training – a Pediatrician's Perspective|url=http://www.doctorslounge.com/index.php/articles/page/295|accessdate=28 August 2012|newspaper=Doctor's Lounge|date=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns have arisen in Europe, where the [[Working Time Directive]] limits doctors to 48 hours per week averaged out over a 6-month reference period.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald JEF, Caesar B, 2012 399–403"/&gt;

Recently,{{when|date=July 2011}} there has been talk of reducing the work week further, to 57 hours.  In the specialty of neurosurgery, some authors have suggested that surgical subspecialties may need to leave the ACGME and create their own accreditation process, because a decrease of this magnitude in resident work hours, if implemented, would compromise resident education and ultimately the quality of physicians in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AANS News|work=|publisher=|date=|url=http://www.aans.org/young_neurosurgeons/spring_08.asp#DutyHours|access-date=11 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007155958/http://www.aans.org/young_neurosurgeons/spring_08.asp#DutyHours#DutyHours|archive-date=7 October 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted, however, that in other areas of medical practice, like internal medicine, pediatrics and radiology, reduced resident duty hours may be not only feasible but advantageous to trainees because this more closely resembles the practice patterns of these specialties, though it has never been determined that trainees should work fewer hours than graduates.

In 2007, the [[Institute of Medicine]] was commissioned by Congress to study the impact of long hours on [[medical errors]].  New ACGME rules went into effect on 1 July 2011 limiting first-year residents to 16-hour shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Program Requirements|url=http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/home/Common_Program_Requirements_07012011.pdf|publisher=ACGME|accessdate=29 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313215923/http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/home/Common_Program_Requirements_07012011.pdf|archivedate=13 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new ACGME rules were criticized in the journal ''Nature and Science of Sleep''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dovepress.com/implementing-the-2009-institute-of-medicine-recommendations-on-residen-peer-reviewed-article-NSS |title=Implementing the 2009 Institute of Medicine recommendations on residen |doi=10.2147/NSS.S19649 |publisher=Dovepress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; for failing to fully implement the IOM recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2008/Resident-Duty-Hours-Enhancing-Sleep-Supervision-and-Safety.aspx |title=Resident Duty Hours: Enhancing Sleep, Supervision, and Safety – Institute of Medicine |publisher=Iom.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923160200/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2008/Resident-Duty-Hours-Enhancing-Sleep-Supervision-and-Safety.aspx |archivedate=23 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research requirement===
The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education clearly states the following three points in the Common Program Requirements for Graduate Medical Education:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.acgme-i.org/web/requirements/internationalfoundational.pdf ACGME International Foundational Program Requirements for Graduate Medical Education.] Updated: 110211&lt;/ref&gt;
#The curriculum must advance residents’ knowledge of the basic principles of research, including how research is conducted, evaluated, explained to patients, and applied to patient care.
#Residents should participate in scholarly activity.
#The sponsoring institution and program should allocate adequate educational resources to facilitate resident involvement in scholarly activities.
Research remains a nonmandatory part of the curriculum and many residency programs do not enforce the research commitment of their faculty leading to a non-Gaussian distribution of the Research Productivity Scale.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Financing residency programs===
The [[Department of Health and Human Services]], primarily [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], funds the vast majority of residency training in the US.  This tax-based financing covers resident salaries and benefits through payments called Direct Medical Education or DME payments.  Medicare also uses taxes for Indirect Medical Education or IME payments, a subsidy paid to teaching hospitals that is tied to admissions of Medicare patients in exchange for training resident physicians in certain selected specialties.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb1997&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-20004039/medicare-funding-for-medical-education-a-waste-of| last = Gottlieb | first =  S. | year = 1997 | journal = USA Today | title = Medicare Funding for Medical Education: A Waste of Money? | volume = 126 | pages = 20–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall funding levels, however, have remained frozen over the last ten years, creating a bottleneck in the training of new physicians in the US, according to the AMA.&lt;ref name=Crosdale&gt;{{cite news|last=Croasdale|first=Myrle|title=Innovative funding opens new residency slots|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2006/01/30/prl20130.htm|accessdate=29 August 2012|newspaper=American Medical News|date=30 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some argue that Medicare subsidies for training residents simply provide surplus revenue for hospitals which recoup their training costs by paying residents salaries (roughly $45,000 per year) that are far below the residents' market value.&lt;ref name="pmid12224893"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reinhardt UE | title = Dreaming the American dream: once more around on physician workforce policy | journal = Health Aff (Millwood) | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 28–32 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12224893 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.21.5.28| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nicholson S, Song D | title = The incentive effects of the Medicare indirect medical education policy | journal = Journal of Health Economics | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 909–933 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11758052 | doi = 10.1016/S0167-6296(01)00099-6 | last2 = Song | first2 = D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson concludes that residency bottlenecks are not caused by a Medicare funding cap, but rather, by Residency Review Committees (which approve new residencies in each specialty) which seek to limit the number of specialists in their field to maintain high incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Nicholson | first =  S. | year = 2003 | title = Barriers to Entering Medical Specialties | journal = NBER Working Paper No. 9649 |doi=10.3386/w9649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, hospitals trained residents long before Medicare provided additional subsidies for that purpose.  A large number of teaching hospitals fund resident training to increase the supply of residency slots, leading to the modest 4% total growth in slots from 1998 to 2004.&lt;ref name=Crosdale /&gt;

===Changes in postgraduate medical training===
Many changes have occurred in postgraduate medical training in the last fifty years:
#Nearly all physicians now serve a residency after graduation from medical school. In many states, full licensure for unrestricted practice is not available until graduation from a residency program. Residency is now considered standard preparation for primary care (what used to be called "general practice").
#While physicians who graduate from osteopathic medical schools can choose to complete a one-year rotating clinical internship prior to applying for residency, the internship has been subsumed into residency for MD physicians. Many DO physicians do not undertake the rotating internship as it is now uncommon for any physician to take a year of internship before entering a residency, and the first year of residency training is now considered equivalent to an internship for most legal purposes.  Certain specialties, such as ophthalmology, radiology, anesthesiology, and dermatology, still require prospective residents to complete an additional internship year, prior to starting their residency program training.
#The number of separate residencies has proliferated and there are now dozens. For many years the principal traditional residencies included internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, neurology, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, otolaryngology, urology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and psychiatry. Some training once considered part of internship has also now been moved into the fourth year of medical school (called a subinternship) with significant basic science education being completed before a student even enters medical school (during their undergraduate education before medical school).
#Pay has increased, but residency compensation continues to be considered extremely low when one considers the hours involved.  The average annual salary of a first year resident is $45,000 for 80 hours a week of work, which translates to $11.25 an hour.  This pay is considered a "living wage," but it is far lower pay than that of the average first-year college graduate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Unlike most attending physicians (that is, those who are not residents), they do not take call from home; they are usually expected to remain in the hospital for the entire shift.
#Call hours have been greatly restricted. In July 2003, strict rules went into effect for all residency programs in the US, known to residents as the "work hours rules". Among other things, these rules limited a resident to no more than 80 hours of work in a week (averaged over four weeks), no more than 24 hours of clinical duties at a stretch with an additional 6 hours for transferring patient care and educational requirement (with no new patients in the last six), and call no more often than every third night. In-house call for most residents these days is typically one night in four; surgery and obstetrics residents are more likely to have one in three call. A few decades ago, in-house call every third night or every other night was the standard. While on paper this has decreased hours, in many programs there has been no decrease in resident work hours, only a decrease in hours recorded. Even though many sources cite that resident work hours have decreased, residents are commonly encouraged or forced to hide their work hours to appear to comply with the 80-hour limits.
#For many specialties an increasing proportion of the training time is spent in outpatient clinics rather than on inpatient care. Since in-house call is usually reduced on these outpatient rotations, this also contributes to the overall decrease in the total number of on-call hours.
#For all [[ACGME]] accredited programs since 2007, there was a call for adherence to ethical principles.&lt;ref name="pmid13678423"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lakhan SE | title = Diversification of U.S. Medical Schools via Affirmative Action Implementation | journal = BMC Medical Education | volume = 3 | page = 6 | year = 2003 | pmid = 13678423 | pmc = 212493 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6920-3-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to personal debt===
In a survey of more than 15,000 residents in internal medicine, approximately 19% of residents with more than $200,000 in debt designated their quality of life as bad, compared with approximately 12% of those with no debt.&lt;ref name=West011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=West CP, Shanafelt TD, Kolars JC | title = Quality of Life, Burnout, Educational Debt, and Medical Knowledge Among Internal Medicine Residents | journal = JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 306 | issue = 9 | pages = 952–60 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21900135 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2011.1247 | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/749203?src=mp&amp;spon=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, residents with more than $200,000 in loans scored 5 points lower on Internal Medicine In Training Exam than those who were debt-free.&lt;ref name=West011/&gt;

==Following a successful residency==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}

In Australia and New Zealand, it leads to eligibility for fellowship of the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]], the [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]], or a number of similar bodies.

In [[Medical school in Canada|Canada]], once medical doctors successfully complete their residency program, they become eligible for certification by the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]] or [[The College of Family Physicians of Canada]] (CFPC) if the residency program was in family medicine. Many universities now offer "enhanced skills" certifications in collaboration with the CFPC, allowing family physicians to receive training in various areas such as [[emergency medicine]], [[palliative care]], maternal and child health care, and [[hospital medicine]]. Additionally, successful graduates of the family medicine residency program can apply to the "Clinical Scholar Program" in order to be involved in family medicine research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/postgrad/programs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216230339/http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/postgrad/programs.htm |archivedate=16 December 2014 |df= }} Post-Graduate Medical Education, McGill University&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mexico]], after finishing their residency, physicians obtain the degree of "Specialist," which renders them eligible for certification and fellowship, depending on the field of practice.

In South Africa, successful completion of residency leads to board certification as a specialist with the Health Professions Council and eligibility for fellowship of the [[Colleges of Medicine of South Africa]].

In the United States, it leads to eligibility for [[board certification]] and membership/fellowship of several [[List of medical specialty colleges in the United States|specialty colleges]] and academies.

'''Salem State University''' is a 4-year public University located in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. Salem State University, established in 1854 as '''Salem Normal School''', is located approximately 15 miles north of Boston, Massachusetts. In 1932 the institution was renamed Salem Teachers College, and from 1968 to 2010 it was known as Salem State College. {{As of|2013}}, Salem State enrolled 7,664 undergraduate and 1,637 graduate, full- and part-time students, from 27 states and 57 foreign countries. The university offers [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]] and  [[Masters Degree]]s in the Arts and Sciences, [[Masters of Business Administration]], and Post Masters Certificates in more than 40 academic disciplines.  In addition, the university also offers [[Continuing Education]] courses for credit and non-credit.

==History==
Salem State University was founded in 1854 as the Salem Normal School under the guidance of [[Horace Mann]]. The Salem Normal School holds the distinction of being the fourth [[normal school]] to open in Massachusetts, and only the tenth to open in the United States. Initially, the school was a 2-year, post-secondary educational institution reserved for women. In 1898, the school became co-educational by enrolling its first group of male students that September.

In 1896 the school relocated to its current location in South Salem (to the building known today as the Sullivan Building). A few years later the Horace Mann Laboratory School was opened. With the construction of a more formal campus, the school was able to lengthen its curriculum to a 4-year study program in 1921. The first bachelor's degree program was in commercial education. In 1932, the school was renamed Salem Teachers College.

In 1960, the school was renamed State Teachers' College at Salem, and shortly thereafter in 1968 the school was renamed to Salem State College. Under the leadership of President Frederick Meier, the physical campus developed quite rapidly during the 1960s, with the construction of new academic buildings, the institution's first residence halls, and a student union. Throughout the 1970s, the school continued to expand its physical campus by constructing a new library, the O’Keefe Athletic Center, and by purchasing the land for what is today known as South Campus.

In the mid-1990s, the college moved forward with purchasing a 37.5-acre industrial site on Loring Avenue. The site was formerly home to a lightbulb plant owned by the [[GTE|General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corporation]], formerly [[Sylvania Electric Products]]. When GTE decided to exit the electrical equipment market, they sold off their former factory to Salem State. That site, is today known as Central Campus. It houses the Bertolon School of Business and three residence complexes: Viking Hall, Marsh Hall and Atlantic Hall.

On July 26, 2010, Massachusetts Governor [[Deval Patrick]] signed into law a bill that changed the name of institution to Salem State University. The name change became official on October 26, 2010.

==Campus==
[[Image:Salem State University.jpg|thumb|right|Edward Sullivan Building at the intersection of Lafayette Street and Loring Avenue.]]
Salem State University is divided into six unique campuses totaling a land-mass of 115 acres with approximately thirty-three buildings.&lt;ref name=ff/&gt; The main campus (North Campus) is located about a mile south of downtown Salem at the intersection of Lafayette Street and Loring Avenue. Within short walking distance from north campus is central campus, south campus, the School of Social Work, and the Richard O'Keefe Athletic Center. The university also operates a maritime facility at Cat Cove on the Salem harbor; located a mile north of the main campus.

'''North Campus'''

North campus is the largest of the five campuses. The majority of the university's arts and science programs are housed within the two academic buildings on north campus; the Edward Sullivan Building and Frederick Meier Hall. A focal point of north campus is the George H. Ellison Campus Center which houses the career and counseling centers as well as a number of student organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salemstate.edu/3531.php|title=Campus Center|accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshman resident students are housed on north campus in two identical freshman residence halls. Other facilities on north campus include the university's main dining complex, the Mainstage Auditorium, the Horace Mann Laboratory School.  

'''Central Campus'''

Central campus is the second largest of the five campuses. The Bertolon School of Business, the music department, and the communications department are all housed in the one academic building on central campus; the Classroom Building. Freshmen, sophomores and transfer students reside in Marsh Hall, Sophomores and juniors reside in Viking Hall and junior and senior students reside in Atlantic Hall. A focal point of central campus is the university's Enterprise Center (small business center). Other facilities on central campus included the campus bookstore, the admissions center, the recital hall, and the university's baseball field and tennis courts.

'''South Campus'''

South campus houses the university's College of Health and Human Services. The School of Nursing, the School of Social Work, and the criminal justice department are housed in the two academic buildings on south campus; the [[Kevin B. Harrington]] Building and the Academic Building. Junior and senior resident students are housed on south campus in the Bates Residence Complex. Other facilities on south campus included the Alumni House and the Center for International Education.

'''School of Social Work'''

The Salem State School of Social Work is located at 297 Lafayette St., just a short walk from North Campus. It is a former synagogue purchased by the University in 2014, and houses many of the classes for the School of Social Work.

'''Richard O'Keefe Athletic Center'''

The O'Keefe Center houses the university's athletic department. Facilities include Twohig Gymnasium, Rockett Ice Arena, Alumni Field, the Gassett Fitness Center and two swimming pools.

'''Cat Cove Maritime Facility'''

'''Schleberoda''' is a village and a former municipality in the [[Burgenlandkreis]] district, in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Germany]]. Since 1 July 2009, it is part of the town [[Freyburg, Germany|Freyburg]].

It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called [[Landesausbau]] and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Schleberoda is located north of the [[Unstrut]]. It was founded as a result of intensive land development by clearance in the [[High Middle Ages]] such as other villages with ″root″ (Roda) in the name (e.g. Albersroda, Baumersorda, Schnellroda, Ebersroda and Schleberoda).    
The closely bordering local nobles in the area separated their territories using stone landmarks, as is still visible at the historic edges of the nearby woods, authentic landmarks which have been unchanged since the High Middle Ages: The clearance work and founding of new villages ran southwards from the original parish of Mücheln and ended at the Neue Göhle forest, which belonged to the territory of the [[Landgrave of Thuringia|Landgraves of Thuringia]] and could therefore not be cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linien und Säume, Zonen und Räume an der Ostgrenze des Reiches im frühen und hohen Mittelalter.|trans-title=Lines and frontiers, zones and spaces at the Eastern border of the empire of the Early and High Medieval Ages|pages=39–56|author=Hardt, Matthias|publisher=Wien|date=2000|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The forest Neue Göhle (Old Sorbian name gola = heath forest) has survived as a continuous, large forest complex. It was used for the production of pole wood in the context of [[winegrowing]] at a very early point in time, which is why it had been afforested in the form of coppice-with-standards.  Stone landmarks, ditches, banks and paths are still visible at the historic edges of this woods separated the territories of the closely bordering local nobles in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1913|language=German|trans-title=On the history of the so-called ″circular villages" in the region of Naumburg. An agricultural research.|title=Zur Geschichte der sogenannten "Kreisdörfer" im Naumburger Kreise. Eine agrarhistorische Studie.|author=Naumann, Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steinmeister vineyard.jpg|thumb|Steinmeister vineyard]]

== Today ==
Schleberoda has retained the structures and authentic form dating from the time of its foundation. It is an examples of the land development in the contact area between [[Germans]] and [[Slavs]] in the [[High Middle Ages]]. It has been able to retain its original ground plan as a radial round village dating from the High Middle Ages.  Around the original village [[pond]], serving for fire-fighting, and the bake house, replaced at the end of the [[18th century]], forward-gabled and side-gabled buildings are grouped, some made with packed loam, with high-quality portals dating from the [[16th century|16th]] to [[19th century]]. 
The position of the former gate to the compact village settlement is still identifiable today. Including the outer boundary of the official village area is not only identifiable by a circumferential path and has survived in its original form to the north-west in the shape of an impenetrable hedge. The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] choir tower of the village church with coupled abat sons has survived.

'''''Scientology''''' is a compilation book about the [[Church of Scientology]] and the [[new religious movement]] [[Scientology]], edited by [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]]. It was published in March 2009 by [[Oxford University Press]]. In addition to Lewis, other contributors to the book include [[J. Gordon Melton]], [[William Sims Bainbridge]], [[Douglas E. Cowan]], [[David G. Bromley]], [[Anson Shupe]], [[James T. Richardson]], and [[Susan J. Palmer]]. ''Scientology'' gives an overview and introduction to the organization, and presents an analysis of the movement from the perspective of [[sociology]]. The book compares the organization to other religious movements, and goes over its history of controversy. It delves into the practices of the organization and activities of its missions.

''Scientology'' was given an unfavorable review in the ''International Journal of Cultic Studies'', which considered the book unduly biased in Scientology's favour, a view echoed in a review in satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''.&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; It received a positive review in ''Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review'', describing it as "the most sophisticated academic item published on Scientology" to date, a book to be read by journalists and academics alike, and "the most important collection of scholarly articles on Scientology published so far – in any language".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

==Editor==
At the time of the book's publication, James R. Lewis was employed as a lecturer in the subject of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Oxford University Press | title =  Scientology - About the Author| work =  OUP USA  | publisher = www.oup.com | year =  2009| url = http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/ReligionTheology/SociologyofReligion/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195331493 | accessdate =2010-01-29  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part covers "Theoretical and Quantitative Approaches", examining Scientology's [[soteriology]] as well as the degree to which Scientology can be said to be growing. The third part focuses on the "Community and Practices" of Scientology, while the fourth part, "Sources and Comparative Approaches", examines Scientology's religious claims. Part V is focused on "Controversy", such as Scientology's battles with the [[anti-cult movement]] and court cases in different countries concerning Scientology's recognition or lack of recognition as a religion. The sixth part analyzes the organization's activities in its "International Missions", while the seventh examines "Dimensions of Scientology", including a chapter on the [[Xenu]] myth.

Various chapters comment on Scientology's growth. Lewis puts forth the assertion that the religion is growing at a "healthy—but not a spectacular—rate" (22 percent over the period from 1990 to 2001, from 45,000 to 55,000 according to an American survey of religious self-identification), and states that contrary to the Church's own claims, it is "clearly not the world's fastest growing".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; William Sims Bainbridge, a [[sociologist]], asserts that Scientology has experienced growth along the [[West Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; Bainbridge looked at statistical data on the percentage of websites managed by Scientologists, and his studies revealed that the most significant portion was in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the state of [[California]].&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; According to Bainbridge, the experience of Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] in [[science fiction]] writing combined with the Church of Scientology's skill with the "emerging cyberculture" might lead to ways that the organization can change in a future that further utilizes technology.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; In a section of the book on dealings of the organization in [[Denmark]], researchers found that there was a decrease in the number of people joining the organization, and that the number of dedicated Scientologists in the country remained steady for the past two decades.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; [[University of Copenhagen]] researchers Rie Wallendorf and Peter B. Andersen write that the Church of Scientology in Denmark is wary of those external to the organization, and that this detracts from the likelihood that new members will join.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt;

[[Charles de Gaulle University – Lille III|Charles De Gaulle University]] researcher [[Régis Dericquebourg]] writes that when compared to the Scientology practice of "[[Auditing (Scientology)|Auditing]]", other ceremonies carried out by the organization have more restricted levels of participation.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; According to Dericquebourg, these Scientology ceremonies include social functions which are frequented mainly by "elite members".&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; [[University Bordeaux Montaigne|University Michel de Montaigne]] researcher Bernardette Rigal-Cellard investigated the various Scientology missions and determined that these missions operated with a United States-based type of methodology.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; This form of organizational structure and operational tactics is seen as not working well in areas where the U.S. is not seen favorably, including sections of [[Western Europe]], but agreeable to locations sympathetic to American culture.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt;

==Critical reception==

===Reviews in scholarly journals===

====Review by Terra Manca====
''Scientology'' was given a negative review by Terra Manca writing in the ''International Journal of Cultic Studies'', the journal of the [[International Cultic Studies Association]].&lt;ref name="manca"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manca|first=Terra|title=Book Review: Scientology by James R. Lewis (editor)|journal=International Journal of Cultic Studies|date=November 1, 2010|url=http://www.icsahome.com/articles/book-review-scientology-ijcs-2010|accessdate=2010-11-17|volume=1|issue=1|publisher=[[International Cultic Studies Association]]|pages=90–96|oclc=608305709|location=[[Bonita Springs, Florida]]|issn=2154-7270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manca wrote, "it is most likely to please persons who take an uncritical view of Scientology."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Of the lack of standards of research utilized in the book, the review stated, "far too many contributors in this volume fail to critically assess the data that they gather, thereby falling short of providing evidence that has undergone rigorous academic inquiry. Without rigor or critical assessment, a book such as this one (about a supposed new religious movement [NRM]) risks becoming pro-NRM propaganda."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca's review put forth the argument, "although this book brings needed academic attention to Scientology, its shortfalls are substantial enough to render it as an unreliable source of information about the organization."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;

{{quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote="... although this book brings needed academic attention to Scientology, its shortfalls are substantial enough to render it as an unreliable source of information about the organization."|source=&amp;nbsp;—''International Journal of Cultic Studies''&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;}}
Manca criticized the book for failing to include substantive analysis of several aspects within the controversial history of the Scientology organization, including its treatment in countries Germany and [[Belgium]]; lack of discussion regarding Scientology programs including [[Narconon]], [[Criminon]], [[World Literacy Crusade]], and [[Applied Scholastics]]; dearth of coverage regarding use within the organization of the [[Suppressive Person]] [[jargon]] and related practice of [[Disconnection]]; scarcity of commentary on the successor to the organization's [[intelligence agency]] [[Guardian's Office]] with the [[Office of Special Affairs]], and failure to cite critical scholarship on the subject matter.&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca noted that aside from simply neglecting to utilize key academic scholarship on the topic, the authors of chapters within ''Scientology'' also failed to seriously analyze material received from primary-sources including Scientology organization representatives.&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; The review asserted, "This lack of critical inquiry leads to some conclusions that appear biased, involves the use of polarized language, and significantly diminishes the quality of information that might have challenged Scientology's claims regarding itself and its founder."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; The review criticized ''Scientology'' for the fact that two contributors had added a reference to [[Wikipedia]] to their essays – "citing questionable sources can produce questionable results, which in turn can discredit the value of academic research".&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca questioned the judgement of the book's publisher for allowing this type of writing practice, "It is surprising that editors at Oxford University Press allow Wikipedia to stand as an appropriate scholarly source in this or any volume."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;

The ''International Journal of Cultic Studies'' book review observed that the researchers were not removed in expressed point-of-view from the topic they wrote about, "Despite Lewis's claims, he and many of his contributors fail to remain neutral".&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca did not recommend the book for research on the Scientology organization, "Because of its numerous and varied shortcomings, this new book on Scientology is a poor sourcebook on the organization."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca wrote that due to the poor quality of the work, the book itself could be cited as an example of problematic research, "Oddly enough, because of its numerous shortfalls and biases, ''Scientology'' may be useful to anyone who is studying the pro-cult/counter-cult debate and who wants to see numerous examples of biased scholarship by apparently polarized researchers."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; The review concluded, "As a reference for inquiry into Scientology, however, this book fails on many fronts."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;

A 30-page review by the German [[Protestant]] [[theologian]] and [[history of religion]] scholar Marco Frenschkowski in ''Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review'' stated that the book "simply put is the most
sophisticated academic item published on Scientology so far", adding that "this does not mean it will not be controversial, or that every statement in the book holds up to scrutiny."&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski&gt;{{Cite journal

Frenschkowski lauded Lewis's introduction, in which Lewis notes scholars' reluctance to publish Scientology research, given the organization's reputation as "a litigious organization, ready to sue anyone who dares criticize the Church", and addresses Scientologists' tendency to misunderstand the nature of the academic process.&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; Frenschkowski described Melton's chapter as finding "a fine balance between critical observations and giving due weight to the point of view of devoted Scientologists [...] This does not mean defending Scientology: it means taking both members and critics seriously."&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

Frenschkowski welcomed Rothstein's chapter on the [[Xenu]] myth as an "important study", stating that it "defines a very good starting point for further research".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; He commented that Rothstein was right to praise "the anonymous Wikipedia article on the subject", a fact that was reflective of "the deeply unsatisfying state of affairs" that to date there had been not a single peer-reviewed journal article covering the topic.&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; However, he wished Rothstein had contextualized the myth more with Hubbard's other [[space opera]] writings, and the [[science fiction]] field in general, and suggested more work needed to be done on this.&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

Frenschkowski listed some minor errors in the anthology, said he regretted the absence of a glossary, and was critical of the fact that there were several overlaps between various chapters; however, his main point of criticism was that apart from some new data based on the quantitative sociological approach, the book mainly presented overviews of data already known, stating that "this does not diminish the value of this fine collection, but the next academic publications on Scientology should not be once again overviews but monographs on special questions", "more specialized, in-depth studies on concepts, ideas and practices working with new data".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

Towards the end of his review, Frenschkowski recalls the editor's prediction, made in the introduction, that the book would "likely end up pleasing no one engaged in the Scientology/anti-Scientology conflict, which is perhaps as it should be".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; Summing up, Frenschkowski states that the book pleased him, at any rate, and that he wished for it to be "read not just by academics but also e.g. by journalists [...]. It is the most important collection of articles on Scientology published so far – in any language."&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

===Other reviews===
The book received a critical analysis in the British [[satire|satirical]] and current affairs [[magazine]] ''[[Private Eye]]''.&lt;ref name="hislop"&gt;{{cite journal|editor-last=Hislop|editor-first=Ian|title=Literary Review: Cult cock - OUP|journal=[[Private Eye]]|volume=|issue=|page=16|publisher= Pressdram Ltd|location = | date = April 17, 2009| url = | doi = |issn=0032-888X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review criticized the book for its unusually sympathetic tone and for not mentioning numerous notable controversies surrounding Scientology.&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; ''Private Eye'' was critical of the book's presentation of asserted facts regarding the life of Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], as given in two separate instances in the book by contributors [[J. Gordon Melton]] and [[David G. Bromley]].&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; Melton stated his contribution gave, "an overview of the life of L. Ron Hubbard anchored by the general agreed facts",&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; and Bromley asserted, "Although the basic outline of L. Ron Hubbard's life is not contested, the LRH persona has been a subject of particularly intense debate. Church critics have charged that many of the claims that Hubbard made about his own life and accomplishments are empirically false."&lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt; The ''Private Eye'' review called this notion "poppycock", writing, "Everything about Scientology's founder is contested, though no one reading this book would realise that."&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; As an example of disputed material about Hubbard's life, the review contrasted assertions by Melton about the [[military career of L. Ron Hubbard]] with documented [[United States Navy]] records cited by author [[Russell Miller]] in the [[biography]], ''[[Bare-Faced Messiah]]''.&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt;

The ''Private Eye'' review concluded by criticizing [[Oxford University Press]] for publishing the book: "What is utterly mystifying is why one of the oldest and most respected publishing houses in the world chooses to give its imprimatur to this tendentious drivel."&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; When questioned by ''Private Eye'', a spokesman for Oxford University Press responded, "Certainly this book was peer-reviewed."&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; ''Private Eye'' joked that the [[peer review]]ers of the book may have been controversial figures [[Jeffrey Archer|Lord Archer]] and [[Conrad Black|Lord Black]].&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt;

Richard Cimino, founder and editor of the Religioscope Institute-published newsletter ''Religion Watch'', wrote that the book "focuses less on the church's abuses than on its organizational dynamics and teachings, although its authors do broach controversial issues."&lt;ref name="cimino"&gt;{{cite news| last =Cimino  | first =  Richard | title =Analysis: the rise or the fall of Scientology?  | work =Religioscope | publisher = religion.info | date = July 30, 2009 | url = http://religion.info/english/articles/article_433.shtml | accessdate = 2010-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cimino commented that the book is "divided about whether the movement and its distinctive blend of science, psychotherapy and esoteric religion is growing".&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; In an article about Scientology by B.A. Robinson at the website of the organization [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]], ''Scientology'' is listed as a "recommended book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Robinson | first = B.A. | title = About the Church of Scientology - A religion founded by L.

A '''sign system''' is a key concept in [[semiotics]] and is used to refer to any system of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]] and relations between signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beynon-Davies P.|year=2010|title=Dances with bees: exploring the relevance of the study of animal communication to informatics|journal=International Journal of Information Management|volume=30|number=1|pages=185–198|doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2010.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[language]]'' is frequently used as a synonym for a sign-system. However, the term ''sign-system'' is preferable to the term ''language'' for a number of reasons. First, the use of the term ''language'' tends to carry with it [[connotation]]s of human language, particularly human spoken language. Human spoken language is only one example of a sign-system; albeit probably one of the most complex sign-systems known.

For example, in traditional forms of face-to-face communication, humans communicate through [[non-verbal communication|non-verbal]] as well as verbal sign-systems; colloquially, this can be referred to as [[body language]]. Hence, humans communicate a great deal by way of facial movements and other forms of bodily expression. Such expressions are also signs and an organised collection of such signs would be considered a sign system. Second, the same concept of a sign-system can be used in considering a vast range of  communication forms such as [[animal communication]] and [[Man-machine interface|man-machine communication]]. Examination of simpler forms of such systems of signs within non-human communication can help to illuminate some of the essence of [[communication]] and in particular can help to provide tentative answers to the question of the nature and function of communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6157">The '''Tanner scale''' (also known as the '''Tanner stages''') is a scale of [[Child development|physical development in children]], [[adolescent]]s and [[adult]]s. The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external [[primary sex characteristic|primary]] and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, such as the size of the [[breast]]s, [[genitals]], testicular volume and development of [[Pubic hair|pubic]] hair. This scale was first identified by [[James Mourilyan Tanner|James Tanner]], a British pediatrician, and thus bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3082|Tanner's stages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5440182"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall WA, Tanner JM |title=Variations in the pattern of pubertal changes in boys|journal=Arch. Dis. Child. |volume=45 |issue=239 |pages=13–23 |date=February 1970 |pmid=5440182 |pmc=2020414 |doi= 10.1136/adc.45.239.13|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5785179"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall WA, Tanner JM |title=Variations in pattern of pubertal changes in girls |journal=Arch. Dis. Child. |volume=44 |issue=235 |pages=291–303 |date=June 1969 |pmid=5785179 |pmc=2020314 |doi= 10.1136/adc.44.235.291|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to [[Human variability|natural variation]], individuals pass through the Tanner stages at different rates, depending in particular on the timing of [[puberty]]. In [[HIV]] treatment, the Tanner scale is used to determine which treatment regimen to follow (adult, adolescent or pediatric).
==Definitions of stages==
Adapted from text by Lawrence Neinstein, M.D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chla.org/profile/lawrence-neinstein-md Lawrence S. Neinstein, M.D.: Adolescent Medicine - Children's Hospital Los Angeles CA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307161350/http://www.chla.org/profile/lawrence-neinstein-md |date=2016-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genitals (male)===
[[File:Tanner scale-male.svg|166px|thumb|Illustration of the Tanner scale for males.]]
; Tanner I
: [[Testicle|testicular]] volume less than 1.5 [[liter|ml]]; small penis (prepubertal; typically age nine and younger)
; Tanner II
: testicular volume between 1.6 and 6 ml; skin on scrotum thins, reddens and enlarges; penis length unchanged (9–11)
; Tanner III
: testicular volume between 6 and 12 ml; scrotum enlarges further; penis begins to lengthen (11–12.5)
; Tanner IV
: testicular volume between 12 and 20 ml; scrotum enlarges further and darkens; penis increases in length (12.5–14)
; Tanner V
: testicular volume greater than 20 ml; adult scrotum and penis (14+)

===Breasts (female)===
[[File:Tanner scale-female.svg|240px|thumb|Illustration of the Tanner scale for females.]]
; Tanner  I
: no glandular tissue: [[areola]] follows the skin contours of the chest (prepubertal) (typically age 10 and younger)
; Tanner II
: [[Thelarche|breast bud]] forms, with small area of surrounding glandular tissue; areola begins to widen (10–11.5)
; Tanner III
: breast begins to become more elevated, and extends beyond the borders of the areola, which continues to widen but remains in contour with surrounding breast (11.5–13)
; Tanner IV
: increased breast sizing and elevation; areola and [[nipple|papilla]] form a secondary mound projecting from the contour of the surrounding breast (13–15)
; Tanner V
: breast reaches final adult size; areola returns to contour of the surrounding breast, with a projecting central papilla. (15+)

===Pubic hair (both male and female)===

; Tanner I
: no pubic hair at all ([[Puberty|prepubertal]]) (typically age 10 and younger)
; Tanner II
: small amount of long, downy hair with slight pigmentation at the base of the [[human penis|penis]] and [[scrotum]] (males) or on the [[labia majora]] (females) (10–11.5)
; Tanner III
: hair becomes more coarse and curly, and begins to extend laterally (11.5–13)
; Tanner IV
: adult–like hair quality, extending across [[mons pubis|pubis]] but sparing medial thighs (13–15)
; Tanner V
: hair extends to medial surface of the thighs (15+)

==Criticism==
The scale has been criticized by the [[pornography]] industry for its potential to lead to false [[child pornography]] convictions, such as in the case when United States federal authorities used it to assert that pornographic actress [[Lupe Fuentes]] was underage. Fuentes personally appeared at the trial and provided documentation that showed that the DVDs in question were legally produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.avn.com/articles/Lupe-Fuentes-Saves-Man-From-Bogus-Child-Porn-Charge-394003.html |title=Lupe Fuentes Saves Man From Bogus ‘Child Porn’ Charge|date=April 16, 2010|work=AVN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Film Star Verifies Her Age, Saves Fan From 20 Years In Prison|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/04/adult-film-star-verifies-her-age-saves-fan-20-years-prison |work=Radar Online|date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanner, the author of the classification system, has argued that age classification using the stages of the scale represents invalid use. Tanner stages do not match with chronological age, but rather maturity stages and thus are not diagnostic for age estimation.&lt;ref name="pmid9882230"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=AL|author2=Tanner, JM |title=Misuse of Tanner puberty stages to estimate chronologic age.|journal=Pediatrics|date=December 1998|volume=102|issue=6|page=1494|doi=10.1542/peds.102.6.1494|pmid=9882230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2773">In {{USCFR|40|156|62}}, the [[EPA]] established four '''Toxicity Categories''' for acute hazards of [[pesticide]] products, with "Category I" being the highest toxicity category ([[toxicity class]]). Most human hazard, precautionary statements, and human [[personal protective equipment]] statements are based upon the Toxicity Category of the pesticide product as sold or distributed. In addition, toxicity categories may be used for regulatory purposes other than [[labeling]], such as classification for restricted use and requirements for [[child-resistant packaging]]. 

In certain cases, statements based upon the Toxicity Category of the product as [[:wikt:dilute|dilute]]d for use are also permitted. A Toxicity Category is assigned for each of five types of acute exposure, as specified in the table below.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Overview==

The four toxicity categories, from one to four are:

*Toxicity category I is Highly toxic and Severely irritating,
*Toxicity category II is Moderately toxic and Moderately irritating,
*Toxicity category III is Slightly toxic and Slightly irritating,
*Toxicity category IV is Practically non-toxic and not an irritant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24224">In [[music]], '''transcription''' can mean [[Musical notation|notating]] a piece or a sound which was previously unnotated, as, for example, an improvised jazz solo. When a musician is tasked with creating [[sheet music]] from a recording and they write down the notes that make up the song in [[music notation]], it is said that they created a ''musical transcription'' of that recording. Transcription may also mean rewriting a piece of music, either solo or [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]], for another instrument or other instruments than which it was originally intended. The [[Beethoven Symphonies (Liszt)|Beethoven Symphonies]] by [[Franz Liszt]] are a good example. Transcription in this sense is sometimes called ''[[arrangement]]'', although strictly speaking transcriptions are faithful adaptations, whereas arrangements change significant aspects of the original piece.
 
Further examples of music transcription include [[Ethnomusicology|ethnomusicological]] notation of [[oral tradition]]s of folk music, such as [[Béla Bartók]]'s and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' collections of the national folk music of [[Hungary]] and [[England]] respectively. The [[France|French]] [[composer]] [[Olivier Messiaen]] transcribed [[bird song|birdsong]] in the wild, and incorporated it into many of his compositions, for example his ''[[Catalogue d'oiseaux]]'' for solo piano. Transcription of this nature involves scale degree recognition and harmonic analysis, both of which the transcriber will need [[Relative pitch|relative]] or [[perfect pitch]] to perform.

In popular music and rock, there are two forms of transcription. Individual performers copy a note-for-note guitar solo or other melodic line. As well, music publishers transcribe entire recordings of guitar solos and bass lines and sell the sheet music in bound books. Music publishers also publish PVG (piano/vocal/guitar) transcriptions of popular music, where the melody line is transcribed, and then the accompaniment on the recording is arranged as a piano part. The guitar aspect of the PVG label is achieved through guitar chords written above the melody. Lyrics are also included below the melody.

Some composers have rendered homage to other composers by creating "identical" versions of the earlier composers' pieces while adding their own creativity through the use of completely new sounds arising from the difference in instrumentation.  The most widely known example of this is [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s arrangement for orchestra of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s piano piece ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]''.  [[Anton Webern|Webern]] used his transcription for orchestra of the six-part [[ricercar]] from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[The Musical Offering]]'' to analyze the structure of the Bach piece, by using different instruments to play different subordinate [[motif (music)|motifs]] of Bach's themes and melodies.

}}
In transcription of this form, the new piece can simultaneously imitate the original sounds while recomposing them with all the technical skills of an expert composer in such a way that it seems that the piece was originally written for the new medium.  But some transcriptions and arrangements have been done for purely pragmatic or contextual reasons.  For example, in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s time, the overtures and songs from his popular operas were transcribed for small [[wind ensemble]] simply because such ensembles were common ways of providing popular entertainment in public places.  Mozart himself did this in his opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', transcribing for small wind ensemble several arias from other operas, including one from his own opera ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. A more contemporary example is [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]´s transcription for four hands piano of ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', to be used on the ballet's rehearsals.  Today musicians who play in cafes or restaurants will sometimes play transcriptions or arrangements of pieces written for a larger group of instruments.

Other examples of this type of transcription include [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s arrangement of [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]'s four-violin concerti for four keyboard instruments and orchestra; Mozart's arrangement of some Bach [[fugue]]s from ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' for string [[trio (music)|trio]]; [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] arrangement of his ''[[Große Fuge]]'', originally written for [[string quartet]], for [[piano]] duet, and his arrangement of his [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] as a [[piano concerto]]; [[Franz Liszt]]'s piano arrangements of the works of many composers, including the [[Beethoven Symphonies (Liszt)|symphonies of Beethoven]]; [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s arrangement of four Mozart piano pieces into an [[orchestral suite]] called "[[Orchestral Suite No. 4 Mozartiana (Tchaikovsky)|Mozartiana]]"; [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s re-orchestration of [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] symphonies; and [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s arrangement for orchestra of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s piano quintet and Bach's "St. Anne" Prelude and Fugue for organ.

Since the piano became a popular instrument, a large literature has sprung up of transcriptions and arrangements for piano of works for orchestra or chamber music ensemble.  These are sometimes called "[[reduction (music)|piano reduction]]s", because the multiplicity of orchestral parts—in an orchestral piece there may be as many as two dozen separate instrumental parts being played simultaneously—has to be reduced to what a single pianist (or occasionally two pianists, on one or two pianos, such as the different arrangements for [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'') can manage to play.

Piano reductions are frequently made of orchestral accompaniments to choral works, for the purposes of rehearsal or of performance with keyboard alone.

Many orchestral pieces have been transcribed for [[concert band]].

==Transcription aids==

===Notation software===
Since the advent of desktop publishing, musicians can acquire [[music notation software]], which can receive the user's mental analysis of notes and then store and format those notes into standard music notation for personal printing or professional publishing of sheet music. Some notation software can accept a Standard [[MIDI]] File (SMF) or MIDI performance as input instead of manual note entry. These notation applications can export their scores in a variety of formats like [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]]. Often the software contains a sound library which allows the user's score to be played aloud by the application for verification.

===Slow-down software===
Prior to the invention of digital transcription aids, musicians would slow down a record or a tape recording to be able to hear the melodic lines and chords at a slower, more digestible pace. The problem with this approach was that it also changed the pitches, so once a piece was transcribed, it would then have to be transposed into the correct key. Software designed to slow down the tempo of music without changing the pitch of the music can be very helpful for recognizing pitches, melodies, chords, rhythms and lyrics when transcribing music. However, unlike the slow-down effect of a record player, the pitch and original octave of the notes will stay the same, and not descend in pitch. This technology is simple enough that it is available in many free software applications.

The software generally goes through a two-step process to accomplish this.  First, the audio file is played back at a lower sample rate than that of the original file.  This has the same effect as playing a tape or vinyl record at slower speed - the pitch is lowered meaning the music can sound like it is in a different key.  The second step is to use [[Digital signal processing|Digital Signal Processing (or DSP)]] to shift the pitch back up to the original pitch level or musical key.

===Pitch tracking software===
{{main|pitch tracker}}
As mentioned in the Automatic music transcription section, some commercial software can roughly track the pitch of dominant melodies in polyphonic musical recordings. The note scans are not exact, and often need to be manually edited by the user before saving to file in either a proprietary file format or in Standard [[MIDI]] File Format. Some pitch tracking software also allows the scanned note lists to be animated during audio playback.

==Automatic music transcription==
The term "automatic music transcription" was first used by audio researchers James A. Moorer, Martin Piszczalski, and Bernard Galler in 1977. With their knowledge of digital audio engineering, these researchers believed that a computer could be programmed to analyze a digital recording of music such that the pitches of melody lines and chord patterns could be detected, along with the rhythmic accents of percussion instruments. The task of automatic music transcription concerns two separate activities: making an analysis of a musical piece, and printing out a score from that analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Eric David Scheirer (October 1998): "Music Perception Systems", Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, pp 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not a simple goal, but one that would encourage academic research for at least another three decades. Because of the close scientific relationship of speech to music, much academic and commercial research that was directed toward the more financially resourced speech recognition technology would be recycled into research about music recognition technology. While many musicians and educators insist that manually doing transcriptions is a valuable exercise for developing musicians, the motivation for automatic music transcription remains the same as the motivation for sheet music: musicians who do not have intuitive transcription skills will search for sheet music or a chord chart, so that they may quickly learn how to play a song. A collection of tools created by this ongoing research could be of great aid to musicians. Since much recorded music does not have available sheet music, an automatic transcription device could also offer transcriptions that are otherwise unavailable in sheet music.  To date, no software application can yet completely fulfill James Moorer’s definition of automatic music transcription. However, the pursuit of automatic music transcription has spawned the creation of many software applications which can aid in manual transcription. Some can slow down music while maintaining original pitch and octave, some can track the pitch of melodies, some can track the chord changes, and others can track the beat of music.

Automatic transcription most fundamentally involves identifying the pitch and duration of the performed notes. This entails tracking pitch and identifying note onsets. After capturing those physical measurements, this information is mapped into traditional music notation, i.e., the sheet music.

[[Digital signal processing|Digital Signal Processing]] is the branch of engineering that provides software engineers with the tools and algorithms needed to analyze a digital recording in terms of pitch (note detection of melodic instruments), and the energy content of un-pitched sounds (detection of percussion instruments). Musical recordings are sampled at a given recording rate and its frequency data is stored in any digital wave format in the computer. Such format represents sound by [[Sampling (signal processing)|digital sampling]].

===Pitch detection===
[[Pitch detection]] is often the detection of individual [[Musical note|note]]s that might make up a [[melody]] in music, or the notes in a [[Chord (music)|chord]]. When a single key is pressed upon a piano, what we hear is not just ''one'' [[frequency]] of sound vibration, but a ''composite'' of multiple sound vibrations occurring at different mathematically related frequencies. The elements of this composite of vibrations at differing frequencies are referred to as [[harmonic]]s or partials.

For instance, if we press the Middle C key on the piano, the individual [[Frequency|frequencies]] of the composite's [[harmonic]]s will start at 261.6&amp;nbsp;Hz as the [[fundamental frequency]], 523&amp;nbsp;Hz would be the 2nd Harmonic, 785&amp;nbsp;Hz would be the 3rd Harmonic, 1046&amp;nbsp;Hz would be the 4th Harmonic, etc. The later harmonics are integer multiples of the [[fundamental frequency]], 261.6&amp;nbsp;Hz ( ex:  2 x 261.6 = 523,   3 x 261.6 = 785,   4 x 261.6 = 1046 ). While only about eight [[harmonic]]s are really needed to audibly recreate the note, the total number of harmonics in this mathematical series can be large, although the higher the harmonic's numeral the weaker the magnitude and contribution of that harmonic. Contrary to intuition, a musical recording at its lowest physical level is not a collection of individual [[Musical note|note]]s, but is really a collection of individual [[harmonic]]s. That is why very similar-sounding recordings can be created with differing collections of instruments and their assigned notes. As long as the total [[harmonic]]s of the recording are recreated to some degree, it does not really matter which instruments or which notes were used.

A first step in the detection of notes is the transformation of the sound file's digital data from the [[time domain]] into the [[frequency domain]], which enables the measurement of various frequencies over time. The graphic image of an audio recording in the frequency domain is called a [[spectrogram]] or sonogram. A musical note, as a composite of various [[harmonic]]s, appears in a [[spectrogram]] like a vertically placed ''comb'', with the individual teeth of the comb representing the various harmonics and their differing frequency values. A [[Fourier transform|Fourier Transform]] is the mathematical procedure that is used to create the [[spectrogram]] from the sound file’s digital data.

The task of many note detection algorithms is to search the [[spectrogram]] for the occurrence of such ''comb patterns'' (a composite of harmonics) caused by individual notes. Once the pattern of a note's particular comb shape of [[harmonic]]s is detected, the note's [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] can be measured by the vertical position of the comb pattern upon the [[spectrogram]].

There are basically two different classes of digital music which create very different demands for a [[pitch detection]] algorithm: ''monophonic'' music and ''polyphonic'' music. Monophonic music is a passage with only one instrument playing one note at a time, while polyphonic music can have multiple instruments and vocals playing at once. [[Pitch detection]] upon a monophonic recording was a relatively simple task, and its technology enabled the invention of guitar tuners in the 1970s. However, [[pitch detection]] upon polyphonic music becomes a much more difficult task because the image of its [[spectrogram]] now appears as a vague cloud due to a multitude of overlapping comb patterns, caused by each note's multiple [[harmonic]]s.

Another method of [[pitch detection]] was invented by Martin Piszczalski in conjunction with Bernard Galler in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It targets monophonic music. Central to this method is how [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] is determined by the human [[ear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process attempts to roughly mimic the biology of the human inner [[ear]] by finding only but a few of the loudest [[harmonic]]s at a given instant. That small set of found [[harmonic]]s are in turn compared against all the possible resultant pitches' harmonic-sets, to hypothesize what the most probable [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] could be given that particular set of [[harmonic]]s.
 
To date, the complete note detection of polyphonic recordings remains a mystery to audio engineers, although they continue to make progress by inventing algorithms which can partially detect some of the notes of a polyphonic recording, such as a [[melody]] or bass line.

===Beat detection===
Beat tracking is the determination of a repeating time interval between perceived pulses in music. Beat can also be described as 'foot tapping' or 'hand clapping' in time with the music. The beat is often a predictable basic unit in time for the musical piece, and may only vary slightly during the performance. Songs are frequently measured for their Beats Per Minute (BPM) in determining the tempo of the music, whether it be fast or slow.

Since notes frequently begin on a beat, or a simple subdivision of the beat's time interval, beat tracking software has the potential to better resolve note onsets that may have been detected in a crude fashion. Beat tracking is often the first step in the detection of percussion instruments.

Despite the intuitive nature of 'foot tapping' of which most humans are capable, developing an algorithm to detect those beats is difficult. Most of the current software algorithms for beat detection use a group competing hypothesis for beats-per-minute, as the algorithm progressively finds and resolves local peaks in volume, roughly corresponding to the foot-taps of the music.

===How automatic music transcription works===
To transcribe music automatically, several problems must be solved:

1. Notes must be recognized - this is typically done by changing from the time domain into the frequency domain.  This can be accomplished through the [[Fourier transform]].  Computer algorithms for doing this are common.  The [[Fast Fourier transform]] algorithm computes the frequency content of a signal, and is useful in processing musical excerpts.

2. A beat and tempo need to be detected ([[Beat detection]])- this is a difficult, many-faceted problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The method proposed in Costantini et al. 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on note events and their main characteristics: the attack instant, the pitch and the final instant. [[Onset detection]] exploits a binary time-frequency representation of the audio signal. Note classification and offset detection are based on [[constant Q transform]] (CQT) and [[support vector machines]] (SVMs). An audio example can be found [http://www.massimilianotodisco.eu/research/pianotrans.html here]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

This in turn leads to a “pitch contour” namely a continuously time-varying line that corresponds to what humans refer to as melody. The next step is to segment this continuous melodic stream to identify the beginning and end of each note.
After that each “note unit” is expressed in physical terms (e.g., 442&amp;nbsp;Hz,  .52 seconds).  The final step is then to map this physical information into familiar music-notation-like terms for each note (e.g., an A4, quarter note).

===Detailed computer steps behind automatic music transcription===
In terms of actual computer processing, the principal steps are to 1) digitize the performed, analog music, 2) do successive short-term, [[Fast Fourier Transform]] (FFTs) to obtain the time-varying spectra, 3) identify the peaks in each spectrum, 4) analyze the spectral peaks to get pitch candidates, 5) connect the strongest individual pitch candidates to get the most likely time-varying, pitch contour, 6) map this physical data into the closest music-notation terms.

The most controversial and difficult step in this process is detecting pitch

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most successful pitch methods operate in the frequency domain, not the time domain. While time-domain methods have been proposed, they can break down for real-world musical instruments played in typically reverberant rooms.

The pitch-detection method invented by Piszczalski&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; again mimics human hearing.  It follows how only certain sets of partials “fuse” together in human listening. These are the sets that create the perception of a single pitch only. Fusion occurs only when two partials are within 1.5% of being a perfect, harmonic pair (i.e., their frequencies approximate a low-integer pair set such as 1:2, 5:8, etc.)  This near harmonic match is required of all the partials in order for a human to hear them as only a single pitch.

'''Urban Agricultural Architecture (UAA)''' is the practice of integrating [[Organic farming|organic]], [[hydroponic]], [[aeroponic]] or [[aquaponic]] [[Agricultural science|farming technologies]] into buildings of all types.  An example can be as small as building a lean-to-[[greenhouse]] on a single-family home and using it as a [[kitchen garden]].  Examples of large-scale projects are the hydroponic greenhouses of [[Lufa Farms]], the rooftop farms of [[Brooklyn Grange]] Rooftop Farm,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.growingagreenerworld.com/episode322/&lt;/ref&gt; and the vertical farms of Sky Greens.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFQOkzEjxQ&lt;/ref&gt;  Building types that can incorporate food growing technologies include: single-family home, multi-family housing, mixed-use buildings, schools,&lt;ref&gt;http://inhabitat.com/nyc/photos-fifth-street-farm-unveils-new-rooftop-farm-designed-by-michael-arad-at-the-east-village-earth-school/&lt;/ref&gt; restaurants,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/photo/rosemary-s-rooftop-farm-/218685.html&lt;/ref&gt; institutional buildings,&lt;ref&gt;http://commcgi.cc.stonybrook.edu/am2/publish/General_University_News_2/rooftop_farm.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; vertical farms, hoop houses and greenhouses that are designed to urban conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://popupcity.net/top-5-of-the-greatest-urban-rooftop-farms/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Vertical Farm Video".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10271">[[File:XASFig.jpg|thumb|Three regions of XAS data|440x440px]]'''X-ray absorption fine structure''' (XAFS) is a specific structure observed in [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy]] (XAS). By analyzing the XAFS, information can be acquired on the local structure and on the unoccupied local electronic states.


==Atomic spectra==

The atomic X-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) of a [[core-level]] in an absorbing [[atom]]  is separated into states in the discrete part of the spectrum called "'''bounds final states'''" or "[[Rydberg state|Rydberg states]]" below the ionization potential (IP) and  '''"states in the continuum'''" part of the spectrum above the ionization potential due to excitations of the photoelectron in the vacuum. Above the IP the absorption cross section attenuates gradually with the X-ray energy. 
Following early experimental and theoretical works in the thirties,&lt;ref name="fano1"&gt;U. Fano [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf02958288 Sullo spettro di assorbimento dei gas nobili presso il limite dello spettro d'arco] Il Nuovo Cimento (1924-1942) 12, (1935) 154-161&lt;/ref&gt; in the sixties using synchrotron radiation at the National Bureau of Standards it was established that the broad asymmetric absorption peaks are due to [[Fano resonance]]s above the atomic ionization potential where the final states are many body quasi-bound states (i.e., a doubly excited atom) degenerate with the continuum.&lt;ref name="fano3"&gt;U. Fano and J. Cooper, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.40.441. Spectral distribution of atomic oscillator strengths. ]  Reviews of Modern Physics 40,  (1968) 441&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectra of molecules and condensed matter==

The XAS spectra of condensed matter are usually divided in three energy regions:

===Edge region===

The edge region usually extends in a range of few eV around the absorption edge. The spectral features in the edge region i) in good metals are excitations to final delocalized states above the Fermi level; ii) in insulators are core excitons below the ionization potential; iii) in molecules are electronic transitions to the first unoccupied molecular levels above the [[chemical potential]] in the initial states which are shifted into the discrete part of the core absorption spectrum by the Coulomb interaction with the core hole. Multi-electron excitations and configuration interaction between many body final states dominate the edge region in strongly correlated metals and insulators.
For many years the edge region was referred to as the “Kossel structure” but now it is known as "absorption edge region" since the Kossel structure refers only to unoccupied molecular final states which is a correct description only for few particular cases: molecules and strongly disordered systems.

=== X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure ===

The XANES energy region&lt;ref name="xanes1"&gt;D. C. Koningsberger, R. Prins (eds) A. Bianconi "X-ray absorption: Principles, applications, techniques of EXAFS, SEXAFS and XANES" (Chemical Analysis 92), Wiley, New York (1988)  pp 573-662 &lt;tt&gt;{{ISBN|978-0-471875475}} &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  extends between the '''edge region''' and the '''EXAFS region''' over a 50-100 eV energy range around the core level x-ray absorption threshold.
Before 1980 the XANES region was wrongly assigned to different final states: a) unoccupied total density of states, or b) unoccupied molecular orbitals (kossel structure) or c) unoccupied atomic orbitals or d) low energy EXAFS oscillations.
In the seventies, using synchrotron radiation in Frascati and Stanford synchrotron sources, it was experimentally shown that the features in this energy region are due to multiple scattering [[resonances]] of the photoelectron in a nanocluster of variable size. Antonio Bianconi in 1980 invented the acronym XANES to indicate the spectral region dominated by multiple scattering [[resonances]] of the photoelectron in the soft x-ray range&lt;ref name="xanes2"&gt;A. Bianconi [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-5963(80)90024-0  "Surface X-Ray absorption spectroscopy: Surface EXAFS and surface XANES"] Applications of Surface Science (1980) pp. 392-418&lt;/ref&gt;
and in the hard X-ray range.&lt;ref name="xanes3"&gt;M. Belli, A. Scafati, A. Bianconi, S. Mobilio, L. Palladino, A. Reale, and E. Burattini, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0038-1098(80)90515-3 "X-ray absorption near edge structures (XANES) in simple and complex Mn compounds"] [[Solid State Communications]] 35 (1980) pp. 355-361&lt;/ref&gt;
In the XANES energy range the kinetic energy of the photoelectron in the final state is between few eV and 50-100 eV. In this regime the photoelectron has a strong scattering amplitude by neighboring atoms in molecules and condensed matter, its wavelength is larger than interatomic distances, its mean free path could be smaller than one nanometer and finally the lifetime of the excited state is in the order of femtoseconds.
The XANES spectral features are described by full multiple scattering theory proposed in the early seventies.&lt;ref name="msr"&gt;J. Dehmer and D. Dill, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.35.213. Shape resonances in K-Shell photoionization of diatomic molecules] [[Physical Review Letters]] 35, (1975) 213&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the key step for XANES interpretation is the determination of the size of the atomic cluster of neighbor atoms, where the final states are confined, which could range from 0.2&amp;nbsp;nm to 2&amp;nbsp;nm in different systems.
This energy region has been called later (in 1982) also near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure ([[NEXAFS]]), which is synonymous with XANES.
During more than 20 years the XANES interpretation has been object of discussion but recently there is agreement that the final states are  "multiple scattering resonances" and many body final states play an important role.&lt;ref name="msr2"&gt;J. J. Rehr and A. L. Ankudinov, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2004.02.014. Progress in the theory and interpretation of XANES] [[Coordination Chemistry Reviews]] 249, (2005) 131&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermediate region ===

There is an intermediate region between the XANES and EXAFS regions where low n-body distribution functions play a key role.&lt;ref name="intermediate1"&gt;M. Benfatto, C. R. Natoli, A. Bianconi, J. Garcia, A. Marcelli, M. Fanfoni, and I. Davoli: [http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9940417  "Multiple-scattering regime and higher-order correlations in x-ray-absorption spectra of liquid solutions"]. [[Physical Review B]]  34, (1986) pp. 5774-5781&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intermediate2"&gt;A. Filipponi, A. Di Cicco, C.R. Natoli: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.52.15122 ''X-ray absorption spectroscopy and n-body distribution functions in condensed matter'']. [[Physical Review B]] 52, (1995), pp. 15122–15148.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extended X-ray absorption fine structure ===

The oscillatory structure extending for hundreds of [[electron volt]]s past the edges was called the “Kronig structure” after the scientist, [[Ralph Kronig]], who assigned this structure in the high energy range ( i.e., for a kinetic energy range - larger than 100 eV - of the phoelectron in the weak scattering regime) to the single [[scattering]] of the excited [[photoelectron]] by neighbouring atoms in molecules and condensed matter.&lt;ref name="exafs1"&gt;J.J.

This regime was called  [[EXAFS]]  in 1971 by Sayers, Stern and Little.

== Applications of x-ray absorption spectroscopy ==
X-ray absorption edge spectroscopy corresponds to the transition from a core-level to an unoccupied [[Atomic orbital|orbital]] or band and mainly reflects the electronic unoccupied states. EXAFS, resulting from the interference in the single scattering process of the photoelectron scattered by surrounding atoms, provides information on the local structure. Information on the geometry of the local structure is provided by the analysis of the multiple [[scattering]] peaks in the XANES spectra.
The XAFS acronym has been later introduced to indicate the sum of the XANES and EXAFS spectra.
