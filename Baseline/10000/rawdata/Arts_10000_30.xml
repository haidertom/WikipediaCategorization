      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4320">'''Aesthetic distance''' refers to the gap between a viewer's conscious reality and the fictional reality presented in a work of art.  When a reader becomes fully engrossed in the illusory narrative world of a book, the author has achieved a close aesthetic distance.  If the author then jars the reader from the reality of the story, essentially reminding the reader they are reading a book, the author is said to have "violated the aesthetic distance." &lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/lit_term.html Literary terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aesthetic+distance Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept originates from [[Immanuel_Kant|Immanuel Kant's]] [[Critique of Judgement]], where he establishes the notion of ''disinterested delight'' which does not depend on the subject's having a desire for the object itself, he writes, "delight in beautiful art does not, in the pure judgement of taste, involve an immediate interest. [...] it is not the object that is of immediate interest, but rather the inherent character of the beauty qualifying it for such a partnership-a character, therefore, that belongs to the very essence of beauty."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1790). 'Critique of Pure Judgement.' trans. Meredith, James Creed. Blacksburg: Virginia Tech. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term aesthetic distance itself derives from an article by Edward Bullough published in 1912. In that article, he begins with the image of a passenger on a ship observing fog at sea. If the passenger thinks of the fog in terms of danger to the ship, the experience is not aesthetic, but to regard the beautiful scene in detached wonder is to take legitimate aesthetic attitude. One must feel, but not too much. Bullough writes, "Distance … is obtained by separating the object and its appeal from one's own self, by putting it out of gear with practical needs and ends. Thereby the 'contemplation' of the object becomes alone possible."&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Edward (1912/1989). '"Psychical Distance" as a Factor in Art and as an Aesthetic Principle.' Dickie, G., Sclafani, R., Roblin, R. ''Aesthetics: A Critical Anthology.'' 2nd ed. New York: St. Martin's. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors of film, fiction, drama, and poetry evoke different levels of aesthetic distance.  For instance, [[William Faulkner]] tends to invoke a close aesthetic distance by using [[first-person narrative]] and [[Stream_of_consciousness_(narrative_mode)|stream of consciousness]], while [[Ernest Hemingway]] tends to invoke a greater aesthetic distance from the reader through use of [[Narrative_mode#Third-person_view|third person narrative]].

==Violating the aesthetic distance==

Anything that pulls a viewer out of the reality of a work of fiction is said to be a violation of aesthetic distance.  An easy example in theater or film is "breaking the fourth wall," when characters suspend the progress of the story to speak directly to the audience.  When the aesthetic distance is deliberately violated in theater, it is known as the [[distancing effect]], or ''Verfremdungseffekt'', a concept coined by playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]].

Many examples of violating the aesthetic distance may also be found in [[meta-fiction]].  [[William Goldman]], in ''[[The Princess Bride]]'', repeatedly interrupts his own fairy tale to speak directly to the reader. In the musical, ''[[Stop the World I Want to Get Off]]'', the [[protagonist]], ''Littlechap'', periodically stops the progress of the play to address the audience directly.

In film, the aesthetic distance is often violated unintentionally.  Examples might include a director's cameo, poor special effects, or perhaps blatant [[product placement]] - any can be enough to pull a viewer out of the reality of the film.  [[David Mamet]] in ''[[On Directing Film]]'' asserts that any direct depiction of graphic sex or violence in film is an inherent violation of aesthetic distance, as audience members will instinctively make judgments as to whether or not what they just saw was real, and thus be pulled out of the story-telling.

'''Ahmed Al Bahrani''', ({{lang-ar|'''أحمد البحراني'''}}) (born 1965) is an [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] sculptor. Ahmed Al Bahrani is one of the most famous Iraqi sculptors, now living in exile.&lt;ref&gt;"Ahmed Al Bahrani," [Biographical Notes], Gary Nader Gallery, [http://garynader.com/artist-det.php?item=46 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Ahmed Al Bahrani was born  in 1965, in Tuarej on the Euphrates River, near Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;There is some confusion surrounding his place of birth. Some secondary sources, such as Bahrani, Z. and Shabout, N.M., ''Modernism and Iraq,'' Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery and Columbia University, 2009, p. 92 state that he was born in Babylon, while other sources claim that he was born in Karbala; however in an interview, the sculptor explicitly stated that he was born in a small village, called Tuarej, near Babylon. See: "The Iraqi sculptor Ahmad Al-Bahrani told Asharq Al-Awsat: I am part of Qatari culture and am proud," [Interview - translated from Arabic], ''Al Sharq,'' 2 April, 2016, [https://www.al-sharq.com/news/details/412673]&lt;/ref&gt; He recalls that as a child, he would withdraw from the games played by other boys, to model clay on the riverbank. He also recalls that on school trips, he was taken to see some of Iraq's ancient monuments and that his reaction to them was different to other boys.&lt;ref&gt;"The Iraqi sculptor Ahmad Al-Bahrani told Asharq Al-Awsat: I am part of Qatari culture and am proud," [Interview - translated from Arabic], ''Al Sharq,'' 2 April, 2016, [https://www.al-sharq.com/news/details/412673]&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied sculpture at the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad and graduated from with a Diploma of Sculpture in 1988, &lt;ref name="BS"&gt;Bahrani, Z. and Shabout, N.M., ''Modernism and Iraq,'' Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery and Columbia University, 2009, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;  where he was influenced by many professors, notably Abdul Rahim Al Wakil.&lt;ref name="AD"&gt;Ayoub, D., "His latest works return to "Calila and Damna" Ahmed Bahrani: Arab sculptor restricted creativity," ''Emaratalyoum,'' [Dubai],  1 February, 2012, [https://www.emaratalyoum.com/life/four-sides/2012-06-02-1.488713 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has participated in several exhibitions, ''Inside and Outside Iraq, Sculpture'' in Iraq and Yemen as well as his participation in several exhibitions in Qatar, [[Beirut]] and the [[UAE]]. His sculpture is on public display in several cities.&lt;ref&gt;''Alkahaki News,'' (translated from Arabic), [http://www.alhakikanews.com/index.php/permalink/21673.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Exhibition - Ahmed Bahrani at "Art Basel Gallery" Miami version sculpts terrorists and in his hand to save life from misunderstanding" (translated from Arabic), ''Annahar'' [newspaper], [https://newspaper.annahar.com/article/73940-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%B6--%D8%A3%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D8%A2%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%AE%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A3%D9%86-%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B0 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at the Baghdad Institute of Fine Arts between 1992 and 1994.&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt;

In mid-career, he decided to move away from the endlesss pursuit of abstraction and began producing figurative works. However, more recently he has returned to abstract sculpture.&lt;ref name="AD" /&gt; 

In 1994, he left Iraq for political reasons, and lived in Amman, Jordan for a number of years and later resided in Yemen.&lt;ref name="AD" /&gt; Since 1999, he has divided his time between Doha in Qatar and Stockholm in Sweden. &lt;ref&gt;"The Iraqi sculptor Ahmad Al-Bahrani told Asharq Al-Awsat: I am part of Qatari culture and am proud," [Interview - translated from Arabic], ''Al Sharq,'' 2 April, 2016, [https://www.al-sharq.com/news/details/412673; Nangiana, U., "Talking Sculptures," ''Gulf Times,'' 13 March, 2016, [http://www.gulf-times.com/story/484374/Talking-sculptures Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Al Bahrani's work comprises large scale sculptures of political, religious and popular figures, often carrying various type of armaments.&lt;ref&gt;"Ahmed Al- Bahrani," ''Wall Street Journal Magazine,'' 27 December, 2013, [https://wsimag.com/art/6676-ahmed-al-bahrani-war-to-war Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of his contemporaries who are living in exile,&lt;ref&gt;The Ministry of Culture has estimated that more than 80 percent of all Iraqi artists are now living in exile,; See: ''Art AsiaPacific Almanac,'' Volume 4, Art AsiaPacific, 2009, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Al Bahrani uses his work to express the sense that he is "estranged from his geographical foundation and his roots." &lt;ref&gt;Nangiana, U., "Talking Sculptures," ''Gulf Times,'' 13 March, 2016, [http://www.gulf-times.com/story/484374/Talking-sculptures Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aleksandër Vasilev Lilov''' ({{lang-bg|Александър Василев Лилов}}; 31 August 1933 – 20 July 2013) was a [[Bulgaria]]n politician and philosopher.

At his career's height during the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], he was described as the second most powerful man of the regime. However, he fell out of favor in 1983 and lost his power. He made a strong political comeback during the democratic transition and was elected chairman of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]]. He led the party to transform and adapt to the post-communist era.  A party referendum supported his proposal to change the name to the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]. After winning the first [[Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election, 1990|democratic elections]] he did not become prime minister himself, instead he eventually supported a multi-party government led by [[Dimitar Iliev Popov|Dimitar Popov]]. After losing the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1991|1991 parliamentary elections]] he stepped down as party leader. In 2001 he retired as MP after having served for 39 years.

==Biography==
Aleksandar Lilov was born on 31 August 1933 in the village of [[Granichak (village)|Granichak]], northwestern [[Vidin Province]]. He graduated Bulgarian Studies (philosophy) at [[Sofia University]] in 1962 and graduated doctoral studies in communist Social Science at the Academy of Public Sciences in Moscow. In 1975 he became an associate at the institution of art at the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]]. Six years later, he defended a doctoral thesis in 1981.&lt;ref name=Death /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt; He died on 20 July 2013 at the age of 79.

==Political career==
Lilov joined the Dimitrov Young Communist League in Vidin and rose to the ranks of its central committee in 1963. Six years later he joined the central Party organ and in 1971 he became a prominent member of the Communist Party. Lilov was a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] from July 1974 to September 1983 and was also a secretary of the Central Committee of the Party from July 1972 to September 28, 1983. He was also a member of the [[State Council of Bulgaria]] from 1976 to 1983.&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt; By the end of the 70s he was viewed as the second most powerful member of the party. After the death of [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] (General Secretary [[Todor Zhivkov]]'s daughter) in 1981, Lilov's power began to wane. In 1983 he was removed from the Politburo after criticizing the General Secretary for his economic mismanagement and apparent lack of interest in current issues.&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt;

After fading from the public view for six year, Lilov returned from Great-Britain - where he was when Zhivkov was forced to resign on November 10, 1989 - and was welcomed back among the leaders of the BCP. There he denounced the [[Revival Process]] (started by Zhivkov and internationally condemned) and allowed Bulgarian Muslims to reinstate their former names.&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt;

During the 14th emergency congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party (held in January - February 1990), the post of general secretary was abolished, and Lilov was elected to the new post of chairman. Under his leadership the party was dissolved and reorganized into the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] on April 3 following an party referendum.&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt; This transition brought about revolutionary change to the party's ideology, from Communism to Socialism (from [[far-left politics|far-left]] to [[left-wing politics|left-wing]]). Change was also brought to the way the party was run in order to dismantle the totalitarian apparatus in the country. In September he was reelected as party chairman by a margin of 2 to 1 against the hopes of the liberals in the party who sought to remove the remains of the former Communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLD : Bulgaria Socialists Reelect Lilov|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-25/news/mn-1340_1_socialist-party|work=World News|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=25 September 1990|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained the party's leader until the end of 1991.

He led the Socialists through the first democratic elections in [[Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election, 1990|1990]], elected to adopt a new constitution, where his party won a majority of the seats (211 out of 400) and 47.15% of the votes. He did not become Prime Minister himself, instead continuing his support for the socialist government in place led by [[Andrey Lukanov]]. This came to an end when mass demonstrations and a general strike led to the formation of a government under the non-partisan judge [[Dimitar Iliev Popov|Dimitar Popov]] in which the BSP participated alongside the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|UDF]], [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union|BANU]] and independent experts.

His second election campaign in [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1991|1991]] ended with defeat after his electoral alliance won only 33.1% of the votes and 106 seats (out of 240); finishing behind the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] who won 34.4% of the votes and 110 seats. Later that year he stepped down and as chairman of the party and was succeeded by [[Zhan Videnov]]. Lilov remained a Member of Parliament until 2001, a seat he held for 39 years (1962–2001).&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt; In 2001 he was the longest serving member of parliament.&lt;ref name=Death /&gt;

Red, orange, and red-orange are examples.

The term ''analogous'' refers to having analogy, or corresponding to something in particular. An analogous color scheme creates a rich, [[monochromatic]] look.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} It is best used with either warm or cool colors, creating a look that has a certain temperature as well as proper color harmony. While this is true, the scheme also lacks contrast and is less vibrant than [[complementary colors|complementary]] schemes.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

[[File:Boutet color wheel.jpg|thumb|Analogous differ depending on the color wheel that you use. For example, by some definitions, it would be impossible to use Goethe's color wheel for analogous colors, because they do not share a common color, such as blue-green. If you wanted to use the analogous colors blue, blue-green and green with  Boutet's color wheel on the left, you wouldn't be able. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_definition_of_analogous_colors analogous def.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Application==
These color schemes are most often seen in nature. For example, during the fall, one might often see the changing leaves form an analogous sort of color scheme, progressively moving through the color wheel to create a gradient in its natural pattern.

==High-key analogous==
High-key color schemes have a lighter value, having white added to them or water in the case of watercolors. These have a more pastel-like look to them. Having a high-key analogous color scheme can give a piece a stimulating shimmer that pleases the eye, making everything seem the same color at first until approach. The colors are pure and aren’t affected by their complements which grab attention. This was commonly used in impressionism by artists such as [[Monet]], [[Pissarro]], and [[Degas]]. [[Pierre Bonnard]] has also been noted for using it.

The '''antiquities trade''' is the exchange of [[antiquities]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]] from around the world. This trade may be [[wikt:illicit|illicit]] or completely legal. The legal antiquities trade abide by national regulations, which now universally provides for extraction that allows for the scientific study of the artifacts in order to study the archaeological and anthropological context.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}{{clarify|date=May 2013}} The illicit antiquities trade involves non-scientific extraction that ignores the [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] context from the artifacts.

==Legal trade==
The legal trade in antiquities abide by the laws of the countries in which the artifacts originate. These laws establish how the antiquities may be extracted from the ground and the legal process in which artifacts may leave the country. In many countries excavations and exports were prohibited without official licenses already in the 19th century, as for example in the Ottoman Empire. According to the laws of the countries of origin, there can't be a legal trade with archaeological artifact without official papers. However, most national laws still overturn these regulations.

==Illicit trade==
{{see also|Art theft|Looted art}}
Illicit or illegal antiquities are those found in illegal or unregulated excavations, and traded covertly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/terminology/illicit-antiquities Illicit Antiquities], Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[black market]] trade of illicit antiquities is supplied by [[looting]] and [[art theft]]. Artifacts are often those that have been discovered and unearthed at archeological digs and then transported internationally through a middleman to often unsuspecting collectors, museums, antique dealers, and auction houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amineddoleh|first=Leila|date=2013-10-01|title=The Role of Museums in the Trade of Black Market Cultural Heritage Property|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2370699|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquities trade is much more careful in recent years about establishing the [[provenance]] of cultural artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/atwood.html Archaeological Institute of America]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3392057.stm BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimates put annual turnover in billions of US dollars.

It is believed by many archaeologists and cultural heritage lawyers that the demand created by circulation, marketing, and collectorship of ancient artifacts causes the continuous looting and destruction of archaeological sites around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/islamic-state-antiquities-trade-stretches-europe-united-states-1724733|title=Islamic State Antiquities Trade Stretches To Europe, United States|date=2014-11-17|work=International Business Times|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal | last1 = Brodie | first1 = Neil | last2 = Renfrew | first2 = Colin | year = 2005 | title = Looting and the world's archaeological heritage: the inadequate response | url = http://traffickingculture.org/publications/brodie-n-and-renfrew-c-2005-looting-and-the-worlds-archaeological-heritage-the-inadequate-response-annual-review-of-anthropology-34-343-61| journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 343–61 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological artifacts are internationally protected by the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] and their circulation is prohibited by the [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|UNESCO Convention (1970) on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property]].

=== Response ===
Recent trends reveal a large push to repatriate [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] illicitly extracted and traded on the international market. Such artifacts include those held by museums like the [[Getty Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/j-paul-getty-museum-returns-to-italy-1999 J Paul Getty Museum Returns to Italy 1999], [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/j-paul-getty-museum-returns-to-italy-2005 J Paul Getty Museum Returns to Italy (2005)], and [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/j-paul-getty-museum-returns-to-italy-2007 J. Paul Getty Museum Returns to Italy (2007)], Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/euphronios-sarpedon-krater Euphronios (Sarpedon) Krater], Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to solve the phenomenon of looting, aerial surveillance - the effectiveness of which depends on the capability to perform systematic prospections - is increasingly being used.  Nevertheless, it is impractical in several countries due to military activity, political restrictions, and/or huge areas and difficult environmental settings (desert, rain forest, etc..). In these contexts, space technology could offer a suitable chance as in the case of Peru. In this country an Italian scientific mission directed by [[Nicola Masini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-16190824|title=Protecting Peru's ancient past|last=Cabitza|first=Mattia|date=2011-12-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 2008 have been using very high resolution satellite data to observe and monitor the phenomeno of 'huaqueros' in some archaeological areas in Southern and Northern Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Lasaponara R., Masini N.

== History ==

=== Early Years: San Diego ===
While Bill Silva was a student at University of San Diego he started a concert promotion company for university parties.  This led him to expand into the San Diego area and establish Bill Silva Presents in 1979. Over the next two decades the company brought acts such as [[The Who]], [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], [[Devo]], [[The Police]], [[Pat Benatar]], [[INXS]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Willie Nelson]] to the area.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"&gt;http://digitalmediasummit.ca/wp-content/plugins/cmw-speakers/speaker_details.php?id=25&lt;/ref&gt;

After securing a foothold in San Diego, Silva branched out into other parts of the southwest, promoting smaller shows in Arizona, Texas, Nevada, and Idaho. In 1982 he partnered with Feyline Productions and became the promoter for any of Feyline's shows outside of Colorado.&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;

In 1992 Silva teamed up with Andrew Hewitt to obtain exclusive rights to produce rock concerts at the [[Hollywood Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-23/news/mn-7298_1_hollywood-bowl "Hollywood Bowl Deal Questioned by Promoters"]. ''latimes''. Retrieved on 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Silva started representing the band [[Unwritten Law]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-silva-mn0001881067 "Bill Silva"]. ''AllMusic''. Retrieved on 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; after promoting one of their shows and BSE's management division, Bill Silva Management, was founded. Soon after, BSM added [[Blink-182]] to its artist roster.&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;

=== The Move To Los Angeles and the Start of the Jason Mraz Era ===

Bill Silva Entertainment moved from San Diego to Los Angeles in 1999.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt; He was introduced to [[Jason Mraz]], who he managed until 2017.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2017/sep/12/blurt-jason-mraz-breaks-manager-bill-silva/&lt;/ref&gt;

Silva also sold his concert division, Bill Silva Presents, to Universal Studios's concert division, which was later purchased by House of Blues Concerts. In March 2003 Andrew Hewitt and Silva left that venture, parting ways in concert promotion with the exception of their partnership at the Hollywood Bowl.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"/&gt;

Silva went on to re-establish Bill Silva Presents with a touring division that was kicked off by 2000's "Up In Smoke Tour" with [[Dr. Dre]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[Eminem]].&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"/&gt; In 2005 Silva hired Eric Herz, a former executive at Avalon Attractions and Metropolitan Entertainment, to oversee Bill Silva Presents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/3501/herz-joins-bill-silva-presents "Herz Joins Bill Silva Presents"]. ''All Access''. Retrieved on 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent Years: Expansion and Diversification ===
In 2011 Silva merged Bill Silva Presents with Live Nation Entertainment, placing Silva and Andrew Hewitt in charge of overseeing the company's concerts in the southwest region of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;George Varga (26 October 2011).

In 2012 the Bill Silva Entertainment team formed a partnership with the model manager David Todd to form DT Model Management.&lt;ref name="emc|bowery"/&gt;

== Bill Silva Management ==
Bill Silva Management has managed the careers of artists, comedians, and film directors since its founding in 1993.

The company began with San Diego bands Unwritten Law and blink-182, and managed [[Jason Mraz]] from 1999 to 2017.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theuprisingcreative"&gt;The Uprising Creative.

== Silva Music Publishing ==
The publishing division of BSE began as a service for its management clients, primarily dealing with BSM artists and their collaborators.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt; In 2012 the company brought in Peter Coquillard, a music publisher who previously worked with Windswept Pacific, L.A. Reid, HITCO, and Network One Music Publishing, to expand the publishing division to include songwriters unaffiliated with BSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songsummit.com.au/program/speakers-artists/peter-coquillard/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306221059/http://www.songsummit.com.au/program/speakers-artists/Peter-Coquillard/ |archivedate=2016-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Madonna of Częstochowa''' ({{lang-pl|Czarna Madonna}} or {{lang|pl|Matka Boska Częstochowska|italic=yes}}, {{lang-la|Imago thaumaturga Beatae Virginis Mariae Immaculatae Conceptae, in Claro Monte}} ), also known as '''Our Lady of Częstochowa''', is a revered [[icon]] of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] housed at the [[Jasna Góra Monastery]] in [[Częstochowa]], [[Poland]]. Several Pontiffs have recognised the venerated icon, beginning with [[Pope Clement XI]] who issued a [[Canonical Coronation]] to the image on 8 September 1717 via the Vatican Chapter.

==The icon==
The four-foot-high painting displays a traditional composition well known in the icons of Eastern Christians.  The Virgin Mary is shown as the "[[Hodegetria]]" ("One Who Shows the Way"). In it the Virgin directs attention away from herself, gesturing with her right hand toward Jesus as the source of salvation. In turn, the child extends his right hand toward the viewer in blessing while holding a book of gospels in his left hand. The icon shows the Madonna in [[fleur-de-lis]] robes.&lt;ref name=polish/&gt;

The origins of the icon and the date of its composition are still contested among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_black_madonna_a_folkloristic_and_iconographic_investigation/ ''The Black Madonna: A Folkloristic and Iconographic Investigation''. Skeptical Inquirer. September/October 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; One difficulty in dating the icon is due in part to its original image being painted over after being badly damaged by [[Hussite]] raiders in 1430. The wooden boards that backed the painting were broken and the canvas slashed. [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] restorers unfamiliar with the [[encaustic painting|encaustic method]] found that the paints they applied to the damaged areas "simply sloughed off the image" according to the medieval chronicler Risinius, and their solution was to erase the original image and to repaint it on the original panel. The original features of an Orthodox icon were softened; the nose was made more aquiline.&lt;ref name=polish/&gt;

==History==

===Lucan tradition===
The icon of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] of Częstochowa has been intimately associated with Poland for the past 600 years. Its history prior to its arrival in Poland is shrouded in numerous legends which trace the icon's origin to [[Luke the Evangelist|St. Luke]] who painted it on a cedar table top from the house of the [[Holy Family]].&lt;ref name="UDayton"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/c/czestochowa-black-madonna.php|title=Black Madonnas: Our Lady of Czestochowa|date=2008-03-26|last=Duricy|first=Michael P|publisher=The Marian Library/International Marian Research Institute, Dayton, Ohio - [[University of Dayton]]|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zawada"&gt;

===Arrival in Częstochowa===

The oldest documents from [[Jasna Góra Monastery|Jasna Góra]] state that the picture travelled from Constantinople via [[Belz]].&lt;ref name="Zawada"/&gt; Eventually it came into the possession of [[Vladislaus II of Opole|Władysław Opolczyk]], [[Duke of Opole]], and adviser to [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis of Anjou]], King of Poland and Hungary. Ukrainian sources state that earlier in its history it was brought to Belz with much ceremony and honors by King [[Leo I of Galicia|Lev I of Galicia]] and later taken by Władysław from the Castle of Belz, when the town was incorporated into the Polish kingdom. A popular story tells that in late August 1384, Ladislaus was passing Częstochowa with the picture when his horses refused to go on. He was advised in a dream to leave the icon at Jasna Gora.

Art historians say that the original painting was a Byzantine icon created around the sixth or ninth century. They agree that Prince Władysław brought it to the monastery in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=polish&gt;[http://www.polamjournal.com/Library/APHistory/blackmadonna/blackmadonna.html "The Black Madonna of Czestochowa", ''Polish American Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pontifical approbations==
Several Pontiffs have recognized the image, namely the following:

* [[Pope Clement XI]] issued a [[Canonical Coronation]] for the image through the Vatican Chapter on 8 September 1717
* [[Pope Pius X]], after the crowns were stolen on 23 October 1909, the Pontiff replaced the crowns on 22 May 1910.
* [[Pope John Paul II]] gifted another set of crowns as a native of Poland, which was placed on 26 August 2005.

===Coronation as Queen and Protectress of Poland===
In August 1382 the hilltop parish church was transferred to the Paulites, a hermitic order from Hungary.&lt;ref name=Menaker/&gt; The golden fleur-de-lis painted on the Virgin's blue veil parallel the heraldic ''azure, semée de lis, or'' of the French royal coat of arms and the most likely explanation for their presence is that the icon had been present in Hungary during the reign of either [[Charles I of Hungary]] and/or [[Louis the Great]], the Hungarian kings of the [[Anjou]] dynasty, who probably had the fleur-de-lis of their family's coat of arms painted on the icon.  This would suggest that the icon was probably originally brought to Jasna Gora by the Pauline monks from their founding monastery in Hungary.
 
The Black Madonna is said to have miraculously saved the monastery of Jasna Góra (English: Bright Mount) from a Swedish invasion.&lt;ref name="Zawada"/&gt; The Siege of Jasna Góra took place in the winter of 1655 during the [[Second Northern War]], as the Swedish invasion of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] is known. The Swedes were attempting to capture the Jasna Góra monastery in Częstochowa. Seventy monks and 180 local volunteers, mostly from the szlachta (Polish nobility), held off 4,000 Swedes for 40 days, saved their sacred icon and, according to some accounts, turned the course of the war.&lt;ref name=Menaker/&gt; This event led King [[John II Casimir Vasa]] to "crown" Our Lady of Częstochowa ("the [[Black Madonna]]") as [[Lwów Oath|Queen and Protector of Poland]] in the cathedral of [[Lviv|Lwów]] on April 1, 1652. Prior to this event, several royal nobilities have offered crowns to the image throughout the years, replacing its iron sheet crown by gold and several jewels. In later years, various jewels were interchanged and repositioned around the image to preserve the aesthetic of the icon with the replacement of stolen crowns.&lt;ref&gt;http://sunday.niedziela.pl/artykul.php?dz=polska&amp;id_art=00163&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legends about the Madonna's appearance===
{{RC-Mariology}}
[[File:Jasna Gora - Czarna Madonna (mozaika).jpg|thumb|right|Black Madonna mosaic at Jasna Góra.]]
The legend concerning the two scars on the Black Madonna's right cheek is that the [[Hussite]]s stormed the Pauline monastery in 1430, plundering the sanctuary. Among the items stolen was the icon. After putting it in their wagon, the Hussites tried to get away but their horses refused to move. They threw the portrait down to the ground and one of the plunderers drew his sword upon the image and inflicted two deep strikes. When the robber tried to inflict a third strike, he fell to the ground and writhed in agony until his death. Despite past attempts to repair these scars, they had difficulty in covering up those slashes as the painting was done with tempera infused with diluted wax.&lt;ref name="UDayton"/&gt;

===Veneration===
Częstochowa is regarded as the most popular shrine in Poland, with many Polish Catholics making a pilgrimage there every year. A pilgrimage has left Warsaw every August 6 since 1711 for the nine-day, 140-mile trek. Elderly pilgrims recall stealing through the dark countryside at great personal risk during the German Nazi occupation. Pope John Paul II secretly visited as a student pilgrim during World War II.&lt;ref name=Menaker&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/22/travel/poland-s-black-madonna.html Menaker, Drusilla. "Poland's Black Madonna", ''New York Times'', July 22, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

The feast day of Our Lady of Częstochowa is celebrated on August 26.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Orthodox Christians are also aware of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa and venerate her. The icon is popular in Ukraine and Belarus as former parts of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and even in Russia. Moreover, this icon has an Orthodox origin, but Polish historians have found out it has been repainted at least twice and there is almost nothing left of the previous Byzantine manner of painting.&lt;ref&gt;A. Różycka-Bryzek, J. Gadomski, Obraz Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej w świetle badań historii sztuki, "Studia Claromontana" 5, 1984, s. 27-52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukrainians]] have a special devotion for the Madonna of Częstochowa. The icon is often mentioned in Ukrainian folk songs from the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Zawada"/&gt;

'''BookLikes''' is a "[[social cataloging]]" website founded in June 2011 by [[Dawid Piaskowski]], a software engineer, e-business analyst and entrepreneur, and [[Joanna Grzelak-Piaskowska]], a linguist and literary scholar.&lt;ref name = "BookLikes: Company Info/Keyfacts"&gt;{{cite web | title= Keyfacts | url = http://booklikes.com/press/29/keyfacts | work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name = "BookLikes: Company Info/Timeline"&gt;{{cite web | title= Timeline | url = http://booklikes.com/press/27/timeline | work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name = "BookLikes: Company Info/Team"&gt;{{cite web | title= Team | url = http://booklikes.com/press/28/team | work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}} The website allows individuals to freely search BookLikes' database of books and reviews. Users can sign up and register books to generate library catalogs.  They can also create their own groups of book suggestions and discussions.

Within eight months of beta testing prior to the May 14, 2013 public launch of the website in its current form, it gathered 8000 bloggers.&lt;ref name="LitReactor: New Book Social Media Site 'BookLikes' Now Open (May 17, 2013)"&gt;{{cite web | title= New Book Social Media Site 'BookLikes' Now Open | url = http://litreactor.com/news/new-book-social-media-site-booklikes-now-open | work = LitReactor | accessdate=12 October 2013|date = 17 May 2013|last = Shultz|first = Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before its public launch in the current format, BookLikes had won an award as the most innovative small business in Greater Poland, on April 17, 2012.&lt;ref name = "BookLikes: Company Info/Timeline"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"&gt;{{cite news | title= If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-pavley/if-you-like-books-youll-l_b_3893860.html | work = [[Huffington Post]] | accessdate=12 October 2013|date = 9 September 2013|last = Pavley|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2013, the company also won the Microsoft BizSpark People's Choice Award, at the Microsoft BizSpark Euro Summit in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Microsoft TechNet/BizSpark Featured Startup on Azure – BookLikes (August 6, 2013)"&gt;{{cite web | title= Featured Startup on Azure – BookLikes | url = http://blogs.technet.com/b/bizspark_group_blog/archive/2013/07/04/bringing-volume-to-serendipity-bizspark-grows-under-microsoft-ventures-germany-opens-microsoft-accelerator-to-packed-event.aspx | work = Microsoft TechNet/BizSpark | accessdate=12 October 2013|date = 4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2013, the website's offices are in Poland; however, founder and CEO Dawid Piaskowski said in a June 2013 interview with the [[Los Angeles Times]] that its owners were contemplating a move of its headquarters to the United States, either to New York City or to California, before the end of 2013.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times: Can Booklikes be the next Goodreads?

== History ==
A first version of BookLikes was launched in June 2011 as a book recommendation engine and social network; a self-described "Facebook for book lovers with price comparison" similar to [[Goodreads]], substantially relying on its own sophisticated book recommendation engine.&lt;ref name = "BookLikes: Company Info/Timeline"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: BookLikes.com Attempts To Out-Suggest Amazon (September 14, 2011)"&gt;{{cite web | title= BookLikes.com Attempts To Out-Suggest Amazon | url = https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/14/booklikes-com-attempts-to-out-suggest-amazon/|work = TechCrunch | accessdate=12 October 2013|date = 14 September 2011|last = Biggs|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this version, the site was presented throughout 2011 at major startup and technology fairs such as [[Seedcamp]] (New York), [[TechCrunch Disrupt]] (San Francisco), and the 2011 Vienna Startup Week.

During the first months of 2012, a new CTO was hired (Daniel Szwarc), and a German version of the service was launched. The growth of [[Goodreads]], as well as the loss of part of BookLikes's data on the servers of the company initially entrusted with hosting those data, and the discovery that the recommendation engine on which the service, until then, had chiefly relied, was not reaching the site's users in the intended way. This prompted the founders to fundamentally revisit the site's conception. They then redesigned it in the [[Tumblr]]-like interactive blog format in which it was eventually launched in May 2013, having won an award as the most innovative small company in Greater Poland already in April 2012.&lt;ref name="BookLikes: Company Info/Timeline"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Microsoft TechNet/BizSpark Featured Startup on Azure – BookLikes (August 6, 2013)"/&gt;

Within five months of its launch in the redesigned format, the site became one of the top 20,000 websites operative in the United States, the sixth highest-ranked startup in Poland, and one of the top 530-ranked startups worldwide.&lt;ref name = "BookLikes Alexa Ranking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BookLikes StartUpRanking data"&gt;{{cite web | title=BookLikes StartUpRanking data | url = http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/booklikes.com | publisher= Alexa | accessdate= 12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, it also won the influential Microsoft BizSpark People's Choice Award, at the Microsoft BizSpark Euro Summit in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Microsoft TechNet/BizSpark Featured Startup on Azure – BookLikes (August 6, 2013)"/&gt; Like [[LibraryThing]], BookLikes was a major beneficiary of (former) [[Goodreads]] users' move towards other book-oriented internet platforms in the wake of [[Goodreads]]'s acquisition by [[Amazon.com]] and a [http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1499741-important-note-regarding-reviews September 2013 change of review-related policy], which left a number of Goodreads users dissatisfied.&lt;ref name="The Digital Reader: Looking for a Replacement for Goodreads?

== Features ==
BookLikes is currently available in three different languages, English, German, and Polish, and plans to add further languages in the future. On the BookLikes website, users can add books to their standard and personal bookshelves, rate and review books, see what their friends are reading, participate in discussion boards and groups on a variety of topics, and get suggestions for future reading choices. Once a user starts following other users, he will see the users' updates and reviews in his or her "Dashboard" feed. BookLikes also adds their own blog updates to a user's feed. The site provides default bookshelves—Read, Currently reading, Planning to read—and the opportunity to create customized shelves to categorize a user's books. Every book that is added by a user can be added to a [[Wish list|wishlist]] or be marked as favorite or private.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;

Similar to [[Tumblr]]'s interface, it lets users access the site on two different levels. On the one hand, a site-wide level, which includes a "Dashboard" feed of items posted by BookLikes and updates from users the user chooses to follow. It also shows the features and services provided directly by BookLikes, such as its recommendation engine, site-related widgets, a presentation of top reviewers, book-related giveaways, "Daily Deals" and other so-called "Goodies", a "friend invite" scheme, discussion groups, and certified author pages for users who are authors themselves.&lt;ref name="BookLikes: Product info"&gt;{{cite web | title= Product info | url = http://booklikes.com/press/21/product-info | work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="BookLikes: Press Release, May 14, 2013"&gt;{{cite web | title= Press Release | url = http://booklikes.com/press/37/press-release | work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="BookLikes: FAQ"&gt;{{cite web | title= FAQ | url = http://booklikes.com/page/18/faq | work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="BookLikes: Community Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web | title= Community Guidelines | url = http://blog.booklikes.com/post/198757/booklikes-community-guidelines|work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}} The site also created an official BookLikes group where users can offer feedback and suggestions for new features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blog.booklikes.com/post/632730|title = Discussion Rooms - Create Groups and Book Clubs|accessdate = 17 October 2013|date = 17 October 2013|website = BookLikes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a second, parallel level, users create their own blogs which other users can subscribe to and which can be customized based on templates provided by BookLikes. The website allows users to link their own website or blog with BookLikes, which then replaces the blog BookLikes offers its users. Users may also customize their blog's layout with [[HTML]].&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Microsoft TechNet/BizSpark Featured Startup on Azure – BookLikes (August 6, 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Digital Reader: Looking for a Replacement for Goodreads?

Users can write posts and each post can be marked as a review. BookLikes features a rating system of one to five stars, with the option of using half-stars. Users can accompany their review with a rating or rate a work without writing a review. By reblogging posts, users can share reviews or updates of other users or repost their own updates and users can like posts of others.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;

The website facilitates reader interactions with authors through giveaways, authors' blogs, and profile information.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;

Since March 2013, BookLikes also allows its users to link their BookLikes account to [[affiliate marketing]] programs, such as [[Amazon.com]] Associates and [[The Book Depository]] Affiliates in order to generate revenue.&lt;ref name="BookLikes: Press Release, May 14, 2013"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}} The profits of these affiliate programs go entirely to the users.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Microsoft TechNet/BizSpark Featured Startup on Azure – BookLikes (August 6, 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Digital Reader: Looking for a Replacement for Goodreads?

{{calligraphy}}
'''Chinese calligraphy''' is a form of aesthetically pleasing writing ([[calligraphy]]), or, the artistic expression of human language in a tangible form. This type of expression has been widely practiced in [[China]] and has been generally held in high esteem across East Asia. Calligraphy is considered as one of the four traditional skills of ancient Chinese literati, along with playing stringed musical instrument, the board game “go”, and painting. There are some general standardizations of the various [[East Asian script styles|styles]] of calligraphy in this tradition. Chinese calligraphy and [[ink and wash painting]] are closely related: they are accomplished using similar tools and techniques, and have a long history of shared artistry. Distinguishing features of Chinese painting and calligraphy include an emphasis on motion charged with dynamic life. According to Stanley-Baker, "Calligraphy is sheer life experienced through energy in motion that is registered as traces on silk or paper, with time and rhythm in shifting space its main ingredients."&lt;ref name="Stanley-Barker 2010a"&gt;{{harv|Stanley-Baker|2010a|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy has also led to the development of many forms of art in China, including [[Chinese seal|seal]] carving, ornate paperweights, and [[inkstone]]s.

== Characteristics ==
In China, calligraphy is referred to as ''shūfǎ'' (書法/书法), literally 'way/method/law of writing';&lt;ref&gt;書 being here used as in 楷书/楷書, etc., and meaning 'writing style'.&lt;/ref&gt; ''shodō'' ({{lang|ja|書道/书道}}) in Japan ('way/principle of writing'); and ''seoye'' (서예; 書藝) in Korea ('skill/criterion of writing'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=王力古漢語字典|author=Wang Li|year=2000|publisher=中華書局|location=Beijing|isbn=7101012191|page=1118|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Chinese calligraphy appreciated more or only for its aesthetic quality has a long tradition, and is today regarded as one of [[the arts]] (Chinese 藝術/艺术 {{zh|p=yìshù}}, a relatively recent word in Chinese)&lt;ref name=mrytmryz&gt;[http://ent.enorth.com.cn/system/2006/04/29/001293903.shtml 田蘊章《每日一題每日一字》] - Internet video series on Chinese calligraphy&lt;/ref&gt; in the countries where it is practised.  Chinese calligraphy focuses not only on methods of writing but also on cultivating one's character (人品)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vincentpoon.com/shodo-and-calligraphy.html|title=Shodo and Calligraphy|website=Vincent's Calligraphy|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught as a pursuit (－書法; {{zh|p=shūfǎ}}, rules of writing [[Han characters]]&lt;ref&gt;Shu Xincheng 舒新城, ed.

'''[[Oracle bone script]]''' was one of the styles of Chinese calligraphy.  Written on [[Oracle bone|oracle bones]] – animal bones or turtle plastrons, it is the earliest known form of Chinese writing. The first appearance of what we recognize unequivocally to refer as “oracle bone inscriptions” comes in the form of inscribed ox scapula and turtle plastrons from sites near modern [[Anyang]] (安阳) on the northern border of [[Henan]] province. Even though there is no proof that the Shang Chinese were solely responsible for the origin of writing in China, but neither is there evidence of recognizable Chinese writing from any earlier time or any other place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31969720|title=The world's writing systems|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Daniels, Peter T., Bright, William, 1928-2006.|isbn=0195079930|location=New York|oclc=31969720}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Shang oracle bone writings constitute the earliest significant corpus of Chinese writing and it is also the oldest known member and ancestor of the Chinese family of scripts, preceding the Chinese bronze inscriptions.  

=== Chinese Bronze Inscriptions  ===
{{Main|Chinese bronze inscriptions}}'''[[Chinese bronze inscriptions]]''' are a kind of style that usually written on the Chinese ritual bronzes. These Chinese ritual bronzes include [[Ding (vessel)|Ding]] (鼎), [[Dui (vessel)|Dui]] (敦), [[Gu (vessel)|Gu]] (觚), [[Guang (vessel)|Guang]] (觥), [[Gui (vessel)|Gui]] (簋), [[Hu (vessel)|Hu]] (壺), [[Jia (vessel)|Jia]] (斝), [[Jue (vessel)|Jue]] (爵), [[Yi (vessel)|Yi]] (匜), [[You (vessel)|You]] (卣), [[Zun]] (尊), and [[Yi (vessel)|Yi]] (彝). Different time period has different method of inscription. Shang bronze inscriptions were nearly all cast along with the implements on which they appear.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=113|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later dynasty such as Western [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]], Spring and Autumn Period, the inscriptions were often engraved after the bronze was cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=73|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze inscriptions are one of the earliest scripts in the [[Chinese family of scripts]], preceded by the [[oracle bone script]].    

=== Seal script ===
{{Main|Seal script}}'''[[Seal script]]''' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|Chinese]]: 篆書; [[pinyin]]: ''zhuànshū'') is an ancient [[Chinese script styles|style]] of writing [[Chinese characters]] that was common throughout the latter half of the 1st millennium BC. It evolved organically out of the [[Zhou dynasty]] [[Bronze script|script]]. The [[Qin (state)|Qin]] variant of seal script eventually became the standard, and was adopted as the formal script for all of China during the [[Qin dynasty]]. 
=== Clerical script ===
{{Main|Clerical script}}The '''[[clerical script]]''' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 隸書; [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 隶书; [[pinyin]]: ''lìshū'') is an archaic style of Chinese calligraphy. The clerical script began during Han dynasty and has lasted up to the present. The clerical script is considered as a form of modern script even though it was replaced by the standard script by very early date. It was all because the graphic forms written in mature clerical script closely resemble those written in standard script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=113|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clerical script is still used for artistic flavor in a variety of functional applications because of its high legibility of reading. 

=== Regular script ===
{{Main|Regular script}}'''[[Regular script]]''' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 楷書; [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 楷书; [[pinyin]]: ''kǎishū'') is the newest of the Chinese script styles. The [[regular script]] first come into existence between the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Cao Wei|Wei]] dynasties, even though it is not popular. The [[regular script]] becomes mature stylistically around the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=143|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first master of regular script is [[Zhong You]]. [[Zhong You]] first used regular script to write some very serious pieces such as memorials to the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=143|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Semi-cursive ===
{{Main|Semi-cursive script}}'''[[Semi-cursive script]]''' also known as ([[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 行书; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 行書; [[pinyin]]: [[Semi-cursive script|Xíng]]), is a cursive [[Chinese script styles|style]] of [[Chinese character|Chinese characters]]. Because it is not as abbreviated as [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]], most people who can read [[regular script]] can read semi-cursive. It is highly useful and also artistic.

=== Cursive script (East Asia) ===
{{Main|Cursive script (East Asia)}}'''[[Cursive script (East Asia)|Cursive script]]''', also known as ([[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 草书; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 草書; [[pinyin]]: ''cǎoshū''), originated in China during the Han dynasty through the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] period (link needed). The cursive script is faster to write than other styles, but difficult to read for those unfamiliar with it. The “grass” in Chinese was also used in the sense of “coarse, rough; simple and crude.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=130|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that ''cǎo'' in the term caoshu “grass script” was used in this same sense. The term ''cǎoshū'' has broad and narrow meanings. In broad sense, it is non-temporal and can refer to any characters which have been hastily written. In narrow sense, it refer to the specific handwriting style in Han dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=131|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
{{Main|Chinese script styles}}
[[File:Mi Fu-On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|''On Calligraphy'' by [[Mi Fu]], [[Song Dynasty]]]]

===Ancient China===
Chinese characters can be retraced to 4000 BC signs ({{harvnb|Lu|Aiken|2004|p= }}).

In 2003, at the site of Xiaoshuangqiao (小双桥), about 20&amp;nbsp;km southeast of the ancient [[Zhengzhou Shang City]], ceramic inscriptions dating to 1435–1412 BC have been found by archaeologists. These writings are made in [[cinnabar]] paint. Thus, the dates of writing in China have been confirmed for the Middle Shang period.&lt;ref name="kaogu.cn"&gt;Song Guoding (2004), [http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Chinese%20Archaeology/4/The%20Cinnabar%20Inscriptions%20Discovered%20at%20the%20Xiaoshuangqiao%20Site,%20Zhengzhou.pdf ''The Cinnabar Inscriptions Discovered at the Xiaoshuangqiao Site, Zhengzhou.''] Chinese Archaeology. Volume 4, Issue 1, Pages 98–102&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceramic ritual vessel vats that bear these cinnabar inscriptions were all unearthed within the palace area of this site. They were unearthed mostly in the sacrificial pits holding cow skulls and cow horns, but also in other architectural areas. The inscriptions are written on the exterior and interior of the rim, and the exterior of the belly of the large type of vats. The characters are mostly written singly; character compounds or sentences are rarely seen.&lt;ref name="kaogu.cn"/&gt;

The contemporary Chinese character's set principles were clearly visible in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]]'s [[Oracle bone script|Jiǎgǔwén characters]](甲骨文) carved on [[ox]] [[scapula]]s and [[tortoise]] [[plastron]]s around 14th - 11th century BCE ({{harvnb|Lu|Aiken|2004|p= }}). Brush-written examples decay over time and have not survived. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved (Keightley, 1978). Each archaic kingdom of current China continued to revise its set of characters.

===Imperial China===
[[File:Poems of The four treasures in a schoolar’s study (Qing).jpg|thumb|right|Poems of The four treasures in a scholar's study ([[Qing dynasty]])]]
For more than 2,000 years, China's literati—Confucian scholars and literary men who also served the government as officials—have been connoisseurs and practitioners of this art.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=ART HISTORY Volume I|last=STOKSTAD|first=MARILYN|last2=W.

In about 220 BC, the emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] （秦始皇, 259 BCE - 210 BCE）, the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them [[Li Si]]'s (李斯, 246-208 BCE) character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized ''Xiǎozhuàn'' characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Fazzioli |first= Edoardo |others= calligraphy by Rebecca Hon Ko |title= Chinese calligraphy : from pictograph to ideogram : the history of 214 essential Chinese/Japanese characters |origyear= 1987 |publisher= [[Abbeville Publishing Group (Abbeville Press, Inc.)|Abbeville Press]] |location= New York |isbn=978-0-89659-774-7 |page= 13 |quote= And so the first Chinese dictionary was born, the ''S&amp;#x101;n Ch&amp;#x101;ng'', containing {{formatnum:3300}} characters|year= 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the main writing implement of the time was already the brush, little paper survives from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.

The [[Clerical script|Lìshū style]] (clerical script) which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text, were also authorised under Qin Shi Huang.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7-ZYX4xCXygC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;ots=YxoWBtBfN-&amp;dq=%22Li%20Ssu%22%20reform%20small%20seal&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=Li%20Ssu&amp;f=false Blakney, p6] : 
{{cite book|author=R. B. Blakney|title=A Course in the Analysis of Chinese Characters|pages=148|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2007|isbn=978-1-897367-11-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is a common mistake to believe that Lishu was created by Cheng Miao alone during Qing Shi Huang’ regime, Lishu was developed from pre-Qin era to the Han dynasty (202BCE-220CE).

During the fourth century CE, calligraphy came to full maturity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Regular script|Kǎishū style]] (traditional regular script) — still in use today — and attributed to [[Wang Xizhi]] (王羲之, 303-361) and his followers, is even more regularized.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt; reached its peak in the Tang Dynasty, when famous calligraphers like Yan Zhenqing and Liu Gongquan produced most of the fine works in Kaishu. Its spread was encouraged by [[Li Siyuan|Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang]] (926-933), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in Kaishu. Printing technologies here allowed shapes to stabilize. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt; But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of &lt;big&gt;广&lt;/big&gt; which is not absolutely the same in the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] of 1716 as in modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to old style.&lt;ref&gt;康熙字典 Kangxi Zidian, 1716. Scanned version available at www.kangxizidian.com. See for example the radicals &lt;big&gt;卩&lt;/big&gt;, &lt;big&gt;厂&lt;/big&gt; or &lt;big&gt;广&lt;/big&gt;, p.41. The 2007 common shape for those characters does not clearly show the stroke order, but old versions, visible on the Kangxi Zidian p.41 clearly allow the stroke order to be determined.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cursive styles such as ''[[Semi-cursive script|Xíngshū]]'' (semi-cursive or running script) and ''[[Cursive script (East Asia)|Cǎoshū]]'' (cursive or sloppy script) are less constrained and faster, where more movements made by the writing implement are visible. These styles' stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They are descended from Clerical script, at the same time as Regular script ([[Han Dynasty]] 202BCE-220CE), but Xíngshū and Cǎoshū were used for personal notes only and were never used as a standard. Caoshu style was highly appreciated during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (140 BCE−87BCE).&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt;

Styles which did not survive include Bāfēnshū, a mix of 80% Xiaozhuan style and 20% Lishu.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt;
Some [[Variant Chinese character]]s were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, were incorporated in the [[Simplified Chinese]] character set.

=== Hard-pen calligraphy ===
This way of writing started to develop in the 1900s when fountain pens were imported into China from the west. Writing with fountain pens remained a convenience until the 1980s. With the Reform and Open, public focused on practicing hard-pen calligraphy. People usually Chinese simplified characters in semi-cursive or regular style.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Printed and computer styles===
Examples of modern printed styles are [[Ming (typeface)|Song]] from the [[Song Dynasty]]'s [[Four Great Inventions of ancient China#Printing|printing press]], and [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|sans-serif]]. These are not considered traditional styles, and are normally not written.

== Materials and tools ==
The ink brush, ink, paper, and inkstone are essential implements of Chinese calligraphy. They are known together as the ''[[Four Treasures of the Study]]''.  In addition to these four tools, a [[Water-dropper (calligraphy)|water-dropper]], desk pads and paperweights are also used by calligraphers.

=== Brush ===
{{Main|Ink brush}}
A brush is the traditional writing instrument for Chinese calligraphy. The body of the brush is commonly made from [[bamboo]] or other materials such as wood, porcelain, or horn. The head of the brush is typically made from animal hair, such as [[Siberian weasel|weasel]], [[rabbit]], [[deer]], [[goat]], [[pig]], [[tiger]], [[wolf]], etc. There is also a tradition in both China and Japan of making a brush using the hair of a newborn child, as a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir. This practice is associated with the legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who scored first in the [[imperial examination]]s by using such a personalized brush.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher's arm.

Today, calligraphy may also be done using a [[pen]].

=== Paper ===
[[Image:Chinese calligraphy scheme 03-en.svg|thumb|250px|right|Calligraphy tools]]

Paper is frequently sold together with a paperweight and [[desk pad]].

Some people insist that Chinese calligraphy should use special papers, such as Xuan paper, Maobian paper, Lianshi paper etc. Any modern papers can be used for brush writing. Because of the long-term uses, Xuan paper became well known by most of Chinese calligraphers.

In [[China]], ''[[Xuanzhi]]'' (宣紙), traditionally made in [[Anhui]] province, is the preferred type of paper. It is made from the [[Tatar wingceltis]] (''Pteroceltis tatarianovii''), as well as other materials including [[rice]], the [[paper mulberry]] (''Broussonetia papyrifera''), [[bamboo]], [[hemp]], etc.
In [[Japan]], ''[[washi]]'' is made from the ''kozo'' (paper mulberry), ''[[ganpi]]'' (''Wikstroemia sikokiana''), and ''[[Edgeworthia papyrifera|mitsumata]]'' (''Edgeworthia papyrifera''), as well as other materials such as bamboo, rice, and [[wheat]].

==== Paperweights ====
[[Paperweight]]s are used to hold down paper. A paperweight is often placed at the top of all but the largest pages to prevent slipping; for smaller pieces the left hand is also placed at the bottom of the page for support. Paperweights come in several types: some are oblong wooden blocks carved with calligraphic or pictorial designs; others are essentially small sculptures of people or animals. Like ink stones, paperweights are collectible works of art on their own right.

==== Desk pads ====
The [[desk pad]] (Chinese [[Traditional Chinese|T]]: 畫氈, [[Simplified Chinese|S]]: 画毡, [[Pinyin]]: huàzhān; Japanese: 下敷 [[shitajiki]]) is a pad made of [[felt]]. Some are printed with grids on both sides, so that when it is placed under the translucent paper, it can be used as a guide to ensure correct placement and size of characters. However, these printed pads are used only by students. Both desk pads and the printed grids come in a variety of sizes.

=== Ink and inkstick ===
[[Image:Chinese calligraphy scheme 01-en.svg|thumb|250px|right|Using an ink stick and inkstone]]
[[Image:Chinese - Brushwasher in the Form of a Leaf - Walters 491212 - Side B.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Brush-washers for removing excess ink are essential tools in the traditional art of Chinese calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]

 |title=Chinese - Brushwasher in the Form of a Leaf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]
Ink is made from lampblack (soot) and binders, and comes in [[inkstick]]s which must be rubbed with water on an inkstone until the right consistency is achieved. Much cheaper, pre-mixed bottled inks are now available, but these are used primarily for practice as stick inks are considered higher quality and chemical inks are more prone to bleeding over time, making them less suitable for use in hanging scrolls. Learning to rub the ink is an essential part of calligraphy study. Traditionally, Chinese calligraphy is written only in black ink, but modern calligraphers sometimes use other colors. Calligraphy teachers use a bright orange or red ink with which they write practice characters on which students trace, or to correct students' work.

=== Inkstone ===
Commonly made from stone, ceramic, or clay, an [[inkstone]] is used to grind the solid inkstick into liquid ink and to contain the ink once it is liquid. [[Chinese inkstone]]s are highly prized as art objects and an extensive bibliography is dedicated to their history and appreciation, especially in China.

=== Seal and seal paste ===
[[Image:Chinese calligraphy scheme 02-en.svg|thumb|250px|right|Using seal paste with a Chinese seal]]
{{Main|Chinese seal}}
Calligraphic works are usually completed by the calligrapher applying one or more [[Chinese seal|seals]] in red ink. The seal can serve the function of a signature.

== Technique ==
The shape, size, stretch, and type of hair in the brush, the color and density of the ink, as well as the absorptive speed and surface texture of the paper are the main physical parameters influencing the final result. The calligrapher also influences the result by the quantity of ink/water he lets the brush take up, then by the pressure, inclination, and direction he gives to the brush, producing thinner or bolder strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, acceleration and deceleration of the writer's moves and turns, and the [[stroke order]] give  "spirit" to the characters by influencing greatly their final shape. The “spirit” is referred to yi in Chinese calligraphy. Yi means “intention or idea” in Chinese. The more practice a calligrapher has, his or her technique will transfer from youyi (intentionally making a piece of work) to wuyi (creating art with unintentional moves). Wuyi is considered as a higher stage for calligraphers, which require the calligrapher to have perfect control over the brush and wrist and following his or her heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Xiongbo|date=2018|title=The Aesthetic Concept of Yi 意 in Chinese Calligraphic Creation|url=|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=68|pages=871-886|via=Project Muse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the bulk of the study of calligraphy is composed of copying strictly exemplary works from the apprentice's master or from reputed calligraphers, thus learning them by rote. The master showing the 'right way' to draw items, which the apprentice have to copy strictly, continuously, until the move becomes instinctive and the copy perfect. Deviation from the model is seen as a failure.&lt;ref name="Stanley-Barker 2010a" /&gt; Competency in a particular style often requires many years of practice. Correct strokes, [[stroke order]], character structure, balance, and rhythm are essential in calligraphy. A student would also develop their skills in traditional [[Chinese arts]], as familiarity and ability in the arts contributes to their calligraphy.

Since the development of [[regular script]], nearly all calligraphers have started their study by imitating exemplary models of regular script. A beginning student may practice writing the character 永 ({{zh|yǒng}}, ''eternal'') for its abundance of different kinds of strokes and difficulty in construction. The [[Eight Principles of Yong]] refers to the eight different strokes in the character, which some argue summarizes the different strokes in regular script.

How the brush is held depends on the calligrapher and which calligraphic genre is practiced. Commonly, the brush is held vertically straight gripped between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger lightly touches the upper part of the shaft of the brush (stabilizing it) while the ring and little fingers tuck under the bottom of the shaft, leaving a space inside the palm. Alternatively, the brush is held in the right hand between the thumb and the index finger, very much like a Western pen. A calligrapher may change his or her grip depending on the style and script. For example, a calligrapher may grip higher for [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]] and lower for [[regular script]].

In Japan, smaller pieces of [[Japanese calligraphy]] are traditionally written while in [[seiza]]. In modern times, however, writers frequently practice calligraphy seated on a chair at a table. Larger pieces may be written while standing; in this case the paper is usually placed directly on the floor, but some calligraphers use an easel.

Basic calligraphy instruction is part of the regular school curriculum in both China and Japan and specialized programs of study exist at the higher education level in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.  In contemporary times, debate emerged on the limits of this copyist tradition within the modern art scenes, where innovation is the rule, while changing lifestyles, tools, and colors are also influencing new waves of masters.&lt;ref name="Stanley-Barker 2010a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley-Barker 2010b"&gt;{{harv|Stanley-Baker|2010b|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese calligraphy is being promoted in Chinese schools to counter [[Character amnesia]] brought on by technology usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New calligraphy classes for China's internet generation|newspaper=BBC NEWS ASIA-PACIFIC|date=27 August 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14693677|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent study, Chinese calligraphy writing have been used as cognitive intervention strategy among older adults or people with mild cognitive impairment. For example, in a recent randomized control trial experiment, calligraphy writing enhanced both working memory and attention control compared to controlled groups &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chan | first1 = SCC | year = 2017 | title = Chinese Calligraphy Writing for Augmenting Attentional Control and Working Memory of Older Adults at Risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial | journal = Journal of Alzheimer's Disease | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 735–746 | doi = 10.3233/JAD-170024 | pmid=28482639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation and appreciation==
While appreciating calligraphy will depend on individual preferences, there are established traditional rules and those who repeatedly violate them are not considered legitimate calligraphers.&lt;ref name=mrytmryz /&gt; Among these rules are:
*'''The characters must be written correctly.'''&lt;ref name=mrytmryz /&gt; A correctly written character is composed in a way that is accepted as correct by legitimate calligraphers. Calligraphic works often use [[variant Chinese character]]s, which are deemed correct or incorrect case-by-case, but in general, more popular variants are more likely to be correct. Correct characters are written in the traditional stroke order and not a modern standard.
*'''The characters must be legible.'''&lt;ref name=mrytmryz /&gt; As calligraphy is the method of writing well, a calligraphic work must be recognizable as script, and furthermore be easily legible to those familiar with the script style, although it may be illegible to those unfamiliar with the script style. For example, many people cannot read [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]], but a calligraphic work in cursive can still be considered good if those familiar with cursive can read it.
*'''The characters must be concise.'''&lt;ref name=mrytmryz /&gt; This is in contrast to [[Western calligraphy]] where flourishes are acceptable and often desirable. Good Chinese calligraphy must be unadorned script. It must also be in black ink unless there is a reason to write in other ink.
*'''The characters must fit their context.'''&lt;ref name=mrytmryz /&gt; All reputable calligraphers in China were well educated and well read. In addition to calligraphy, they were skilled in other areas, most likely [[Chinese painting|painting]], [[Chinese poetry|poetry]], [[Music of China|music]], [[Chinese opera|opera]], [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]], and [[Go (game)|Go]]. Therefore, their abundant education contributed to their calligraphy. A calligrapher practicing another calligrapher's characters would always know what the text means, when it was created, and in what circumstances. When they write, their characters' shape and weight agrees with the rhythm of the phrases, especially in less constrained styles such as [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]] and [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]]. One who does not know the meaning of the characters they write, but varies their shape and weight on a whim, does not produce good calligraphy.
*'''The characters must be aesthetically pleasing.'''&lt;ref name=mrytmryz /&gt; Generally, characters that are written correctly, legibly, concisely, and in the correct context are also aesthetically pleasing to some degree. Characters that violate the above rules are often less aesthetically pleasing. An experienced calligrapher will consider the quality of the line, the structure of each character which the lines are placed, the compositional organization of groups of characters. Throughout the work, the brush line of light or dark, dry or wet should record the process of the artist creating the work vividly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnhart|first=Richard|date=1972|title=Chinese Calligraphy: The Inner World of the Brush|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3258680|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|volume=|pages=230-241|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
=== Calligraphy in Japan and Korea ===
The Japanese and Koreans have developed their own specific sensibilities and styles of calligraphy while incorporating Chinese influences, as well as applying to specific scripts. [[Japanese calligraphy]] extends beyond [[Hanzi|Han characters]] to also include local scripts such as [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]].

In the case of [[Korean calligraphy]], the [[Hangeul]] and the existence of the circle required the creation of a new technique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daikynguyen.com/eet/print_archive/united_states/chicago/2006/05-May/26/B7.pdf Daikynguyen.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708220741/http://www.daikynguyen.com/eet/print_archive/united_states/chicago/2006/05-May/26/B7.pdf |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other arts ===
[[File:Chinesecalligraphywater1.jpg|thumb|Water calligraphy or ground calligraphy is a popular pastime in China.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first=Wendan|title=Chinese writing and calligraphy|year=2009|publisher=University of Hawaiʻi Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0-8248-3364-0|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
The existence of temporary calligraphy is also to be noted. This is the practice of water-only calligraphy on the floor which dries out within minutes. This practice is especially appreciated by the new generation of retired Chinese in public parks of China.

Calligraphy has influenced [[ink and wash painting]], which is accomplished using similar tools and techniques. Calligraphy has influenced most major art styles in [[East Asia]], including [[Ink and wash painting]], a style of [[Chinese painting|Chinese]], [[Japanese painting|Japanese]], and [[Korean painting]] based entirely on calligraphy.

The '''coat of arms''' of the [[Germany|German]] state and city of [[Hamburg]] is a kind of a [[national emblem]]. The [[coat of arms]] and the [[Flag of Hamburg|flags]] are regulated by the constitution of Hamburg and law. The colors of Hamburg are white and red. One of the oldest versions of the castle is found on a seal in 1245.

==Description==
All coat of arms show a castle with three towers. The middle tower shows a cross on top. It is believed that the so-called Marian stars on top of the two side-towers and the cross recalls the fact that Hamburg used to be an archbishopric.&lt;ref name="admi"/&gt; The towers and the walls with their pinnacles and the closed gate symbolized the determination of the town to defend itself.&lt;ref name=abbl/&gt;

===Greater Coat of Arms===
The Greater Coat of Arms shows the castle, the stars and the church in silver on red ground with two lions standing on a compartment. The top is like the middle coat of arms with a helmet with crest including three peacock feathers and six banners of the arms and a mantling. This coat of arms is protected and only allowed to be used by the [[Government of Hamburg|Senat and the Diet of Hamburg]].&lt;ref name="admi"/&gt;

===Admiralty Coat of Arms of Hamburg===
The Admiralty Coat of Arms of Hamburg is used for official ships of Hamburg.&lt;ref name="admi" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Seal City of Hamburg 1241 replica.jpg|thumb|left|First known [[Seal (device)|seal]] of 1241 (Replica)]]
The oldest coat of arms of Hamburg has been retained on city seals of the 12th and 13th centuries. During the centuries the towers, walls, pinnacles and symbols of the coat of arms of Hamburg changed several times, without changing in character. The central castle was shown with opened doors sometimes with closed doors and with a portcullis.&lt;ref name="admi"/&gt;

The colors of version of the lesser arms of 2008 are declared by an act of law of the [[Senate of Hamburg]] on 14 May 1752.&lt;ref name="admi"/&gt; Before the [[Tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] was a red castle on white ground.&lt;ref name=hhlex/&gt; Since 1952, the coat of arms and the flags are regulated by the [[constitution of Hamburg]]. The colors of Hamburg are white and red.&lt;ref name=verfassung/&gt; In general the use of city seals with the coat of arms was a privilege of the City Council. The city elders had to watch its maintenance. Even now the coat of arms is protected and can only be used under specific circumstances.

===Greater Coat of Arms===
The coat of arms exists since the 16th century.&lt;ref name="admi"/&gt;

===Admiralty Coat of Arms of Hamburg===
In 1623, a ''Admiralitätskollegium'' (lit. admiralty council) was established to oversee the law of sea and the security of shipping, as a port authority.&lt;ref name="hhlex2"/&gt; The coat of arms exists since 1642.&lt;ref name="admi"/&gt; In 1811 abandoned during the [[France|French]] occupation, the admiralty council was officially disestablished in 1814, and succeeded as a court instance by the ''Handelsgericht'' (trade court) and for administrative purposes by the port and shipping deputation (German title: ''Schifffahrts- und Hafendeputation'').&lt;ref name="hhlex2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2795">In the field of [[patent]]s, the phrase "to '''design around'''" means to invent an alternative to a patented [[invention]] that does not infringe the patent’s [[Claim (patent)|claim]]s.  The phrase can also refer to the invention itself.

Design-arounds are considered to be one of the benefits of patent law.  By providing monopoly rights to inventors in exchange for disclosing how to make and use their inventions, others are given both the information and incentive to invent competitive alternatives that design around the original patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://works.bepress.com/katherine_strandburg/4 |last=Strandburg |first=Katherine |year=2004 |title=What Does the Public Get?: Experimental Use and the Patent Bargain |journal=Wisconsin Law Review |volume=2004 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of [[vaccine]]s, for example, design-arounds are considered fairly easy.  It is often possible to use the original patent as a guide for developing an alternative that does not infringe the original patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Nc33ZS5nRa0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA119&amp;ots=N1uqRKKYJd&amp;sig=lJPt-TOjqdtnPvbXYN2JzQNeoCs#PPA91,M1 |last=Kremer |first=Michael |chapter=Creating Markets for New Vaccines –Part II: Design Issues |title=Innovation Policy and the Economy |volume=I |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=2001 |page=93 |isbn=0-262-60041-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design-arounds can be a defense against [[patent troll]]s.  The amount of license fee that a patent troll can demand is limited by the alternative of the cost of designing around the troll's patent(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=991698 |last=Golden |first=John M. |title='Patent Trolls' and Patent Remedies |journal=[[Texas Law Review]] |volume=85 |issue= |pages=2111–2161 [p. 2130] |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to defend against design-arounds, inventors often develop a large [[patent portfolio|portfolio]] of interlocking patents, sometimes called a [[patent thicket]].  Thus a competitor will have to design around a large number of patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rubinfeld |first=Daniel L. |last2=Maness |first2=Robert |year=2005 |chapter=The Strategic Use of Patents: Implications for Antitrust |title=Antitrust, Patents and Copyright: EU and US Perspectives |editor1-last=Leveque |editor1-first=Francois |editor2-last=Shelanski |editor2-first=Howard |location=Northampton |publisher=Edward Elgar |pages=85–102 |chapterurl=http://www.law.berkeley.edu/faculty/rubinfeldd/Profile/publications/Strategic_Use_of_Patents.pdf |isbn=1-84542-603-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Douglas Moggach has written on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Hegel]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Bruno Bauer]], [[aesthetics]], [[Republicanism]], and history of ancient and modern political thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://douglasmoggach.cgpublisher.com/biography.html CGS Publishers Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moggach's research falls into three principal areas: analysis of the philosophy, politics, and economic thought of the Hegelian School; the historical development of German idealism from Leibniz to Hegel; and aesthetics and politics. His archival research led to the discovery and publication of lost texts by Bruno Bauer, a leading figure in the Hegelian School of the 1830s and 1840s. Moggach argues that the political thinking of the German Hegelians represents a specific variant of republicanism, which recognizes modern social diversity and alienation.&lt;ref&gt;See also Volker Gerhart's preface to Moggach's volume, Bruno Bauer: Uber die Prinzipien des Schönen.&lt;/ref&gt; His works in German Idealism have focused on the foundational importance of Leibniz for Kant and Hegel, and trace the origins of Kant's juridical thought in the German Enlightenment debates about freedom,  perfection, and state economic direction.&lt;ref&gt;D. Moggach, Freedom and Perfection: German Debates on the State in the Eighteenth Century" Canadian Journal of Political Science, Dec. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Moggach has also published on aesthetics and politics, notably on Schiller and Bauer, developing the concept of an aesthetic republicanism based on an aesthetic version of Kant's moral idea of autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer&lt;/ref&gt; Moggach also traces the relations between German idealism and various strands of Romanticism, and contributes to conceptions of universality, freedom and republicanism in European political thought.&lt;ref&gt;See, Moggach, 2004, Reason, Universality, and History.&lt;/ref&gt; Moggach wrote the chapter on Marx in The Impact of Idealism, ed. N. Boyle and J. Walker, vol. 2 (CUP 2013), and the chapter on Romantic Political Thought in Oxford Companion to European Romanticism, ed. P. Hamilton (OUP, 2016).

Moggach discovered an unpublished manuscript by Bruno Bauer, which had been awarded the Prussian Royal Prize in philosophy by a panel headed by Hegel in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;D. Moggach/Winfried Schulze, Bruno Bauer, De pulchri principiis. Uber die Prinzipien des Schönen, Berlin 1996. Reviewed in Philosophische Rundschau, 43/3, 1996; Owl of Minerva, 30/2, 1999; Studi kantiani, XII, 1999; Revue d’esthétique, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This manuscript, written in Latin, is held in the archives of the Humboldt Universität, Berlin, but had not been recognized before. Moggach shows how after attending Hegel's lectures on logic in 1828, Bauer applies this logic to the categories of aesthetic judgement that Kant had developed in his Third Critique. Starting from the Hegelian premise of the unity of thought and being, Bauer wants to show that the separation of subject and object in Kant's Critiques of Pure and of Practical Reason remains a feature of the Critique of Judgement. Bauer argues that Kant does make efforts to bridge the gap, and he opens the path that Hegel will follow, but Kant does not finally succeed in this objective. What prevents him from succeeding is his faulty treatment of the categories involved in making aesthetic judgements. Moggach thinks that in this early text Bauer also lays the foundations for his later theory of infinite self-consciousness, and for his specific type of ethical and historical idealism.

Moggach's book, The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer (CUP, 2003) traces the emergence of German republicanism from philosophical and religious polemics of the 1830s and 1840s, its relation to Kant and Hegel, and its assessment of political and economic change. This work was short-listed for the 2004 C.B. Macpherson Prize, awarded by the Canadian Political Science Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca&lt;/ref&gt; It was reviewed by Frederick Beiser in Times Literary Supplement, 24 September 2004; Choice, Nov. 2004; and other journals.&lt;ref&gt;Times Literary Supplement, 24 September 2004; Philosophy in Review, 24/5, Oct. 2004; Choice, Nov. 2004; Canadian Journal of Political Science, 37/3, 2004; Filosofia politica, 3, Dec. 2003; H-Net, Nov. 2004 &lt;www.h-net.org/reviews&gt;; History of European Ideas, 30/4, 2004; Dialogue (ΦΣΤ), 04/2005; European Journal of Philosophy, 14/1, 2006; Owl of Minerva, 38/ 1-2, 2006-07; Bulletin of the Hegel Society of Great Britain, 57/58, 2008; etc. Review essay, "Philosophie der Krise: Dimensionen der nachhegelschen Reflexion. Neuere Literatur zur Philosophie des Vormärz und der Junghegelianer," Zeitschrift für philosophische Forschung 63, 2009, pp. 313-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moggach's edited volume, The New Hegelians (CUP, 2006), is intended to show that after Hegel's death in 1831, members of his school developed his philosophy in new directions in order to understand the evolution of modern society, along with the modern state and economy. The Hegelians were not mere imitators of their teacher, but creative thinkers about modernity and its problems, especially social cohesion and the conflict of individual interests. According to Moggach, many of these New or Young Hegelians found a solution to these conflicts in republican ideas of virtue, rethought so that they are compatible with modern institutions. Moggach applies the idea of republican rigorism, introduced by other historians of political thought, to outline these solutions. For the Hegelians, this concept involves changing the boundaries between morality and legality that Kant had established. Kant had claimed that the legal sphere concerns the external aspects of action alone, but not its motivating principles or maxims. For the Hegelians, though, political action has to promote, or at least not hinder, the external freedom of others, but it must also have the right kinds of internal ethical motivation: this means not acting from private interest, but from an idea of the general good. In this way Kant's idea of autonomy is related to political as well as moral action, and to republican ideas of freedom as non domination.&lt;ref&gt;Reviewed in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews 2007.05.02 &lt;http://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews.cfm&gt;; British Journal for the History of Philosophy, 15/2, 2007; Journal of the History of Philosophy, 45/4, 2007; Neue politische Literatur, 52/1, 2007; Bulletin of the Hegel Society of Great Britain,59/60, 2009; Foundations of Political Theory www.political-theory.org/books/reviews/moggach.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent edited volume, Politics, Religion, and Art: Hegelian Debates (Northwestern UP, 2011), Moggach and his colleagues continue to establish the importance of the Hegelians of the 1830's and 1840's as innovators in theology, aesthetics, and ethics, and as creative contributors to foundational debates about modernity, state, and society. The political significance of religious and aesthetic debates, and the German contributions to republican political thought, receive further attention in this volume, which also draws heavily on archival material.

Moggach, Beiser, and other interlocutors debated Schiller's republicanism in a special issue of Inquiry (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Inquiry, Vol. 51 no. 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Moggach produced a critical discussion of multiculturalism, in a published conversation with [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Jeremy Waldron]], [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Omid Payrow Shabani]], ed., Multiculturalism and the Law: A Critical Debate, University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2007; review here: {{cite web|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/reviews/2009/03/multiculturalism-and-law-critical.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607152453/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/reviews/2009/03/multiculturalism-and-law-critical.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5427">[[File:Ferdinand von Wright.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand von Wright (1880s).]]
'''Ferdinand von Wright''' (19 March 1822, Haminalahti, near [[Kuopio]] - 31 July 1906, Kuopio) was a [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish-Swedish]] painter. He is best known for his landscapes and animal paintings, especially his detailed depictions of birds, but he also created [[still-life]]s and portraits.

==Biography==
His ancestors were Scottish merchants who had settled in [[Narva]] during the 17th-Century and his father was a retired Major who owned a large, well-known estate. He was the youngest of nine surviving children and was tutored at home. Two of his older brothers, [[Magnus von Wright|Magnus]] and [[Wilhelm von Wright|Wilhelm]], also became painters and illustrators. Following in their footsteps, he showed an early aptitude for art, developed during time spent hunting and exploring nature while making sketchbooks.

He travelled to Sweden for the first time when he was fifteen, visiting [[Bohuslän]] Province with Wilhelm,&lt;ref name="Y"&gt;[https://www.jyu.fi/hum/laitokset/taiku/taiku_opiskelu/kurssit/klassikot/materiaalit/ferdinand Brief biography] @ the [[University of Jyväskylä]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; who was working as an illustrator for the zoologist [[Bengt Fredrik Fries]]. The following year, he went by himself to work for the amateur [[ornithologist]], Count Nils Bonde, who had recently subsidized the publication of a multi-volume ''Svenska Fåglar'' (Swedish Birds), with illustrations by Magnus and Wilhelm. 
[[File:Ferdinand von Wright - The Fighting Capercaillies - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Fighting [[Capercaillies]] (1886)]]
After a few months back in Finland, he returned to Sweden where, in 1842, he briefly studied at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]] with the sculptor [[Johan Niclas Byström]]. He went home again in 1844, having been in Sweden for almost six years. Five years later, he went to [[Turku]], where he took some additional lessons from [[Robert Wilhelm Ekman]].&lt;ref name="Y" /&gt; In 1852, he and his brothers went to Helsinki, where he set up a studio and began painting more detailed scenes, rather than individual animals. Six years later, he took a trip to [[Dresden]], where he spent two months studying with the noted animal painter {{ill|Johann Siegwald Dahl|de}}.&lt;ref name="Y" /&gt; He then travelled to [[Orust]] with Wilhelm, staying for a year.

In 1863, he built a home near his family's estate, which he named "Lugnet" (serenity or tranquility in Swedish).&lt;ref name="L"&gt;[http://www.lahteilla.fi/fi/person/ferdinand-von-wright Brief biography] @ Lähteillä.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived there for the next twenty years, occasionally spending time with his sisters in Kuopio. In the early 1870s, he had several strokes and was often bedridden,&lt;ref name="Y" /&gt; but continued to paint as much as possible. Eventually, he had to move out of the main part of his home and occupy two smaller guest rooms upstairs. He made his last trip in 1881, to Orust, visiting Wilhelm, who was also ill.

His work became more commercial after this and, in 1886, he produced his best-known work ''The Fighting Capercaillies''.&lt;ref name="Y" /&gt; He also contributed articles to various ornithological journals. About this time, he received a state artists' pension.&lt;ref name="L" /&gt; Many former students came to visit and, in the late 1890s, the bird painter {{ill|Matti Karppanen|fi}} stayed on to be his pupil and assistant. Slowly, he became more withdrawn and died in 1906.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3691">A '''form''' is a [[document]] with spaces (also named ''fields'' or ''placeholders'') in which to [[writing|write]] or select, for a  series of documents with similar contents. The documents usually have the printed parts in common, except, possibly, for a [[serial number]]. 

Forms, when completed, may be a statement, a request, an [[order (business)|order]], etc.; a [[check (finance)|check]] may be a form. Also there are forms for taxes; filling one in is a duty to have determined how much tax one owes, and/or the form is a request for a refund. See also [[Tax form|Tax return]].

Forms may be filled out in duplicate (or ''triplicate'', meaning three times) when the information gathered on the form needs to be distributed to several departments within an [[organization]]. This can be done using [[carbon paper]].

[[File:Mantelbögen.JPG|thumb|A variety of forms.]]

== History ==
Forms have existed for a significant amount of time, with historians of [[law]] having discovered preprinted legal forms from the early 19th century that greatly simplified the task of drafting [[complaint]]s and various other legal pleadings. It is believed that the form was conceived by mathematician and inventor [[Charles Babbage]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e24VAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA114,M1 ''On the economy of machinery and manufactures'' p114]&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, like [[California]], many common types of legal pleadings must be submitted on official government forms.

== Advantages ==
Advantages of forms include the following:
* One has to write less (while the printing is almost universally done in some automatic way)
* One is told or reminded what information has to be supplied
* There is [[Wiktionary:uniformity|uniformity]], for convenience in processing
* Information is collected in writing and so can be reexamined later (the form can also include a signature field to allow someone to take responsibility for the accuracy of the information provided). 
* Simpler tasks, such as collecting or distributing data, can be separated in the [[workflow]] from more skilled processes, such as making decisions. Issuing and processing the forms may then be done by less skilled staff, or by a computer. The de-skilled task becomes issuing or completing the appropriate form for the circumstances, and then passing it on to the next step in the [[workflow]]. This might reduce costs and increase the volume of work that can be handled.

A form on a computer allows for conveniently typing in the variable parts (the input data).

== Form structure ==
A blank form is like a usual document, with some outlined parts with spaces. Blank forms are generally not copyrightable in the US.&lt;ref&gt;37 Code of Federal Regulations § 202.1(c) (2006) ("Blank forms, such as time cards, graph paper, account books, diaries, bank checks, scorecards, address books, report forms, order forms and the like, which are designed for recording information and do not in themselves convey information [are not subject to copyright]"); ''see also [[Baker v. Selden]]'', 101 U.S. 99 (1880).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frame and fixed content===
Part of the document that never changes. Usually a frame with title and textual instructions.

===Placeholders===
Boxes or spaces where the user can type to fill in the form.

'''Gobeunok''' or '''Gogok''' are comma-shaped or curved beads and jewels that appeared from [[prehistoric Korea]] through the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]].  

==Details==
Gogok is also sometimes romanized as "kogok" and "kokkok" or "kokok." They are also found in [[Northeast Asia]], but are most numerous in [[Japan]] ([[Magatama]]) and especially in [[Hokkaido]] from [[Jōmon period]] populations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Although usually made from [[jadeite]] mined in Japan, they have been discovered made from many different materials such as [[nephrite]], [[rock (geology)|stone]], clay, bone and [[glass]]. They range in size range from {{convert|1 to 10|cm}}, and have a small hole in the middle of the round part for threading. They were used as earrings and necklaces, and as decoration on crowns, belts, and bracelets. Some are further decorated with gold or silver attachments.

The curved nature of the gogok beads and their similarities to bear claws has led to a theory of Scytho-Iranian and Persian influence and origin created by bear totem tribes.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/publications/pdfs/korea/divided/Materials-Music.pdf#search='comma%20shaped%20silla%20beads'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mei.edu/content/1500-years-contact-between-korea-and-middle-east|title=1,500 Years of Contact between Korea and the Middle East|work=Middle East Institute|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Korea]], jade gogok are found at prehistoric sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9049968 magatama - Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the [[Korean Peninsula]], nephrite gogok are found inand [[Bronze Age]] sites in stone burial chambers (stone cists and [[dolmen]]s). This probably indicates that gogok were symbols of prestige and power buried with the elites of society.

The most famous examples of gogok in [[Korean art]] are from the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms period]], in the [[crowns of Silla]], earrings, necklaces, and [[royal girdle of Korea]].  These treasures were found in the burial mounds and royal mausoleums of [[Silla]], [[Baekje]], and [[Gaya confederacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/opac/catalogue_detail.php?&amp;object_number=C.102-1984&amp;_limit_=10&amp;_function_=xslt The Fitzwilliam Museum : Catalogue Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612092144/http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/opac/catalogue_detail.php?&amp;object_number=C.102-1984&amp;_limit_=10&amp;_function_=xslt |date=2011-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ornamental antlers and tree-like structures of the Silla crown and similarities of the crown with works from the [[Eurasian Steppe]] and [[Afghanistan]] suggests vast networks of trade and also reinforces a Scytho-Iranian origin for gogok.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/05/eak/ht05eak.htm Korea, 1–500 A.D. | Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  They declined in use from about the middle of the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kr.dic.yahoo.com/search/enc/result.html?pk=10815300&amp;p=%B0%EE%BF%C1%20&amp;field=id&amp;type=enc 야후! 백과사전 - 곡옥&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:PazyrikHorseman.JPG|thumb|Horseman, [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]] felt artifact, c.300 BC. A gogok shaped ornament can be found on the chest of the horse.]]

==Origin==
The origin of gogok is contested by archaeologists because these jewels are common in [[Kofun period]] tombs of Japan, where they are known as [[magatama]]. One archaeologist, James Keally, who believes gogok originated in Japan, cites the fact that gogok have been reported in Jōmon sites in Tohoku as early as about 1000 BCE.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.t-net.ne.jp/~keally/kofun.html Kofun Culture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/05/eak/ht05eak.htm Korea, 1–500 A.D. | Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray Area hosts exhibitions and music events, software and electronics classes, a media lab and resident-artist program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Heather Knight, Chronicle Staff Writer | title=Arts district to transform lower Taylor Street | url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-02-21/news/17189827_1_arts-district-large-arts-institutions-arts-gallery  | accessdate=8 February 2011 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=21 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray Area Foundation for the Arts’ stated purpose is to bring “together the best creative coders, data artists, designers, and makers to create experiments that build social consciousness through digital cultur''e.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Gray Area | title=Mission | url=http://grayarea.org/about/mission/ | year=2012 | accessdate=31 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

Founded in 2006 by its Executive Director Josette Melchor and Board Chairman Peter Hirshberg, Gray Area joins similarly focused institutions, like [[Eyebeam Art and Technology Center]] and [[Ars Electronica]], in promoting the intersections of art, technology and community by working to produce, exhibit, and develop the creative technical skills that allow for experimentation with and exploration of the most contemporary technologies.

==History==
Following a conversation in 2006 about the lack of proper venues for the exhibition of new media and technology based art work, Melchor and Hirshberg initially opened ''Gray Area Gallery'' in San Francisco's [[South of Market, San Francisco|South of Market (SoMa)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=forward/slash: The Gray Area Foundation for the Arts Story | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ulwcLVzT7w | year=2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Mid-Market Street Monitor | title=Examiner on Mid-Market Street revival | url=http://www.midmarketstreet.com/2009/07/examiner-on-mid-market-street-revival.html | year=2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the gallery incorporated as a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] and was renamed ''Gray Area Foundation for The Arts''. In June 2009, Gray Area relocated to its present facility near the end of Taylor Street . In total, the {{convert|8000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} location had included in addition to the pornography arcade, a bar (Club 65) and liquor store. Leased from property owner Jack Sumski, the space allowed Gray Area to expand its well-established exhibition platform to include artist residencies, educational workshops and symposiums, growing Gray Area into the comprehensive and integrated center for the creation and promotion of technology-based art it is today.

When the Art Theatres [[Adult video arcade|pornography arcade]] that had been there since the 1970s moved out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=San Francisco Chronicle | title=An art gallery blossoms on seedy Taylor Street | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/cityinsider/detail?entry_id=48594  | accessdate=6 January 2011 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=SF Weekly | title=Arts groups create new music opportunities in the Tenderloin | url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2009-03-18/music/arts-groups-create-new-music-opportunities-in-the-tenderloin/ | year=2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sumski decided that "it was time to do something in my old age, to get something going, and give the Tenderloin a future" and invested heavily to prepare the site for Gray Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=San Francisco Business Times | title=Mid-Market arts district may finally premiere | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2009/05/25/story16.html | accessdate=6 January 2011 | date=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Mid-Market Street Monitor | title=Examiner on Mid-Market Street revival | url=http://www.midmarketstreet.com/2009/07/examiner-on-mid-market-street-revival.html | year=2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray Area Foundation for The Arts is part of a coalition of city agencies, arts organizations and community service providers seeking to revitalize a neighborhood that has historically struggled with the effects of substance abuse, addiction and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=SF Gov: Office of the Mayor | title=Mayor Newsom Announces San Francisco Arts Commission Awarded $250,000 Grant... | url=http://sfmayor.org/press-room/press-releases/press-release-mayor-newsom-announces-san-francisco-arts-commission-awarded-250000-grant-from-the-national-endowment-for-the-arts-for-mid-market-revitalization/ | year=2010 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=SF Examiner | title=Steve Falk: Mid-Market Street’s best new hope can happen | url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/opinion/steve-falk-mid-market-street-s-best-new-hope-can-happen | year=2010 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''City Centered Festival'' brought together artists, educators and community leaders within the Tenderloin district to generate ideas of using 'locative media' to better understand and connect in their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=City Centered website | url=http://citycentered.org/ | year=2010 | accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Syzygryd'' is a collaboration with three other arts organizations (Interpretive Arson, False Profit Labs &amp; Ardent Heavy Industries), to create a large scale interactive art piece to be unveiled at the 2010 [[Burning Man]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Syzygryd.com | url=http://www.syzygryd.com/ | year=2010 | accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artist residency===
The first five resident artists ''(Alphonzo Solorzano, Gabriel Dunne, Ryan Alexander, Miles Stemper and Daniel Massey)'' moved into the space in July 2009. In 2010, three of these resident artists remained. ''(Gabriel Dunne, Ryan Alexander and Daniel Massey)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Gray Area | title=Artists | url=http://grayarea.org/community-category/artists/ | year=2010 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arts Incubator ===
The Gray Area Incubator is a peer-driven community of creators developing work at the intersection of art and technology. Membership is a 6 month commitment, though many have continued on much longer to develop their works in the Incubator. Artists work in the disciplines of Visual Media Arts, Creative Code, Virtual &amp; Augmented Reality, Civic Engagement &amp; Digital Activism, Social Entrepreneurship, Data Science, Sound &amp; Audio, and Software &amp; Hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://grayarea.org/incubator/membership/|title=Incubator Membership - Gray Area Art &amp; Technology|work=Gray Area Art &amp; Technology|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
Gray Area's Josette Melchor was selected as one of the five innovators showcased on Ford's The Edge of Progress Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=The Edge of Progress Tour: Technological Art and Robotic Filmmakers in San Francisco | url=http://www.good.is/edgeofprogress/the-edge-of-progress-tour-technological-art-and-robotic-filmmakers-in-san-francisco/  | year=2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historical criticism''', also known as '''the historical-critical method''' or '''higher criticism''', is a branch of criticism that investigates the origins of ancient texts in order to understand "the world behind the text".&lt;ref name="Handbook, 78"&gt;{{cite book|last=Soulen|first=Richard N.|title=Handbook of biblical criticism|year=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky.|isbn=0-664-22314-1|edition=3rd ed., rev. and expanded.|author2=Soulen, R. Kendall|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; While often discussed in terms of Jewish and Christian writings from ancient times, historical criticism has also been applied to other religious writings from various parts of the world and periods of history.
The primary goal of historical criticism is to discover the text's primitive or original meaning in its original historical context and its literal sense or ''sensus literalis historicus''. The secondary goal seeks to establish a reconstruction of the historical situation of the author and recipients of the text. That may be accomplished by reconstructing the true nature of the events that the text describes. An ancient text may also serve as a document, record or source for reconstructing the ancient past, which may also serve as a chief interest to the historical critic. In regard to Semitic biblical interpretation, the historical critic would be able to interpret the literature of Israel as well as the history of Israel.&lt;ref name="Handbook, 79"&gt;{{cite book|last=Soulen|first=Richard N.|title=Handbook of Biblical Criticism|year=2001|publisher=John Knox|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 18th century [[Biblical criticism]], the term "higher criticism" was commonly used in mainstream scholarship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hahn|first=general editor, Scott|title=Catholic Bible dictionary|year=2009|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=0-385-51229-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast with "[[lower criticism]]". In the 21st century, historical criticism is the more commonly used term for higher criticism, and [[textual criticism]] is more common than the loose expression "lower criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soulen|first=Richard N.|title=Handbook of Biblical Criticism |year=2001|publisher=John Knox|pages=108, 190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical criticism began in the 17th century and gained popular recognition in the 19th and 20th centuries. The perspective of the early historical critic was rooted in [[Protestant Reformation]] ideology since its approach to biblical studies was free from the influence of traditional interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Ebeling. Word and Faith. Philadelphia, Fortress Press, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; Where historical investigation was unavailable, historical criticism rested on philosophical and theological interpretation. With each passing century, historical criticism became refined into various methodologies used today: [[source criticism]], [[form criticism]], [[redaction criticism]], [[tradition criticism]], [[canonical criticism]], and related methodologies.&lt;ref name="Handbook, 79"/&gt;

==Methods==
Historical-critical methods are the specific procedures &lt;ref name="Handbook, 78"/&gt; used to examine the text's historical origins, such as/the time, the place in which the text was written; its sources; and the events, dates, persons, places, things, and customs that are mentioned or implied in the text.&lt;ref name="Handbook, 79"/&gt;

===Application===
Application of the historical critical method, in [[biblical studies]], investigates the books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as the [[New Testament]]. Historical critics compare texts to other texts written around the same time. An example is that modern biblical scholarship has attempted to understand the [[Book of Revelation]] in its 1st century historical context by identifying its [[literary genre]] with Jewish and Christian [[apocalyptic literature]].

In regard to the [[Gospels]], higher criticism deals with the [[synoptic problem]], the relations among [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]. In some cases, such as with several [[Pauline epistles]], higher criticism can confirm the traditional understanding of authorship.{{cn|date=October 2017}} Higher criticism understands the New Testament texts within a historical context: that is, that they are not adamantine but writings that express the ''traditio'' (what is handed down). The truth lies in the historical context.

In [[classical studies]], the 19th century approach to higher criticism set aside "efforts to fill ancient religion with direct meaning and relevance and devoted itself instead to the critical collection and chronological ordering of the source material."&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' (1985), Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, higher criticism, whether biblical, classical, Byzantine or medieval, focuses on the source documents to determine who wrote it and where and when it was written.

Historical criticism has also been applied to other religious writings from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Islam]].

===Methodologies===

Historical criticism comprises several disciplines, including&lt;ref name="Handbook, 79"/&gt; [[source criticism]], [[form criticism]], [[redaction criticism]], [[tradition criticism]], and [[radical criticism]].

====Source criticism====
{{Main|Source criticism}}
Source criticism is the search for the original sources which lie behind a given biblical text. It can be traced back to the 17th century French priest [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]], and its most influential product is undoubtably [[Julius Wellhausen]]'s ''[[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels]]'' (1878), whose "insight and clarity of expression have left their mark indelibly on modern biblical studies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony F. Campbell]], SJ, "[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/BPL_Images/Content_store/Sample_chapter/9780631210719/perdue.pdf Preparatory Issues in Approaching Biblical Texts]," in ''The Hebrew Bible in Modern Study'', p. 6. Campbell renames source criticism as "origin criticism".&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Two source hypothesis.png|thumb|250px|[[Source criticism]]: diagram of the [[two-source hypothesis]], an explanation for the relationship of the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke.]]

====Form criticism====
{{Main|Form criticism}}

Form criticism breaks the Bible down into sections (''pericopes'', stories), which are analyzed and categorized by genres (prose or verse, letters, laws, court archives, war hymns, poems of lament etc.). The form critic then theorizes on the pericope's ''Sitz im Leben'' ("setting in life"), the setting in which it was composed and, especially, used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibledudes.com/biblical-studies/form.php Bibledudes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tradition history]] is a specific aspect of form criticism, which aims at tracing the way in which the pericopes entered the larger units of the biblical canon, especially the way in which they made the transition from oral to written form. The belief in the priority, stability and even detectability, of oral traditions is now recognised to be so deeply questionable as to render tradition history largely useless, but form criticism itself continues to develop as a viable methodology in biblical studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/3815_3767.pdf Yair Hoffman, review of Marvin A. Sweeney and Ehud Ben Zvi (eds.), ''The Changing Face of Form-Criticism for the Twenty-First Century'', 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Redaction criticism====
{{Main|Redaction criticism}}
Redaction criticism studies "the collection, arrangement, editing and modification of sources" and is frequently used to reconstruct the community and purposes of the authors of the text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-relg-studies.scu.edu/facstaff/murphy/courses/exegesis/redaction.htm Religious Studies Department, Santa Clara University.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228065539/http://www-relg-studies.scu.edu/facstaff/murphy/courses/exegesis/redaction.htm |date=2006-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Pioneers of historical criticism as applied to the Bible include the Dutch scholars [[Desiderius Erasmus]]{{cn|date=July 2017}} (1466? – 1536) and [[Benedict Spinoza]] (1632–1677).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
When it is applied to the Bible, the historical-critical method is distinct from the traditional, devotional approach.&lt;ref name="JInt"&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]]. [[Jesus, Interrupted]], HarperCollins, 2009. {{ISBN|0-06-117393-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, while devotional readers concern themselves with the overall message of the Bible, historians examine the distinct messages of each book in the Bible.&lt;ref name="JInt"/&gt; Guided by the devotional approach, for example, Christians often combine accounts from different gospels into single accounts, but historians attempt to discern what is unique about each gospel, including how they differ.&lt;ref name="JInt"/&gt;

The phrase "higher criticism" became popular in Europe from the mid-18th century to the early 20th century to describe the work of such scholars as [[Jean Astruc]] (1684-1766), [[Johann Salomo Semler]] (1725–91), [[Johann Gottfried Eichhorn]] (1752–1827), [[Ferdinand Christian Baur]] (1792–1860), and Wellhausen (1844–1918).&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In academic circles, it now is the body of work properly considered{{by whom?|date=July 2017}} "higher criticism", but the phrase is sometimes applied to earlier or later work using similar methods.

"Higher criticism" originally referred to the work of [[Germany|German]] biblical scholars of the [[Tübingen School]].  After the groundbreaking work on the [[New Testament]] by [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), the next generation, which included scholars such as [[David Friedrich Strauss]] (1808–74) and [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]] (1804–72), analyzed in the mid-19th century the historical records of the Middle East from biblical times, in search of independent confirmation of events in the [[Bible]]. The latter scholars built on the tradition of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Rationalism|Rationalist]] thinkers such as [[John Locke]] (1632–1704), [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Gotthold Lessing]], [[Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] (1770–1831) and the French [[rationalism|rationalists]].

Such ideas influenced thought in [[England]] through the work of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and, in particular, through [[George Eliot]]'s translations of Strauss's ''The Life of [[Jesus]]'' (1846) and Feuerbach's ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1854). In 1860, seven [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] [[Anglican]] theologians began the process of incorporating this historical criticism into Christian doctrine in ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'', causing a five-year storm of controversy, which completely overshadowed the arguments over [[Charles Darwin]]'s newly-published ''[[The Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species]]''. Two of the authors were indicted for heresy and lost their jobs by 1862, but in 1864, they had the judgement overturned on appeal. ''La Vie de Jésus'' (1863), the seminal work by a Frenchman, [[Ernest Renan]] (1823–1892), continued in the same tradition as Strauss and Feuerbach. In Catholicism, ''[[L'Evangile et l'Eglise]]'' (1902), the magnum opus by [[Alfred Loisy]] against the ''[[Essence of Christianity]]'' of [[Adolf von Harnack]]{{cn|date=July 2017}} (1851–1930) and ''La Vie de Jesus'' of Renan, gave birth to the [[modernist crisis]] (1902–61). Some scholars, such as [[Rudolf Bultmann]] (1884–1976) have used higher criticism of the Bible to "[[demythologization|demythologize]]" it.

[[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]] argues that the term "historical-critical method" conflates two nonidentical distinctions, and prefers the term "Biblical criticism":
::Historical study... can be either critical or noncritical; and critical study can be historical or nonhistorical. This suggests that the term "historical-critical method" is an awkward hybrid and might better be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;
John Barton, ''The Nature of Biblical Criticism'', Westminster John Knox Press (2007), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Not a few observers, especially among religious circles, have criticized the historical-critical method as biased by ''a priori'' reasons:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From these two principles the Modernists deduce two laws, which, when united with a third which they have already got from agnosticism, constitute the foundation of '''historical criticism'''. We will take an illustration from the Person of Christ. In the person of Christ, they say, science and history encounter nothing that is not human. Therefore, in virtue of the first canon deduced from agnosticism, whatever there is in His history suggestive of the divine, must be rejected. Then, according to the second canon, the historical Person of Christ was transfigured by faith; therefore everything that raises it above historical conditions must be removed. Lately, the third canon, which lays down that the person of Christ has been disfigured by faith, requires that everything should be excluded, deeds and words and all else that is not in keeping with His character, circumstances and education, and with the place and time in which He lived. A strange style of reasoning, truly; but it is Modernist criticism.
''[...]''
Now we ask here: Who is the author of this history? The historian? The critic? Assuredly, neither of these but the philosopher. From beginning to end everything in it is a priori.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3339">In [[film studies]], '''historical poetics''' is a scholarly approach to studying [[film]], which [[David Bordwell]] outlined in his book ''Making Meaning'' (1989).&lt;ref name=Bhaskar&gt;Ira Stig Bhaskar (2004), "Historical Poetics, Narrative, and Interpretation" in ''A Companion to Film Theory'' (eds. Toby Miller &amp; Robert Stan). Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Bhaskar's article is a critical account of historical poetics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Bordwell argues that theory-driven, interpretative approaches should be eschewed and argued that historical poetics was a better approach to studying film.&lt;ref name=Bhaskar/&gt; Bordwell argues that "[a]ny inquiry into the fundamental principles by which a work in any representational medium is constructed can fall within the domain of poetics."&lt;ref name=Bordwell1&gt;David Bordwell (1989), "Historical Poetics of Cinema" in ''The Cinematic Text'' (ed. R. Barton Palmer). New York: AMS Press, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Jenkins makes a distinction between [[descriptive poetics]] and prescriptive poetics where the former examine "how artworks ''have been'' constructed" and the latter make a case for "how artworks ''should be'' constructed."&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;Henry Jenkins (1989), "Historical Poetics" in ''Approaches to Popular Film'' (ed. Joanne Hollows and Mark Jankovich). Manchester: Manchester UP, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Bordwell's own research falls within the former category while an example of the latter is the ''[[Dogme 95|Dogme 95 Manifesto]]'' by [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Film director|director]]s [[Lars von Trier]] and [[Thomas Vinterberg]].

Bordwell's research into the stylistic changes in Hollywood cinema demonstrates four specific changes: the use of more rapid editing, an increasingly frequent use of very long or very short lenses, a more prevalent use of close shots, and more camera movement.&lt;ref name=Bordwell3&gt;David Bordwell (2002) “Intensified Continuity: Visual Style in Contemporary American Film” in ''Film Quarterly'' 55(3), 16-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bordwell2&gt;David Bordwell (2006) ''The Way Hollywood Tells It. Story and Style in Modern Movies'' Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical poetics and [[neoformalism (film theory)|neoformalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Historical poetics and neoformalism are sometimes used interchangeably, sometimes as related approaches.&lt;/ref&gt; are part of the "post-theory" trend in [[film studies]]. Bordwell has repeatedly argued that some approaches — ones based in "Grand Theories" — do not study films ''per se'' but instead use films to confirm predetermined theoretical frameworks. He and [[Noël Carroll]] coined the term "S.L.A.B. theory" which refers to theorists [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]], [[Lacan]], [[Althusser]], and [[Barthes]].&lt;ref&gt;Annette Kuhn and Guy Westwell (2012). "Post-theory" in ''A Dictionary of Film Studies''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Historical poetics is considered to be related to [[cognitive film theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Annette Kuhn and Guy Westwell (2012).

'''Gerald "Jerry" Neal Williamson''' (April 17, 1932 - December 8, 2005) was an American horror writer and editor known under the name '''J. N.

He studied journalism at [[Butler University]].  He published his first novel in 1979 and went on to publish more than 40 novels and 150 short stories.  In 2003 he received a lifetime achievement award from the [[Horror Writers of America]]. He edited the critically acclaimed ''How to Write Tales of Horror, Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction (1987)'' which covered the themes of such writing and cited the writings of such writers as [[Robert Bloch]], Lee Prosser, [[Richard Matheson]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[August Derleth]], [[William F. Nolan]], and [[Stephen King]]. Many important writers in the genre contributed to the book. Williamson edited the popular anthology series, ''Masques''. Some of his novels include ''The Ritual (1979)'', ''Playmates (1982)'', ''Noonspell (1991)'', ''The Haunt (1999)'', among others.

Williamson recalled in a 2003 interview that his first work of fiction was a [[Sherlock Holmes]] [[pastiche]] called "The Terrible Death of Crosby, The Banker."&lt;ref name=G/&gt;

{{Muhammad cartoons}}

The '''''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy''' (or '''Muhammad cartoons crisis''') ([[Denmark|Danish]]: ''Muhammedkrisen'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henkel |first=Heiko |title=Fundamentally Danish? The Muhammad Cartoon Crisis as Transitional Drama |journal=Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-knowledge |date=Fall 2010 |volume=VIII |series=2 |url=http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20VIII%202/Henkel-FM.pdf |accessdate=25 November 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194639/http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20VIII%202/Henkel-FM.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; began after the [[List of newspapers in Denmark|Danish newspaper]] ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' published 12 editorial cartoons on 30 September 2005, most of which depicted [[Muhammad]], a principal figure of the religion of [[Islam]]. The newspaper announced that this was an attempt to contribute to the debate about [[criticism of Islam]] and self-censorship. Muslim groups in [[Denmark]] complained, and the issue eventually led to protests around the world, including violent demonstrations and riots in some [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title="The Muhammad Cartoon Crisis. The tip of an Iceberg", Japanese religion |last=Jensen |first=Tim |year=2006 |pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam has a strong tradition of [[aniconism]], and it is considered [[Islam and blasphemy|highly blasphemous in most Islamic traditions]] to visually depict Muhammad. This, compounded with a sense that the cartoons insulted Muhammad and Islam, offended many Muslims. Danish Muslim organisations that objected to the depictions responded by petitioning the embassies of Islamic countries and the Danish government to take action in response, and filed a judicial complaint against the newspaper, which was dismissed in January 2006. After the Danish government refused to meet with diplomatic representatives of the Muslim countries and would not intervene in the case, a number of Danish [[imam]]s visited the Middle East in late 2005 to raise awareness of the issue. They presented a dossier containing the twelve cartoons from the ''Jyllands-Posten'', and other information some of which was found to be falsified.&lt;ref name=responsibilities /&gt;&lt;ref name="HH80-84" /&gt;

As a result, the issue received prominent media attention in some Muslim-majority countries, leading to protests across the world in late January and early February 2006. Some escalated into violence resulting in more than 200 reported deaths, attacks on Danish and other European diplomatic missions, attacks on churches and Christians, and a major international boycott. Some groups responded to the outpouring of protest by endorsing the Danish policies, launching "Buy Danish" campaigns and other displays of support. The cartoons were reprinted in newspapers around the world both in a sense of journalistic solidarity and as an illustration in what became a major news story.

Danish Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] described the controversy as Denmark's worst international relations incident since the [[Denmark in World War II|Second World War]]. The incident came at a time of heightened political and social tensions between [[Islam by country|Muslim majority countries]] and [[Western world|Western countries]], following several, high-profile [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorist attacks]] in the West{{mdash}}including the [[September 11 attacks]]{{mdash}}and Western military interventions in Muslim countries, such as [[American occupation of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]. The cartoons and the reaction to them aggravated already-strained relations. The relationship between Muslims in Denmark and the broader society was similarly at a low-point, and the conflict came to symbolize the misunderstandings between the Islamic community and the rest of society. In the years since, terrorist plots claiming to be in retaliation for the cartoons have been planned, and some executed, against targets affiliated with newspapers that published the cartoons or Denmark.

Supporters said that the publication of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] regardless of the validity of the expression, that it was important to openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as [[Islamophobic]], racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.

=== Debate about self-censorship ===
On 16 September 2005, Danish news service [[Ritzau]] published an article discussing the difficulty encountered by the writer [[Kåre Bluitgen]], who was initially unable to find an illustrator prepared to work on his children's book ''The Qur'an and the life of the Prophet Muhammad'' (Danish:''Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv'').&lt;ref name=hansen&amp;hundevadt&gt;{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=John |title=Provoen og Profeten: Muhammed Krisen bag kulisserne |year=2006 |publisher=Jyllands-Postens Forlag |location=Copenhagen |isbn=87-7692-092-5 |first2=Kim |last2=Hundevadt |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bluitgen |first=Kåre |title=Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv |year=2006 |publisher=Høst &amp; Søn/Tøkk |isbn=978-87-638-0049-5 |page=268 |url=http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T |others=Anonymous illustrator |language=Danish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118123641/http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T |archivedate=18 January 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three artists declined Bluitgen's proposal out of fear of reprisals.

One artist agreed to assist anonymously; he said that he was afraid for his and his family's safety.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bluitgen, one artist declined due to the murder in Amsterdam of the film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] the year before; another cited the attack in October 2004 on a lecturer at the [[Carsten Niebuhr]] Institute at the [[University of Copenhagen]]; he was assaulted by five assailants who opposed his reading of the Qur'an to non-Muslims during a lecture.&lt;ref name="dybangst" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 October 2004 |title=Overfaldet efter Koran-læsning |publisher=TV 2 |url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php?id=1424089 |language=Danish |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202822/http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php?id=1424089 |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story gained some traction, and the major Danish newspapers reported the story the following day.&lt;ref name="dybangst"&gt;{{cite news |date=17 September 2005 |title=Dyb angst for kritik af islam ("Profound anxiety about criticism of Islam") |newspaper=Politiken |url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/ECE123660/dyb-angst-for-kritik-af-islam/ |accessdate=19 March 2013 |language=Danish |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195043/http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/ECE123660/dyb-angst-for-kritik-af-islam/ |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supposed refusals from these first three artists to participate was seen as evidence of self-censorship out of fear of violence from [[Islamist]]s, which led to much debate in Denmark.&lt;ref name="dybangst" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whyipub"&gt;{{cite news |date=19 February 2006 |title=Why I Published Those Cartoons |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/17/AR2006021702499.html |first=Flemming |last=Rose |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923211833/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/17/AR2006021702499.html |archivedate=23 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.&lt;ref&gt;Politiken 12. Februar 2006 "''Muhammedsag: Ikke ligefrem en genistreg''"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publication ===

At an editorial meeting of ''Jyllands-Posten'' ("The [[Jutland]] Post", Denmark's largest daily newspaper) on 19 September, reporter Stig Olesen mooted the idea of asking the members of the newspaper illustrators union if they would be willing to draw Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be an experiment to see the degree to which professional illustrators felt threatened. [[Flemming Rose]], culture editor, was interested in the idea and wrote to the 42 members of the union asking them to draw their interpretations of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="whyipub" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

15 illustrators responded to the letter; three declined to participate, one did not know how to contribute to what he called a vague project, one thought the project was stupid and badly paid, and one said he was afraid.&lt;ref name="Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 17"&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; 12 drawings had been submitted{{mdash}}three from newspaper employees and two which did not directly show Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 17" /&gt; The editors thought that some of the illustrators who had not responded were employed by other newspapers and were thus contractually prohibited from working for ''Jyllands-Posten.'' In the end, editor-in-chief [[Carsten Juste]] decided that given its inconclusive results, the story was better suited as an opinion piece rather than a news story, and it was decided to publish it in the culture section, entirely under the direction of editor Flemming Rose.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[Peter Hervik]], a professor of Migration Studies, has since written that the results of this experiment disproved the idea that self-censorship was a serious problem in Denmark because the overwhelming majority of cartoonists had either responded positively or refused for contractual or philosophical reasons.&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt; Carsten Juste has said that the survey "lacked validity and the story fell short of sound journalistic basis."&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt; Hervik said that this, along with the fact that the most controversial cartoons were drawn by the newspaper's staff cartoonists, demonstrates that the newspaper's "desire to provoke and insult Danish Muslims exceeded the wish to test the self-censorship of Danish cartoonists."&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt;

Rose wrote the editorial which accompanied the cartoons in which he argued there had been several recent cases of self-censorship, weighing freedom of speech against the fear of confronting issues about Islam, so he thought it was legitimate news story. Among the incidents he cited were: the translators of a book critical of Islam did not want their names published; the [[Tate gallery]] in London withdrew an installation by the avant-garde artist [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] depicting the Quran, Bible and Talmud torn to pieces, and comedian [[Frank Hvam]] said in an interview with ''Jyllands-Posten'' that he would hypothetically dare to urinate on the Bible on television, but not on the Quran. Rose also mentioned the case of a Danish imam who had met with Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and "called on the prime minister to interfere with the press in order to get more positive coverage of Islam."&lt;ref name="whyipub" /&gt;

On 30 September 2005, ''Jyllands-Posten'' published an article entitled "''Muhammeds ansigt''" ("The face of Muhammad")  incorporating the cartoons.&lt;ref name="muhammeds_ansigt"&gt;{{cite news |first=Flemming |last=Rose |date=29 September 2005 |title=Muhammeds ansigt |newspaper=Jyllands-Posten |url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE4769352/muhammeds-ansigt/ |language=Danish |accessdate=18 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225235648/http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE4769352/muhammeds-ansigt/ |archivedate=25 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article consisted of the 12 cartoons and an explanatory text, in which Rose wrote:

{{quote|Modern, secular society is rejected by some Muslims. They demand a special position, insisting on special consideration of their own religious feelings. It is incompatible with contemporary democracy and freedom of speech, where one must be ready to put up with insults, mockery and ridicule. It is certainly not always attractive and nice to look at, and it does not mean that religious feelings should be made fun of at any price, but that is of minor importance in the present context.&amp;nbsp;... we are on our way to a slippery slope where no-one can tell how the self-censorship will end. That is why ''Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten'' has invited members of the Danish editorial cartoonists union to draw Muhammad as they see him.|Flemming Rose|&lt;ref name="muhammeds_ansigt" /&gt;}}

Later, Rose explained his intent further in ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "The cartoonists treated Islam the same way they treat Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and other religions. And by treating Muslims in Denmark as equals they made a point: We are integrating you into the Danish tradition of satire because you are part of our society, not strangers. The cartoons are including, rather than excluding, Muslims."&lt;ref name="whyipub" /&gt; The publication of the cartoons was also accompanied by an editorial titled 'Truslen fra mørket'' ('The Threat from  the Darkness'') condemning Islamic spiritual leaders "who feel entitled to interpret the prophet's word, and cannot abide the insult that comes from being the object of intelligent satire."&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt; In October 2005, ''Politiken'', another leading Danish newspaper, published its own poll of thirty-one of the forty-three members of the Danish cartoonist association. Twenty-three said they would be willing to draw Muhammad. One had doubts, one would not be willing because of fear of possible reprisals, and six artists would not be willing because they respected the Muslim ban on depicting Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Profetens ansigt: Ingen selvcensur blandt tegnere (''The prophet's face: No Self Censorship among illustrators'') |newspaper=Politiken |date=20 October 2005 |page=Section 2, page 3 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Description of the cartoons ===
{{Main|Descriptions of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons}}

The 12 cartoons were drawn by 12 professional cartoonists in Denmark. Four of the cartoons have Danish texts, one deliberately evades the issue and depicts a school child in Denmark named Muhammad rather than the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]], one is based on a Danish cultural expression, and one includes a Danish politician.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The immediate responses to the publication included newspaper sellers refusing to distribute that day's paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHUIuy2Y5AQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Klausen,+Jytte+The+Cartoons&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5bGHUq6oMIrNtAbj_oHQCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=September%2030%2C%202005&amp;f=false |title=The Cartoons That Shook the World |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624082203/https://books.google.com/books?id=lHUIuy2Y5AQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Klausen,+Jytte+The+Cartoons&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5bGHUq6oMIrNtAbj_oHQCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=September%2030%2C%202005&amp;f=false |archivedate=24 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, the cartoons received significant attention in other Danish press outlets. According to [[Jytte Klausen]], "most people groaned that the newspaper was at it again, bashing Muslims. The instinct was to split the blame."&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 17"&gt;Klausen, 2009. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Berlingske-Tidende'' criticised the 'gag', but also said that Islam should be openly criticised. ''Politiken'' attacked Rose's account of growing self-censorship; it also surveyed Danish cartoonists and said that self-censorship was not generally perceived as a problem.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 17" /&gt; On October 4, a local teenager telephoned the newspaper offices threatening to kill the cartoonists, but he was arrested after his mother turned him in.&lt;ref&gt;Klausen, 2009. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the publication, a group of Islamic leaders formed a protest group. [[Raed Hlayhel]] called a meeting to discuss their strategy, which took place in Copenhagen a few days after the cartoons appeared.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 86"&gt;Klausen, 2009. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic Faith Community and four mosques from around the country were represented. The meeting established 19 "action points" to try to influence public opinion about the cartoons. [[Ahmed Akkari]] from an  mosque in Aarhus was designated the group's spokesman. The group planned a variety of political activities, including launching a legal complaint against the newspaper,  writing letters to media outlets inside and outside Denmark, contacting politicians and diplomatic representatives, organising a protest in Copenhagen, and mobilising Danish Muslims through text messages and mosques.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 86" /&gt; A one-day strike and sleep-in were planned, but never took place.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 86" /&gt; A peaceful protest, which attracted about 3,500 demonstrators, was held in Copenhagen on 14 October 2005.&lt;ref name=Klausen186&gt;Klausen, 2009. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having received petitions from Danish imams, eleven ambassadors from Muslim-majority countries{{mdash}}Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Libya, Morocco{{mdash}}and the Head of the Palestinian General Delegation&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt; asked for a meeting with Danish Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] on 12 October 2005. They wanted to discuss what they perceived as an "on-going smearing campaign in Danish public circles and media against Islam and Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;Hervik, 2012, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter, the ambassadors mentioned the issue of the Muhammad cartoons, a recent indictment against [[Radio Holger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Denmark targets extremist media |date=17 August 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4159220.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |first=Thomas |last=Buch-Andersen |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055144/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4159220.stm |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and statements by MP [[Louise Frevert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ordene på Louise Freverts hjemmeside |date=30 September 2005 |language=Danish |url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/baggrund/article.php?id=2946997 |publisher=[[TV2 (Denmark)|TV2]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211101846/http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/baggrund/article.php?id=2946997 |archivedate=11 December 2005 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Minister of Culture [[Brian Mikkelsen]].&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mikkelsen blæser til ny kulturkamp |date=25 September 2005 |url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php?id=2923885 |publisher=TV2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215173141/http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php?id=2923885 |archivedate=15 February 2006 |language=Danish |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded:

The government answered with a letter without addressing the request for a meeting: "The freedom of expression has a wide scope and the Danish government has no means of influencing the press. However, Danish legislation prohibits acts or expressions of blasphemous or discriminatory nature. The offended party may bring such acts or expressions to court, and it is for the courts to decide in individual cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gfx-master.tv2.dk/images/Nyhederne/Pdf/side3.pdf |title=Official response to ambassadors from A.F.Rasmussen |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219083657/http://gfx-master.tv2.dk/images/Nyhederne/Pdf/side3.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2006 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The refusal to meet the ambassadors was later prominently criticised by the Danish political opposition, twenty-two Danish ex-ambassadors and the Prime Minister's fellow party member, former Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Uffe Ellemann-Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davidsen-Nielsen |first=Hans |title=Danske ambassadører leverer skarp kritik af Fogh |url=http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE132427/danske-ambassadoerer-leverer-skarp-kritik-af-fogh/ |accessdate=19 September 2013 |newspaper=Politiken |date=19 December 2005 |language=Danish |last2=Surrugue |first2=Stéphanie |last3=Parker Astrup |first3=Tanja |last4=Emborg |first4=Rasmus |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055618/http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE132427/danske-ambassadoerer-leverer-skarp-kritik-af-fogh/ |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hervik wrote, "While it is certainly true that the prime minister did not have a legal right to intervene in the editorial process, he could have publicly (as an enactment of free speech) dissociated himself from the publication, from the content of the cartoons, from Rose's explanatory text, from ''Jyllands-Posten'''s editorial of the same day, and from the general association of Islam with terrorism. Rasmussen did none of those. Instead, he used his interview [on 30 October 2005] to endorse ''Jyllands-Posten's'' position and the act of publishing the cartoons."&lt;ref&gt;Hervik, 2012. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) and [[Arab League]] also wrote a joint letter to the Prime Minister expressing alarm about the cartoons and other recent incidents and insults committed by Danish politicians.&lt;ref name=Klausen186 /&gt; The Muslim countries continued to work diplomatically to try to have the issue{{mdash}}and the other issues mentioned in their initial letter{{mdash}}addressed by the Danish government.&lt;ref name=Diplomatic&gt;Klausen, 2009.

After trying to engage the Danish government diplomatically, Egyptian foreign minister [[Ahmed Aboul Gheit]] and the secretary-generals of the  OIC and the Arab League sent letters to the [[OSCE]], [[OECD]], and [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|EU foreign policy coordinator]] complaining about Danish inaction.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 67" /&gt;

=== Judicial investigation of ''Jyllands-Posten'' (October 2005 – January 2006) ===
On 27 October 2005, representatives of the Muslim organisations which had complained about the cartoons in early October filed a complaint with the Danish police claiming that ''Jyllands-Posten'' had committed an offence under section 140 and 266b of the [[Danish Criminal Code]], precipitating an investigation by the public prosecutor.&lt;ref name="danish_response_to_un_jan"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.um.dk/NR/rdonlyres/00D9E6F7-32DC-4C5A-8E24-F0C96E813C06/0/060123final.pdf |title=Official Response by the Danish Government to the UN Special Rapporteurs |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark |date=24 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218054430/http://www.um.dk/NR/rdonlyres/00D9E6F7-32DC-4C5A-8E24-F0C96E813C06/0/060123final.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2006 |format=PDF |language=Danish |accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg discontinued the investigation as he found no basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish [[case law]] extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech must be taken into consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation.&lt;ref name="danish_response_to_un_jan" /&gt; In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.&lt;ref name=rigsadvokat /&gt;

In December, after failing to make any progress with the Danish government or the newspaper, the "Committee for Prophet Honouring" decided to gain support and leverage outside of Denmark by meeting directly with religious and political leaders in the Middle East. They created a 43-page dossier (commonly known as the [[Akkari-Laban dossier]], after two leading imams ({{lang-ar|ملف عكّاري لبن}})) containing the cartoons and supporting materials for their meetings.&lt;ref name=clash&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,398624,00.html |date=1 February 2006 |title=Alienated Danish Muslims Sought Help from Arabs |newspaper=Spiegel Online International |accessdate=6 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307221716/http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,398624,00.html |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dossier, finalised for the group's trip to Lebanon in mid-December, contained the following:&lt;ref name=Thomsen&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomsen |first=Per Bech |title=Muhammed-krisen – Hvad skete der, hvad har vi lært? |year=2006 |publisher=People's Press |location=Copenhagen |isbn=87-7055-002-6 |pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblen.info/Ressourcer/5679.pdf The dossier (PDF in arabic)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223335/http://www.biblen.info/Ressourcer/5679.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }} (page visited on 7 January 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts{{mdash}}including Helle Lykke Nielsen{{mdash}}who have examined the dossier said that it was broadly accurate from a technical point of view but contained a few falsehoods and could easily have misled people not familiar with Danish society, an assessment which the imams have since agreed to.&lt;ref name="HH80-84"&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 80-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mistakes were that Islam is not officially recognised as a religion in Denmark (it is), that the cartoons are the result of a contest, and that Anders Fogh Rasmussen in his role as Prime Minister gave a medal to [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] (he gave one in his capacity as party leader of the Liberal Party). The imams also claimed to speak on behalf of 28 organisations, many of which later denied any connection to them.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Additions such as the "pig" photograph may have polarised the situation (the association of a person and a pig is considered very insulting in Islamic culture), as they were confused for the cartoons published in the newspaper.&lt;ref name=responsibilities /&gt; Muslims who met with the group later said Akkari's delegation had given them the impression that Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen somehow controlled or owned ''Jyllands-Posten''.&lt;ref name=clash /&gt;

On 9 September 2006, BBC News reported that the Muslim boycott of Danish goods had reduced Denmark's total exports by 15.5% between February and June. This was attributed to an approximated 50% decline in exports to the Middle East. The BBC said, "The cost to Danish businesses was around 134 million euros ($170m), when compared with the same period last year, the statistics showed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5329642.stm |title=Cartoons row hits Danish exports |publisher=BBC News |date=9 September 2006 |accessdate=9 September 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004180422/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5329642.stm |archivedate=4 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper in the UK said, "While Danish milk products were dumped in the Middle East, fervent right-wing Americans started buying [[Bang &amp; Olufsen]] stereos and [[Lego]].

[[Naser Khader]], a Muslim Danish MP, founded an organisation called [[Democratic Muslims in Denmark]] in response to the controversy. He was worried that what he believed to be Islamists were seen to speak for all Muslims in Denmark. He said that there is still a sharp division within the Danish Muslim community between Islamists and moderates, and that Denmark had become a target for Islamists. He said that some good came from the crisis because "the cartoon crisis made clear that Muslims are not united and that there is a real difference between the Islamists and people like myself. Danes were shown that talk of 'the Muslims' was too monolithic." He also said that the crisis served as a wake-up call about radical Islam to European countries.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pipes |first=Daniel |title=Naser Khader and Flemming Rose: Reflections on the Danish Cartoon Controversy |journal=[[Middle East Quarterly]] |date=Fall 2007 |volume=XIV |issue=4 |pages=59–66 |url=http://www.meforum.org/1758/naser-khader-and-flemming-rose-reflections-on |accessdate=18 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920205949/http://www.meforum.org/1758/naser-khader-and-flemming-rose-reflections-on |archivedate=20 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, I was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset that I could not see the greater picture. I was convinced it was a fight for my faith, Islam." Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society. To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views." A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said "It is still not OK to publish drawings of Muhammad.

In February 2015, in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris, a gunman opened fire on attendants and police officers at a meeting discussing freedom of speech with the Swedish cartoonist [[Lars Vilks]] among the panelists, and later attacked a synagogue killing two people in Copenhagen in the [[2015 Copenhagen shootings]].

Freedom of speech was guaranteed in law by the Danish Constitution of 1849, as it is today by The [[Constitution of Denmark|Constitutional Act of Denmark]] of 5 June 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jayasinghe |first=Anita May |title=The Constitutional Act of Denmark |url=http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Democracy/The_Constitutional_Act_of_Denmark.aspx |publisher=Folketinget |accessdate=29 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120170200/http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Democracy/The_Constitutional_Act_of_Denmark.aspx |archivedate=20 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Danish freedom of expression is quite far-reaching{{mdash}}even by Western European standards{{mdash}}although it is subject to some legal restrictions dealing with libel, hate speech, blasphemy and defamation.&lt;ref name=mediadem&gt;{{cite book |title=Case Study Report: Does media policy promote media freedom and independence?

=== Islamic tradition ===

==== Aniconism ====
[[File:Mohammed kaaba 1315.jpg|160px|thumb|left|Muhammad rededicating the [[Kaaba]] [[Black Stone]]. Found in the [[Jami' al-tawarikh]] by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid Al-Din]], at the [[University of Edinburgh]] library; [[Circa|c.]] 1315.]]
{{Main|Aniconism in Islam|Depictions of Muhammad}}

The [[Qur'an]] condemns idolatry, and this has led some Islamic scholars to interpret it as prohibiting figurative representation; this is known as [[aniconism]]. However, since Islam has many centres of religious authority, opinion and tradition about this is not uniform.&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;{{cite book |last=Esposito |first=John L. |title=What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-979413-3 |pages=14–15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnN6wvw8zVQC&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506193700/https://books.google.com/books?id=xnN6wvw8zVQC&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=6 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In popular practice today there is no general injunction against pictorial representation of people outside of religious contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Klausen 2009. p.&amp;nbsp;139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, images of Muhammad have been prohibited throughout history. In practice, images of Muhammad have been made on many occasions, generally in a restricted and socially regulated way; for example, they are often stylised or do not show Muhammad's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Muhammad: A Very Short Introduction |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-151027-0 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9JafXLrLiwYC&amp;pg=PT105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Brown |first=Jonathan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502081332/https://books.google.com/books?id=9JafXLrLiwYC&amp;pg=PT105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Muslim communities, views about pictorial representations have varied: [[Shi'a Islam]] has been generally tolerant of pictorial representations of human figures while [[Sunni Islam]] generally forbids any pictorial representation of living beings, albeit with some variation in practice outside a religious context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Voices of Islam |year=2007 |publisher=Praeger Publishers |isbn=0-275-98732-9 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RNTAHx95RqQC&amp;pg=PA29 |first=Titus |last=Burckhardt |editor=Vincent J.

==== Insulting Muhammad ====
In Muslim societies, insulting Muhammad is considered one of the gravest of all crimes. According to Ana Belen Soage of the [[University of Granada]], "The Islamic sharî'a has traditionally considered blasphemy punishable by death, although modern Muslim thinkers such as [[Mohammad Hashim Kamali]] maintain that, given that the Quran does not prescribe a punishment, determining a penalty is left to the judicial authorities of the day."&lt;ref name=Soage&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soage |first=Ana Belen |title=The Danish Caricatures Seen from the Arab World |journal=Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions |year=2006 |volume=7 |series=3 |pages=363–369 |doi=10.1080/14690760600819523 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Quran itself, "God often instructs Muhammad to be patient to those who insult him and, according to historical records, no action was taken against them during his years in Mecca." &lt;ref name=Soage /&gt; Many Muslims said their anti-cartoon stance is against insulting pictures and not so much as against pictures in general.

Peter Hervik said that the cartoon controversy must be seen in the context of an increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002.&lt;ref name=Hervik&gt;{{cite book |last=Hervik |first=Peter |title=The Annoying Difference: The Emergence of Danish Neonationalism, Neoracism, and Populism in the Post-1989 World |year=2011 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=978-0-85745-100-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BivtnsLX5FgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hervik said these themes are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that ''Jyllands-Posten'' and the Danish government were innocent victims in a dispute over freedom of speech inaccurate.&lt;ref name=Hervik /&gt; Against this background, Danish Muslims were particularly offended by the cartoons because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not respect their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Müller |first=Marion G. |last2=Özcan |first2=Esra |title=The Political Iconography of Muhammad Cartoons: Understanding Cultural Conflict and Political Action |journal=PS: Political Science and Politics |date=April 2007 |volume=40 |series=2 |doi=10.1017/S104909650707045X |at=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|the solicitation and publication of the ʻMuhammad cartoonsʼ was part of a long and carefully orchestrated campaign by the conservative ''Jyllands-Posten'' (also known in Denmark as Jyllands-Pesten – the plague from Jutland), in which it backed the centre-right Venstre party of Prime Minister Fogh Rasmussen in its successful bid for power in 2001.

Danish Muslim politician Naser Khader said, "Muslims are no more discriminated against in Denmark than they are elsewhere in Europe&amp;nbsp;... Generally, Danes give you a fair shake. They accept Muslims if you declare that you are loyal to this society, to democracy. If you say that you are one of them, they will accept you. If you have reservations, they will worry."&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview /&gt; His concern has centred on the power of "Islamism" or fundamentalist political Islam in Denmark's Muslim community which he has tried to fight, especially in the wake of the controversy by forming an association of democratic, moderate Muslims.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview /&gt;

==== Relationship between the West and Muslims ====
{{Main|Islam in Europe|Multiculturalism}}

The incident occurred at a time of unusually strained relations between the Muslim world and the West. This was a result of decades of Muslim immigration to Europe, recent political struggles, violent incidents such as September 11 and a string of Islamist terrorist attacks and Western interventions in Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cowell |first=Alan |title=West Beginning to See Islamic Protests as Sign of Deep Gulf |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/international/europe/08islam.html?ref=danishcartooncontroversy&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=21 March 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=8 February 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107223659/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/international/europe/08islam.html?ref=danishcartooncontroversy&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=7 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoons were used as a tool by different political interests in a wide variety of local and international situations. Some debate surrounded the relationship between Islamic minorities and their broader societies, and the legal and moral limits that the press should observe when commenting on that minority or any religious minority group.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===== Cartoons as a political tool in the West =====

Some commentators see the publications of the cartoons as part of a deliberate effort to show Muslims and Islam in a bad light, thus influencing public opinion in the West in aid of various political projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 March 2006 |title=Islam and globanalisation |newspaper=Al-Ahram |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/787/cu4.htm |last=Dabashi |first=Hamid |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625133913/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/787/cu4.htm |archivedate=25 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Andrew Mueller wrote, "I am concerned that the ridiculous, disproportionate reaction to some unfunny sketches in an obscure Scandinavian newspaper may confirm that&amp;nbsp;...

{{quote|the critique of 'Muslim fundamentalism' has become a cornerstone in the definition of European identities. As well as replacing anti-communism as the rallying point for a broad 'democratic consensus' (and, in this shift, remaking this consensus), the critique of Islamic fundamentalism has also become a conduit for imagining Europe as a moral community beyond the nation. It has emerged as a banner under which the most diverse sectors of society can unite in the name of 'European' values.}}

===== Racism and ignorance =====

One controversy that arose around the cartoons was the question of whether they were racist.&lt;ref name="Modood Hansen Bleich OLeary 2006 pp. 7–16"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Modood |first=Tariq |last2=Hansen |first2=Randall |last3=Bleich |first3=Erik |last4=O'Leary |first4=Brendan |last5=Carens |first5=Joseph H. |title=The Danish Cartoon Affair: Free Speech, Racism, Islamism, and Integration |at=The Danish Cartoon Controversy: A Defence of Liberal Freedom |journal=International Migration |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |volume=44 |issue=5 |year=2006 |issn=0020-7985 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2435.2006.00386.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (UNCHR) [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] "on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance", [[Doudou Diène]], saw xenophobia and racism in Europe as the root of the controversy, and partly criticised the government of Denmark for inaction after the publication of the cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=13 February 2006 |title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance on the situation of Muslim and Arab peoples in various parts of the world (E/CN.4/2006/17) |first=Doudou |last=Diène |publisher=UNCHR |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/sessions/62/listdocs.htm |quote=Politically and from the standpoint of the morality of international relations, the Danish Government, against the backdrop of an alarming resurgence of defamation of religions, especially Islamophobia but also anti-Semitism and Christianophobia, failed to show the commitment and vigilance that it normally displays in combating religious intolerance and incitement to religious hatred and promoting religious harmony. |accessdate=18 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927190308/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/sessions/62/listdocs.htm |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Aurel Sari has since said that the special rapporteur's interpretation was wrong and that "neither the decision to commission images depicting the Prophet in defiance of Islamic tradition, nor the actual content of the individual cartoons can be regarded as racist within the meaning of the relevant international human rights instruments" although "some of the more controversial pictures may nevertheless be judged 'gratuitously offensive' to the religious beliefs of Muslims in accordance with the applicable case-law of the European Court of Human Rights."

Many Muslims saw the cartoons as a sign of lack of education about Islam in Denmark and in the West. Egyptian preacher and television star [[Amr Khaled]] urged his followers to take action to remedy supposed Western ignorance, saying, "It is our duty to the prophet of God to make his message known&amp;nbsp;...

He supported calls for a UN resolution that "categorically prohibits affronts to prophets{{mdash}}to the prophets of the Lord and His messengers, to His holy books, and to the religious holy places". He also castigated governments around the world for inaction on the issue, saying, "Your silence over such crimes, which offend the Prophet of Islam and insult his great nation, is what begets violence, generates terrorism, and makes the terrorists say: Our governments are doing nothing, and we must avenge our Prophet ourselves. This is what creates terrorism and begets violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Special Dispatch No.1089: Sheikh Al-Qaradhawi Responds to Cartoons of Prophet Muhammad: Whoever is Angered and Does Not Rage in Anger is a Jackass – We are Not a Nation of Jackasses |url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/1604.htm |work=Jihad &amp; Terrorism Studies Project |publisher=[[MEMRI]] |accessdate=16 November 2012 |date=9 February 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109150258/http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/1604.htm |archivedate=9 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Relationship between the Liberal West and Islam =====

[[Francis Fukuyama]] wrote in the online magazine ''Slate'' that "while beginning with a commendable European desire to assert basic liberal values," the controversy was an alarming sign of the degree of cultural conflict between Muslim immigrant communities in Europe and their broader populations, and advocated a measured and prudent response to the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 February 2006 |last=Fukuyama |first=Francis |title=Europe vs. Radical Islam |newspaper=Slate |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2136964/ |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907121835/http://www.slate.com/id/2136964/ |archivedate=7 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Helle Rytkonen wrote in ''Danish Foreign Policy Yearbook 2007'' that most of the debate around the cartoon controversy was over-simplified as a simple matter of free speech against religion. She said that the actual dispute was more nuanced, focusing on the tone of the debate and broader context of Western-Islamic relations.&lt;ref&gt;Rytkonen 2007, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] wrote in ''Slate'' that official reaction in the West{{mdash}}particularly the United States{{mdash}}was too lenient toward the protesters and Muslim community in Denmark, and insufficiently supportive of Denmark and the right to free speech. He said, "nobody in authority can be found to state the obvious and the necessary—that we stand with the Danes against this defamation and blackmail and sabotage. Instead, all compassion and concern is apparently to be expended upon those who lit the powder trail, and who yell and scream for joy as the embassies of democracies are put to the torch in the capital cities of miserable, fly-blown dictatorships. Let's be sure we haven't hurt the vandals' ''feelings''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Stand up for Denmark! |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/stand_up_for_denmark.html |work=Slate |date=21 February 2006 |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925164659/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/stand_up_for_denmark.html |archivedate=25 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Kristol]] also wrote that the response of Western leaders, with the exception of the Danish Prime Minister, was too weak and that the issue was used as an excuse by "those who are threatened by our effort to help liberalize and civilize the Middle East" to fight back against the "assault" on radical Islamists and Middle Eastern dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kristol |first=William |title=Oh, the Anguish!

Flemming Rose said he did not expect a violent reaction, and talked about what the incident implies about the relationship between the West and the Muslim world. He said, 

{{quote|I spoke to [historian of Islam] Bernard Lewis about this, and he said that the big difference between our case and the Rushdie affair is that Rushdie is perceived as an apostate by the Muslims while, in our case, Muslims were insisting on applying Islamic law to what non-Muslims are doing in non-Muslim countries. In that sense, he said it is a kind of unique case that might indicate that Europe is perceived as some kind of intermediate state between the Muslim world and the non-Muslim world.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview /&gt;}}

==== Freedom of speech, political correctness and self-censorship ====

One of the principal lines of controversy surrounding the cartoons concerned the limits of free speech,&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Mohammed Saif-Alden Wattad, [http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2010_2/dr-mohammed-saif-alden-wattad.pdf "ISLAM, TERRORISM AND MODERN LIBERAL SOCIETIES"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=Sam Sailor |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''NUJS LAW REVIEW'', January 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; how much it should be legally or ethically constrained and whether the cartoons were an appropriate expression for a newspaper to print. The cartoons were first printed in response to the perception of some journalists at the newspaper that self-censorship was becoming a problem; the ensuing reaction did nothing to dispel that idea. Rose said: 

{{Quote|When I wrote the accompanying text to the publication of the cartoons, I said that this act was about self-censorship, not free speech. Free speech is on the books; we have the law, and nobody as yet has thought of rewriting it. This changed when the death threats were issued; it became an issue of the Sharia trumping the fundamental right of free speech.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview /&gt;}} 

Rose also highlighted what he believed to be a difference between political correctness and self-censorship{{mdash}}which he considered more dangerous. He said: 

{{Quote|There is a very important distinction to be made here between what you perceive as good behavior and a fear keeping you from doing things that you want to do&amp;nbsp;... A good example of this was the illustrator who refused to illustrate a children's book about the life of Mohammed. He is on the record in two interviews saying that he insisted on anonymity because he was afraid.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview /&gt;}}

Christopher Hitchens wrote that it is important to affirm "the right to criticize not merely Islam but religion in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Cartoon Debate: The Case for Mocking Religion |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/cartoon_debate.html |accessdate=4 October 2012 |newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=4 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010093541/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/cartoon_debate.html |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticised media outlets which did not print the cartoons while covering the story. [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] wrote that the violent reaction to the cartoons constituted a sort of [[counter-enlightenment]] which must be defended against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dahrendorf |first=Ralf |title=Today's Counter-Enlightenment |url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/today-s-counter-enlightenment |publisher=[[Project Syndicate]] |accessdate=14 November 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021074101/http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/today-s-counter-enlightenment |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sonia Mikich]] wrote in ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'', "I hereby refuse to feel badly for the chronically insulted. I refuse to argue politely why freedom of expression, reason and humour should be respected". She said that those things are part of a healthy society and that deeply held feelings or beliefs should not be exempt from commentary, and that those offended had the option of ignoring them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mikich |first=Sonia |title=What next, bearded one?

Ashwani K. Peetush of Wilfrid Laurier University wrote that in a liberal democracy freedom of speech is not absolute, and that reasonable limits are put on it such as libel, defamation and hate speech laws in almost every society to protect individuals from "devastating and direct harm". He said that the cartoons "create a social environment of conflict and intimidation for a community that already feels that its way of life is threatened. I do not see how such tactics incorporate people into the wider public and democratic sphere, as Rose argues. They have the opposite effect: the marginalised feel further marginalised and powerless." He said that it is reasonable to consider two of the cartoons as hate speech, which directly undermine a group of people (Muslims) by forming part of an established discourse linking all Muslims with terrorism and barbarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peetush |first=Ashwani K. |title=Caricaturizing Freedom: Islam, Offence, and The Danish Cartoon Controversy |journal=Studies in South Asian Film and Media |date=May 2009 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=173–188 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/safm/2009/00000001/00000001/art00010 |accessdate=15 November 2012 |doi=10.1386/safm.1.1.173_1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001221527/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/safm/2009/00000001/00000001/art00010 |archivedate=1 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, satirical magazine ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' was taken to court for publishing the cartoons; it was acquitted of charges that it incited hatred.&lt;ref name="Leveque" /&gt;  In Canada a human rights commission investigated ''[[The Western Standard]]'', a magazine which published the cartoons, but found insufficient grounds to proceed with a human rights tribunal (which does not imply criminal charges, but is a quasi-judicial, mandatory process) against the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danish cartoon complaint rejected |url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=bab36f55-6aec-43c6-a458-a49f262fbbb6&amp;sponsor= |accessdate=10 June 2013 |newspaper=National Post |date=7 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324103700/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=bab36f55-6aec-43c6-a458-a49f262fbbb6&amp;sponsor= |archivedate=24 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These government investigations of journalists catalysed debate about the role of government in censoring or prosecuting expressions they deemed potentially hateful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahn |first=Robert |title=Tragedy, Farce or Legal Mobilization?

==Entertainment career==
In 1976, Atchity founded L/A House, Inc., a consulting, translation, book, television, and film development and production company whose clients included the [[Getty Museum]] and the [[US Postal Service]]. L/A House began by extending Atchity's teaching of creative writing to manuscript consultation and soon moved on to publishing with the production of ''Follies'', a magazine covering creativity, and ''CQ:'' ''Contemporary Quarterly; Poetry and Art'' of which he was editor. In the 1980s L/A House moved into television, with a syndicated television pilot of ''BreakThrough!'' of which Atchity was executive producer and co-writer.

In 1985, L/A House began development of a set of video/TV romance film projects entitled ''[[Shades of Love (film series)|Shades of Love]]'', which became 16 full-length films, produced in 1986–87 with Atchity as executive producer, that aired throughout the world, distributed by [[Lorimar]], Astral-Bellevue-Pathe, Manson International, and [[Warner Brothers|Warner Brothers International]], nominated for Canada's [[Gemini Award]]; in the U.S. they premiered on Cinemax-HBO.

In 1989 he sold L/A House and founded AEI (Atchity Editorial/Entertainment International),&lt;ref name="aeionline1" /&gt; a literary management and motion picture production company. Chi-Li Wong,&lt;ref&gt;Chi-Li Wong IMDB [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0938995/]&lt;/ref&gt; formerly Associate Director of the Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival, joined him as AEI partner in 1992. AEI was incorporated in 1996, its name changed to Atchity Entertainment International, Inc. in 2005.

In 1996 Atchity also founded [http://www.thewriterslifeline.com/ The Writers Lifeline, Inc.]&lt;ref name="thewriterslifeline1"/&gt; (incorporated in 2002) to continue the consulting work of L/A House and to prepare intellectual property for representation: "bringing your craft and skills to the level of your vision and ambition."

In 2006, he and manager-partner Fred Griffin of Houston's Griffin Partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ]web|url=http://www.griffinpartners.com |title=griffinpartners.com |publisher=griffinpartners.com |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a group of investors from Louisiana and Texas, acquired [http://www.thelouisianawavestudio.com/index.html The Louisiana Wave Studio],&lt;ref name="thelouisianawavestudio1"/&gt; LLC in Shreveport, Louisiana from [[Walt Disney Productions]]. The LWS is the only tank specifically designed to make waves for motion pictures in North America. Films produced at the LWS include ''[[The Guardian (2006 film)|The Guardian]]'', ''Mayday—Bering Sea'', [[Shark Night 3d|''Shark Night 3D'',]] [[Streets of Blood|''Streets of Blood'',]] and [[I Love You Phillip Morris|''I Love You, Philip Morris'';]] along with numerous government and industrial films.

Responding to changes in the worlds of entertainment and publishing, in 2009 AEI shifted its energies to raising independent financing for motion pictures to advance its clients' interests. In 2011 Atchity and Wong were nominated for an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for producing ''The Kennedy Detail'' ([[Discovery Channel|Discovery]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/search/results.html?focus=site&amp;query=The+Kennedy+Detail&amp;search=+]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on their clients' Jerry Blaine and Lisa McCubbin's ''[[New York Times]]'' bestselling book by the same title published by Gallery/[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 2010. AEI's films include ''[[Joe Somebody]]'' ([[Tim Allen]], [[Julie Bowen]]), ''[[Life or Something Like It|Life Or Something Like It]]'' ([[Angelina Jolie]], [[Edward Burns]]), and ''[[The Meg|The MEG]]'' ([[Jason Statham]]).
[[File:The Messiah Matrix.jpg|thumb|A Thriller by Kenneth John Atchity]]
In 2010, Atchity also founded Atchity Productions for independent film productions, and Story Merchant&lt;ref name="storymerchant1"/&gt; for representation and strategic coaching for writers.

== ''The Messiah Matrix'' ==
In 2012, Atchity published his completion of [[William Diehl|William Diehl's]] ''Seven Ways to Die'' and his first solo novel, ''The Messiah Matrix''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newtopiamagazine.wordpress.com/2012/11/15/mongrel-patriot-review-producer-and-writer-kenneth-atchity/|title=Mongrel Patriot Review: Producer and Writer Kenneth Atchity|last=Nichols|first=Kimberly|date=Nov 15, 2012|website=Newtopia Magazine|publisher=|access-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel centers on a fictional marine archaeological find of a rare Herodian coin honoring Augustus. A romantic interest develops between the American archaeologist who has discovered the coin, and a young Jesuit priest intrigued by its implications.  A powerful faction of the Jesuits has been preparing to announce that the fictional character [[Jesus of Nazareth]] was inspired by the life of Caesar [[Augustus]], and the coin is crucial evidence for their claims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Regarding the premise of his novel, Atchity said that it is based on actual historical facts linking Jesus and Augustus.

A '''literary agent''' (sometimes ''[[publishing]] agent'', or ''writer's representative'') is an [[Agent (law)|agent]] who represents [[writer]]s and their written works to [[publisher]]s, [[theatrical producer]]s, [[film producer]]s, and [[film studio]]s, and assists in the sale and deal negotiation of the same. Literary agents most often represent [[novelist]]s, [[screenwriter]]s, and non-fiction writers. They are paid a fixed percentage (usually twenty percent on foreign sales and ten to fifteen percent for domestic sales)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfwa.org/for-authors/writer-beware/agents/|title=LITERARY AGENTS – SFWA|work=SFWA}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the proceeds of sales they negotiate on behalf of their clients.

== Advantages ==
Literary agents perform various services for authors. They connect the author's work with appropriate publishers, negotiate contracts, ensure royalty payments, and mediating problems between author and publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://howpublishingreallyworks.com/?page_id=166 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501141451/http://howpublishingreallyworks.com/?page_id=166 |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agents can help new authors get public recognition. Agents also help publishing houses and others expedite the process of review, publication, and distribution of authors' works. Many well-known, powerful, and lucrative publishing houses (such as the [[Big Five (publishers)|Big Five]]) are generally less open than smaller publishers to unrepresented submissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherylreif.com/2012/04/27/small-vs-big-six-publishers-whats-the-difference/|title=Small vs Big Six Publishers: What’s the Difference?|author=Cheryl Reif|work=Cheryl Reif Writes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A knowledgeable agent knows the market, and can be a source of valuable career advice and guidance. Being a publishable author doesn't automatically make someone an expert on modern publishing contracts and practices—especially where television, film, or foreign rights are involved.  Many authors prefer to have an agent handle such matters. This prevents straining the author's working relationship with the [[editing|editor]] with disputes about royalty statements or late checks. 

An agent can also function as an adviser, showing an author the various aspects of how to make a living writing. Literary agents often transition from jobs in other aspects of the publishing industry. Though [[self-publishing]] is becoming much more popular, literary agents still fulfill a useful role as gatekeepers to publishing houses.

== Diversity ==
Literary agencies can range in size from a single agent who represents perhaps a dozen authors, to a substantial firm with senior partners, sub-agents, specialists in areas like foreign rights or licensed merchandise tie-ins, and clients numbering in the hundreds. Most agencies, especially smaller ones, specialize to some degree. They may represent—for example—authors of science fiction, mainstream thrillers and mysteries, children's books, romance, or highly topical nonfiction. Very few agents represent short stories or poetry.

Legitimate agents and agencies in the book world are not required to be members of the Association of Authors' Representatives (AAR), but according to ''[[Writer's Market]]'' listings, many agents in the [[United States]] are. To qualify for AAR membership, agents must have sold a minimum number of books and pledge to abide by a Canon of Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaronline.org/Join|title=Association of Authors' Representatives, Inc. - Join|work=aaronline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective professional agents often learn their trade while working for another agent, though some cross over to agenting after working as editors.

== Cost ==
Legitimate agents do not charge reading or other upfront fees (e.g., retainers), or bill authors for most operating expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pred-ed.com/pubagent.htm|title=Preditors &amp; Editors|work=pred-ed.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722044734/http://pred-ed.com/pubagent.htm|archivedate=2012-07-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rachellegardner.com/2011/08/questionable-practices-by-literary-agents/|title=Questionable Practices by Literary Agents|work=Rachelle Gardner}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also do not offer to place work with a [[vanity press|vanity or subsidy press]].

== Querying ==
A client typically establishes a relationship with an agent through ''querying'', though the two may meet at a writers' conference, through a contest, or in other ways.  A query is an unsolicited proposal for representation, either for a finished work or unfinished work.  Various agents request different elements in a query packet, and most agencies list their specific submission requirement on their Website or in their listing in major directories. It typically begins with the author sending a query letter (1-2 pages) that explains the purpose of the work and any writing qualifications of the author. Some agencies want a synopsis or outline as part of the query.  Often, the author sends the first three chapters (typically around 50 pages) of their work. For paper queries, the author must include a [[self-addressed stamped envelope]] to receive a response, though email submissions are increasingly common.

If an agency rejects a written query, they send the response—typically a form letter—in the self-addressed stamped envelope.  A rejection that is not merely a form letter, or has hand-written comments (especially a message to the effect of "query me for other projects") is typically a good sign.

== Notable agents ==

The '''Lotte Lehmann Foundation''', named for the German soprano [[Lotte Lehmann]], was founded in 1999,&lt;ref name=afterlife/&gt; and served to preserve and perpetuate her legacy, and to honor her dream of bringing [[art song]] into the lives of as many people as possible. The organization was founded by Gary Hickling, a musician and expert on Lehmann. Hickling was also the founder of the Lotte Lehmann League, which currently exists as a website.&lt;ref name=league&gt;[http://www.lottelehmannleague.org Lotte Lehman League], a website which includes material on Lehmann's career&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inception and history==
Founder Gary Hickling had met [[Lotte Lehmann]] in the early 1960s when he was a [[double bass]] player at university, observing the private voice lessons Lehmann gave at Orplid, her home in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]. He later observed her [[master classes]] at the [[Music Academy of the West]], which she had helped found in 1947.

Hickling became a noted expert on Lehmann's career and work, compiling a Lehmann discography in 1987.  He continued to compile and collect material and memorabilia relating to her career, which now forms a significant part of the Lotte Lehmann Archive in Santa Barbara.  The foundation's precursor, the Lotte Lehmann League, published a newsletter from 1989 to 1994; the league was later re-established as a website in 2011.&lt;ref name=league/&gt;

Hickling founded the Lotte Lehmann Foundation in 1999.&lt;ref name=afterlife/&gt; In the early years of its existence, he was solely responsible for maintaining it.

Operations of the foundation were transferred from Hawaii, where Hickling lived, to New York City in 2003.  The composer [[Daron Hagen]] was chosen as the newly configured foundation's president, and an entirely new board of directors was chosen at that time. Mezzo soprano Linn Maxwell was elected president in 2007. Larry Smith was president beginning in 2010. Hickling retired from the foundation in 2005 and became an emeritus member of the Board of Directors.

As of 2016, the foundation is in hiatus.&lt;ref name=afterlife&gt;lottelehmannleague.org. [http://lottelehmannleague.org/about-lotte-lehmann/ll-afterlife/ Lotte Lehmann “Afterlife”]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1988, Hickling has hosted a weekly program on [[art song]]s on [[Hawaii Public Radio]], initially titled ''Great Songs'', and from 2011 titled ''Singing and Other Sins''. Information and listenable archives of the program are hosted on the Lotte Lehmann League website.

==Activities==
The Lehmann Foundation was a respected non-profit musical foundation in the United States.  Its activities included two competitions, the first of which, the internet-based CyberSing vocal competition occurred every two years and solicited recordings from singers the world over.&lt;ref&gt;lottelehmann.org. [http://www.lottelehmann.org/llf/programs/cybersing/about.html About Cybersing]&lt;/ref&gt;  Entrants submitted recordings of appropriate literature, including a song written expressly for the competition by a distinguished composer.  These songs were commissioned from composers such as [[Ned Rorem]], [[Libby Larsen]] and [[Dan Welcher]].  Winners were chosen solely on the basis of their recorded submissions.  Laureates of the 2006 competition included sopranos Debra Stanley and Danielle Talamantes and baritone Andrew Garland.

The [[ASCAP]]/Lotte Lehmann Foundation Song Cycle Competition, which occurred in alternating years with CyberSing, solicited compositions by young composers resident in or native of the United States; winners received commissions to compose individual songs or, in the case of the First Prize recipient, a song cycle.&lt;ref&gt;lottelehmann.org. [http://www.lottelehmann.org/llf/programs/ascapllf Programs]&lt;/ref&gt;  Winners of the 2005 competition included Scott Gendel and Mark Buntag.  Gendel's prize-winning commission, the [[song cycle]] ''The Space Between'' was published by E. C. Schirmer and premiered by soprano Martha Guth and pianist Bradley Moore on 24 February 2007 at the Bruno Walter Auditorium in New York under the auspices of the Joy in Singing Foundation.

VoxNova Media was another aspect of the foundation's activities.&lt;ref&gt;lottelehmann.org. [http://lottelehmann.org/llf/about/ About the Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;  The mission of this division was to produce media in a variety of forms, including audio recordings, video recordings, printed materials. VNM plan was to reissue historical audio recordings by Lehmann and her colleagues, present new recordings of contemporary vocal repertoire and of the vocal art of contemporary interpreters.

In addition to these programs and activities, the foundation presented an annual World of Song Award which alternated among composers, singers, and collaborative pianists and served to recognize those who have devoted their creative lives to this enriching form of music.&lt;ref&gt;lottelehmann.org.[http://www.lottelehmann.org/llf/programs/worldofsong "World of Song"]&lt;/ref&gt; Recipients include pianist and educator John Wustman, composers [[Dominick Argento]] and [[Ned Rorem]], pianists [[Dalton Baldwin]] and [[Graham Johnson (musician)|Graham Johnson]], tenor [[Hugues Cuénod]], mezzo soprano [[Janet Baker]], and baritone [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]]. The foundation also published ''SongScape'', a biannual newsletter edited by board member Craig Urquhart and featuring news of the foundation's activities.

The '''Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra''' ({{lang-lb|Lëtzebuerger philharmoneschen Orchester}}, {{lang-fr|Orchestre philharmonique du Luxembourg}}), abbreviated to '''OPL''', is a symphony [[orchestra]] based in [[Luxembourg City]], [[Luxembourg]].  The orchestra formerly performed at the [[Grand Théâtre de Luxembourg|Grand Théâtre de la Ville de Luxembourg]] and the [[Conservatoire de Luxembourg]].  Its current home is the [[Philharmonie Luxembourg]], a large [[concert hall]] opened in 2005 in the [[Kirchberg, Luxembourg|Kirchberg]] [[Quarters of Luxembourg City|quarter]] in the northeast of the city.

The orchestra was founded in 1933 as the in-house orchestra of [[RTL Radio]], named the ''RTL Grand Symphony Orchestra'' ({{lang-fr|Grand orchestre symphonique de RTL}}); [[Henri Pensis]] was its founder and first music director. After his initial tenure from 1933 to 1939, Pensis went into exile in the USA in the wake of [[World War II]].  He returned to Luxembourg in 1946 to resume direction of the orchestra.  After Pensis died in 1958, [[Carl Melles]] was the orchestra's music director in 1958.  [[Louis de Froment]] subsequently became music director and held the post from 1958 to 1980.  [[Leopold Hager]] succeeded de Froment in 1981, and served for 15 years to 1996.

Following the 1991 privatisation of the ''Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Radiodiffusion'', in 1995, RTL decided not to renew its contract with the orchestra.  Subsequently, the Luxembourg government established the Henri Pensis Foundation to allow for the orchestra to continue its existence.  In 1996, the orchestra acquired its current name under its new auspices.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news|author=James C. Taylor |title=The Luxembourg Philharmonic Looks to Make Its Mark Anew |url=http://www.andante.com/article/article.cfm?id=24595 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20041026045522/http://www.andante.com/article/article.cfm?id=24595 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 October 2004 |work=Andante.com |date=21 October 2004 |accessdate=23 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The orchestra's fifth music director, [[David Shallon]] suddenly died in 2000 while on tour in Japan.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;  [[Bramwell Tovey]] took over as music director in September 2002, and held the post until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Ben Mattison | title=Conductor Bramwell Tovey Extends Vancouver Symphony Tenure, Steps Down From Luxembourg Post | url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/1002.html | work=Playbill Arts | date=20 December 2004 | accessdate=23 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The OPL appointed [[Emmanuel Krivine]] as their music director starting from the 2005-2006 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Ben Mattison | title=Conductor Emmanuel Krivine to Lead Luxembourg Philharmonic | url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/3531.html | work=Playbill Arts | date=21 December 2005 | accessdate=23 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2009, Krivine extended his contract with the orchestra through the 2014-2015 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Agence France Presse | title=Emmanuel Krivine prolongé à la tête de l'orchestre du Luxembourg | url=http://tageblatt.editpress.lu/culture/15068.html | work=Tageblatt | date=18 May 2009 | accessdate=12 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Krivine concluded his OPL tenure at the end of the 2014-2015 season.

'''Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɑː|k|ˈ|t|iː|n|,_|b|ɑː|x|-}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bakhtin "Bakhtin"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ru|Михаи́л Миха́йлович Бахти́н}}, {{IPA-ru|mʲɪxɐˈil mʲɪˈxajləvʲɪtɕ bɐxˈtʲin|pron}}; {{OldStyleDate|16 November|1895|4 November}} – 7 March&lt;ref&gt;Gary Saul Morson and Caryl Emerson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BViC_wkbd4oC&amp;dq= ''Mikhail Bakhtin: Creation of a Prosaics''], Stanford University Press, 1990, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; 1975) was a [[Russian people|Russian]] [[philosopher]], [[literary critic]], [[semiotician]]&lt;ref&gt;Maranhão 1990, p.197&lt;/ref&gt; and scholar who worked on [[literary theory]], ethics, and the [[philosophy of language]]. His writings, on a variety of subjects, inspired scholars working in a number of different traditions ([[Marxism]], [[semiotics]], [[structuralism]], religious criticism) and in disciplines as diverse as literary criticism, history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology and psychology. Although Bakhtin was active in the debates on aesthetics and literature that took place in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1920s, his distinctive position did not become well known until he was rediscovered by Russian scholars in the 1960s.

== Early life ==
{{Semiotics}}
Bakhtin was born in [[Oryol]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], to an old family of the nobility. His father was the manager of a bank and worked in several cities. For this reason Bakhtin spent his early childhood years in Oryol, in [[Vilnius]], and then in [[Odessa]], where in 1913 he joined the historical and philological faculty at the local university (the [[Odessa University]]). Katerina Clark and Michael Holquist write: "Odessa..., like Vilnius, was an appropriate setting for a chapter in the life of a man who was to become the philosopher of [[heteroglossia]] and [[Carnivalesque|carnival]]. The same sense of fun and irreverence that gave birth to [[Isaak Babel|Babel]]'s Rabelaisian gangster or to the tricks and deceptions of [[Ostap Bender]], the [[picaro]] created by [[Ilf and Petrov]], left its mark on Bakhtin."&lt;ref&gt;Katerina Clark and Michael Holquist, ''Mikhail Bakhtin'' (Harvard University Press, 1984: {{ISBN|0-674-57417-6}}), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He later transferred to [[Petrograd Imperial University]] to join his brother Nikolai. It is here that Bakhtin was greatly influenced by the classicist [[Tadeusz Stefan Zieliński|F. F. Zelinsky]], whose works contain the beginnings of concepts elaborated by Bakhtin.

== Career ==
Bakhtin completed his studies in 1918. He then moved to a small city in western Russia, [[Nevel (town)|Nevel]] ([[Pskov Oblast]]), where he worked as a schoolteacher for two years. It was at that time that the first "[[Bakhtin Circle]]" formed. The group consisted of intellectuals with varying interests, but all shared a love for the discussion of literary, religious, and political topics. Included in this group were [[Valentin Voloshinov]] and, eventually, [[P. N. Medvedev]], who joined the group later in [[Vitebsk]]. Vitebsk was “a cultural centre of the region” the perfect place for Bakhtin “and other intellectuals [to organize] lectures, debates and concerts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/49580/Mikhail-Bakhtin |title=Mikhail Bakhtin (Russian philosopher and literary critic) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1975-03-07 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; German philosophy was the topic talked about most frequently and, from this point forward, Bakhtin considered himself more a philosopher than a literary scholar. It was in Nevel, also, that Bakhtin worked tirelessly on a large work concerning moral philosophy that was never published in its entirety. However, in 1919, a short section of this work was published and given the title "Art and Responsibility". This piece constitutes Bakhtin's first published work. Bakhtin relocated to Vitebsk in 1920. It was here, in 1921, that Bakhtin married Elena Aleksandrovna Okolovich. Later, in 1923, Bakhtin was diagnosed with [[osteomyelitis]], a bone disease that ultimately led to the amputation of his leg in 1938. This illness hampered his productivity and rendered him an invalid.&lt;ref name="politru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polit.ru/news/2014/11/17/bakhtin/|title=Мемория. Михаил Бахтин|publisher=polit.ru|language=Russian|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Circulo_de_bajtin_1924.JPG|thumb|left|Bakhtin Circle, Leningrad, 1924-26.]]
In 1924, Bakhtin moved to [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], where he assumed a position at the Historical Institute and provided consulting services for the State Publishing House. It is at this time that Bakhtin decided to share his work with the public, but just before "On the Question of the Methodology of Aesthetics in Written Works" was to be published, the journal in which it was to appear stopped publication. This work was eventually published 51 years later. The repression and misplacement of his manuscripts was something that would plague Bakhtin throughout his career. In 1929, "Problems of Dostoevsky’s Art", Bakhtin's first major work, was published. It is here that Bakhtin introduces the concept of [[dialogism]]. However, just as this book was introduced, on 8 December 1928, right before Voskresenie's 10th anniversary, Meyer, Bakhtin and a number of others associated with Voskresenie were apprehended by the Soviet secret police, the [[Joint State Political Directorate|OGPU]] (Hirschkop 1999: p.&amp;nbsp;168), the leaders being sentenced up to ten years in labor camps of [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]], though after an appeal to consider the state of his health his sentence was commuted to exile to [[Kazakhstan]], where he and his wife spent six years in [[Kostanay|Kustanai]] (now Kostanay), after which in 1936 they moved to [[Saransk]] (then in [[Mordovian ASSR]], now the Republic of [[Mordovia]]) where he taught at the [[Mordovian State University|Mordovian Pedagogical Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, D. J. (2013). Bakhtin reframed. London: I.B. Tauris.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encspb.ru/object/2804015084?lc=en&lt;/ref&gt;

During the six years he spent working as a book-keeper in the town of [[Kustanai]] he wrote several important essays, including "Discourse in the Novel". In 1936, living in [[Saransk]], he became an obscure figure in a provincial college, dropping out of view and teaching only occasionally. In 1937, Bakhtin moved to [[Kimry]], a town located one hundred kilometers from Moscow. Here, Bakhtin completed work on a book concerning the 18th-century German novel which was subsequently accepted by the Sovetskii Pisatel' Publishing House. However, the only copy of the manuscript disappeared during the upheaval caused by the German invasion.

After the amputation of his leg in 1938, Bakhtin's health improved and he became more prolific. In 1940, and until the end of [[World War II]], Bakhtin lived in Moscow, where he submitted a dissertation on [[François Rabelais]] to the [[Gorky Institute of World Literature]] to obtain a postgraduate title,&lt;ref&gt;Holquist ''Dialogism: Bakhtin and His World'' p.10&lt;/ref&gt; a dissertation that could not be defended until the war ended. In 1946 and 1949, the defense of this dissertation divided the scholars of Moscow into two groups: those official opponents guiding the defense, who accepted the original and unorthodox manuscript, and those other professors who were against the manuscript's acceptance. The book's earthy, anarchic topic was the cause of many arguments that ceased only when the government intervened. Ultimately, Bakhtin was denied a [[Higher doctorate|higher doctoral degree]] ([[Doctor of Sciences]]) and granted a lesser degree ([[Candidate of Sciences]], a [[research doctorate]]) by the State Accrediting Bureau. Later, Bakhtin was invited back to Saransk, where he took on the position of chair of the General Literature Department at the Mordovian Pedagogical Institute. When, in 1957, the Institute changed from a teachers' college to a university, Bakhtin became head of the Department of Russian and World Literature. In 1961, Bakhtin's deteriorating health forced him to retire, and in 1969, in search of medical attention, Bakhtin moved back to Moscow, where he lived until his death in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xxi-xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin's works and ideas gained popularity after his death, and he endured difficult conditions for much of his professional life, a time in which information was often seen as dangerous and therefore often hidden. As a result, the details provided now are often of uncertain accuracy. Also contributing to the imprecision of these details is the limited access to Russian archival information during Bakhtin's life. It is only after the archives became public that scholars realized that much of what they thought they knew about the details of Bakhtin's life was false or skewed largely by Bakhtin himself.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschkop 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works and ideas ==

=== ''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' ===
''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' was first published in the USSR in 1986 with the title ''K filosofii postupka''. The manuscript, written between 1919–1921, was found in bad condition with pages missing and sections of text that were illegible. Consequently, this philosophical essay appears today as a fragment of an unfinished work. ''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' comprises only an introduction, of which the first few pages are missing, and part one of the full text. However, Bakhtin's intentions for the work were not altogether lost, for he provided an outline in the introduction in which he stated that the essay was to contain four parts.&lt;ref&gt;Liapunov xvii&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the essay deals with the analysis of the performed acts or deeds that comprise the actual world; "the world actually experienced, and not the merely thinkable world." For the three subsequent and unfinished parts of ''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' Bakhtin states the topics he intends to discuss. He outlines that the second part will deal with aesthetic activity and the ethics of artistic creation; the third with the ethics of politics; and the fourth with religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 54&lt;/ref&gt;

''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' reveals a young Bakhtin who is in the process of developing his moral philosophy by decentralizing the work of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. This text is one of Bakhtin's early works concerning [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]] and it is here that Bakhtin lays out three claims regarding the acknowledgment of the uniqueness of one's participation in Being:
# I both actively and passively participate in Being.
# My uniqueness is given but it simultaneously exists only to the degree to which I actualize this uniqueness (in other words, it is in the performed act and deed that has yet to be achieved).
# Because I am actual and irreplaceable I must actualize my uniqueness.

Bakhtin further states: "It is in relation to the whole actual unity that my unique thought arises from my unique place in Being."&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 41&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtin deals with the concept of morality whereby he attributes the predominating legalistic notion of morality to human moral action. According to Bakhtin, the I cannot maintain neutrality toward moral and ethical demands which manifest themselves as one's voice of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschkop 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

It is here also that Bakhtin introduces an "architectonic" or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]tic model of the human psyche which consists of three components: "I-for-myself", "I-for-the-other", and "other-for-me". The I-for-myself is an unreliable source of identity, and Bakhtin argues that it is the I-for-the-other through which human beings develop a sense of identity because it serves as an amalgamation of the way in which others view me. Conversely, other-for-me describes the way in which others incorporate my perceptions of them into their own identities. Identity, as Bakhtin describes it here, does not belong merely to the individual, rather it is shared by all.&lt;ref&gt;Emerson and Morson 184-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics'': polyphony and unfinalizability &lt;!--linked from 'Fabula and syuzhet'--&gt; ===
During his time in Leningrad, Bakhtin shifted his view away from the philosophy characteristic of his early works and towards the notion of dialogue. It is at this time that he began his engagement with the work of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]. ''Problems of Dostoevsky’s Art'' is considered to be Bakhtin's seminal work, a work in which Bakhtin introduces three important concepts.

The first concept is the unfinalizable self: individual people cannot be finalized, completely understood, known, or labeled. Though it is possible to understand people and to treat them as if they are completely known, Bakhtin's conception of '''unfinalizability''' considers the possibility that a person can change, and that a person is never fully revealed or fully known in the world. Readers may find that this conception reflects the idea of the "soul"; Bakhtin had strong roots in [[Christianity]] and in the [[Neo-Kantian]] school led by [[Hermann Cohen]], both of which emphasized the importance of an individual's potentially infinite capability, worth, and the hidden soul.

Second is the idea of the relationship between the self and others, or other groups. According to Bakhtin, every person is influenced by others in an inescapably intertwined way, and consequently no voice can be said to be isolated. In an interview with the [[Novy Mir]] Editorial Staff ('Response to a Question from Novy Mir Editorial Staff'), Bakhtin once explained that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to understand, it is immensely important for the person who understands to be located outside the object of his or her creative understanding—in time, in space, in culture. For one cannot even really see one's own exterior and comprehend it as a whole, and no mirrors or photographs can help; our real exterior can be seen and understood only by other people, because they are located outside us in space, and because they are others.
~''New York Review of Books'', June 10, 1993.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, Bakhtin's philosophy greatly respected the influences of others on the self, not merely in terms of how a person comes to be, but also in how a person thinks and how a person sees him- or herself truthfully.

Third, Bakhtin found a true representation of "[[polyphony (literature)|polyphony]]" (i.e. many voices) in Dostoevsky's work. According to Dostoevsky, each character represents a voice that speaks for an individual self, distinct from others. This idea of polyphony is related to the concepts of unfinalizability and self-and-others, since it is the unfinalizability of individuals that creates true polyphony.

Bakhtin briefly outlined the polyphonic concept of truth. He criticized the assumption that, if two people disagree, at least one of them must be in error. He challenged philosophers for whom plurality of minds is accidental and superfluous. For Bakhtin, truth is not a statement, a sentence or a phrase. Instead, understanding is a number of mutually addressed, albeit contradictory and logically inconsistent, statements. Understanding needs a multitude of carrying voices. It cannot be held within a single mind, or be expressed by "a single mouth". The polyphonic truth requires many simultaneous voices. Bakhtin does not mean to say that many voices carry partial truths that complement each other. A number of different voices do not make the truth if simply "averaged" or "synthesized". Rather, it is the fact of mutual addressivity, of engagement, and of commitment to the context of a real-life event, that distinguishes understanding from misunderstanding.

After Bakhtin's ''Problems of Dostoevsky’s Art (1929)'' was translated into English and published in the West, a chapter on the concept of "carnival" was added to the book which was published with the slightly different title, ''Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics (1984)''. According to Bakhtin, ''carnival'' is the context in which distinct individual voices are heard, flourish and interact together. The carnival creates the "threshold" situations where regular conventions are broken or reversed and genuine dialogue becomes possible. The notion of a carnival was Bakhtin's way of describing Dostoevsky's polyphonic style: each individual character is strongly defined, and at the same time the reader witnesses the critical influence of each character upon the other. That is to say, the voices of others are heard by each individual, and each inescapably shapes the character of the other.

=== ''Rabelais and His World'': carnival and grotesque ===
{{Main article|Rabelais and His World}}
During World War II Bakhtin submitted a dissertation on the French Renaissance writer [[François Rabelais]] which was not defended until some years later. The controversial ideas discussed within the work caused much disagreement, and it was consequently decided that Bakhtin be denied his [[higher doctorate]]. Thus, due to its content, ''Rabelais and Folk Culture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance'' was not published until 1965, at which time it was given the title ''[[Rabelais and His World]]''&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xxv&lt;/ref&gt; (Russian: Творчество Франсуа Рабле и народная культура средневековья и Ренессанса, ''Tvorčestvo Fransua Rable i narodnaja kul'tura srednevekov'ja i Renessansa'').
	
In ''Rabelais and His World'', a classic of Renaissance studies, Bakhtin concerns himself with the openness of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel''; however, the book itself also serves as an example of such openness. Throughout the text, Bakhtin attempts two things: he seeks to recover sections of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'' that, in the past, were either ignored or suppressed, and conducts an analysis of the [[Renaissance]] social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language that was not. It is by means of this analysis that Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts: the first is ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]) which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and the second is ''[[grotesque body|grotesque realism]]'' which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body and the material bodily lower stratum.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 297-299&lt;/ref&gt;

In his chapter on the history of laughter, Bakhtin advances the notion of its therapeutic and liberating force, arguing that "laughing truth ... degraded power".&lt;ref&gt;Iswolsky 1965, p. 92f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Dialogic Imagination'': chronotope and heteroglossia &lt;!--linked from 'Fabula and syuzhet'--&gt; ===
''The Dialogic Imagination'' (first published as a whole in 1975) is a compilation of four essays concerning language and the essay: "[[Epic and Novel]]" (1941), "From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse" (1940), "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel" (1937–1938), and "Discourse in the Novel" (1934–1935). It is through the essays contained within ''The Dialogic Imagination'' that Bakhtin introduces the concepts of ''[[heteroglossia]]'', ''[[dialogism]]'' and ''[[chronotope]]'', making a significant contribution to the realm of literary scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtin explains the generation of meaning through the "primacy of context over text" (heteroglossia), the hybrid nature of language ([[polyglossia]]) and the relation between [[utterance]]s ([[intertextuality]]).&lt;ref&gt;Maranhão 1990, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wertsch98"&gt;[[James V. Wertsch]] (1998) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=73Vv7Y3vf14C Mind As Action]''&lt;/ref&gt; Heteroglossia is "the base condition governing the operation of meaning in any [[utterance]]."&lt;ref name="Wertsch98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holquist and Emerson 1981, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; To make an utterance means to "appropriate the words of others and populate them with one's own intention."&lt;ref name="Wertsch98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtin's deep insights on dialogicality represent a substantive shift from views on the nature of language and knowledge by major thinkers such as [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;Holquist, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bakcult8"&gt;{{citation|last1=Hirschkop|first1=Ken|last2=Shepherd|first2=David G|title=Bakhtin and cultural theory|page=8|isbn=978-0-7190-2615-7|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|year=1989|accessdate=2011-04-26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCO8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Bakhtin%20Saussure%20Kant&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}} Unlike Kant, Bakhtin positions aesthetic activity and experience over abstraction. Bakhtin also clashes with Saussure's view of "langue is a 'social fact'", since Bakhtin views Saussure's society as a "disturbing homogenous collective"&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Epic and Novel", Bakhtin demonstrates the novel's distinct nature by contrasting it with the [[Epic poetry|epic]]. By doing so, Bakhtin shows that the novel is well-suited to the post-industrial civilization in which we live because it flourishes on diversity. It is this same diversity that the epic attempts to eliminate from the world. According to Bakhtin, the novel as a genre is unique in that it is able to embrace, ingest, and devour other genres while still maintaining its status as a novel. Other genres, however, cannot emulate the novel without damaging their own distinct identity.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

"From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse" is a less traditional essay in which Bakhtin reveals how various different texts from the past have ultimately come together to form the modern novel.&lt;ref name="Holquist81xxxiii"&gt;Holquist 1981, p. xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

"Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel" introduces Bakhtin's concept of [[chronotope]]. This essay applies the concept in order to further demonstrate the distinctive quality of the novel.&lt;ref name="Holquist81xxxiii" /&gt; The word ''chronotope'' literally means "time space" (a concept he refers to that of Einstein) and is defined by Bakhtin as "the intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature."&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 84&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of his writing, an author must create entire worlds and, in doing so, is forced to make use of the organizing categories of the real world in which he lives. For this reason ''chronotope'' is a concept that engages reality.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 278&lt;/ref&gt;

The final essay, "Discourse in the Novel", is one of Bakhtin's most complete statements concerning his philosophy of language. It is here that Bakhtin provides a model for a history of discourse and introduces the concept of heteroglossia.&lt;ref name="Holquist81xxxiii" /&gt; The term ''heteroglossia'' refers to the qualities of a language that are extralinguistic, but common to all languages. These include qualities such as perspective, evaluation, and ideological positioning. In this way most languages are incapable of neutrality, for every word is inextricably bound to the context in which it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Speech Genres and Other Late Essays'' ===
In ''Speech Genres and Other Late Essays'' Bakhtin moves away from the novel and concerns himself with the problems of method and the nature of culture. There are six essays that comprise this compilation: "Response to a Question from the ''Novy Mir'' Editorial Staff", "The ''Bildungsroman'' and Its Significance in the History of Realism", "The Problem of Speech Genres", "The Problem of the Text in Linguistics, Philology, and the Human Sciences: An Experiment in Philosophical Analysis", "From Notes Made in 1970-71," and "Toward a Methodology for the Human Sciences."

"Response to a Question from the ''Novy Mir'' Editorial Staff" is a transcript of comments made by Bakhtin to a reporter from a monthly journal called ''[[Novy Mir]]'' that was widely read by Soviet intellectuals. The transcript expresses Bakhtin's opinion of literary scholarship whereby he highlights some of its shortcomings and makes suggestions for improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' and Its Significance in the History of [[Literary realism|Realism]]" is a fragment from one of Bakhtin's lost books. The publishing house to which Bakhtin had submitted the full manuscript was blown up during the German invasion and Bakhtin was in possession of only the prospectus. However, due to a shortage of paper, Bakhtin began using this remaining section to roll cigarettes. So only a portion of the opening section remains. This remaining section deals primarily with [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Problem of Speech [[Genre]]s" deals with the difference between Saussurean [[linguistics]] and language as a living dialogue (translinguistics). In a relatively short space, this essay takes up a topic about which Bakhtin had planned to write a book, making the essay a rather dense and complex read. It is here that Bakhtin distinguishes between literary and everyday language. According to Bakhtin, genres exist not merely in language, but rather in communication. In dealing with genres, Bakhtin indicates that they have been studied only within the realm of [[rhetoric]] and [[literature]], but each discipline draws largely on genres that exist outside both rhetoric and literature. These extraliterary genres have remained largely unexplored. Bakhtin makes the distinction between primary genres and secondary genres, whereby primary genres legislate those words, phrases, and expressions that are acceptable in everyday life, and secondary genres are characterized by various types of text such as legal, scientific, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Problem of the Text in Linguistics, Philology, and the Human Sciences: An Experiment in Philosophical Analysis" is a compilation of the thoughts Bakhtin recorded in his notebooks. These notes focus mostly on the problems of the text, but various other sections of the paper discuss topics he has taken up elsewhere, such as speech genres, the status of the author, and the distinct nature of the human sciences. However, "The Problem of the Text" deals primarily with dialogue and the way in which a text relates to its context. Speakers, Bakhtin claims, shape an utterance according to three variables: the object of discourse, the immediate addressee, and a ''superaddressee''. This is what Bakhtin describes as the tertiary nature of dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xvii-xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

"From Notes Made in 1970-71" appears also as a collection of fragments extracted from notebooks Bakhtin kept during the years of 1970 and 1971. It is here that Bakhtin discusses interpretation and its endless possibilities. According to Bakhtin, humans have a habit of making narrow interpretations, but such limited interpretations only serve to weaken the richness of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final essay, "Toward a Methodology for the Human Sciences", originates from notes Bakhtin wrote during the mid-seventies and is the last piece of writing Bakhtin produced before he died. In this essay he makes a distinction between dialectic and dialogics and comments on the difference between the text and the aesthetic object. It is here also, that Bakhtin differentiates himself from the [[Formalism (literature)|Formalists]], who, he felt, underestimated the importance of content while oversimplifying change, and the [[Structuralism|Structuralists]], who too rigidly adhered to the concept of "code."&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xx-xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disputed texts ==
Some of the works which bear the names of Bakhtin's close friends [[V. N. Vološinov]] and [[P. N. Medvedev]] have been attributed to Bakhtin – particularly ''Marxism and Philosophy of Language'' and ''The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship''. These claims originated in the early 1970s and received their earliest full articulation in English in Clark and Holquist's 1984 biography of Bakhtin. In the years since then, however, most scholars have come to agree that Vološinov and Medvedev ought to be considered the true authors of these works. Although Bakhtin undoubtedly influenced these scholars and may even have had a hand in composing the works attributed to them, it now seems clear that if it was necessary to attribute authorship of these works to one person, Vološinov and Medvedev respectively should receive credit.&lt;ref&gt;Bota and Bronckart.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bakhtin had a difficult life and career, and few of his works were published in an authoritative form during his lifetime.&lt;ref name="Brandist The Bakhtin Circle, 1-26"&gt;Brandist ''The Bakhtin Circle'', 1-26&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there is substantial disagreement over matters that are normally taken for granted: in which discipline he worked (was he a philosopher or literary critic?), how to periodize his work, and even which texts he wrote (see below). He is known for a series of concepts that have been used and adapted in a number of disciplines: [[dialogic|dialogism]], the [[carnivalesque]], the chronotope, heteroglossia and "outsidedness" (the English translation of a Russian term ''vnenakhodimost,'' sometimes rendered into English—from French rather than from Russian—as "exotopy"). Together these concepts outline a distinctive philosophy of language and culture that has at its center the claims that all discourse is in essence a dialogical exchange and that this endows all language with a particular ethical or ethico-political force.

== Legacy ==

As a literary theorist, Bakhtin is associated with the [[Russian Formalists]], and his work is compared with that of [[Yuri Lotman]]; in 1963 [[Roman Jakobson]] mentioned him as one of the few intelligent critics of Formalism.&lt;ref name="Holquist Dialogism, p.183"&gt;Holquist ''Dialogism'', p.183&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, Bakhtin's work tended to focus on ethics and aesthetics in general. Early pieces such as ''Towards a Philosophy of the Act'' and ''Author and Hero in Aesthetic Activity'' are indebted to the philosophical trends of the time—particularly the Marburg School [[Neo-Kantianism]] of Hermann Cohen, including [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Max Scheler]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Nicolai Hartmann]]. Bakhtin began to be discovered by scholars in 1963,&lt;ref name="Holquist Dialogism, p.183"/&gt; but it was only after his death in 1975 that authors such as [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Tzvetan Todorov]] brought Bakhtin to the attention of the Francophone world, and from there his popularity in the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other countries continued to grow. In the late 1980s, Bakhtin's work experienced a surge of popularity in the West.

Bakhtin's primary works include ''Toward a Philosophy of the Act,'' an unfinished portion of a philosophical essay; ''Problems of Dostoyevsky’s Art,'' to which Bakhtin later added a chapter on the concept of carnival and published with the title ''Problems of Dostoyevsky’s Poetics''; ''Rabelais and His World,'' which explores the openness of the Rabelaisian novel; ''The Dialogic Imagination,'' whereby the four essays that comprise the work introduce the concepts of dialogism, heteroglossia, and chronotope; and ''Speech Genres and Other Late Essays,'' a collection of essays in which Bakhtin concerns himself with method and culture.

In the 1920s there was a "Bakhtin school" in Russia, in line with the [[discourse]] analysis of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Roman Jakobson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Ludwig Berger]] ''Redeeming Laughter: The Comic Dimension of Human Experience'' (1997) p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence ===
He is known today for his interest in a wide variety of subjects, ideas, vocabularies, and periods, as well as his use of authorial disguises, and for his influence (alongside [[György Lukács]]) on the growth of Western scholarship on the novel as a premiere literary genre. As a result of the breadth of topics with which he dealt, Bakhtin has influenced such Western schools of theory as [[Neo-Marxism]], [[Structuralism]], [[Social constructionism]], and [[Semiotics]]. Bakhtin's works have also been useful in anthropology, especially theories of ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, David  and Eric K. Silverman (2005) "Dialogics of the Body: The Moral and the Grotesque in Two Sepik River Societies." ''Journal of Ritual Studies'' 19 (2) 17-52.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his influence on such groups has, somewhat paradoxically, resulted in narrowing the scope of Bakhtin's work. According to Clark and Holquist, rarely do those who incorporate Bakhtin's ideas into theories of their own appreciate his work in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bakhtin is traditionally seen as a literary critic, there can be no denying his impact on the realm of [[Rhetorical|rhetorical theory]]. Among his many theories and ideas Bakhtin indicates that style is a developmental process, occurring both within the user of language and language itself. His work instills in the reader an awareness of tone and expression that arises from the careful formation of verbal phrasing. By means of his writing, Bakhtin has enriched the experience of verbal and written expression which ultimately aids the formal teaching of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some even suggest that Bakhtin introduces a new meaning to rhetoric because of his tendency to reject the separation of language and ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Klancher 24.&lt;/ref&gt; As Leslie Baxter explains, for Bakhtin, “Because all language use is riddled with multiple voices (to be understood more generally as discourses, ideologies, perspectives, or themes), meaning-making in general can be understood as the interplay of those voices.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|title=Communication as...: Perspectives on theory|year=2006|publisher=SAGE|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bakhtin and communication studies ===
Bakhtin's communication legacy reaches beyond rhetoric, social constructionism and semiotics as he has been called "the philosopher of human communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Danow|first=David|title=The Thought of Mikhail Bakhtin: From Word to Culture.|year=1991|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bakhtin “concentrates heavily on language and its general use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gary|first=Kim|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: The philosopher of human communication|journal=The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–62 [54]|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=totem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Baxter observes: “Communication scholars have much to gain from conversing with Bakhtin’s dialogism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|title=Voicing relationships: A dialogic perspective|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publishing, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim argues that “theories of human communication through verbal dialogue or literary representations” such as the ones Bakhtin studied “will apply to virtually every academic discipline in the human sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Gary|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: The philosopher of human communication" (54). |journal=The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–62|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=totem}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bakhtin's theories on dialogism influence interpersonal communication research, and "dialogism represents a methodological turn towards the messy reality of communication, in all its many language forms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=E.J.|title=Bakhtinian dialogism: A philosophical and methodological route to dialogue and difference?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/E_White/publication/242580201_Bakhtinian_dialogism_A_philosophical_and_methodological_route_to_dialogue_and_difference/links/559a66b808ae99aa62ccb40f/Bakhtinian-dialogism-A-philosophical-and-methodological-route-to-dialogue-and-difference.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to understand Bakhtin as a communication scholar one must take all forms of communication into account. While Bakhtin's works focused primarily on text, interpersonal communication is also key, especially when the two are related in terms of culture. Kim states that “culture as [[Clifford Geertz|Geertz]] and Bakhtin allude to can be generally transmitted through communication or reciprocal interaction such as a dialogue.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Gary|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: The philosopher of human communication.|journal=The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–62 [54]|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=totem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interpersonal communication ====
“Any concrete [[utterance]] is a link in the chain of speech communication of a particular sphere. The very boundaries of the utterance are determined by a change of speech subjects. Utterances are not indifferent to one another, and are not self-sufficient; they are aware of and mutually reflect one another... Every utterance must be regarded as primarily a response to preceding utterances of the given sphere (we understand the word ‘response’ here in the broadest sense). Each utterance refutes affirms, supplements, and relies upon the others, presupposes them to be known, and somehow takes them into account... Therefore, each kind of utterance is filled with various kinds of responsive reactions to other utterances of the given sphere of speech communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=Mikhail|title=Speech genres and other late essays|year=1986|publisher=University of Austin|location=Texas|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is reminiscent of the inter-personal theory of communication [[turn-taking]]. This means that every utterance is related to another utterance, true to turn-taking in which the conversational norms are followed in order for a conversation to have a cohesive flow in which individuals respond to one another. If, for example, an utterance does not pertain to a previous utterance then a conversation is not occurring. However, the utterance will likely pertain to an utterance that the individual once heard- meaning it is, in fact, interrelated, just not in the context of that particular conversation. As Kim explains, “the entire world can be viewed as [[wikt:polyglossic|polyglossic]] or multi-voiced since every individual possesses their own unique world view which must be taken into consideration through dialogical interaction."&lt;ref name="autogenerated54"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Gary|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: The philosopher of human communication|journal=The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–62 [54]|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=totem}}&lt;/ref&gt; This world view must be considered when a conversation is occurring in order to better understand its cultural and communicative significance.

==== Communication and culture ====
“Bakhtin’s life work can be understood as a critique of the monologization of the human experience that he perceived in the dominant linguistic, literary, philosophical, and political theories of his time."&lt;ref name="baxter102"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|title=Communication as...:Perspectives on theory|year=2006|publisher=SAGE Publishing, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  True to his roots of social constructionism and post-modernism Bakhtin “was critical of efforts to reduce the unfinalizable, open, and multivocal process of meaning-making in determinate, closed, totalizing ways."&lt;ref name="baxter102"/&gt; According to Bakhtin, the meaning found in any dialogue is unique to the sender and recipient based upon their personal understanding of the world as influenced by the socio-cultural background. “Bakhtin’s dialogism opens up space for communication scholars to conceive of difference in new ways” meaning they must take the background of a subject into consideration when conducting research into their understanding of any text as “a dialogic perspective argues that difference (of all kinds) is basic to the human experience."&lt;ref name="baxter102"/&gt; Kim argues that “his ideas of art as a vehicle oriented towards interaction with its audience in order to express or communicate any sort of intention is reminiscent of [[Clifford Geertz]]’s theories on culture."&lt;ref name="autogenerated54"/&gt; Culture and communication become inextricably linked to one another as one's understanding, according to Bakhtin, of a given utterance, text, or message, is contingent upon their culture background and experience.

==== Carnivalesque and communication ====
Sheckels contends that "what [... Bakhtin] terms the ‘carnivalesque’ is tied to the body and the public exhibition of its more private functions [...] it served also as a communication event [...] anti-authority communication events [...] can also be deemed ‘carnivalesque’.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheckels|first=T.F.|title=Maryland politics and political communication: 1950-2005|year=2006|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, MD|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Essentially, the act of turning society around through communication, whether it be in the form of text, protest, or otherwise serves as a communicative form of carnival, according to Bakhtin. Steele furthers the idea of carnivalesque in communication as she argues that it is found in corporate communication. Steele states “that ritualized sales meetings, annual employee picnics, retirement roasts and similar corporate events fit the category of carnival.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=M.B.|title=Corporate communication: Theory and Practice|year=1994|publisher=SUNY|location=Albany|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnival cannot help but be linked to communication and culture as Steele points out that “in addition to qualities of inversion, ambivalence, and excess, carnival’s themes typically include a fascination with the body, particularly its little-glorified or 'lower strata' parts, and dichotomies between ‘high’ or ‘low’.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=M.B.|title=Corporate communication: Theory and Practice|year=1994|publisher=SUNY|location=Albany|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high and low binary is particularly relevant in communication as certain verbiage is considered high, while slang is considered low. Moreover, much of popular communication including television shows, books, and movies fall into high and low brow categories. This is particularly prevalent in Bakhtin's native Russia, where postmodernist writers such as [[Boris Akunin]] have worked to change low brow communication forms (such as the mystery novel) into higher literary works of art by making constant references to one of Bakhtin's favorite subjects, [[Dostoyevsky]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5109">The '''Moscow State Jewish Theater'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moscovery.com/shalom-moscow-jewish-theatre/|title=History of the Jewish Theatre in Moscow (in English)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ru|Московский '''Гос'''ударственный '''Е'''врейский '''Т'''еатр}}), also known by its [[acronym]] '''GOSET''' (ГОСЕТ), was a [[Yiddish theater]] company established in 1919 and shut down in 1948 by the [[USSR|Soviet]] authorities.

It was founded by [[Alexis Granowsky|Alexander Granowsky]] as the Jewish Theater Workshop, in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Riss, Heidelore (2000). ''Ansätze zu einer Geschichte des jüdischen Theaters in Berlin 1889-1936''. Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang. p.&amp;nbsp;154.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, when Granowsky's theater was taken over by the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment, it relocated to Moscow, and became the Moscow State Jewish Theater.&lt;ref name="Veidlinger-YIVO"&gt;Veidlinger, Jeffrey (September&amp;nbsp;3, 2010). "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Moscow_State_Yiddish_Theater Moscow State Yiddish Theater]." ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. Retrieved 2017-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; It early on attracted [[Solomon Mikhoels]], who eventually became the leading actor and, in 1928, its director. The design of GOSET's foyer, as well as decorations sets and costumes for its first production, were done by [[Marc Chagall]].

The theater's repertoire included adaptations of [[Sholom Aleichem]], such as ''[[Tevye|Tevye the Milkman]]'' (also adopted in the West as ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''), and of [[Avrom Goldfaden]], such as ''Bar Kokhba'', as well as works by contemporary Soviet Yiddish writers, such as [[Perets Markish]] and [[Dovid Bergelson]].  The theater also performed [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' to great acclaim. Many of the theater's plays were ostensibly supportive of the Soviet state, but closer readings suggest that they actually contained veiled critiques of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s regime.

In January 1948, Mikhoels was murdered by the [[MVD]], and his death was made to look like a car accident. Months later the theater was shut down, and the members of the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] (also headed by Mikhoels) were arrested. At least thirteen prominent Soviet Yiddish writers were executed on August 12, 1952 in the event known as "The [[Night of the Murdered Poets]]" ("Ночь казненных поэтов").

{{nihongo|'''''Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba'''''|蒙古襲来絵詞|Illustrated Account of the Mongol Invasion}} is a set of two [[Japan]]ese illustrated handscrolls (''[[emakimono]]'') composed between 1275 and 1293.  They were commissioned by the [[samurai]] [[Takezaki Suenaga]] in order to record his battlefield valor and deeds during the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]].

The author and artist are unknown.  The scrolls show images of battles between the Mongol invaders and Japanese defenders on land and on the seas. Pictures are occasionally truncated by accompanying text. Several versions of the scrolls exist: the original 13th-century version, an 18th-century copy, a hand-drawn copy by [[Fukuda Taika]] dating from the 19th century, and a 21st-century reconstruction. The original is currently stored at the [[Museum of the Imperial Collections]] in [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]].

The '''Oregon Vortex''' is a [[roadside attraction]] located in [[Gold Hill, Oregon|Gold Hill]], [[Oregon]], in the [[United States]]. It consists of a number of interesting effects, which are [[gravity hill]] [[optical illusion]]s, {{citation needed|reason = where is the source for this? |date=July 2016}} but which the attraction's proprietors propose are the result of [[paranormal]] properties of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Haunted Places: The National Directory : A Guidebook to Ghostly Abodes, Sacred Sites, UFO Landings, and Other Supernatural Locations|author=Hauck, Dennis|publisher=Penguin|year=1996|page=344|isbn= 978-0-14200-234-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at {{coord|42.49313|-123.085113|source:googlemaps_region:US-OR|display=inline,title}}. &lt;!-- geocoded street address and centered on entrance --&gt;

== Background ==
Prior to any construction of the area, local legend had it that Native Americans in the area referred to the site as a "forbidden" land, and travelers passing through would often find their horses refusing to go through the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Haunted Oregon: Ghosts and Strange Phenomena of the Beaver State|author=Weeks, Andy|pages=59–61|publisher=Stackpole Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gold assay office was built in the area in 1904, which slid from its foundation in the early teens, coming to rest at an odd angle. Odd angles seem to create an illusion of objects seemingly rolling uphill. The same effect can be seen in The [[Montana]] Vortex and house of mystery, [[Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania's]] [[Laurel Caverns]], and at [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[California]]'s [[Mystery Spot]].  
Oregon Vortex is also famous for "height change" as the apparent relative height of two people varies, depending on where each stands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonvortex.com/photographs-northend.htm Oregon Vortex official website.] Retrieved December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Most people{{Who?|date=April 2016}} believe that this effect is due to a distorted background that induces a [[forced perspective]], as with an [[Ames room]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randi.org/jr/101003.html Oregon No-Vortex] Retrieved December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but this has been ruled out by taking readings with a stick.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} The Oregon site also appears to exhibit phenomena similar to those perceived by visitors at the mystery spot located outside St. Ignace in the upper peninsula of Michigan.

== In popular culture ==
* The site was investigated on a second season episode of the [[SyFy]] [[reality show]] ''[[Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files]]'', and although there seemed to be a small debate between the show's investigators over the "height change" phenomenon, they ultimately concluded that overall, all of the effects demonstrated were optical illusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/2012/06/fact_or_faked_paranormal_files.html|work=Oregon Live|title='Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files' investigates Oregon Vortex: Optical illusions or unexplained mysteries?|author=Butler, Grant|date=June 20, 2012|accessdate=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was also mentioned on [[Supernatural (season 3)#ep55|season 3, episode 11 ("Mystery Spot")]], of [[The CW|The CW's]] ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' by [[Jared Padalecki|Jared Padalecki's]] character, Sam Winchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=Supernatural|season=3|episode=11|network=The CW}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is alluded to by one of the places that can be visited in the game ''[[Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road]]''. One of the locations that can be visited in the game is called Mystery Vortex and is located roughly at the position of the Oregon Vortex on the in-game map of the United States.
* In ''[[The X-Files]]'' an "Oregon Vortex" is mentioned during the season seven episode number five "Rush".
* The Mystery Shack in the Disney TV show ''[[Gravity Falls]]'' was modeled after the Oregon Vortex.{{fact|date=July 2018}}
* On their Season 15 premiere episode of ''[[Ghost Adventures]]'', "Golden Ghost Town", the Ghost Adventures Crew visited the location in order to ask why rituals are happening in the forests surrounding the [[Golden, Oregon|Golden]] area and by extension, near the vortex and get an understanding on how [[ley lines]] work.
*On the Season 15, episode 10 episode of ‘’[[Mysteries at the Museum]]’’, hosted by Don Wildman and airing on The Travel Channel, explores a theory that the non-level angles of the floor actually warps visitors’ depth perceptions and cause headaches as well as  nausea. This explanation could possibly account for objects appearing to defy gravity and the house’s ability to distort people’s heights.

'''Pendilia''' (singular '''pendilium'''; from [[Latin]] ''pendulus'', hanging) or '''pendoulia''' (the Greek equivalent), are [[pendant]]s or dangling ornaments hanging from a piece of metalwork such as a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], [[votive crown]], [[crux gemmata]], or [[kamelaukion]], and are a feature of Early Medieval [[goldsmith]] work.  On crosses the pendilia may include the letters [[alpha and omega]], and on votive offerings, which were often designed to be hung over altars and where pendilia are at their largest and most spectacular, they may spell out whole words (see illustration).

The term is commonly used in [[coin collecting]]. Pendilia are depicted on coins as jewels or pearls hanging from the sides of the crown, and occur frequently on coins of [[Byzantine emperors]]. The pendilia which hung from the Emperors' crowns began with [[Marcian]]. Although the years saw the styles of crown change, the pendilia remained, at least through [[Manuel II Palaiologos]]. Surviving crowns with pendilia include the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] and many votive crowns of the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]] from [[Visigothic]] Spain.

The '''Poets Union''' is a [[not-for-profit organisation]] representing [[Australian poets]], founded in [[Melbourne]] in 1977, it is now [[Sydney]] based.

[[File:Photograph of Guardi's Regatta in Venice at the Frick Art Reference Library.jpg|thumb|300px|''Regatta in Venice'']]

'''''Regatta in Venice''''', c. 1770 by [[Francesco Guardi]], is a small oil on canvas painting measuring 48.6 x 78.4&amp;nbsp;cm which is now in [[The Frick Collection]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guardi Regatta in Venice Frick Collection|url=http://collections.frick.org/view/objects/asitem/items$0040:701|website=Frick Collection|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was gifted to the museum by [[Helen Clay Frick]], the daughter of [[Henry Clay Frick]], who founded the Frick Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Frick Collection|url=http://www.frick.org/collection/history|website=Frick Collection|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently on display in the reading room of the [[Frick Art Reference Library]], which was founded by Helen after her father's death.

The painting depicts the [[Grand Canal (Venice)]]. In the distance the [[Rialto Bridge]] is visible alongside the bell tower of the church of [[San Bartolomeo, Venice|San Bartolomeo]] and the dome of the Church of [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]]. Guardi has included this fifteenth century Italian Gothic Church as well as the more recent seventeenth century bell tower, documenting both historical and contemporary changes in the urban landscape. In the foreground of the painting Guardi paints the [[Palazzo Balbi]] built by [[Alessandro Vittoria]] from 1582 as the residence of the Venetian patrician family of the [[Balbi]].

Guardi fills the Palazzo Balbi with people pouring onto balconies. This brings the viewer's attention to the [[regatta]], the traditional Venetian boat race. Guardi has depicted the most exciting part of the Regatta race: the paleto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Venetian Regatta|url=http://venicexplorer.net/tradizione/storica.php|website=Venice Explorer|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paleto is a turning post that stands in the middle of the Grand Canal. At this juncture, the boats begin to turn around and the winners normally take the lead. The figures in Guardi’s picture push their oars into the water in different directions in a hurry to spin their boats.

The Venetian regatta race was normally preceded by bissone, traditional gondolier boats which would parade before the race to clear the waters and settle rowdy onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Venetian Regatta|url=http://www.regatastoricavenezia.it/rs.php?pg=8&amp;lang=en|website=Regata Storica Venezia|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guardi paints these boats in bright colours with figures in matching costumes. This historical event and iconic architectural view was not uncommon in Guardi's oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paintings of the Grand Canal by Francesco Guardi|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings_of_Canal_Grande_by_Francesco_Guardi|website=Wikimedia|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, this was also painted by Guardi's great predecessor, [[Canaletto]]. Canaletto's ''The Grand Canal from the Palazzo Balbi'' in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] is painted from a similar viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canaletto's Grand Canal from the Palazzo Balbi|url=http://www.the-athenaeum.org/art/detail.php?ID=21268|website=Athenaeum|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5810">'''The Great Led Zeppelin Wine Pairing''' is a series of “wine and music pairings,” created by noted restaurateur and viticulturist [[Joe Bastianich]] and writer-musician [[Mike Edison]],  along with writer and wine expert [[David Lynch (wine)|David Lynch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/newyork/articles/led-zeppelin-wine-tasting,27655 Led Zeppelin Wine Tasting - A.V. Club]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25997634-14440,00.html Whole lotta Joe - TheAustralian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/rock_wine_6eepZtkURHTX9Pg55vlcAO Rock 'N' Wine - NewYorkPost]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/03042009/entertainment/food/its_a_red_zeppelin_157977.htm It's a Red Zeppelin - NewYorkPost]&lt;/ref&gt; Bastianich and Lynch are both recipients of the [[James Beard Award.]]

The idea was formed when Bastianich and Edison were pondering how to pair the songs of [[Led Zeppelin]] with various wines.

"Our passion for wine is only rivaled by our passion for Zeppelin,” said Bastianich, and encouraged attendees to "taste with their ears and listen with their mouths."&lt;ref name="nym09"&gt;New York Metromix, March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison, in an interview with publishing blog Galley Cat, said, "Either you see this as a hyper-intellectual exercise in promoting the lexicon of oenology as a valid critical system while simultaneously subverting it and subjecting it to ridicule—or you think it is just some dudes who want to drink some really good wine and listen to Led Zeppelin. No matter what, it is still going be the best salon since [[Dorothy Parker]] made that crack about horticulture.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galleycat.com/ Galleycat.com], March 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Why Led Zeppelin? ==
Edison has explained that “Zep is the perfect band to pair with wine—maybe the only band. They have all the right qualities: They can be earthy and intense, or dark and mellow, or just insanely huge. They've got some very real, edgy twang, and some rich, complex textures. They embrace both the Old World and the New. I can't think of any other band that shows so much depth and development, both within individual songs and across entire records,” adding, that the wine pairings were both “freakishly sophisticated and patently absurd.”&lt;ref name="nym09"/&gt;

==History==
The first Great Led Zeppelin Wine Pairing was held at [[Becco]] restaurant in New York City on March 17, 2009,  and received excellent reviews and widespread media attention. The New York Post reported, “Guests at Tuesday night's first-ever Great Led Zeppelin Wine Tasting were an odd combo of wine fans and Zep heads but it didn't take many samplings for everyone to start feeling a whole lotta love.”&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Post]]'', March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The menu, created by chef [[Billy Gallagher (chef)|Billy Gallagher]], featured six courses, each paired with wine and select Led Zeppelin songs, as follows:

'''~Antipasto~'''

“[[The Song Remains the Same (song)|The Song Remains the Same]]”

Grilled Calamari &amp; Dandelion Salad with Hard-Boiled Egg

Champagne 1er Cru Vertus NV, Guy Larmandier (France)
Gruner Veltliner Smaragd Terrassen 2007,
Domane Wachan (Austria)

'''~Primi~'''

“[[Going to California]]”

Pappardelle with Wild Mushroom Ragu

Pinot Noir Knox Alexander 2006, Au Bon Climat (California)

“[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]”

Black Spaghetti Arribiata with Sautéed Shrimp

Malbec 2005, Tritono (Argentina)

'''~Secondi~'''

“[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]”, “[[Whole Lotta Love]]”

Bistecca alla Becco

Black Angus Rib-Eye Steak grilled Medium-Rare  with Garlic Mashed Potatoes &amp; Sauteed Broccoli Rabe

Barolo Vigne Rionda 2000, Oddero   (Italy)

'''~Dolci~'''

“[[Tangerine (Led Zeppelin song)|Tangerine]]”

Farm Fresh Tangerines

Moscato d’Asti 2008, Vietti (Italy)

“[[Custard Pie (song)|Custard Pie]]”

Vanilla Custard Pie &amp; Led Zeppolini

The second Great Led Zeppelin Wine Tasting was held at City Winery in [[New York City]] and featured the Led Zeppelin Tribute band [[Six Foot Nurse]] performing live with special guest [[Scott Ian]] from the band [[Anthrax.]] More events are expected, including one in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in May 2010. &lt;-- did this take place? --&gt;

== Quotes ==
'''Joe Bastianich:''' “I think because of the sheer complexity and the deep roots of the music—where the music comes from, and how profound it is— Led Zeppelin's music can only really be paralleled with the kind of evolution, importance and complexity of wine, as both a cultural thing as well as a beverage.”&lt;ref&gt;''New York Metromix, March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mike Edison:''' “Back when I was in seminary school, attempting to pair [[Boones Farm]] apple wine with "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" and having disastrous results, I stumbled upon this little theory: "[[Led Zeppelin IV]]" is the record that when you're stoned and listening to it really loud you think the phone is ringing when it's really not. ’[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]’ is like a fully fucking awesome motherfucker—this is when they got really heavy.”&lt;ref name="nym09" /&gt;

'''[[David Lynch (wine)|David Lynch]]''' (referring to the “Black Dog” pairing): We're bringing the thunder. We're bringing the tannin. We're bringing the viscosity. We're coming at you with guns blazing, with a [[Malbec]] from [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="nym09" /&gt;

'''The Magic Circle''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[organisation]], dedicated to promoting and advancing the art of [[magic (illusion)|magic]].

Applicants must qualify for membership, either through a performance exam or by a written thesis on a branch of magic, after which they will be designated Member of the Magic Circle (M.M.C.) Further distinctions may earn them the title Associate of the Inner Magic Circle (A.I.M.C.), and Member of The Inner Magic Circle (M.I.M.C) a select group limited to 300 members. The Circle was founded in 1905, and was male-only until 1991. There is a junior branch, the Young Magicians Club, which gained popularity through the success of the [[Harry Potter]] franchise.

== History ==
[[File:Magic Circle Blue Plaque 2017.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Blue plaque]] commemorating the founding of the Magic Circle on the former Pinoli's in [[Wardour Street]]]]
[[File:Magic Circle staircase.jpg|thumb|upright|A staircase at the Magic Circle building]]
The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 after a meeting of 23 amateur and professional magicians at London's Pinoli's Restaurant. At this founders meeting, chaired by [[Servais Le Roy]], those present decided upon the name of the Society: it was initially felt that the name of the Society should be the Martin Chapender Club, in memory of the performer and founding member who had recently died at the age of twenty-five. However, it was then agreed that the name "Magic Circle" would be more appropriate and that this name shared the same initials as those of Martin Chapender.&lt;ref name="londonist"/&gt;

The first official meeting was at the Green Man [[public house]] in [[Soho]], but meetings were later in a room at [[St. George's Hall (London)|St George's Hall]] in Langham Place, where [[David Devant]] and [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] were regularly seen performing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.illusionist.co.uk/magician-blog/2010/06/magic-circle-magician-faq/ |title=Magic Circle Magician FAQ |first=Andi |last=Gladwin |authorlink=Andi Gladwin |date=June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devant became the first president of the Magic Circle, and in 1906, Maskelyne edited the first issue of ''The Magic Circular'' magazine, a regular feature for members ever since. The ''Magic Circular'' claims to be the longest-running regular magic magazine in conjuring history.

The club was male-only until 1991, when more than 75% of members voted to admit women. As of 2010 there were around eighty female members of the Magic Circle, including [[Paul Daniels]]' wife, [[Debbie McGee]].&lt;ref name="londonist"/&gt; In 2014, [[Megan Knowles-Bacon]] became the first female officer in the Magic Circle, as well as the youngest person to be elected as an officer; she was elected as secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/11217461/Magic-Circle-elects-Megan-Knowles-Bacon-as-first-female-officer.html|title=Magic Circle elects Megan Knowles-Bacon as first female officer|date=7 November 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motto ==
The motto of the society is the Latin ''indocilis privata loqui'', roughly translated as "not apt to disclose secrets" (lit. "incapable [of] speaking [of] private [things]") ; members give their word not to wilfully disclose magic secrets other than to bona fide students of magic. Anyone breaking this or any other rule may be expelled.

== Headquarters ==
[[File:Houdini's cabinet.jpg|thumb|'[[Harry Houdini|Houdini']]s Cabinet' at The Magic Circle Museum, London]]
Since 1998, the Magic Circle building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venue.themagiccircle.co.uk/ |title=Welcome to The Magic Circle |publisher=The Magic Circle |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in central London near [[Euston Station]] in [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] has been available for meetings and corporate entertainment. It was voted the UK's Number One Venue in the hospitality industry's Top 20 UK Venues poll 2008.

The Magic Circle's headquarters houses a [[theatre]], library, museum, a dining room, a clubroom and bars. The museum features magic tricks, props, posters, programs, toys, photographs and artefacts related to conjuring history. Items of interest include, [[Robert Harbin]]’s original [[Zig Zag Girl|Zig Zag]] illusion, [[Chung Ling Soo]]'s robes, an original [[Sooty]] with associated [[Harry Corbett]] apparatus, sets of props used by television magicians [[David Nixon (magician)|David Nixon]] and [[Tommy Cooper]], items and a sound recording of [[Harry Houdini]] taken from an Edison cylinder, and a set of cups and balls used by HRH [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] when he took his Magic Circle exam in 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/prince-charles-performs-his-first-conjuring-trick-in-public-news-photo/888813084#/prince-charles-performs-his-first-conjuring-trick-in-public-to-gain-picture-id888813084|title=Prince Charles performs his first conjuring trick in public to gain his membership to the Magic Circle|work=Getty Images|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Membership ==
Magicians who wish to join may spend up to two years as an Apprentice before applying for full membership.  They need to have known two current members for at least one year and must be at least 18 years old. These two members are then asked to act as sponsors, or referees, on the candidate's application form and propose them as a suitable candidate for membership. Following the receipt and processing of the application, the candidate is invited to an interview with the examinations secretary, usually at the London headquarters. If the candidate proves suitable and sufficiently knowledgeable a performance exam is scheduled or a thesis may be written. The exam takes place in front of a panel of judges, and candidates must demonstrate their skills to members in a rehearsed act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themagiccircle.co.uk/attachments/193_193_GuideFullRevised.pdf|title=The Magic Circle guide to examinations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a thesis is chosen, it is read by two examiners and a copy is made available in the Magic Circle library. The final stage is by vote by members of the Council, who will approve the candidate as a member. Once the applicant is successful, they are free to call themselves "Members of the Society" and use the letters '''''M.M.C.''''' after their name.

Members of the Magic Circle include: [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[Luis de Matos (magician)|Luis de Matos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ionline.pt/artigos/mais/magico-luis-matos-premiado-londres-pelo-the-magic-circle|title=ionline|website=ionline|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Vincent (magician)|Michael Vincent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0c3qI4ijaP8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Michael+Vincent&amp;f=false|title=Circle Without End: The Magic Circle 1905-2005|first1=Edwin Alfred|last1=Dawes|first2=Michael|last2=Bailey|date=1 July 2005|publisher=Jeremy Mills Publishing|accessdate=22 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dynamo (magician)|Dynamo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themagiccircle.co.uk/news/716-dynamo-wins-best-entertainment-programme|title=Dynamo wins Best Entertainment Programme|website=themagiccircle.co.uk|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom London (magician)|Tom London]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/ashford/news/americas-got-talent-star-surprises-129383/|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Archer (magician)|John Archer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2009/06/10/huddersfield-magic-circle-to-celebrate-60th-anniversary-86081-23831071/|title=Huddersfield Magic Circle to celebrate 60th anniversary|date=10 June 2009|publisher=Huddersfield Daily Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members may take a further examination to achieve the degree of '''''Associate of the Inner Magic Circle'''''. The designation '''A.I.M.C.''' shows this higher membership.  The A.I.M.C. degree can also be attained through thesis, and in rare cases &amp;ndash; that is when a candidate gains 18 or higher out of a possible 20 marks in the written exam &amp;ndash; examinees taking the M.M.C. exam are awarded the A.I.M.C. degree. Those who attain an A.I.M.C. degree as a result of a performance examination are awarded the A.I.M.C. with silver star.

Within the society, there are a number of members never exceeding three-hundred known as the "'''Inner Magic Circle'''". Full membership of the Inner Magic Circle is denoted by the letters '''M.I.M.C.''' after the member's name. '''Membership of the Inner Magic Circle''' is by call of The Society's President. The M.I.M.C. degree may be awarded with a gold star, to signify that the recipient is a performer of magic (as opposed to e.g. an inventor, historian or noteworthy volunteer for the Society). The honour of a gold star does not necessarily signify the holder's excellence as a performer and not all recipients are performers of excellence.

Sponsored by the Magic Circle, members of the Young Magicians Club meet for monthly workshops at the Magic Circle Headquarters, the 'Centre for the Magic Arts' in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magicweek.co.uk/magic_articles/article_young_magicians.htm |title=The Young Magicians Club |last=Thomson |first=Ian A. |date=July 2000  |work=MagicWeek |accessdate=2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Young Magicians Club's principal means of communication among its members is its bi-monthly magazine ''Secrets''. The worldwide membership also communicates through a members-only on-line forum on the Young Magicians Club website.

Membership in The Young Magicians Club requires no interview or exam and is open to all young people interested in magic. There are monthly all-day workshops for members who come from all over the country to take part. Adult members of the Magic Circle take on the responsibility of instructing the members of the Young Magicians Club. Local adult magic clubs will often have a junior magicians club attached to them but The Young Magicians Club is the only such club associated with the Magic Circle. Members of the Young Magicians Club are eligible to join the Magic Circle at a reduced rate when they reach 18, but then they must complete the examination procedure for full membership.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The Young Magicians Club holds their annual one-day convention every October called 'J-Day'. The convention includes lectures and the finals of two competitions with awards, which include the ''Home Counties Trophy'' for stage magic, ''The Mark Leveridge Cup'' for close-up magic, ''Kaymar Komedy Cup'' and the ''Peter McCahon Award for Originality''. In recent years, the celebrity guest lectures have been presented by [[Derren Brown]] in 2010, [[Dynamo (magician)|Dynamo]] in 2011, [[John Archer (magician)|John Archer]] in 2012, [[Marvin Berglas]] in 2013, [[Luis de Matos (magician)|Luis De Matos]]  in 2014 and Dave Loosley and [[Andi Gladwin]] in 2015.

The popularity of the [[Harry Potter]] franchise was one of the key reasons for the organisation's growth this century with membership doubling after the announcement of the first film in 2001.&lt;ref name="potter"/&gt;

'''''The Martyrdom of Saint Maurice''''' is a 1580-1582 painting by [[El Greco]], now in the [[Real Monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial]]. It was produced early in his [[Toledo, Spain|Toledan]] period. It had originally been commissioned from [[Juan Fernández Navarrete]] by [[Philip II of Spain]] for as a side altarpiece for the basilica of the Escorial dedicated to the saint and for use by the Legión Tebana, but after Navarrete's death in 1579 Philip transferred the commission to El Greco&lt;ref&gt;Scholz, pág. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Maurice is shown in a blue breastplate and red tunic in the right foreground, surrounded by the officers of his legion while they decide whether to sacrifice to the pagan gods or accept martyrdom. To Maurice's left [[Exuperius (Theban Legion)|Saint Exuperius]] holds a red banner. Next to him is a bearded man in a tunic, identified as [[James the Less]], who had converted the whole of Maurice's legion to Christianity. Between Maurice and the banner-bearer are two figures modelled on Spanish soldiers of the time - the elder one is [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]], commander of the Spanish troops at the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of St. Quentin]] in 1557 and Grand Master of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus|Military Order of Saint Maurice]]. To Emmanuel's right (closer to Maurice) is [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Alessandro Farnese]], then fighting against the [[Dutch Republic]]. 

The martyrdom occurs in the left background, including a figure modelled on [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s illegitimate son [[Don John of Austria]], victor of the [[battle of Lepanto]]. In the left upper background angels wait to welcome the martyrs into heaven.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5209">[[File:Taste buds.svg|thumb|The myth of the tongue map; that 1 tastes bitter, 2 tastes sour, 3 tastes salt, and 4 tastes sweet.]]

The '''tongue map''' or '''taste map''' is a [[common misconception]] that different sections of the [[tongue]] are exclusively responsible for different [[basic taste]]s. It is illustrated with a schematic map of the tongue, with certain parts of the tongue labeled for each taste. Although widely taught in schools, this was scientifically disproven by later research; all taste sensations come from all regions of the tongue, although different parts are more sensitive to certain tastes.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|date=November 10, 2008 |title=The Claim: The tongue is mapped into four areas of taste |first=Anahad |last=O'Connor |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/health/11real.html?_r=1 |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7105/abs/nature05084.html |title=The cells and logic for mammalian sour taste detection |first1=Angela |last1=Huang |first2=Xiaoke |last2=Chen |first3=Mark |last3=Hoon |first4=Jayaram |last4=Chandrashekar |first5=Wei |last5=Guo |first6=Dimitri |last6=Tränkner |first7=Nicholas |last7=Ryba |first8=Charles |last8=Zuker |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature05084 |volume=442 |pages=934–938 |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=June 24, 2011 |issue=7105 |pmid=16929298 |pmc=1571047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The theory behind this map originated from a paper written by Harvard psychologist [[D.P Hanig]], which was a translation of a German paper, ''Zur Psychophysik des Geschmackssinnes'', which was written in 1901.&lt;ref name="Haenig"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hänig |first=David |year=1901 |url=http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/library/data/lit4562 |title=Zur Psychophysik des Geschmackssinnes |journal=[[Philosophische Studien]] |volume=17 |pages=576–623 |accessdate=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unclear representation of data in the former paper suggested that each part of the tongue tastes exactly one basic taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/health/060829_bad_tongue.html |first=Christopher |last=Wanjek |title=The Tongue Map: Tasteless Myth Debunked |date=August 29, 2006|work=Livescience.com |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= David V. Smith |author2=Robert F. Margolskee |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-taste-map-all-wrong |date=March 2001 |journal=[[Scientific American]] |title=The Taste Map: All Wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper showed minute differences in threshold detection levels across the tongue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Jacob M. Andersen |url=http://brushflossandmouthwash.com/mythbusting-tongue-map/ |date=Jan 2015 |journal=[[ASDA]] |title=Mythbusting The Tongue Map}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these differences were later taken out of context and the minute difference in threshold sensitivity was misconstrued in textbooks as a difference in sensation.&lt;ref name=mistake&gt;[http://wwwalt.med-rz.uni-sb.de/med_fak/physiol1/LDM/chemotopic_1.htm The Chemotopic Organization of Taste] wwwalt.med-rz.uni-sb.de {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718005301/http://wwwalt.med-rz.uni-sb.de/med_fak/physiol1/LDM/chemotopic_1.htm |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some parts of the tongue may be able to detect a taste before the others do, all parts are equally capable of conveying the [[qualia]] of all tastes. Threshold sensitivity may differ across the tongue, but intensity of sensation does not.&lt;ref name=mistake/&gt;

The same paper included a taste bud distribution diagram that showed a "taste belt".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwalt.med-rz.uni-sb.de/med_fak/physiol1/LDM/chemotopic_2.htm Chemotopic representation of the human tongue according to Hänig (1901)] wwwalt.med-rz.uni-sb.de {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718005324/http://wwwalt.med-rz.uni-sb.de/med_fak/physiol1/LDM/chemotopic_2.htm |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Virginia Collings investigated the topic again, and confirmed that all the tastes exist on all parts of the tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collings |first=V. B. |year=1974 |title=Human Taste Response as a Function of Locus of Stimulation on the Tongue and Soft Palate |journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics |volume=16 |pages=169–174 |doi=10.3758/bf03203270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taste belt ==
The misinterpreted 2013 diagram in the article that sparked this myth shows human taste buds distributed in a "taste belt" along the inside of the tongue.

Prior to this, A. Hoffmann had concluded, in 1875, that the dorsal center of the human tongue has practically no fungiform papillae and taste buds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoffmann |first=A. |date=1875 |title=Über die Verbreitung der Geschmacksknospen beim Menschen |language=de |trans-title=On the spread of taste buds in humans |journal=Archiv für pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und für klinische Medicin |volume=62 |pages=516–530 |doi=10.1007/bf01928657}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was this finding that the diagram describes.

{{Costume}}
Some authors have argued that '''use of costume in Athenian tragedy''' was standardized for the [[genre]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to have consisted of a full-length or short tunic, a cloak and soft leather boots, and may have been derived from the robes of [[Dionysos|Dionysian]] priests or invented by [[Aeschylus]]. Brockett, however, disputes this, arguing that the evidence we have is based on archaeological remains, some few references in the texts, and the writings of later authors. As far as the vase paintings are concerned, most of these are dated later than the 5th Century BCE and their relationship with theatrical practice is unclear. One of the earliest examples is a red-figure vase painting c. 500-490 BCE that shows a tragic [[Greek chorus|chorus]] invoking a ghost, on a crater (bowl) in the Antikenmuseum in Basle.&lt;ref name="The Ancient Theatre, E. Simon"&gt;Simon, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragic actors were certainly heavily disguised. This had a religious purpose, for the actor was supposed to give up his identity in order to let another speak and act through him. Indeed, the dramas were performed in honour of [[Dionysus]], the God of Ecstasy, which means “standing outside oneself”.&lt;ref name="The Ancient Theatre, E. Simon"/&gt; Actors therefore had to renounce their individuality. The actors thought that the mask itself contained the character and are said to have prayed before putting on their masks. The costume was probably an elaborately-decorated version of everyday clothing worn in the 5th Century BCE. The garments included:

* ''[[chiton (costume)|chiton]]'' (robe or tunic)
* ''chlaina'' (overgarment)
* ''[[chlamys]]'' (short cloak)
* [[buskin|''kothurnus'']] (short lace-up boots)
* ''[[himation]]'' (overgarment)
* ''[[peplos]]'' (cloak).&lt;ref&gt;Laver&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''chiton'' worn by the actors differed from that worn in everyday life because it incorporated sleeves, which were coloured and patterned. The sleeves may in fact have been part of an undergarment. Long white sleeves were worn by the (male) actors for female roles, and indeed, in vase paintings females are usually painted with lighter skin.

The costumes worn for the performances of ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', for example, were [[Iconography|iconographic]], and symbolised the opposition of light and dark.&lt;ref&gt;Wiles, 1999, p159.&lt;/ref&gt; In the play, life is evoked as the act of seeing the sun. Death – the son of Night in [[Greek mythology]] - wears a black peplos and black wings. [[Apollo]] wears white, representing the sun. Admetus contrasts the black of the funeral procession with the white of the funeral procession. The corpse of Alcestis is dressed as a bride, in accordance with Greek tradition and [[Herakles]] wears a bearskin and carries a club.

The costumes worn gave the audience an immediate sense of character-type, gender, age, social status and class.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm, 1994, p65 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of [[Aeschylus]], the boots or [[buskin]]s worn by the actors were flat. The actors had the same “status” as the [[Greek chorus|chorus]]. In the 3rd Century BCE, the actors were raised to the status of heroes and “platform” soles began to be used, together with a head-dress called an ''onkos''. The raised soles may have induced a stylised way of walking, suited to the rhythm of tragic verse, and the ''onkos'' made the actors taller, enhancing visibility. Their bodies were padded so that they did not look too slim.&lt;ref name="Laver"&gt;Laver.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors believe that this happened later than the 3rd Century BCE. It is also thought that the “teetering gait” is a misapprehension.&lt;ref&gt;McLeish.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mask]]s were the most striking feature of the costume worn by the Athenian actors. Facial expression was lost anyway due to the huge size of the [[Theatre of Dionysus|Greek theatres]], but the masks were also a means of blotting out expression, so visual meaning was expressed by the entire body. The actors were seen as silhouettes, or integral bodies, rather than faces. The masks themselves were made of stiffened linen, thin clay, cork or wood, and covered the whole head and had hair.

Attempts have been made in modern times to investigate the use of masks in Athenian tragedy through [[practice research]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Walton, 2007, p. 247 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; These explorations conclude that masks may lead to a more demonstrative style of acting, with declamatory delivery of the lines substituted for intimacy. They also found that the mask could impede the projection of sound. The Greeks are said to have overcome this in various ways. Initially, the mouth apertures were small, but later this became a “wide-open” mouth. Some authors believe that the mouth was shaped like a “mouth-trumpet” and had an amplifying effect.&lt;ref&gt;Simon.&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, the use of a mask covering the whole produces an enhanced resonating effect, which serves dramatic delivery.

Performances therefore had to be more physical. Peter Arnott states that the Greeks thought good acting and a good voice were synonymous. This was achieved through athletic training, voice exercises and diet.

Experiments have shown that unaccustomed actors suffer disorientation and restriction when masked. The Greeks countered this through a vocabulary of gesture known as ''cheironomia'' (gesticulation). [[Aristotle]] says that in his day excessive gestures were used – leading to overacting – compared with the older tradition.

Masks can also be used as a dramatic tool, e.g. lowering the masks shows reflection, raising the mask shows a challenge or superiority. The Greeks called these physical stances ''schemata'' (forms).

Silent masks were used to great effect, particularly on child actors, expressing powerlessness, bewilderment, vulnerability, etc.

The use of masks enabled the three speaking actors to portray up to eight or nine characters, through multiple role-playing. The same character could therefore be played by different actors, and transitions within a character would be portrayed by the use of different masks.

The wide variety of masks used is attested by [[Julius Pollux|Pollux]], a rhetorician writing in 2nd Century CE, in his ''[[Onomastikon]]''.&lt;ref name="Laver"/&gt; He lists 30 different male masks (old age with white or grey hair, the tyrant with thick black hair, a fair, pale masks indicating sorrow or sickness, a boastful soldier, a rustic, servants, a cook, etc.) and 17 female masks (fat and thin old women, two matrons, one virgin, a bawd, a mistress, three courtesans, a lady’s maid, etc.).

'''''View and Plan of Toledo''''' is a work of [[El Greco]], made in 1608 during his last period. It is preserved in the [[El Greco Museum, Toledo]].

==Analysis==
This work moves away from the beautiful and stylized descriptions of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]; it shows a great meticulousness. This fostered the assumption that it was commissioned by the city council. The enormous detail that was made on the plane caused many scholars to guess that this is a work of [[Jorge Manuel Theotocópuli|Jorge Manuel]], son of the painter and expert in architecture.

At the top of the canvas is the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], accompanied by a court of angels carrying the chasuble of [[Ildefonsus|San Ildefonso]]. In this work it could be read as an anticipation of [[impressionism]], and even [[Paul Cézanne]].

== Provenance ==
The painting was probably commissioned by Pedro de Salazar y Mendoza. It appeared on an inventories of goods of El Greco in 1614, and [[Jorge Manuel Theotocópuli|Jorge Manuel]] in 1621. It entered the collection of the [[El Greco Museum, Toledo|Museo del Greco]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ceres.mcu.es/pages/ResultSearch?txtSimpleSearch=Vista%2520y%2520plano%2520de%2520Toledo&amp;simpleSearch=0&amp;hipertextSearch=1&amp;search=simpleSelection&amp;MuseumsSearch=MGTO%7C&amp;MuseumsRolSearch=28&amp;|title=Red Digital de Colecciones de Museos de España - Museos|website=ceres.mcu.es|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022703/oai_euromuseos_mcu_es_euromuseos_MGTO_CE00014.html|title=Vista y plano de Toledo - Cuadro|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scholz-Hänsel2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Scholz-Hänsel|title=El Greco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4M2pozQOD4wC|year=2004|publisher=Taschen|isbn=978-3-8228-3171-7|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Viy 3D''''' ({{lang-ru|Вий}}, internationally known as '''''Forbidden Empire''''', and in the UK as '''''The Forbidden Kingdom''''') is a 2014 [[dark fantasy]] film produced by Russian and Ukraine Film Group and Marins Group Entertainment and loosely based on the [[Nikolai Gogol]] story ''[[Viy (story)|Viy]]''. The film was released in cinemas in Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan on 30 January 2014, in the United States on 22 May 2015 and in the United Kingdom on 1 June 2015.
 
The film is directed by Oleg Stepchenko, based on the first manuscript of Nikolai Gogol. The film has been in production since December 2005 and stopped several times due to lack of funding. In October 2012, the filming was completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inter.ua/ru/news/2012/04/02/4778 Закончились съемки фильма "Вий" 3D], The filming of "Viy 3D" completed, Inter Channel, April 2012, {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Viy'' was a huge commercial success, even breaking a record for opening weekend in Russia, but was met with mixed reviews in media.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.kinofilms.ua/movie/7252_Viy/videos_filming/?video=8623 История создания.

==Plot==
Early-18th-century [[cartographer]] Jonathan Green undertakes a scientific voyage from Western Europe to the East. Having passed through [[Transylvania]] and crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]], he finds himself in a small village lost in impassable woods of [[Ukraine]]. Nothing but chance and heavy fog could bring him to this cursed place. People who live here do not resemble any other people which the traveler saw before that. The villagers, having dug a deep moat to fend themselves from the rest of the world, share a naive belief that they could save themselves from evil, failing to understand that evil has made its nest in their souls and is waiting for an opportunity to gush out upon the world.

==Production==
In 2006, Russian producer Alexey Petrukhin and Russian director Oleg Stepchenko decided that they wanted to make a film based on the horror story of [[Viy (story)|''Viy'']] by [[Nikolai Gogol]]. By then, two other projects based on Gogol's tale were in production, such as ''[[Taras Bulba (2009 film)|Taras Bulba]]'' film from 2009 and ''The Witch'' from 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasha-shumiha.ru/news/vij_v_meru_strashnyj_i_ochen_sovremennyj/2014-01-30-2764 «Вий»: в меру страшный и очень современный — 30 Января 2014 — Газета «Наша Шумиха»&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to secure the title, they needed without any further delay to release the information on the forthcoming project. In the course of three days, they filmed a teaser trailer where the role of Khoma Brutus was played by Petrukhin himself. Only after that did the active production of the film begin. When the teaser was shown in theaters, the script was not yet written and the actors were not cast. The story kept growing and changing until it turned from a simple screen version into a big-budget fantasy thriller.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvrain.ru/articles/mongajt_vij_v_3d_gogol_perevernetsja_v_grobu-361004/?autoplay=false Монгайт. «ВИЙ» В 3D: Гоголь перевернется в гробу.

Денис Корсаков&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors understood that the new times set new rules, so in 2011 they made a difficult but very important decision: they decided re-shoot the picture in 3D, even though half of the footage was already filmed. Conversion was out of the question. The decision to re-shoot was not just a PR trick. The re-shooting was taken seriously—the producers developed an innovative technology that had no parallels in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinsgroup.ru/kino/651-lr-3d----23--2014-.html «Вий» выйдет в прокат 23 января 2014 года]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Viy'' is an intersection of two storylines. One is the narrative from [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s horror story. The writers used the first edition of the story still untouched by Belinskiy's proofs. The original version has quite different motifs and the whole narrative focuses on a different kind of drama. What's more important, this version abounds in secrets and riddles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itar-tass.com/ekonomika/952588|title=ФАС получила жалобу на скрытую рекламу водки в фильме «Вий»]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Gogol's immortal story will be screened without cuts. The second storyline is centered on a real person—[[Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan]] (1595–1685)—a French traveler and cartographer who was the first to study the Ukrainian territories and their people and culture. His research is included in the book ''From Transylvania to Muscovy''. The producers chose his figure because he was also the first to collect and systematize under one cover Slavic myths and legends. De Beauplan was a prototype of the film's main character—Jonathan Green.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.kinofilms.ua/movie/7252_Viy/videos_filming/?video=8623 История создания. Часть 1 Вий 3D&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming locations===
''Viy'' was shot in [[Prague]] at the [[Gatteo]], [[Barrandov]], and Letnyany studios.

The castle in England where Green sets out on his journey is doubled in the film by the Czech [[Sychrov Castle]]. Despite being a few hundred years old—it was built in 1693—it is the newest castle in the [[Czech Republic]]. The legend goes that somewhere in the dungeons of the castle is hidden a treasure guarded by a "Black Lady", a woman dressed in a black gown of mourning. In order to make her figure even scarier, some storytellers began calling the lady of the castle "the Black Widow".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvrain.ru/articles/mongajt_vij_v_3d_gogol_perevernetsja_v_grobu-361004/?autoplay=false Монгайт. «ВИЙ» В 3D: Гоголь перевернется в гробу. Часть 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name became so popular that it turned into a cliché and is used every time a female ghost is depicted. It found its way into hundreds of legends around the world. But the locals take the story quite seriously. In order to not shock the tourists staying in the castle overnight, it is forbidden to move any furniture—by morning all of it will be in its original place. The castle guardians explain that "the lady of the house is putting things in order". Zamek Sychrov serves as a film location for the second time already: in 1972 it was the set for Three Wishes for Cinderella.

Most of filming sets were built in [[Czech Republic]].

===Design===
For the location shooting, a life-sized Cossack hamlet, with every historical detail thoroughly reproduced, was built. It included 21 households, a marketplace, a church, a tavern, a mill, a house of pray, and watch towers. Some props were even donated later to historical museums as they were so realistic. The church—the setting for the three notorious nights—was also built for the film from scratch. During the filming of the three nights, the decorators burned over twelve thousand wax candles manufactured according to a special historical design.

The carriage in which the protagonist travels was also designed and built at one of the most famous German automobile manufacturers. The vehicle was designed to be mechanically modern, while its outside appearance was that of a piece of transport from the 18th century. The carriage cost $75,000. A second carriage worth $23,000 was also constructed to double for the interior scenes.

Besides the carriage, the protagonist was equipped with other elaborate technical gadgets—cartographic tools, cryptographic equipment, and even a tablet computer. Costumes were designed by a legend in the Czech movie industry Yarmila Koneczna. She made almost 200 costumes. The main character alone owns six original suits, another seven were made for his doubles and stuntmen.

===Casting===
Several actors were cast for the lead role of Jonathan Green: [[Vincent Cassel]], [[Christian Slater]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Sean Bean]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], and [[Jason Statham]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.kinofilms.ua/movie/7252_Viy/videos_filming/?video=8623 История создания. Часть 1 Вий 3D&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The producers had official negotiations with each of the actors. It was Jason Statham who recommended his best friend Jason Flemyng for the lead. Flemyng was soon approved by the director and the producers. Christian Slater, after seeing the footage of the film, regretted that he did not appear in the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extranews.org/supermodel-natalya-vodyanova-ochen-xotela-sygrat-vedmu-v-filme-vij_110886.html Супермодель Наталья Водянова очень хотела сыграть ведьму в фильме «Вий»]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special effects===
All the stunts and fighting scenes were choreographed by Irzi Kuba.

There are three categories of monsters in the film: made-up artists, animatronics—puppet monsters animated by machines and stunt actors—and virtual 3D ogres. Special make-up artist Petr Gorshenin, who worked on ''Vysotskiy'': Thanks for living on... and other films, said that his work on ''Viy'' was the most complicated and important.

The film is shot in real 3D. Stereoscopic design of the film was done by the German company Stereotec.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianfilmgroup.com/news83.htm Stereotec brought Viy to the New Level]&lt;/ref&gt; Special proprietary technology was developed for the film's 3D effects: rfg_BTS (Beyond The Screen), also called Touch3D.

The producer, Alexei Petrukhin, said that originally the film was supposed to be stereoscopic. The scenes that were filmed during the first shooting period (about 20 minutes) were filmed in 2D and postconverted to 3D (in particular, episodes of Pannochka's funeral in the church were filmed that way). In 2011 the production decided to cooperate with Stereotec&lt;ref&gt;[http://stereotec.com www.stereotec.com], Stereotec shooting "Viy 3D", January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; for the rest of the movie, a worldwide-operating, Munich-based 3D company.

==Release==
Initially, in order to show that the picture is in production, Alexey Petrukhin and Oleg Stepchenko filmed a teaser trailer, which took them 18 hours to make, where the role of Homa Brutus (character with a bald head) was played by Petrukhin himself.

On 16 June 2010, a sneak preview of some of the finished episodes was held. The show, held in 3D, was organised by the creators of the film for their American guests, who considered distributing the picture in 80 countries around the world.

'''''Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle''''' (c. 1665-70) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[Mount Stuart House]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911, who wrote; "760. A HILLY LANDSCAPE WITH A WATERFALL AND A RUINED CASTLE.  [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. 198.]] A ruined castle stands on a high rocky hill to the right. In the left foreground a stream, on whose rocky banks grow firs, forms a waterfall and flows along the foot of the hill. A great fir stands on a bank ; some felled trees lie near. To the right are two houses amid trees at the foot of the castle-hill. In the left distance is a mountain. In the style of [[Allaert van Everdingen|A. van Everdingen]]. "This capital production of art is painted in a broad free manner, and possesses great force and effect " (Sm.). 
Canvas, 47 inches by 71 inches. In the collection of the [[Marquess of Bute]], London, [[Jean Paul Richter|Richter]]'s 1884 catalogue, No. 145 ; it was in that collection in 1835 (Sm.), and was mentioned by [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Waagen]] in 1854 (iii. 481)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/241/mode/1up  Entry 760 for ''''Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael made in this period and these often served as inspiration for later painters of landscape.

:''This article is about women as subjects of art. For women creating art in the Philippines, see [[Filipino women artists]].''
'''Women in Philippine art''' is the many forms of [[art in the Philippines]] that utilizes [[women in the Philippines]] and even women from other parts of the world as the main subject depending on the purpose of the Filipino artist. The portrayal of women in the visual arts depend on the context on how Philippine society perceives women and their roles in human communities, such as their own.

==Women in paintings==
In the field of painting, Filipino visual artists depicted women in their painting as women who are influential and with authority, women who are engaged in domestic activities, and women who are shown to be under the control of influential [[men in the Philippines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tarroza|first=Ma. Abigail|title=Eva: Women in Philippine Art|url=https://www.academia.edu/3999369/Eva_Women_in_Philippine_Art|publisher=Academia.edu|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or foreign men.

===Amorsolo's women===

In painting the faces and figures of Filipino women, [[Philippine National Artist]] [[Fernando Amorsolo]] (1892-1972) was able to develop  his own template on how to paint and create Filipino women in his art: women with rounded faces but not oval, with "exceptionally lively eyes" (not dreamy or sleepy), with "firm and strongly marked" noses (not blunt in form), with clear skin and fresh color, not necessarily of white complexion nor of dark brown [[Ethnic Malays|Malayan]] color. Amorsolo painted Filipino women that is similar to the stature of a  "[[blushing]]" girl.&lt;ref name=Paras&gt;Paras-Perez, Rodriguez. ''Amorsolo Drawings'' ([http://www.lopezmuseum.org.ph/gallery_amorsolo.html excerpt available online]) (1992), {{oclc|29416198}}. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903235159/http://www.lopezmuseum.org.ph/gallery_amorsolo.html |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luna's women===
[[File:Espana y Filipinas by Juan Luna.jpg|thumb|110px|right|''España y Filipinas'' (1886) by [[Juan Luna]]]]
In contrast, Filipino painter, sculptor, [[ilustrado]], propagandist, political activist and revolutionary hero [[Juan Luna]] (1857–1899) painted women in a different light. In his painting known as ''[[España y Filipinas]]'' ("Spain and the Philippines", 1886), Luna used symbolism and allegory by rendering a taller and strong-shouldered maternal Spaniard woman (representing [[Spain]] and [[colonialism]]) guiding a shorter, graceful and "humbly dressed" Filipino woman (representing the [[Philippines]]) towards the way to [[Social progress|progress]].&lt;ref name=Inq&gt;Ocampo, Ambeth.

Prolific in his career as a painter, Luna produced scenes that depict Philippine and European life. Luna's portrayal of [[Women in Europe|European women]] can be seen in his ''[[Las Damas Romanas]]'' ([[Women in Ancient Rome|Roman Women]], 1882), the ''[[Odalisque (painting)|Odalisque]]'' (1885), ''[[La Madrileña (En el Balcon)|La Madrileña]]'' (The Woman from Madrid, c. 1880s), ''En el Balcon'' (At the Balcony, 1884), ''Picnic in Normany'' (c. 1880s), ''The Parisian Life'' (1892), ''Despues del Baile'' (After the Dance, c. 1880s), ''Street Flower Vendor'' (c. 1880s), ''[[Ensueños de Amor]]'' (Dreams of Love, c. 1890s), ''Mi Novia'' (My Girlfriend) and ''La Marquesa de Monte Bolivar'' (The [[Marchioness]] of Monte Olivar, 1881). Luna's depiction of Filipino women can be viewed in ''[[Tampuhan]]'' (1895), ''[[La Bulaqueña]]'' (The Woman from [[Bulacan]], 1895), ''Nena y Tinita'' (Nena and Tinita, c. 1880s). Luna also painted a scene depicting [[Women in Egypt|Egyptian women]] in his ''[[The Death of Cleopatra|La Muerte de Cleopatra]]'' (The Death of [[Cleopatra]], 1881).

===Hidalgo's women===
[[File:A lady in the moonlight Félix Resurrección Hidalgo.jpg|thumb|left|120px|''A Lady in the Moonlight'' (undated) by [[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo]]]]
[[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo]] (1855-1913), one of the great Filipino painters of the late 19th century, has his fair share of artistic contribution in painting historical  female characters through the visual arts during his time. Hidalgo's ''[[Las Virgenes Cristianas Expuestas al Populacho]]'' (Christian Virgins Exposed to the Mob, 1884) recounting the suffering that women has experienced during the period in [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman history]] when the [[Persecution of Christians|persecution]] of [[Christian]]s in [[Ancient Rome]] occurred.&lt;ref name=Interior&gt;Ocampo, Ambeth R.

===Other painters===
[[Fabián de la Rosa]], the mentor and uncle of Fernando Amorsolo and his brother [[Pablo Amorsolo]] (1898–1945) had his own technique of painting women. De la Rosa painted a group of ''Women Working in a Rice Field'' in 1902 and his portrait of a ''Young Filipina'' in 1928. Pablo Amorsolo himself painted his own rendition of a female ''Fruit Vendor'' (undated).

==Women in sculptures==

===Rizal's women===
[[File:Rizal's sculpture The Power of Science over Death.jpg|thumb|right|''The Triumph of Science over Death'' (1890) by [[José Rizal]]]]
Painter, sculptor, writer, revolutionary and Philippine national hero [[José Rizal]] (1861-1896) also used the theme of a woman of power in his sculptures. His clay sculpture known as ''[[The Triumph of Science over Death]]'' (also known as ''Scientia'', 1890) was a rendering of a naked and young woman with overflowing hair standing and trampling a skull while bearing a torch held high. The sculpture symbolized the ignorance of humankind durings the Dark Ages. The torch being held by the woman signified the victory and enlightenment that humankind has received by vanquishing death through science.&lt;ref name=Reyes&gt;{{cite book|last=Reyes|first=Raquel A. G.|title=Love, Passion and Patriotism: Sexuality and the Philippine Propaganda Movement, 1882 - 1892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W3tjWD-ngC4C&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=triumph+of+science+over+death+jose+rizal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xYrJSx2Vpd&amp;sig=h12nlAc5UKT8qE1HoNgG5GGE-Lc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nT2SUsCBMKTksASay4H4BQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=triumph%20of%20science%20over%20death%20jose%20rizal&amp;f=false|publisher=NUS Press, National University of Singapore (2008)|accessdate=24 November 2013}}, pp. 181-183 and 191.&lt;/ref&gt; In another sculpture known as the ''Victory of Death over Life'' (1890), Rizal portrayed a woman that was limp and lifeless against the hold and embrace of a cloaked figure of a standing skeleton (the symbol of death).&lt;ref name=Reyes/&gt; Rizal also sculpted another figure of a woman known as the ''Reclining Nude'' (1890). Rizal's technique of molding women into sculptures involved the rendering of the young female body as a representation of vitality and virtue. Rizal's "sculptured women", as described by Raquel A. G. Reyes in her book ''Love, Passion and Patriotism: Sexuality and the Philippine Propaganda Movement, 1882 - 1892'' were smooth, young, with unblemished condition, with traditional signs of long abundant and flowing hair on the head, with rounded conical breasts, and with absence of [[pubic hair]] on the genital area.&lt;ref name=Reyes/&gt; This overall softness and fluidity were a contrasting effect against the hardness of the ''escayola'' material used by Rizal in sculpting these women.&lt;ref name=Reyes/&gt; Rizal had drawn a sketch, using crayons, of his former girlfriend [[Leonor Rivera]].

==Women and sexuality in Philippine art==
As one example of women in Philippine art, Rizal's three sculptures (as discussed above) were described by Raquel A. G.  Reyes as a "rare representation of the insatiable female [[Sexuality in the Philippines|sexuality]] that Rizal (...) attributed to the non-Filipino woman". Reyes further explained that Rizal did not want women in the Philippines to "imitate or to emulate" the foreign women, such as the [[Women in Europe|European women]] of his time, who were the basis of his sculptures.&lt;ref name=Reyes/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8952">The '''word count''' is the number of [[word]]s in a document or passage of text. Word counting may be needed when a text is required to stay within certain numbers of words. This may particularly be the case in [[academia]], legal proceedings, [[journalism]] and [[advertising]]. Word count is commonly used by [[translator]]s to determine the price for the translation job. Word counts may also be used to calculate measures of [[readability]] and to measure typing and reading speeds (usually in [[words per minute]]). When converting [[character (computing)|character]] counts to words, a measure of 5 or 6 characters to a word is generally used for English.&lt;ref&gt;The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America suggest [http://www.sfwa.org/2005/01/what-is-a-word/ 6 chars to a word]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details and variations of definition ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
Variations in the [[operational definition]]s of how to count the words can occur (namely, what "counts as" a word, and which words "don't count" toward the total). However, especially since the advent of widespread [[word processing]], there is a broad consensus on these operational definitions (and hence the bottom-line integer result). The consensus is to accept the [[text segmentation]] rules generally found in most word processing software (including how [[Word#Word boundaries|word boundaries]] are determined, which depends on how [[word divider]]s are defined). The first trait of that definition is that a [[space (punctuation)|space]] (any of various [[whitespace character]]s, such as a "regular" word space, an [[space (punctuation)#Space characters and digital typography|em space]], or a [[tab key#Tab characters|tab character]]) is a word divider. Usually a [[hyphen]] or a [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] is, too. Different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the [[text segmentation]] rule details, and on whether words outside the main text (such as [[note (typography)|footnotes]], [[note (typography)|endnotes]], or [[hidden text]]) are counted. But the behavior of most major word processing applications is broadly similar.

However, during the era when school assignments were done in [[handwriting]] or with [[typewriter]]s, the rules for these definitions often differed from today's consensus. Most importantly, many students were drilled on the rule that "certain words don't count", usually [[English articles|articles]] (namely, "a", "an", "the"), but sometimes also others, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s (for example, "and", "or", "but") and some prepositions (usually "to", "of"). Hyphenated permanent compounds such as "follow-up" (noun) or "long-term" (adjective) were counted as one word. To save the time and effort of counting word-by-word, often a [[rule of thumb]] for the average number of words per line was used, such as 10 words per line. These "rules" have fallen by the wayside in the word processing era; the "word count" feature of such software (which follows the [[text segmentation]] rules mentioned earlier) is now the standard arbiter, because it is largely consistent (across documents and applications) and because it is fast, effortless, and costless (already included with the application).

As for which sections of a document "count" toward the total (such as [[note (typography)|footnotes]], [[note (typography)|endnotes]], [[abstract (summary)|abstract]]s, [[citation|reference lists and bibliographies]], [[table (information)|tables]], figure captions, [[hidden text]]), the person in charge (teacher, client) can define their choice, and users (students, workers) can simply [[selection (user interface)|select]] (or exclude) the elements accordingly, and watch the word count automatically update.

== Software ==
Modern [[web browser]]s support word counting via [[Browser extension|extensions]], via a [[JavaScript]] [[bookmarklet]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web | url=http://marklets.com/Word+Count.aspx | title=Word Count Bookmarklet | publisher=Marklets.com | accessdate=March 3, 2013 | author=Tavory, Ran}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[script (computing)|script]] &lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web | url=https://wordcounttools.com/ | title=Word Count Tool | accessdate=March 6, 2014 | author=Word Counter}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is hosted in a website. Most [[word processor]]s can also count words. [[Unix]]-like systems include a  program, ''[[wc (Unix)|wc]]'', specifically for word counting. There are a wide variety of word counting tools available online.

As [[#Details and variations in how the count is defined|explained earlier]], different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the [[text segmentation]] rule details. The exact number of words often is not a strict requirement, thus the variation is acceptable.

== In fiction ==
Novelist [[Jane Smiley]] suggests that length is an important quality of the [[novel]].&lt;ref&gt;Smiley, Jane. 2005. Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel. NY: Alfred A. Knopf, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, novels can vary tremendously in length; Smiley lists novels as typically being between 100,000 and 175,000 words,&lt;ref&gt;Smiley, 2005, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[National Novel Writing Month]] requires its novels to be at least 50,000 words. There are no firm rules: for example, the boundary between a [[novella]] and a [[novel]] is arbitrary and a literary work may be difficult to categorise.&lt;ref&gt;Edge, Tom, "Does Size Matter?" The Guardian (UK), Booksblog, Nov. 2, 2006. http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2006/nov/02/doessizematter&lt;/ref&gt; But while the length of a novel is to a large extent up to its writer,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[New York Times]]|last=Quindlen|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Quindlen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/books/writers-on-writing-the-eye-of-the-reporter-the-heart-of-the-novelist.html|title=Writers on Writing: The Eye of the Reporter, the Heart of the Novelist|date=September 23, 2002|quote=A novelist doesn't write to space, of course; 80,000 words, 100,000, it is up to the writer to say when the story is done.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lengths may also vary by subgenre; many [[chapter book]]s for children start at a length of about 16,000 words,&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Nancy, Crafting Stories for Children. Cincinnati: Writer's Digest Books, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and a typical mystery novel might be in the 60,000 to 80,000 word range while a thriller could be well over 100,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Agents give writers the book on what's hot and what's not|journal=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|first=Carol|last=Thurston|date=August 3, 1997|quote=no one wants more than 60-80,000 words in a mystery, 110,000 for a thriller}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] specifies word lengths for each category of its [[Nebula award]] categories:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090319043837/http://sfwa.org/awards/faq.htm SFWA Awards FAQ], [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] as follows:&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Classification !! Word count
|-
|| [[Novel]] || 40,000 words or over
|-
|| [[Novella]] || 17,500 to 39,999 words
|-
|| [[Novella#Versus novelette|Novelette]] || 7,500 to 17,499 words
|-
|| [[Short story]] || under 7,500 words
|}

The acceptable length of an academic [[dissertation]] varies greatly, dependent predominantly on the subject. Numerous American universities limit Ph.D. dissertations to 100,000 words, barring special permission for exceeding this limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Authoring a PhD|first=Patrick|last=Dunleavy|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2003|isbn=978-1-4039-1191-9|page=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
