'''African Centre for Technology Studies''' (ACTS) is an intergovernmental non-profit organization, founded in 1988 by [[Calestous Juma]]  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS|commas=true}}&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt; in Nairobi, Kenya, promoting policy-oriented research on science and technology in development that is sustainable in terms of the economy, society, and the environment.&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt; It was the first African non-profit organization to combine policy research, science and technology.&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==History==
Founded in 1988, ACTS was a pioneer in development research on innovative development policies related to applied science, technology, and innovation.&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt;

ACTS research influenced policies on industrial property legislation and policy in Kenya, environmental impact assessment standards in Eastern and Southern Africa,  [[biofuels]] and [[bio-energy]] in Kenya, Eastern and West Africa. ACTS has also influenced policies across Africa on issues such as [[climate change adaptation]] and [[climate change mitigation|mitigation]], agriculture, biotechnology, [[biodiplomacy]], and [[biosafety]].&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt;

==Affiliations==
ACTS is a member of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD),  which includes 150 data producers and users working towards sustainable development focusing on data that informs research ending extreme poverty and addressing climate change. The Canadian, Colombian, French, Ghanaian, Italian, Mexican, Moroccan, Nigerian, Philippine, Senagalese, United Kingdom and United States' governments are member-states of the network.&lt;ref name="sustainabledevelopment_UN"&gt;{{citation |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=9691 |title=Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data |publisher=United Nations |date=2016 |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2013, ACTS was named as one of the top Environment Think Tanks globally.&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt; In 1991 the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa ([[CODESRIA]]) honored ACTS for its contribution to expanding the knowledge base for development in Africa with the Justinian Rweyemamu Prize, named after Tanzania’s first major economics scholar, [[Justinian Rweyemamu]].&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Community-based actions==
ACTS policy researchers engage with local communities to encourage communities to reflect on and learn from their own coping mechanisms when faced with flood-prone areas. They then choose best practice adaptations and develop long-term proactive strategies for flood mitigation which might include crop diversification.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://cdkn.org/resource/in-conversation-with-elvin-nyukuri-african-centre-for-technology-studies-2/?loclang=en_gb |title=In conversation with… Elvin Nyukuri, African Centre for Technology Studies |publisher=African Centre for Technology Studies |date=May 16, 2011 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected publications==
ACTS published the groundbreaking study by Harvard professor, Calestous Juma&lt;ref name="List of Fellows"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Fellows|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about-us/people-council-committees/the-fellowship/list-of-fellows}}&lt;/ref&gt; and J.

In his 1993 article, in which he examined legal processes regarding access and tenurial issues in regards to group and individual pastoral natural resource management in Turkana in Kenya, focusing on tree rights, Edmund G.C. Barrow made a case for indigenous property rights.&lt;ref name="Barrow_1993_Tree_rights"&gt;{{citation |publisher=Biopolicy International, African Centre for Technology Studies via Bioline International |number=8 |date=1993 |pages=1–23 |title=Tree Rights in Kenya: The Case of the Turkana (Part 1) |author=Edmund G.C.

===''Fits, Trances, and Visions''===

''Fits, Trances, and Visions'' (1999) charts the experience of Anglo-American Protestants and those who left the Protestant movement beginning with the transatlantic awakening in the early 18th century and ending with the rise of the [[psychology of religion]] and the birth of [[Pentecostalism]] in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Taves|1999|p=3}} 

It charts the synonymic language of [[trance]] in the American Christian traditions: ''power'' or ''presence'' or ''indwelling'' of God, or Christ, or the Spirit, or spirits. Typical expressions include "the indwelling of the Spirit" ([[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]), "the witness of the Spirit" ([[John Wesley]]), "the power of God" (early American [[Methodists]]), being "filled with the Spirit of the Lord" (early [[Adventists]]; see [[charismatic Adventism]]), "communing with spirits" ([[Spiritualists]]), "the Christ within" ([[New Thought]]), "streams of holy fire and power" (Methodist [[Holiness movement|holiness]]), "a religion of the Spirit and Power" (the [[Emmanuel Movement]]), and "the baptism of the Holy Spirit" (early [[Pentecostal]]s).{{sfn|Taves|1999|p=3}}

It focuses on a class of seemingly involuntary acts alternately explained in [[religious]] and [[secular]] terminology. These involuntary experiences include uncontrolled bodily movements ([[Seizure|fits]], bodily exercises, falling as dead, [[catalepsy]], [[convulsions]]); spontaneous vocalizations (crying out, shouting, [[speaking in tongues]]); unusual sensory experiences (trances, [[hallucination|visions]], voices, [[clairvoyance]], [[out-of-body experiences]]); and alterations of [[consciousness]] and/or [[memory]] ([[dreams]], [[wikt:somnium|somnium]], [[somnambulism]], mesmeric trance, mediumistic trance, [[hypnotism]], [[spirit possession|possession]], alternating personality).{{sfn|Taves|1999|p=3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/26/books/joyful-noises.html|title=Joyful Noises|last=Everdell|first=William R.|date=1999-12-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anti-establishment''' view or belief is one which stands in opposition to the conventional social, political, and economic principles of a society. The term was first used in the modern sense in 1958, by the [[UK|British]] magazine ''[[New Statesman]]'' to refer to its political and social agenda.&lt;ref&gt;The Compact Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition, Clarendon Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-19-861258-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Antiestablishmentarianism''' (or '''anti-establishmentarianism''') is an expression for such a [[political philosophy]].

The center-right electoral alliance led by League's secretary [[Matteo Salvini]] won a pluralities of seats in both houses.

[[Power to the People (Italy)|Power to the People]], a left-wing to far-left electoral alliance comprising several parties, organizations, associations, committees and [[Self-managed social centers in Italy|social centers]], is also an anti-establishment movement. In its manifesto, membership to Power to the People is described as "[[Social policy|social]] and [[Politics|political]], anti-[[Liberism|liberist]] and [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]], [[Communism|communist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]], [[Feminism|feminist]], [[Secularism|secular]], [[Pacifism|pacifist]], [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[Southern Italy autonomist movements|southernist]] [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]]", whose goal as coalition is "to create real democracy, through daily practices, [[self-governance]] experiments, [[socialisation]] of knowing and popular [[Participatory politics|participation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://poterealpopolo.org/manifesto|title=Manifesto Potere al Popolo|work=Potere al Popolo|access-date=2018-06-04|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 general election]], they obtained 370,320 votes for the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] (1.13%) and 319,094 votes for the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate]] (1.05%), without electing any representatives.

== Anti-establishment figures in the United Kingdom ==
In the UK anti-establishment figures and groups are seen as those who argue or act against the [[ruling class]]. Having an [[established church]], in England,  a [[Royal family|British monarchy]], an [[aristocracy]], and an unelected [[House of Lords|upper house]] in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] made up in part by [[Hereditary peer|hereditary nobles]], the UK has a clearly definable [[The Establishment|Establishment]] against which anti-establishment figures can be contrasted. In particular, [[satire|satirical humour]] is commonly used to undermine the deference shown by the majority of the population towards those who govern them. Examples of British anti-establishment satire include much of the humour of [[Peter Cook]] and [[Ben Elton]]; novels such as [[Rumpole of the Bailey]]; magazines such as [[Private Eye]]; and television programmes like [[Spitting Image]], [[Rumpole of the Bailey]], [[That Was The Week That Was]], and [[The Prisoner]] (see also the [[satire boom]] of the 1960s). Anti-establishment themes also can be seen in the novels of writers such as [[Will Self]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spikemagazine.com/0597self.php|title=Self Destruction|author=Chris Mitchell|work=Spike Magazine|accessdate=20 October 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061101072152/http://www.spikemagazine.com/0597self.php| archivedate= 1 November 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by operating through the arts and media, the line between politics and culture is blurred, so that [[pigeonholing]] figures such as [[Banksy]] as either anti-establishment or counter-culture figures can be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5346822.stm|title=Faces of the week|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 October 2006 | date=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] newspapers such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', are less subtle, and commonly report on the sex-lives of the [[House of Windsor|Royals]] simply because it sells newspapers, but in the process have been described as having anti-establishment views that have weakened traditional institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5385814.stm|title=Prince fears media embarrassment|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 October 2006 | date=27 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, as time passes, anti-establishment figures sometimes end up becoming part of the Establishment, as [[Mick Jagger]], the [[Rolling Stones]] frontman, became a [[Knight]] in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2045813.stm | work=BBC News | title=Jagger: It's only rock 'n' roll | date=12 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when [[The Who]] [[frontman]] [[Roger Daltrey]] was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 2005 in recognition of both his music and his work for charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4249453.stm|title=Who singer Daltrey collects CBE|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 October 2006 | date=9 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The pop term "anti-establishment" in the United States ==
Individuals who were anti-establishment often spoke of "fighting [[the man]]", "selling out to the Establishment", and "tearing down the Establishment." Many well renowned activists and activist groups innovated great changes to society by standing up to "[[the Establishment]]", including the [[MC5]], [[Symbionese Liberation Army]], [[Black Panther Party]], [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Malvina Reynolds]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Howard Zinn]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], [[System of a Down]], K-Rino, [[Immortal Technique]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Terminator X]], [[Gil-Scott Heron]], [[dead prez]], [[Timothy Leary]], [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], and [[Lupe Fiasco]] among others.

The "Establishment" to these, and these anti-establishment activists was not simply the people of the older generation. Dictionary.com defines the establishment as "the existing power structure in society; the dominant groups in society and their customs or institutions; institutional authority",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/establishment|title=The definition of establishment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Merriam-Webster defines the words as "a group of social, economic, and political leaders who form a ruling class"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/establishment|title=Definition of ESTABLISHMENT|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Free Dictionary defines it as "A group of people holding most of the power and influence in a government or society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/establishment|title=Establishment|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social critic and "people's" historian Howard Zinn defines the establishment as "Republicans, Democrats, newspapers [and] television" in his book, ''[[A People's History of the United States]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinnseven20.html|title=The Seventies: Under Control?|work=historyisaweapon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Zinn calls out the "huge military establishment" which one could assume is part of his definition of the "Establishment." In a chapter of the book that expresses Zinn's political theory for the future he defines "the Establishment [as] that uneasy club of business executives, generals, and politicos."&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, Howard. "The Coming Revolt of the Guards." History Is A Weapon. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 March 2012. &lt;http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinncomrev24.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in Zinn's book is a reprinted quote from Samuel Huntington, who was a Harvard University political science professor and White House political consultant, that describes the establishment and the coalition a president should establish upon being elected:
:"...the President act[s]...with the support and cooperation of key individuals and groups in the executive office, the federal bureaucracy, Congress, and the more important businesses, banks, law firms, foundations, and media, which constitute the private sector's "Establishment."...The day after [the President's]...election, the size of his majority is almost — if not entirely — irrelevant to his ability to govern the country. What counts then is his ability to mobilize support from the leaders of key institutions in a society and government. ... This coalition must include key people in Congress, the executive branch, and the private-sector 'Establishment'."&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, Howard. "The Seventies: Under Control?." History Is A Weapon. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 March 2012. &lt;http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinnseven20.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early usage ===
The anti-establishment began in the 1940s and continued through the 1950s. 

Many [[World War II]] [[veteran]]s, who had seen horrors and inhumanities, began to question every aspect of life, including its meaning. Urged to return to "normal lives" and plagued by [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (discussing it was "not manly"), many veterans found [[suburbia]] cloying and empty.

The [[Hells Angels]] were originally composed of WWII veterans feeling rebellious: the name came from WWII fighting units. The image of [[Marlon Brando]] as a motorcycle rebel in ''[[The Wild One]]'' and [[James Dean]] as a ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' horrified some Americans and electrified others. Some veterans, who founded the [[Beat Movement]], were denigrated as ''Beatniks'' and accused of being "downbeat" on everything. [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] wrote a Beat autobiography that cited his wartime service.

Many people craved angry "true" commentary such as Lenny Bruce's acid-tongued comedy, or simply a desire for more personal freedom, even "vices". [[Playboy magazine]], with its famous nudes, was the first [[skin mag]] sold alongside national magazines, and caused a scandal and backlash.

Many women also harbored a deep resentment. During the war years, they had been encouraged to assume men's roles in industry, both [[White-collar worker|white collar]] and [[blue collar]]. [[Rosie the Riveter]] was a national icon. But after the war, women were forced to give up their jobs and become homemakers.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Citizens had also begun to question authority, especially after the Gary Powers [[1960 U-2 incident|U-2 Incident]], wherein President Eisenhower repeatedly assured people the USA was not spying on Russia, then was caught in a blatant lie. This general dissatisfaction was popularized by [[Peggy Lee]]'s laconic pop song "[[Is That All There Is?]]", but remained unspoken and unfocused. It was not until the [[Baby Boomers]] came along in huge numbers that protest became organized (or disorganized in the case of the hippies), who were named by the Beats as "little hipsters".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

=== 1960s ===
"Anti-establishment" became a buzzword of the tumultuous 1960s. Young people raised in comparative luxury saw many wrongs perpetuated by society and began to question "the Establishment". Contentious issues included the ongoing [[Vietnam War]] with no clear goal or end point, the constant military build-up and diversion of funds for the [[Cold War]], perpetual widespread poverty being ignored, money-wasting [[boondoggle (project)|boondoggle]]s like [[pork barrel]] projects and the [[Space Race]], festering race issues, a stultifying education system, repressive laws and harsh sentences for casual [[recreational drug use|drug use]], and a general malaise among the older generation. On the other side, "[[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]]" often regarded questions as accusations, and saw the younger generation as spoiled, drugged-out, sex-crazed, unambitious [[slacker]]s.

Anti-establishment debates were common because they touched on everyday aspects of life. Even innocent questions could escalate into angry diatribes. For example, "Why do we spend millions on a foreign war and a space program when our schools are falling apart?" would be answered with "We need to keep our military strong and ready to stop the Communists from taking over the world." As in any debate, there were valid and unsupported arguments on both sides. "[[Make love not war]]" invoked "America, love it or leave it."

[[File:Ken Westerfield 1977.jpg|thumb|320px|right|As a [[hippie]], [[Ken Westerfield]] helped to popularize [[Frisbee]] as an [[Flying disc games|alternative disc sport]] in the 1960s and 1970s.]]
As the 1960s simmered, the anti-Establishment adopted conventions in opposition to the Establishment. T-shirts and blue jeans became the uniform of the young because their parents wore collar shirts and slacks. Drug use, with its illegal panache, was favored over the legal consumption of alcohol. Promoting peace and love was the antidote to promulgating hatred and war. Living in genteel poverty was more "honest" than amassing a nest egg and a house in the [[suburb]]s. [[Rock and roll|Rock 'n roll]] was played loudly over [[easy listening]]. [[Draft dodger|Dodging the draft]] was passive resistance to traditional [[military service]]. Dancing was free-style, not learned in a ballroom. Over time, anti-establishment messages crept into popular culture: songs, fashion, movies, lifestyle choices, television.

The emphasis on freedom allowed previously hushed conversations about sex, politics, or religion to be openly discussed. A wave of radical liberation movements for minority groups came out of the 1960s, including [[second-wave feminism]]; [[Black Power]], [[Red Power]], and the [[Chicano Movement]]; and [[gay liberation]]. These movements differed from previous efforts to improve minority rights by their opposition to [[respectability politics]] and militant tone. Programs were put in place to deal with inequities: [[Equal Opportunity Employment]], the [[Head Start (education)|Head Start Program]], enforcement of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]], [[desegregation busing|busing]], and others. But the widespread dissemination of new ideas also sparked a backlash and resurgence in conservative religions, new segregated private schools, [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] and [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion legislation]], and other reversals. Extremists tended to be heard more because they made good copy for newspapers and television. In many ways, the angry debates of the 1960s led to modern right-wing talk radio and coalitions for "traditional [[family values]]".

As the 1960s passed, society had changed to the point that the definition of the Establishment had blurred, and the term "anti-establishment" seemed to fall out of use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2049">The '''Applied Information Science in Economics''' is a professional qualification awarded generally in Russian Federation. The degree inherited from the USSR education system also known as [[Specialist degree]], which after the [[Soviet Union]] was extended to 5 years. The degree is awarded after five years of full-time study and includes several internships, course-works, thesis writing and defense. 

The degree has similarities with German Magister Artium or [[Diplom]] degree. However, due to the [[Bologna Process]] number of such degrees are declining.

Historical accounts for early U.S. naval history now occur across the spectrum of two and more centuries. This Bibliography lends itself primarily to [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] covering early U.S. naval history beginning around the [[American Revolution]] period on through the 18th and 19th centuries and includes sources which cover notable naval commanders, Presidents, important ships, major naval engagements and corresponding wars. The bibliography also includes sources that are not committed to the subject of U.S. naval history per se but whose content covers this subject extensively.

Among the contemporary and earlier historical accounts are [[WP:PSTS|primary sources]], historical accounts, often derived from letters, dispatches, government and military records, captain's logs and diaries, etc., written by authors who were involved in or closely associated to the historical episode in question. Primary source material is often collected, compiled and published by other editors also, sometimes many years after the historical subject has passed. Many of the authors are notable and even famous in their own right and are linked to their corresponding biographies.

==Listing and format of sources==
Sources dedicated to or well committed to a subject are listed under that subject/section.
Sources in any given section can often be used for other subjects/section so a link is sometimes provided to those section(s). A few of the more general sources are sometimes duplicated in the various sections where they equally apply. Sections/subjects are listed in chronological order.  For uniformity in the listing, sources in this bibliography employ the format supported by [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Bibliographies#Examples|WikiProject Bibliographies]], presented in the example shown directly below, noting author's ''lastname'' first, etc., year-date of publication, book title in ''italics'', number of pages, ISBN and/or OCLC number (when available):
&lt;center&gt;
*'''Last, First, (1900), ''Book-title'', Publisher, 123 pages, ISBN '''0123...''', Url'''''
&lt;/center&gt;
Primary sources listed in this bibliography are denoted with an uppercase bold ' ('''P''') ' before the book title. Many of the historical accounts were authored by members and ex-members of the U.S. Navy who have not only offered primary accounts but have very often gone on to write about naval history in other general and specific capacities—these sources will be denoted with an  ' ('''N''') ' following the author's name.

Many of the sources are available for searching and viewing online. Copyrighted publications are often offered for partial viewing, while sources in the public domain can be viewed in their entirety and are denoted with '' 'E'book' ''. At this late date most of the publications are now available in PDF and/or EPUB formats.  A link to the publication is included at the end of a given title listing.

As the listings in the various sections are often lengthy, a link to the ''' 'Top' ''' of a given section is provided at the end of that section.

'''Bordels Mobiles de Campagne''' or '''Bordel Militaire de Campagne''' (both abbreviated to '''BMC''') is a [[French language|French]] term for the mobile [[brothel]]s which were used during [[World War I]], [[Second World War]], and [[First Indochina War]] to supply [[prostitution]] services to [[France|French]] [[soldier]]s who were facing combat in areas where brothels were unusual, such as at the [[front line]] or in isolated [[garrison]]s.&lt;ref&gt;World Association of International Studies [http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=2351 article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612081843/http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=2351 |date=2007-06-12 }}, retrieved on March 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tlv"&gt;''The Last Valley'' [[Martin Windrow]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The BMCs gradually generated regulation of prostitution within the French army.

These mobile brothels were in some cases officially organized by the army. They consisted of large trailer trucks in which up to ten women would work.&lt;ref name="iesv"&gt;''The International Encyclopaedia of Sexuality: Vietnam'', retrieved on March 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The first references to these BMC's were in World War I, and they are noted particularly in the Indochina War and the [[Algerian War]]. 

Almost absent in France after World War II, there were many during the Indochina War and the war in Algeria. Subsequently, only the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] still used them.

The tradition of bringing "brothels to soldiers" was started during the [[Third Crusade]] by [[Philip II of France]]. He was so shocked by the extent of sodomy and rapes committed by the Crusaders, he arranged for a full boat of "girls of joy" to be sent from France.&lt;ref name="reynaert"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reynaert|first1=François|title=Dans les bordels de l'armée française|url=https://bibliobs.nouvelobs.com/essais/20140424.OBS5078/dans-les-bordels-de-l-armee-francaise.html|website=Bibliobs|accessdate=15 April 2018|language=fr-FR|date=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first BMCs probably appeared during the period of military control of Algeria (1830-1870), following its conquest by the French army.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; The BMCs remained confined to the army in Africa until the [[First World War]]. BMCs then arrived in France with the arrival of indigenous units from the colonies. The military command not wanting indigenous soldiers to have sex with local women,&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; but especially to try to limit the infection of the troops by [[venereal diseases]], especially [[syphilis]] which was hardly curable at the time. ([[Penicillin]] was only available from 1944). Despite this, four years of war saw the infection of 400,000 men.&lt;ref name="benoit"&gt;{{cite interview |last= Benoit |first= Lieutenant-Colonel Christian  |subjectlink= |interviewer= |title=L'armée a fermé son dernier bordel en 1995 |trans-title= The army closed its last brothel in 1995 |work= |publisher=Guerres &amp; Histoire |location= |date=13 June 2013|language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, no official designation is given to the BMCs. The acronym first appeared in the 1920s with the regulation of signs in the French army, and from then BMCs are mentioned in military documents.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;

Military officials actively provided prostitutes for their troops.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; The "association des maitres et maitresses d'hôtels meublés de France et des colonies" plays an almost official coordinating role. It was governed by a law of 1 July 1901, and located at 73 rue de Nazareth, [[Paris]]. The prostitutes were volunteers.&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Bordel militaire de campagne ferma en 1995|url=http://www.journalducanada.com/le-bordel-militaire-de-campagne-ferma-en-1995-2424-2014/|website=Journal Du Canada|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=fr-FR|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military brothels multiplied during the interwar period,&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; almost every town has a garrison or a regiment with a BMC.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; During the colonial wars, the organisation and attendance of BMC was public knowledge and encouraged by the army, especially in [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]] ("the candy box").&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;  In France brothels were prohibited by "Loi Marthe Richard" in 1946. However, in 1947, the Ministry of the Armed Forces authorised the maintenance of BMC for North African units while stationed in Metropolitan France,&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; the prostitutes for these BMCa coming from Algeria.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;

BMCs, were generally mobile and temporary and should be distinguished from "reserved areas" close to permanent garrisons, such as [[Bousbir|Bousbir de Casablanca]].

French literature has several times mentioned the "Buffalo Park", a BMC in [[Saigon]]. In the Indochina War, the French used women from the [[Ouled Naïl]] tribe of the highlands of [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard B. Fall]], ''[[Street Without Joy#The book|Street Without Joy]]: The French Debacle in Indochina'', Pen &amp; Sword, 1961, p.133, {{ISBN|978-0811732369}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMC's were known to have a significant role in the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s&lt;ref name="iesv"/&gt; and were an avenue of attack by female [[Viet Minh]] sympathizers.&lt;ref&gt;''Vietnam, a war lost and won'', Nigel Cawthorne&lt;/ref&gt; There was a vast BMC in [[Saigon]] known as "the park of the buffaloes", and in January 1954, a BMC containing [[Vietnam]]ese and Algerian prostitutes&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;IHT [http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/04/01/edpringle_ed3_.php article], retrieved on March 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; was flown to [[Dien Bien Phu]].&lt;ref name="tlv"/&gt; Here, the prostitutes became [[nursing assistant]]s for the French garrison during the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|siege]],&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt; though they were sent for reeducation by the Viet Minh after the French garrison fell.&lt;ref name="iht"/&gt;

==Closure==
The last BMC in France, that of the Foreign Legion [[2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment]] in [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]], [[Corsica]] was closed in 1978.&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; The last BMC in [[French territory]], that of the Legion in [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]] closed in 1995&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="france24"&gt;{{cite web|title=France's military brothels: Hidden history of the First World War - France 24|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20141212-france-military-brothels-hidden-history-first-world-war-prostitution|website=France 24|accessdate=27 December 2017|date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kedor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;  (following a complaint by a [[Brazil]]ian [[pimp]] for unfair competition).&lt;ref name="benoit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trouillard|first1=Stéphanie|title=Prostituées et soldats, le couple indissociable de la Grande Guerre|url=http://www.france24.com/fr/20141213-sexe-prostitution-xxx-grande-guerre-bordel-militaire-poilus-soldat-putain-bmc-proxenete-syphilis|website=France 24|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=fr-FR|date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the French territories, the Foreign Legion still had a BMC in the Republic of Djibouti in 2003.&lt;ref name="canard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kedor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

==In film==
* In the film ''RAS'' (1973), directed by [[Yves Boisset]], about the war in Algeria, a sequence shows the arrival of a BMC and its use by the soldiers.
* Stéphane Benhamou's 2013 documentary film, ''Putains de guerre'', contains many sequences and testimonials on BMC, especially in Indochina.

The '''Chemical Society of Japan''' (CSJ) is a [[learned society]] and [[professional association]] founded in 1878 in order to advance research in chemistry.  The mission of the CSJ is to promote chemistry for science and industry in collaboration with other domestic and global societies.&lt;ref name="about_csj"&gt;Chemical Society of Japan (CSJ), [http://www.csj.jp/csj-en/about/about.html  About CSJ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The organization was modeled after the British Chemical Society.  This [[learned society]] in London was the precursor of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]. Like its British counterpart, the Japanese association sought to foster the communication of new ideas and facts throughout Japan and across international borders. &lt;ref name="Lagowski1991"&gt;Lagowski, J. J. (1991). [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ed068p1  "A British Sesquicentennial,"] ''Journal of Chemical Education,'' Vol 68, No. 1, p. 1; acknowledging the sesquicentennial of The Chemical Society in London, which eventually became The [[Royal Society of Chemistry]].&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
Membership was expanded in 1948 in a merger with the Society of Chemical Industry.&lt;ref name="Lagowski1991"/&gt; In 2018 the first woman was announced as president, the distinguished chemist [[Maki Kawai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chemistry.or.jp/en/aboutus/message.html|title=President Message|work=The Chemical Society of Japan|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Activities==
Support for the ''[[Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan]]'' (BCSJ) began in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;CSJ, [http://www.csj.jp/csj-en/journals/bcsj.html history of BCSJ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other publications of the society include:

The '''circuit of culture''' is a theory or framework used in the area of [[cultural studies]]. It was devised in 1997 by a group of theorists when studying the [[Walkman]] cassette player. The theory suggests that in studying a cultural text or artifact you must look at five aspects: its representation, identity, production, consumption and regulation. Du Gay et al. suggest that "taken together (these 5 points) complete a sort of circuit...through which any analysis of a cultural text...must pass if it is to be adequately studied."&lt;ref&gt;du Gay et al. (1997) ''Doing Cultural Studies: The story of the Sony Walkman'' Milton Keynes: Open University; Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerard Goggin openly uses this framework in his book ''Cell Phone Culture: Mobile technology in everyday life'' in order to fully understand the cell phone as a cultural artifact. His book is split into four parts: production, consumption, regulation, and representation and identity (through looking at mobile convergences).&lt;ref&gt; Goggin, Gerard. (2006) ''Cell Phone Culture: Mobile technology in everyday life'' Routledge, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ercolano.JPG|thumb|250px|Ancient [[Herculaneum]] (bottom), modern [[Ercolano]] (center), and [[Vesuvius]] (top)]]
[[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] were once thriving towns, 2,000 years ago, in the Bay of Naples. Though both cities have rich histories influenced by [[Greeks]], [[Oscans]], [[Etruscans]], [[Samnites]] and finally the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], they are most renowned for their destruction: both were buried in the AD 79 eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Paul|title=Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199987436|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5yHWMgEACAAJ&amp;dq=pompeii+herculaneum+ad+79&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For over 1,500 years, these cities were left in remarkable states of preservation underneath volcanic ash, mud and rubble. The eruption completely obliterated the towns but ironically was the cause of their longevity and survival over the centuries.

However, for both cities, excavation has brought with it deterioration, as both natural forces and human activity (whether accidental or deliberate) have played their part in the slow disintegration of the sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amery|first1=Colin|last2=Curran|first2=Brian|title=The Lost World of Pompeii|date=2002|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=9780892366873|page=35|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dO0mxAefnFEC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=pompeii+herculaneum+excavation+destruction&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnv-HPlMjWAhWQb1AKHdsWAecQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=pompeii%20herculaneum%20excavation%20destruction&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems range from paintings being exposed to light and buildings being worn away by weathering, erosion and water damage to inappropriate excavation and reconstruction methods to outright theft and vandalism. As stated by Henri de Saint-Blanquat:

{{cquote|The city's second existence began with its gradual rediscovery in the 18th century. But just when Pompeii was being rediscovered, it began to die its second death. Not only because the early excavations, carried out over two hundred years ago and again in the 19th century, often turned out to be more of a massacre — what fun to carry off statues and fling around inscribed bronze plaques! — but also because all the remains preserved by the catastrophic explosion, were now exposed to the extremes of the weather, to vegetation and to man... Pompeii suffers from pollution, the worst forms of damage are of human origin.|20px|20px|Henri de Saint-Blanquat|''Science et Avenir''}}

The ancient city was included in the [[1996 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]], and again in [[1998 World Monuments Watch|1998]] and in [[2000 World Monuments Watch|2000]]. In 1996, the organization claimed that Pompeii "desperately need[ed] repair" and called for the drafting of a general plan of restoration and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;World Monuments Fund, [http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/Watch_Catalog_1996.pdf ''List of 100 Most Endangered Sites - 1996''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320153209/http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/Watch_Catalog_1996.pdf |date=2013-03-20 }}, New York, NY: 1996, p. 31.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems of conservation==
While the excavation of the cities has led to a wealth of information on the two towns and on Roman life in general, it has also allowed the sites to come under the attack of the elements. Some of this is unpreventable; however, much of it can be slowed or completely stopped through human intervention. Unfortunately, funding is in such a state that not everything can be saved. An estimated US$335 million is needed to carry out all the works necessary in Pompeii alone. 
===Weathering and erosion===
Pompeii and Herculaneum have been excavated for centuries (excavations began in 1738 in Herculaneum, and later in 1748), and all exposed structures have been affected by general deterioration over time. In particular, since the eruption disrupted many of the buildings, excavation has left them unstable and vulnerable to collapse, such as the town wall of Pompeii. In many places, walls have partially collapsed, and much of the site is closed to visitors because of the danger it poses to them.

Many artifacts themselves are also damaged by natural processes. In Herculaneum, the carbonised remains of objects, once exposed to the air, deteriorated within days. Only when a substance ([[lampblack]]) was applied were they able to survive in the open. Also in Herculaneum, the bones of hundreds of victims found at the beach have been left in the open air due to a lack of funding, and are steadily disintegrating.

[[File:Roman fresco Villa dei Misteri Pompeii 011.jpg|left|thumb|250px|This fresco of a girl's initiation into the cult of [[Dionysos]] shows not only damage before and during the eruption, but also a distinct fade in the lustre of the paint caused from exposure after excavation. Flash photography is prohibited to inhibit further deterioration.]]

====Light exposure====
The frescoes, sculptures and paintings prevalent in both towns were highly preserved, retaining a large amount of detail, colour and vibrancy. Unfortunately, on excavation, they began to fade due to exposure to natural light, as well as beginning to crumble and pull away from the walls. However, these issues can be resolved through simple conservation techniques: earlier organic methods of preservation proved effective, and a more modern method using aluminium and plastic has had even better results. In addition, detailed reproductions have been made of many of the artworks, such as the [[Alexander Mosaic]] in the House of the Faun.

Not all actions taken to preserve structures and artefacts have been effective, however, and some have caused more damage. For example, perspex cases have been constructed to protect frescoes and graffiti, however this creates a humidity trap and causes damage to the plaster.

====Plants and animals====
The region of [[Campania]] in which both sites lie is very temperate and fertile, so many plants thrive even inside the archaeological site. Henri de Saint-Blanquat identifies thirty-one parasitic plants in Pompeii, which, after growing in patches of bare earth, grow outward and attack the surrounding buildings, as well as dislodging tiles and mosaics. In particular, ivy grows along the walls, making parts crumble, and the roots undermine the foundations of the buildings. In regions traversed by tourists, their feet trample the plants; in closed-off areas, particularly those closest to unexcavated parts of the cities, this severely damages the buildings.

[[File:Pompeii - Via dell'Abbondanza.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The buildings on the left show signs of decay due to the infestation of various plants, while the debris accumulating on the footpath indicates erosion of the infrastructure. The footpaths and road have also been worn down by pedestrian activity since excavation.]]

Feral dogs were particularly an issue in Pompeii. The dogs which occupied buildings around the Forum in the 1980s have been removed. Hundreds lived on the site, inadvertently damaging footpaths, roads and walls, as well as proving aggressive towards some tourists.

In Herculaneum, pigeons are a particular problem; the acidic nature of their feces wears away the roofs and walls of many structures. Italian law prohibits them from being shot.

=== Human activity ===
====Early excavations====
Particularly in Herculaneum, the earliest excavations revolved around collecting valuable artifacts and antiquities rather than systematic excavation. By merely digging for objects with [[aesthetic]] and commercial value, they were taken from being [[In situ#Archaeology|in situ]] to private collections, and thus much of the information on them was lost. Additionally, other objects not considered worthy by pursuers of [[Antiquarian]]ism were destroyed, or damaged in the process of retrieving other items.

These valuable objects, once discovered, were also disorganised and lost all historical meaning: a collection of bronze letters originally fixed on a wall in Herculaneum, once removed by the [[House of bourbon|Bourbon kings]], were taken out of order without recording the original placement or meaning. Visitors were invited to re-arrange them to form their own messages. A similar usage was made of bones: they would often be arranged together as composites of bones of several individuals, even combining those of children with adults and giving some literally two left feet. These would then be displayed for dramatic effect. Some of these remain today, but there is little hope of re-forming the original skeletons or using them to discover information on the inhabitants of Pompeii or Herculaneum.

====Reconstruction efforts====
[[Amedeo Maiuri]], director of Pompeii and Herculaneum from 1924 to 1961, was intent on re-creating the "atmosphere" of the two towns as they were just prior to the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. Though some directors before him had taken limited steps towards this, Maiuri was motivated to reconstruct much of the infrastructure of the two towns. This meant rebuilding walls and roofs that had been knocked down by the eruption to reproduce the facade of the towns. This was particularly important in Pompeii, where the roofs and anything more than two metres above ground level were destroyed by the eruption.

Unfortunately, the materials used in this reconstruction were mostly concrete and steel. The mix of the cement was particularly bad in many places, and the alkaline in the masonry reacted with the ancient stones, causing crumbling and erosion to walls of structures such as the House of the Coloured Capitals, as well as peeling off any existing paint.
 
After the 1980s, these materials used in reconstruction were replaced by more modern ones which would not react badly with the original work, and the old reconstructions are being gradually replaced; however, the damage has already been done in most places, and the replacement endeavours will take many more years to complete.

====Tourism====
[[Tourism]] has been a mixed blessing for the site. As there are 2.5 million visitors to both cities every year, their presence allows for education on the conservation issues on the site. Additionally, a law was passed in Italy in 1997, which allowed for all money raised from these tourists to be directly channeled to helping with the conservation of the site.

However, the massive number of tourists also causes many problems. The general movement of them causes the gradual wearing down of the roads and pavements, particularly in the more frequented areas like the Pompeiian [[forum (Roman)|Forum]] complex. Tourists also might take chips of rock or stone from the site, as well as accidentally brushing against the walls and frescoes, further increasing their rate of deterioration. The open nature of both sites to tourists is also a leading cause in vandalism and theft.

[[File:Pompeii - Temple of Venus.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Fencing in the temple of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] in Pompeii prevents vandalism of the site, as well as theft - many tourists obtain small artefacts from both cities as souvenirs.]]

====Vandalism and war====
Vandalism, particularly graffiti, is a problematic issue for Pompeii and Herculaneum. Tourists and others often break off parts of the city's structures to take home as mementos or souvenirs. Graffiti appears inscribed in the walls (often alongside their [[Graffiti#Ancient graffiti|ancient counterparts]]) as well as on paintings and frescoes, particularly the less damaged or unsullied works of art.  The site was also bombed by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air forces during the [[Second World War]], and many of its buildings needed to be reconstructed in the postwar period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/pompeii/interactives/bombing/index.html The Last Days of Pompeii (Getty Villa Exhibitions)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theft====
While both areas are guarded, many artifacts still find their way to the [[illicit antiquities]] market. Often these acts of theft also cause accidental damage to surrounding objects, and the thieved antiquities are no longer [[In situ#Archaeology|''in situ'']] and lose their context and cultural associations.

In 2003, two frescoes were hacked off a wall in the House of the Chaste Lovers in Pompeii. This act of theft also damaged several other frescoes in the house, and, though a camera system exists in Pompeii, it had been out of operation for several months when the event took place. These frescoes were recovered some months later, but many others have disappeared from the site, never to be returned.

==House of the Gladiators collapse==
The 2,000-year-old “House of the Gladiators” in the ruins of ancient Pompeii collapsed on 6 November 2010. Known officially by its Latin name “Schola Armatorum ” the structure was not open to visitors but was visible from the outside as tourists walked along one of the ancient city’s main streets. There was no immediate word on what caused the building to collapse, although reports suggested water infiltration following heavy rains might be responsible. There has been fierce controversy regarding the collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2010/11/06/16003236.html |title=Pompeii collapse prompts charges of official neglect }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Pompeii-Gladiator-Centre-Collapses-At-Archaeological-Site-In-Southern-Italy-Cause-Not-Yet-Known/Article/201011115796320?lpos=World_News_First_Home_Page_Feature_Teaser_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15796320_Pompeii_Gladiator_Centre_Collapses_At_Archaeological_Site_In_Southern_Italy%2C_Cause_Not_Yet_Known |title=Pompeii Gladiator Training Centre Collapses |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113083136/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Pompeii-Gladiator-Centre-Collapses-At-Archaeological-Site-In-Southern-Italy-Cause-Not-Yet-Known/Article/201011115796320?lpos=World_News_First_Home_Page_Feature_Teaser_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15796320_Pompeii_Gladiator_Centre_Collapses_At_Archaeological_Site_In_Southern_Italy%2C_Cause_Not_Yet_Known |archivedate=2010-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation projects==
There are many conservation projects, endeavours and enterprises associated with both cities in an attempt to prevent further deterioration. These focus on removing the forces that attack the sites, as well as restoring the damaged artefacts and preventing further destruction.

[[File:Pompeii - Conservation Work on Via dell'Abbondanza.jpg|right|thumb|200px|This site of conservation work on the Via dell'Abbondanza (Street of Abundance) is part of a larger project by the Soprintendenza Archaeologica di Pompeii to restore the [[facade]]s and frescoes of many buildings on the street.]]

===Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Napoli e Pompeii===
The Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Napoli e Pompeii is the major administrative body of both sites and others in the Naples and Vesuvuian area. It has overall responsibility for caring for both ancient cities, managing the sites, conserving them, working towards the removal of plants, providing security to prevent further theft, administering tourist entry into the site and reconstructing various buildings. It also directs many other subsidiary projects, and controls all funding and access to the two cities. Projects such as the restoration of frescoes and sculptures in Pompeii are run by the institute. Additionally, modern technology is used to help in conservation; in 2006, a laser survey was created of the Forum complex, allowing a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]], digital reconstruction.

===Moratorium===
In 1999, Pietro Giovanni Guzzo declared a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on all further excavations of both sites. As then superintendent, he decided that all funds should be diverted into preserving the remains of both cities, rather than excavating more when massive amounts of work is still needed on the areas already unearthed. This has caused controversy amongst historians and archaeologists, and has become the centre of the debate on whether to focus on conservation or excavation. Classicists argue that only by continuing excavations can more ancient texts be found to reveal more about ancient Roman life. In particular, they pin their hopes on the unexcavated chamber of the [[Villa of the Papyri]], where over 1,800 carbonised [[Herculaneum papyri|papyrus rolls]] have been discovered containing works of [[Epicureanism|Epicurean philosophy]] by Philodemus. However, those in favour of conservation argue that the texts are much safer underground than exposed and we still have much to draw from what has already been excavated.

Minor excavations, such as that of the House of the Surgeon currently being undertaken by the Anglo-American Project at Pompeii at a cost of 10 million euro a year, are still allowed. However, no new sites are open to be excavated.

===Herculaneum Conservation Project===
As a joint project led by the [[Packard Humanities Institute]] and the Soprintendenza Speciale per I Beni Archaeologici di Napoli e Pompeii with the British School at Rome, the project has worked since 2001 to halt the serious decay conditions which were found at the site. Initially the work focused on an emergency campaign which then transformed into works to ensure the long-term maintenance of the site. A major emphasis has been placed on ensuring that infrastructures work effectively so that when the project is completed, the Soprintendenza will be in a good position to manage the continuous care of the site. In addition scientific research is under way so that suitable methodologies can be identified to conserve Herculaneum's wall paintings, plasters, mosaics, wooden features, structures, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Fall and Rise and Fall of Pompeii|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/fall-rise-fall-pompeii-180955732/?no-ist|accessdate = 2015-07-01|first = Joshua|last = Hammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2374">'''Diatonic set theory''' is a subdivision or application of [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] which applies the techniques and [[musical analysis|insights]] of [[discrete mathematics]] to properties of the [[diatonic collection]] such as [[maximal evenness]], [[Myhill's property]], [[well formed generated collection|well formedness]], the [[deep scale property]], [[cardinality equals variety]], and [[structure implies multiplicity]]. The name is something of a misnomer as the concepts involved usually apply much more generally, to any periodically repeating scale.

Music theorists working in diatonic set theory include [[Eytan Agmon]], [[Gerald J. Balzano]], [[Norman Carey]], [[David Clampitt]], [[John Clough (music theorist)|John Clough]], [[Jay Rahn]], and mathematician [[Jack Douthett]]. A number of key concepts were first formulated by [[David Rothenberg]], who published in the journal ''Mathematical Systems Theory'', and [[Erv Wilson]], working entirely outside of the academic world.

An '''academic discipline''' or '''academic field''' is a [[Branch (academia)|branch]] of [[knowledge]]. It incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with a given scholastic subject area or college department. For example, the branches of science are commonly referred to as the scientific disciplines, e.g. [[physics]], [[mathematics]], and [[biology]].

Individuals associated with academic disciplines are commonly referred to as ''[[expert]]s'' or ''specialists''. Others, who may have studied [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]] or [[systems theory]] rather than concentrating in a specific academic discipline, are classified as ''generalists''.

While academic disciplines in and of themselves are more or less focused practices, scholarly approaches such as [[Interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinarity]], [[interdisciplinarity]], [[transdisciplinarity]], and [[cross-disciplinarity]] integrate aspects from multiple academic disciplines, therefore addressing any problems that may arise from narrow concentration within specialized fields of study. For example, professionals may encounter trouble communicating across academic disciplines because of differences in language or specified concepts.

Some researchers believe that academic disciplines may be replaced by what is known as [[Mode 2]]&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, Michael; Camille Limoges, Helga Nowotny, Simon Schwartzman, Peter Scott, &amp; Martin Trow (1994). ''The New Production of Knowledge: The Dynamics of Science and Research in Contemporary Societies''. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; or "post-academic science",&lt;ref&gt;Ziman, John (2000). ''Real Science: What It Is, and What It Means''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which involves the acquisition of cross-disciplinary knowledge through collaboration of specialists from various academic disciplines.

==History of the concept==
The [[University of Paris]] in 1231 consisted of four [[Faculty (division)|faculties]]: [[Theology]], [[Medicine]], [[Canon Law]] and [[Liberal Arts|Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;''History of Education'', Encyclopædia Britannica (1977, 15th edition), Macropaedia Volume 6, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational institutions originally used the term "discipline" to catalog and archive the new and expanding body of information produced by the scholarly community. Disciplinary designations originated in German Universities during the beginning of the nineteenth century.

Most academic disciplines have their roots in the mid-to-late-nineteenth century [[secularization]] of universities, when the traditional [[curriculum|curricula]] were supplemented with non-classical languages and [[literatures]], [[social sciences]] such as [[political science]], [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[public administration]], and [[natural science]] and [[technology]] disciplines such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[engineering]].

In the early twentieth century, new academic disciplines such as [[education]] and [[psychology]] were added. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an explosion of new academic disciplines focusing on specific themes, such as [[media studies]], [[women's studies]], and [[Africana studies]]. Many academic disciplines designed as preparation for careers and professions, such as [[nursing]], [[Hospitality management studies|hospitality management]], and [[corrections]], also emerged in the universities. Finally, interdisciplinary scientific fields of study such as [[biochemistry]] and [[geophysics]] gained prominence as their contribution to knowledge became widely recognized.

As the twentieth century approached, these designations were gradually adopted by other countries and became the accepted conventional subjects. However, these designations differed between various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jacques Revel |authorlink1=History and the Social Sciences |editor1-last=Porter |editor1-first=Theodore |editor2-last=Ross |editor2-first=Dorothy |title=Cambridge History of Science: The Modern Social Sciences |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521594421 |pages=391–404 |chapter=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, the natural science disciplines included: [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], and [[astronomy]]. The social science disciplines included: [[economics]], [[politics]], [[sociology]], and [[psychology]].

Prior to the twentieth century, categories were broad and general, which was expected due to the lack of interest in science at the time. With rare exceptions, practitioners of science tended to be amateurs and were referred to as "natural historians" and "natural philosophers"—labels that date back to Aristotle—instead of "scientists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How The Word 'Scientist' Came To Be |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127037417 |website=npr.org |publisher=National Public Radio |accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural history referred to what we now call life sciences and natural philosophy referred to the current physical sciences.

Few opportunities existed for science as an occupation outside the educational system. Higher education provided the institutional structure for scientific investigation, as well as economic support. Soon, the volume of scientific information rapidly increased and people realized the importance of concentrating on smaller fields of scientific activity. Because of this, scientific specializations emerged. As these specializations developed, modern scientific disciplines in universities also improved. Eventually, academia's identified disciplines became the foundations for people of specific specialized interests and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cohen |first1=E |last2=Lloyd |first2=S |title=Disciplinary Evolution and the Rise of Transdiscipline |url=http://www.inform.nu/Articles/Vol17/ISJv17p189-215Cohen0702.pdf |publisher=Informing Science: the International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions and criticism==
A very influential critique of the concept of academic disciplines came from [[Michel Foucault]] in his 1975 book, ''Discipline and Punish''. Foucault asserts that academic disciplines originate from the same social movements and mechanisms of control that established the modern prison and penal system in eighteenth-century [[France]], and that this fact reveals essential aspects they continue to have in common: "The disciplines characterize, classify, specialize; they distribute along a scale, around a norm, hierarchize individuals in relation to one another and, if necessary, disqualify and invalidate." (Foucault, 1975/1979, p 223.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1977). Discipline and Punish: The birth of the prison. Trans. Alan Sheridan. New York: Vintage.(Translation of: Surveiller et punir; naissance de la prison. [Paris] : Gallimard, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Communities of academic disciplines==
'''Communities of academic disciplines''' can be found outside academia within corporations, government agencies, and independent organizations, where they take the form of associations of professionals with common interests and specific knowledge. Such communities include corporate [[think tanks]], [[NASA]], and [[IUPAC]]. Communities such as these exist to benefit the organizations affiliated with them by providing specialized new ideas, research, and findings.

Nations at various developmental stages will find need for different academic disciplines during different times of growth. A newly developing nation will likely prioritize government and political matters over those of the arts and sciences. On the other hand, a well-developed nation may be capable of investing more into the arts and sciences. Communities of academic disciplines would contribute at varying levels of importance during different stages of development.

==Interactions==
These categories explain how the different academic disciplines interact with one another.

===Multidisciplinary===
{{main|Multidisciplinary approach}}
'''Multidisciplinary''' knowledge is associated with more than one existing academic discipline or profession.

A multidisciplinary community or project is made up of people from different academic disciplines and professions. These people are engaged in working together as equal stakeholders in addressing a common challenge. A multidisciplinary person is one with degrees from two or more academic disciplines. This one person can take the place of two or more people in a multidisciplinary community. Over time, multidisciplinary work does not typically lead to an increase or a decrease in the number of academic disciplines. One key question is how well the challenge can be decomposed into subparts, and then addressed via the distributed knowledge in the community. The lack of shared vocabulary between people and communication overhead can sometimes be an issue in these communities and projects. If challenges of a particular type need to be repeatedly addressed so that each one can be properly decomposed, a multidisciplinary community can be exceptionally efficient and effective.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

There are many examples of a particular idea appearing in different academic disciplines, all of which came about around the same time. One example of this scenario is the shift from the approach of focusing on sensory awareness of the whole, "an attention to the 'total field{{'"}}, a "sense of the whole pattern, of form and function as a unity", an "integral idea of structure and configuration". This has happened in art (in the form of cubism), physics, poetry, communication and educational theory. According to [[Marshall McLuhan]], this paradigm shift was due to the passage from the era of mechanization, which brought sequentiality, to the era of the instant speed of electricity, which brought simultaneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=McLuhan: Understanding Media |authorlink=Marshall McLuhan |year=1964 |work=[[Understanding Media]] |page=13 |url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208070250/http://georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |archivedate=December 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multidisciplinary approaches also encourage people to help shape the innovation of the future. The political dimensions of forming new multidisciplinary partnerships to solve the so-called societal Grand Challenges were presented in the Innovation Union and in the European Framework Programme, the [[Horizon 2020]] operational overlay. Innovation across academic disciplines is considered the pivotal foresight of the creation of new products, systems, and processes for the benefit of all societies' growth and wellbeing. Regional examples such as Biopeople and industry-academia initiatives in translational medicine such as SHARE.ku.dk in Denmark provides the evidence of the successful endeavour of multidisciplinary innovation and facilitation of the paradigm shift.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Interdisciplinary===
{{main|Interdisciplinarity}}
"Interdisciplinary activity on a campus is a day-to-day mode of research (or study) where, in order to do the best work, each researcher's work demands the use of ideas, concepts, materials or instruments from one or more other disciplines. Such research is usually directed to a specified goal or mission."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rustum Roy]] (1979) "Interdisciplinary science on campus", pp. 161–96 in ''Interdisciplinarity and Higher Education'', J.J. Kockelmans editor, [[The Pennsylvania State University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcedisciplinary===
{{main|Transdisciplinarity}}
In practice, '''transcedisciplinary''' can be thought of as the union of all interdisciplinary efforts. While interdisciplinary teams may be creating new knowledge that lies between several existing disciplines, a transcedisciplinary team is more holistic and seeks to relate all disciplines into a coherent whole.

===Cross-disciplinary===
'''Cross-disciplinary''' knowledge is that which explains aspects of one discipline in terms of another. Common examples of cross-disciplinary approaches are studies of the [[physics]] of [[music]] or the [[politics]] of [[literature]].

==Bibliometric studies of disciplines==
[[Bibliometrics]] can be used to map several issues in relation to disciplines, for example the flow of ideas within and among disciplines (Lindholm-Romantschuk, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm-Romantschuk, Y. (1998). Scholarly book reviewing in the social sciences and humanities. The flow of ideas within and among disciplines. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or the existence of specific national traditions within disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlsson, H. (1999). Is there a Scandinavian psychology? A bibliometric note on the publication profiles of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. [[Scandinavian Journal of Psychology]], 40, 235–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly impact and influence of one discipline on another may be understood by analyzing the flow of citations.&lt;ref&gt;Serenko, A. &amp; Bontis, N. (2013). [http://aserenko.com/papers/Serenko_Bontis_2013_JKM_KM_Core.pdf The intellectual core and impact of the knowledge management academic discipline.] Journal of Knowledge Management, 17(1), 137–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bibliometrics approach is described as straightforward because it is based on simple counting. The method is also objective but the quantitative method may not be compatible with a qualitative assessment and therefore manipulated. The number of citations is dependent on the number of persons working in the same domain instead of inherent quality or published result’s originality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidelines.kaowarsom.be/bibliometrics|title=Bibliometrics {{!}} The Guidelines project|website=www.guidelines.kaowarsom.be|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Dmanisi skull''', also known as '''Skull 5''' or '''D4500''', is one of five ''[[Homo erectus]]'' skulls discovered in [[Dmanisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Described in a publication in October 2013, it is estimated to be about 1.8 million years old and is the most complete skull of a [[Pleistocene]] ''[[Homo]]'' species,&lt;ref name=article&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Complete Skull from Dmanisi, Georgia, and the Evolutionary Biology of Early Homo |author=David Lordkipanidze, Marcia S.

The skull has been the cause of a paleontological controversy that is still ongoing as of 2017: many hominin fossils thought to be from different species such as ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'' or ''[[Homo habilis]]'' may not have been separate species at all. Rather, they may have been a single evolving [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]].&lt;ref name=nature /&gt;

== Discovery of the skull ==
[[File:Dmanissi, Georgia ; Homo georgicus 1999 discovery map.png|thumb|[[Dmanisi]] geographical localization in the middle of the [[Caucasus]]]]
In 1991, Georgian scientist [[David Lordkipanidze]] found traces of early human occupation in the cave at [[Dmanisi]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]: a hamlet and an [[archaeological site]] about {{convert|90|km|mi}} southwest of the country's capital, [[Tbilisi]]. Since then, five early hominin skulls have been discovered at the site. '''Skull 5''', found in 2005, is the most complete specimen of them all. After further analysis, it was coupled with its [[mandible]] (D2600) found 5 years earlier. The final analysis of the discovery took many years and was only published in 2013.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

== Description of the skull ==
[[File:Amb. Bass-with D.Lordkipanidze at Dmanisi.JPG|thumb|[[David Lordkipanidze]] (centre) on the archeological site at [[Dmanisi]], 2010]]
Despite a brain volume the size of a large [[Australopithecus]] male, ({{convert|546|cm3|in3}}) all the characteristics of [[Homo erectus]] are clearly visible on '''Skull 5'''. The [[Neurocranium|braincase]] sizes of the other Dmanisi skulls are between {{convert|601|cm3|in3}} and {{convert|730|cm3|in3}}.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

The cranial superstructures of '''Skull 5''', which are prominent and massive, suggest that it was probably a male. Its face is one of the largest of any human ancestor discovered to date.&lt;ref name=article/&gt; The [[zygomatic arch]]es are massive with the right one displaying many traces of deformations, probably due to fractures and injuries. Researchers estimate that the height of the individual was between {{convert|146|cm|ft}} and {{convert|166|cm|ft}} and his weight between {{convert|47|kg|lb}} and {{convert|50|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name=article /&gt;

== Dating ==
[[File:Dmanisi_stone_tool_1.jpg|thumb|Stone tools found on the [[Dmanisi]] [[paleontological]] site]]
Until the 1980s, scientists assumed that [[hominins]] had been restricted to the African continent for the whole of the [[Early Pleistocene]] (until about 0.8 [[Megaannum#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]), only migrating out during a phase named [[Out of Africa I]]. Thus, the vast majority of archaeological effort was disproportionately focused on Africa.&lt;ref name = "Lahr 2010"&gt;Lahr, M.M., 2010. “Saharan Corridors and Their Role in the Evolutionary Geography of ‘Out of Africa I’”. In: A. Baden et al. (Eds.), Out of Africa I: The First Hominin Colonization of Eurasia. Springer Netherlands, 27–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The  Dmanisi archeological site is the earliest hominin site out of Africa and the analysis of its [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] showed that some hominins, chiefly the ''[[Homo erectus#Homo erectus georgicus|Homo erectus georgicus]]'' had left [[Africa]] as far back as 1.85 million years ago. All of the 5 skulls are roughly the same age.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

Consequently, the paleontological significance of the [[Radiocarbon dating|dating]] of the Dmanisi skulls is major. It is worth noting that it was not associated with the discovery of skull 5, but with another specimen found at the same site, the [[D2700|Dmanisi Skull 3]], also known as D2700.

== Controversy and significance of the discovery==

The Dmanisi skulls, especially '''Skull 5''' with its comparatively tiny {{convert|546|cm3|in3}} brain compared to other skulls found at the site, suggests that the earliest species of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' were actually subspecies of the species ''erectus''.&lt;ref name=article /&gt; The variation in [[Morphology (archaeology)|morphology]] of all the Dmanisi skulls is so large that had they been discovered on different archaeological sites, they most likely would have been classified as different species. However, all Dmanisi skulls have the same age and have been found at exactly the same place.

Faced with the wide variation between '''Skull 5''' and the other Dmanisi skulls, Georgian and University of Zurich researchers were prompted to examine normal variations in modern human skulls and chimpanzees skulls. They found that while they looked different from one another, the great variations among all Dmanisi skulls were no greater than those seen among modern people and among chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=article /&gt; Consequently, it was entirely possible that such a discrepancy could be found in ''Homo erectus''.

This discovery led the scientists to suggest that two species of early hominins, ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'' and  ''[[Homo habilis]]'', were actually both ''[[Homo erectus]]''.&lt;ref name=nature /&gt; This is an ongoing debate among the scientific community.&lt;ref name=National_Geographic&gt;{{cite news |last=Switek |first=Brian |date=17 October 2013 |title= Beautiful Skull Spurs Debate on Human History |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131017-skull-human-origins-dmanisi-georgia-erectus/ |newspaper= National Geographic |accessdate=22 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In dominator culture, men rule over women, whereas partnership culture values men and women equally. Other theorists, including [[Terence McKenna]] and [[bell hooks]], have expanded on the implications and impact of dominator culture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=Atria Books|year=2003|isbn=0743456084|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food of the Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge|last=McKenna|first=Terence|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1993|isbn=0553371304|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They, among others, argue that adherence to the dominator model over the partnership model denies the possibility of a more equal society, systematically allowing for the persecution of those who are “dominated”—including racial and ethnic minorities, LGBT people, and women.

== Concept and terminology ==
Riane Eisler presents dominator culture as a cultural construction of the roles and relations of women and men, where men “dominate,” or are in control within society. Regardless of the location, time period, religious beliefs, or advancements in technology, a society might follow the dominator culture model. Eisler characterizes dominator culture as featuring four core elements:
* an authoritarian social and family structure
* rigid male dominance
* a high level of violence and abuse
* and a system of beliefs that normalizes such a society&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisler|first=Riane|year=2015|title=Human Possibilities: The Interaction of Biology and Culture|url=http://pubs.lib.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=ijps|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Partnership Studies|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The dominator model is framed in contrast to the partnership model. In a sort of reversal of the elements of dominator culture, the partnership model is characterized by:
* organization according to the ideals of a democratic structure
* equal partnership between men and women
* a lack of tolerance for abuse and violence
* and belief systems that validate an empathetic perspective&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
By juxtaposing dominator culture with partnership culture, Eisler creates a continuum between the two. She argues that where a society falls on this spectrum influences its culture, beliefs, and actions. Adherence to dominator culture affects people from a personal to a public level, as seen in its societal impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Historical context ===

The prevalence of dominator culture has shifted over time. Eisler claims that, in the prehistory of humans, partnership used to be the norm. In both the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods, there are examples of matriarchal societies preceding patriarchies. British archeologist [[James Mellaart]], for example, reported a Neolithic site with many female images and no signs of destructive warfare for almost 1000 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For thousands of years, people lived in these peaceful partnership societies, until warlike nomadic tribes disrupted the balance with their dominator cultures. Since then, fluctuations between dominator and partnership societies have occurred over time, but the primary shift has been towards dominator culture.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewarticle.asp?id=34997|title=Dominator v Partnership Societies and Relationships|last=Hollick|first=Malcolm|date=2007|website=Author's Den|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2017}}

== Societal impact ==
Dominator culture impacts the way a society appears and functions. Riane Eisler posits that “narratives about our cultural origins,” like dominator culture, “reflect and guide how we think, feel, and act.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though no culture is fully dominator or fully partnership in its construction, the degree to which it aligns with one of these models impacts the beliefs, institutions, and relationships of that society.

=== Gender inequalities ===
The main distinction between the dominator and partnership models, according to Eisler, is their treatment of the relationships between men and women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She argues that, historically, men have been the dominators, leading to [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society that upholds constricting, traditional gender roles. Surveys by anthropologists Peggy R. Sanday and Scott Coltrane support this connection, showing the correlation between a society’s structure and the expectations for men and women. They found that greater equality between men and women led to greater male involvement in childcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Female Power and Male Dominance: On the Origins of Sexual Inequality|last=Sanday|first=Peggy R.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1981|isbn=0521280753|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because dominator culture upholds a harsh division between masculinity and femininity, it dissociates masculinity from anything stereotypically feminine—even at the expense of benefits such as those reported by Sanday and Coltrane. Accordingly, in these societies that prize domination and power, the societal value for qualities like empathy, caregiving, and nonviolence diminishes. Instead, by viewing femininity as undesirable and inferior, these dominator societies accept and perpetuate violent and inequitable behavior.

=== Power disparities ===
In dominator culture, society reinforces such hierarchies by presenting the dominator model as the natural order of society. According to Eisler, some sociobiologists and psychologists claim that male dominance is inherent in human genes and a product of evolution, demonstrating dominator thinking.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Theorist bell hooks has expanded on this, indicating that dominator culture “teaches us that we are all natural-born killers but that males are more able to realize the predator role.” &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By accepting male dominance as a genetic imperative, society justifies a dominator structure. Consequently, this situates the desire to overpower and control others as part of human identity, according to hooks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This hierarchical disparity is not only explained genetically but societally reinforced, extending to “power” more generally. Although Eisler often distinguishes between the two models on the basis of gender, she also applies these hierarchies more broadly to other societal constructions of power, like race, class, and age. Terence McKenna, a friend of Eisler’s and fellow writer, asserts that Eisler's book ''The Chalice and the Blade'' “de-genderized the terminology,” framing it as a contrast between dominator and partnership ideologies, rather than just an indictment of patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archaic Revival|last=McKenna|first=Terence|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1992|isbn=0062506137|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting this interpretation, Eisler argues that society’s requirement of children to be submissive and obedient to their parents reflects the influence of dominator culture. Dominator culture encourages the ideology, from childhood, that one either dominates or is dominated. Accordingly, dominator culture not only equates the difference between men and women to superiority and inferiority, but rather “frame[s] all relationships as power struggles."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Historical and cultural implications ==
Dominator culture has had varying manifestations in society throughout the course of human history, from the prehistoric warlike tribes of the Neolithic era to present-day displays. The dominator structure of society dictates and shapes the culture that accompanies it. Other authors have used, expanded on, and interpreted Riane Eisler’s idea of dominator culture to apply it to a wide range of fields, as far-reaching as nursing, war, language learning, economics, and [[ecofeminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bortoluzzi|first=Maria|year=2003|title=Language Learning Approaches and Some Aspects of the Partnership Model|url=http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/mlaib/docview/53789232/B3BCFF0A700B46ABPQ/1?accountid=4485|journal=The Art of Partnership: Essays on Literature, Culture, Language, and Education Towards a Cooperative Paradigm|volume=|pages=159–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirk|first=Mary|year=2010|title=Review: The Real Wealth of Nations|url=|journal=Feminist Teacher|volume=20|pages=266–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical and cultural manifestations ===

Author Malcolm Hollick cites [[Nazi Germany]], Stalinist Russia, and Islamic fundamentalist states as modern, though severe, examples of dominator societies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2017}} The Nazi claim to power, for example, was also accompanied by the call for women’s return to “traditional,” or subservient, places in family structures. However, manifestations of dominator culture are not always so extreme; the effects of dominator culture often manifest in pervasive and subtle ways in society. In the United States, the [[War on Terror|wars on terror]], [[War on Drugs|drugs]], and [[War on crime|crime]] perpetuate the use of force to achieve an end and indicate a lessening of certain freedoms.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2017}} On a larger scale, sex-slavery, forced marriage, and the acceptance of wife-beating persist around the world. Though the Western world has made considerable strides towards a more partnership society in the past few centuries—Western society boasts of freedom of speech, access to education, political participation, gay rights, and women in the workforce—the shift towards the partnership model is neither universal nor complete.

Similarly, dominator culture threatens the preservation of the environment. Hierarchical societies that value claiming control justify humans' claims of dominion over nature. Terence McKenna expanded on Eisler’s work, using the idea of dominator culture to illuminate the character of what he sees as Western patriarchal culture—indicating, for example, his claims that it perennially lacks social conscience and lacks concern for the environment. He argues that, “The entire structure of dominator culture… is based upon our alienation from nature, from ourselves, and from each other.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As a result, dominator culture not only accepts but justifies the pollution and destruction of the environment. [[Daniel Quinn]], a philosophical and environmental writer, takes on these issues in his novel ''[[Ishmael (novel)|Ishmael]]'', characterizing dominator culture as Taker culture and detailing its incompatibility with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ishmael|last=Quinn|first=Daniel|publisher=Bantam|year=1995|isbn=0553375407|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been used and expanded upon by other writers, such as{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}
* [[Carol J. Adams]] in ''[[The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory]]''
* [[Fritjof Capra]] in ''[[The Turning Point (book)|The Turning Point]]''
* [[Thom Hartmann]] in ''[[The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight]]''
* [[Leonard Shlain]] in ''[[The Alphabet Versus the Goddess]]''
* [[Starhawk]] in ''[[Dreaming the Dark]]''
* [[bell hooks]] in ''Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope''

=== Consequences for the future ===

Despite the stability and fairness characteristic of partnership society, dominator culture often still takes precedence. Eisler argues that blindly accepting dominator culture as part of the genetic, natural order of the world excuses human responsibility. When people understand dominator culture as a genetic imperative, they ignore environmental influences, including parenting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This perpetuates the cycle of dominator culture and ignores scientific findings that contradict the supposedly genetic nature of violence. By accepting dominator culture as the norm, people discount their own claim to agency. However, in her article “Love as the Practice of Freedom,” bell hooks offers a potential counter to dominator culture. She states that love—the “longing to connect with someone radically different”—led people to overcome dominator thinking in action, whether the issue was “ending racism, sexism, homophobia, or class elitism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=hooks|first=bell|year=2006|title=Love as the Practice of Freedom|url=http://collectiveliberation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hooks_Love_As_The_Practice_Of_Freedom.pdf|journal=Outlaw Culture|volume=|pages=|via=Collective Liberation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Eisler acknowledges that cultural transformation does not happen on its own; however, she asserts, “Many of us worldwide are working for cultural transformation, for a shift to a more peaceful, equitable, and sustainable way of relating to one another and our Mother Earth.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{short description|The integrated, quantitative, and interdisciplinary approach to the study of environmental systems.}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}
{{Environment sidebar}}

'''Environmental science''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[academic field]] that integrates physical, biological and [[information science]]s (including [[ecology]], [[biology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[plant science]], [[zoology]], [[mineralogy]], [[oceanography]], [[limnology]], [[soil science]], [[geology]] and [[physical geography]] ([[geodesy]]), and [[atmospheric science]]) to the study of the environment, and the solution of environmental problems. Environmental science emerged from the fields of [[natural history]] and [[medicine]] during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750-1800|date=2008|publisher=[[Ashgate]]|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today it provides an integrated, quantitative, and [[interdisciplinary]] approach to the study of [[ecosystem|environmental systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Science: Iowa State University. Environmental Sciences provides an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to understand and mitigate hazards arising from anthropogenic and natural activities by focusing on key areas of environmental chemistry, earth sciences, environmental engineering, atmospheric sciences, and sustainable systems. http://www.ensci.iastate.edu (Accessed 17 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Related areas of study include [[environmental studies]] and [[environmental engineering]].  Environmental studies incorporates more of the social sciences for understanding human relationships, perceptions and policies towards the environment. Environmental engineering focuses on design and technology for improving environmental quality in every aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Environmental engineering|date=2018-08-30|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Environmental_engineering&amp;oldid=857171174|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental scientists work on subjects like the understanding of earth processes, evaluating [[alternative energy]] systems, [[pollution control]] and mitigation, [[natural resource management]], and the [[effects of global warming|effects of global climate change]]. [[Environmental issues]] almost always include an interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Environmental scientists bring a systems approach to the analysis of environmental problems. Key elements of an effective environmental scientist include the ability to relate space, and time relationships as well as quantitative analysis.

Environmental science came alive as a substantive, active field of scientific investigation in the 1960s and 1970s driven by (a) the need for a [[multi-disciplinary]] approach to analyze complex environmental problems, (b) the arrival of substantive environmental laws requiring specific environmental protocols of investigation and (c) the growing public awareness of a need for action in addressing environmental problems. Events that spurred this development included the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s landmark environmental book ''[[Silent Spring]]&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Rachel. ''Silent Spring'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1962), Mariner Books, 2002, {{ISBN|0-618-24906-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' along with major environmental issues becoming very public, such as the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]], and the [[Cuyahoga River]] of Cleveland, Ohio, "catching fire" (also in 1969), and helped increase the visibility of environmental issues and create this new field of study.

==Terminology==
{{See also|Glossary of environmental science}}

In common usage, "environmental science" and "ecology" are often used interchangeably, but technically, ecology refers only to the study of organisms and their interactions with each other and their environment. Ecology could be considered a subset of environmental science, which also could involve purely chemical or [[public health]] issues (for example) ecologists would be unlikely to study. In practice, there is considerable overlap between the work of ecologists and other environmental scientists.

The National Center for Education Statistics in the United States defines an academic program in environmental science as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A program that focuses on the application of biological, chemical, and physical principles to the study of the physical environment and the solution of environmental problems, including subjects such as abating or controlling environmental pollution and degradation; the interaction between human society and the natural environment; and natural resources management. Includes instruction in biology, chemistry, physics, geosciences, climatology, statistics, and mathematical modeling.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics. ''[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/occupationallookup6d.ASP?CIP=03.0104 Classification of Instructional Programs]''. United States Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, 2000. (Accessed 29 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Top_of_Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Earth's [[atmosphere]]]]

=== Atmospheric sciences ===
{{Main|Atmospheric sciences}}
Atmospheric sciences focus on the Earth's atmosphere, with an emphasis upon its interrelation to other systems. Atmospheric sciences can include studies of [[meteorological|meteorology]], [[greenhouse gas]] phenomena, [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]] of airborne contaminants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; sound propagation phenomena related to [[noise pollution]], and even [[light pollution]].

Taking the example of the [[global warming]] phenomena, physicists create [[computer model]]s of atmospheric circulation and [[infra-red radiation]] transmission, chemists examine the inventory of atmospheric chemicals and their reactions, biologists analyze the plant and animal contributions to [[carbon dioxide]] fluxes, and specialists such as [[meteorologist]]s and [[oceanographer]]s add additional breadth in understanding the [[atmospheric dynamics]].

=== Ecology ===
{{Main|Ecology}}
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|left|[[Biodiversity]] of a coral reef. Corals adapt and modify their environment by forming [[calcium carbonate]] skeletons. This provides growing conditions for future generations and forms a habitat for many other species.]]
Ecology is the study of the interactions between organisms and their environment. Ecologists might investigate the relationship between a population of organisms and some physical characteristic of their environment, such as concentration of a chemical; or they might investigate the interaction between two populations of different organisms through some symbiotic or competitive relationship.

For example, an interdisciplinary analysis of an ecological system which is being impacted by one or more stressors might include several related environmental science fields. In an estuarine setting where a proposed industrial development could impact certain species by [[water pollution|water]] and [[air pollution]], [[biologist]]s would describe the flora and fauna, [[chemist]]s would analyze the transport of [[water pollutant]]s to the marsh, [[physicist]]s would calculate air pollution emissions and [[geologist]]s would assist in understanding the marsh soils and bay muds.

=== Environmental chemistry ===
{{Main|Environmental chemistry}}

Environmental chemistry is the study of chemical alterations in the environment. Principal areas of study include [[soil contamination]] and water pollution. The topics of analysis include chemical degradation in the environment, multi-phase transport of chemicals (for example, evaporation of a [[solvent]] containing lake to yield solvent as an air pollutant), and chemical effects upon [[biota (ecology)|biota]].

As an example study, consider the case of a leaking solvent tank which has entered the habitat soil of an [[endangered species]] of amphibian. As a method to resolve or understand the extent of [[soil contamination]] and subsurface transport of solvent, a [[computer model]] would be implemented. Chemists would then characterize the [[molecular bonding]] of the solvent to the specific soil type, and biologists would study the impacts upon soil [[arthropod]]s, plants, and ultimately pond-dwelling organisms that are the food of the endangered amphibian.

=== Geosciences ===
{{Main|Geosciences}}

Geosciences include [[environmental geology]], [[environmental soil science]], [[volcanic]] phenomena and evolution of the Earth's crust. In some classification systems this can also include [[hydrology]], including [[oceanography]].

As an example study of soils [[erosion]], calculations would be made of [[surface runoff]] by soil scientists. Fluvial geomorphologists would assist in examining [[sediment transport]] in overland flow. Physicists would contribute by assessing the changes in light transmission in the receiving waters. Biologists would analyze subsequent impacts to aquatic flora and fauna from increases in water turbidity.

==Regulations driving the studies==
[[File:Glen Canyon Dam &amp; Lake Powell.jpg|thumb|Environmental science examines the effects of humans on nature ([[Glen Canyon Dam]] in the U.S.)]]
In the U.S. the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) of 1969 set forth requirements for analysis of major projects in terms of specific environmental criteria. Numerous state laws have echoed these mandates, applying the principles to local-scale actions. The upshot has been an explosion of documentation and study of environmental consequences before the fact of development actions.

One can examine the specifics of environmental science by reading examples of [[Environmental Impact Statement]]s prepared under NEPA  such as: ''Wastewater treatment expansion options discharging into the San Diego/[[Tijuana]] [[Estuary]]'', ''Expansion of the [[San Francisco International Airport]]'', ''Development of the [[Houston]], Metro Transportation system'', ''Expansion of the metropolitan [[Boston]] MBTA transit system'', and ''Construction of [[Interstate 66]] through [[Arlington, Virginia]]''.

In England and Wales the [[Environment Agency]] (EA),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/ Environment Agency&lt;/ref&gt; formed in 1996, is a public body for protecting and improving the environment and enforces the regulations listed on the communities and local government site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1503251] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812001715/http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1503251|date=12 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly the office of the deputy prime minister). The agency was set up under the [[Environment Act 1995]] as an independent body and works closely with UK Government to enforce the regulations.

The '''Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences''', commonly known simply as '''Fields Institute''', is an international centre for [[scientific research]] in [[mathematical science]]s at the [[University of Toronto]], in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. The institute is named for University of Toronto mathematician [[John Charles Fields]], after whom the [[Fields Medal]] is also named. It was established in 1992, and was briefly based at the [[University of Waterloo]] before relocating to Toronto in 1995.

As a centre for mathematical activity, the institute brings together mathematicians from Canada and abroad. It also supports the collaboration between professional mathematicians and researchers in other domains, such as statistics, computer science, engineering, physical and biological sciences, medicine, economics and finance, telecommunications and information systems. It also holds monthly meetings on mathematics education, attended by participants from secondary school boards, university mathematics departments and the private sector.

The institute occupies a building at the university that was specially conceived and constructed for its activities, designed by [[Bruce Kuwabara|Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects]]. It accommodates up to 66 visitors and their support staff, providing office spaces and full access to the mathematics collection of the [[University of Toronto Libraries]].

The ''Fields Institute Monographs'' (FIM) features the research work of the institute, and is jointly published with the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fields Institute Monographs |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |url=http://www.ams.org/cgi-bin/bookstore/bookpromo/fimseries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fellows==
In 2002, the Fields Institute initiated the Fields Institute Fellows program to recognize outstanding contributions to activities at the Fields Institute and within the Canadian mathematical community.&lt;ref name="fellows"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fields Institute Fellows|url=https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/honours/fieldsinstfellows.html|website=Fields Institute|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fellowship is a lifetime appointment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7086">The '''Global Challenge Award''' is an online science and engineering design program for pre-college school students (e.g. middle school through high school) from all over the world. It is an initiative that started with a partnership with the [[University of Vermont]] in collaboration with the [[National Science Foundation]], currently funded by the MacArthur Foundation Digital Media and Learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmlcompetition.net/|title=Digital Media and Learning Competition 6|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; program as well as other foundations and corporations, wherein students have the opportunity to form teams with international counterparts and work towards a solution to mitigate [[global warming]] and help envision the future of [[renewable energy]]. The program is an online educational environment that uses [[game based learning]], [[simulation]] and Web-based science resources in a global competition. It relies on the personal initiative and creativity of students working in diverse teams. The access to the project via the Web makes it possible for students, parents, [[homeschooling]] families, teachers and interested global community members to get involved to help young people with their creative ideas for innovation in new forms of energy, conservation and increased productivity.

==History==
Founded in 2005 by Craig Deluca and David Rocchio of the Arno Group and Biddle Duke, the publisher of the Stowe Reporter newspaper company in Stowe, Vt., working in close partnership with Domenico Grasso of [[The University of Vermont]] (see) College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/|title=CEMS Home : University of Vermont|first=University of|last=Vermont|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the program gives international student teams the opportunity to experience the excitement of scientific understanding and engineering design while working on significant human and societal issues – bringing science to life in innovative new applications. The program mission is to "give students the tools and confidence to solve global problems together."

The overarching model for the learning experiences offered worldwide to any student was influenced by  The George Lucas Foundation's Big ideas For Better Schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/big-ideas|title=Big Ideas for Better Schools: Ten Ways to Improve Education|first=|last=Edutopia|date=11 August 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Partnership for 21st Century Schools&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/ Partnership for 21st Century Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306025420/http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/ |date=2010-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[game based learning]].  The Global Challenge was funded in part by a [[National Science Foundation]] award from the [[Innovative Technology Experiences for Students]] (ITEST) program, validating the project's design for engaging youth in science, technology, engineering and mathematics learning.

Since its founding in 2005, The Global Challenge has reached over 100,000 people worldwide and engaged over 4,000 students from 60 countries in forming teams to solve the challenge. About $200,000 in scholarships, travel, summer study have been provided to over 200 students from 10 countries.

==International connections==
The Global Challenge Award is responsible for identification of high school students who represent the United States in the [[International Earth Science Olympiad]] or IESO. Students and teachers travel to South Korea in 2007 and the Philippines in 2008. Plans are now underway to form a US-IESO selection process with the support of the American Geological Institute.

In addition, the design of the program builds international student teams. Students from over 79 countries participate each year. Top countries by participation with over 100 students each year have been the United States, India, China, and South Korea.

==Program elements==

There are several project areas in the Challenge. Some are designed specifically for teams, others students can work on alone. Students can mix and match projects based on their interest level and time. They can form a team to compete in one competition and, at the same time, work on individual points.

* ''Global Business Plan'' Students build an international team, envision a global solution, create a detailed [[business plan]], and submit it for judging.
* ''Technical Innovation Plan'' Students build an international team, envision any kind of technical solution, explain it to a panel of judges.
* ''Explorations'' Students work on their own on science, technology, engineering and mathematics units of study called "challenges."
* ''Green Earth Corps'' Students work on their own or with any team, build a home and business auditing service, earn while they learn and serve.
* ''GCA-350'' Students create an awareness event about the need to reach "350 parts per million" of [[CO2 emissions|CO2 in the atmosphere]].

Each Challenge earns certain points, and in the end, teams with the highest scores win and earn scholarships, travel awards to the Governor's Institute on Engineering in Vermont, cash prizes, and tuition scholarships.

==News coverage==

The program was the lead story "Save the World" in Learning &amp; Leading with Technology November 2007. In the Burlington Free Press in July 2008, and has led to a number of youth-authored articles on Cogito.org, for example: Using Nanotechnology for Cost Effective Converters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogito.org/Articles/ArticleDetail.aspx?ContentID=17460|title=Using Nanotechnology for Cost-Effective Catalytic Converters

'''''Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery'''''&lt;ref&gt;Lipman, Matthew. ''Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery'' (NJ: IAPC, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; is a philosophical novel for children by [[Matthew Lipman]]. The novel was Lipman's first, and inaugurated the educational movement known as [[Philosophy for Children]]. It was first published in 1971 and revised in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/harry-stottlemeiers-discovery/oclc/927158010/editions ''Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery''] at [[WorldCat]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book deals with everyday situations which a group of children encounter. These situations then become the substance for mental engagement and thinking about thinking. Rather than looking for answers, the type of thinking encouraged is about prolonging questioning, and performing self-initiated testing on the events or objects under discussion. There is a focus on how to teach ourselves logic by examining the results of the self-initiated tests. The books deal with substantial democratic issues as well such as "should every child go to school?", "should every person salute the flag?"&lt;ref&gt;Katzner, Louis I.

[[File:Réchaud de gaz de dirigeant.JPG|thumb|Lafare's portable gas stove 1932]]
[[File:Camping gaz.jpg|thumb|A modern gas cartridge for a portable stove]]
The '''portable gas stove''' is a combination of portability and functionality; combining the light weight of a small gas canister with the heat output needed to cook a meal. Portable stoves in modern times can be divided into several broad categories based on the type of fuel used and the design of the [[aluminium]] stoving frame. Unpressurised stoves use solid/liquid fuel placed in the burner before ignition. Combustible stove hangers use a form of volatile liquid fuel in a pressurized burner i.e. [[bottled gas]] stoves. They originate from the gravity-fed 1932 "spirit" stoves or ''réchaud de gaz de dirigeant''.

==Origins==
The production of the ''réchaud de gaz de dirigeant'' (Portable gas stove) was commissioned and begun in the workshop of the industrial designer Jue Lafare (born April 7, 1896) in 1932 after he placed his plan for a portable gas cooker before the [[French Army]] two and a half years earlier.

==Early introduction==
By 1934 Lafare's portable cooker was in [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] ranks and within the next 16 months would come to be a staple of every officer in the French army. Due to fear of common misuse by soldiers of lower ranks obtaining the cookers without consent, the army requested that all instructional writing be placed upon the cookers in English as only the officers were taught fluency in English.

==Military applications==
Unfortunately Lafares design, however brilliant, was not enough to stop the German ranks marching over his homeland in 1940 after only 6 weeks. The majority of ''réchaud de gaz de dirigeant'' were melted down into what can only be assumed as scrap metal for the German war machine. However, from Jeu Lafare's stove the idea was adapted in various forms around the world during [[World War II]] and afterwards. Examples can be seen in many military originations around the world today with the American 'Bunga' or Japanese '携帯用ガス炊飯器'. Today there are estimated to be less than 80 of Lafare's original Full Blue French made with English writing ''réchaud de gaz de dirigeant''. Although the stove was a wonderful invention, the Germans were incredible in their precision at melting them down in such a systematic way.

==Rarity==
As mentioned above, examples of Lafare's original full blue French made ''réchaud de gaz de dirigeant'' are extremely rare. The War Memorial Museum in [[Boulogne]], France, paid 390EU for the piece pictured above in their collection some 20 years ago. However, it should be pointed out that the gas canister is a later 1940s Deutsch army model.

The '''International FAIRTRADE Certification Mark''' is an independent [[certification mark]] used in over 50 countries. It appears on products as an independent guarantee that a product has been produced according to Fairtrade political standards.

The FAIRTRADE Mark is owned and protected by [[FLO International|Fairtrade International]] (FLO), on behalf of its 25-member and associate member Fairtrade producer networks and labelling initiatives.

For a product to carry the FAIRTRADE Mark, it must come from [[FLO-CERT]] inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be marketed in accordance with the International Fairtrade standards set by [[FLO International|Fairtrade International]]. The supply chain is also monitored by [[FLO-CERT]]. To become certified Fairtrade producers, the primary cooperative and its member farmers must operate to certain political standards, imposed from Europe. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organisations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;FLO-CERT (2008). [http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en FLO-CERT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918131636/http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en |date=2009-09-18 }}. URL accessed on August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Fair trade debate]] there are many complaints of failure to enforce these standards, with Fairtrade cooperatives, importers and packers profiting by evading them.&lt;ref&gt;Raynolds, L.

As of 2006, the following products currently carry the FAIRTRADE Mark: coffee, tea, chocolate, cocoa, sugar, bananas, apples, pears, grapes, plums, lemons, oranges, Satsumas, clementines, [[lychee]]s, avocados, pineapples, mangoes, fruit juices, [[quinoa]], peppers, green beans, coconut, dried fruit, [[rooibos]] tea, green tea, cakes and biscuits, honey, muesli, cereal bars, jams, [[chutney]] and sauces, herbs and spices, nuts and nut oil, wine, beer, rum, flowers, footballs, rice, yogurt, baby food, sugar body scrub, cotton wool and cotton products.&lt;ref name=FLOPRO&gt;Fairtrade International (2011).[http://www.fairtrade.net/products.0.html Products] URL accessed on August 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
The marketing system for Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade coffee is identical in the consuming countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing and retailing firms. Some independent brands operate a virtual company, paying importers, packers and distributors and advertising agencies to handle their brand, for cost reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, 'Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies', Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt; In the producing country Fairtrade is marketed only by Fairtrade cooperatives, while other coffee is marketed by Fairtrade cooperatives (as uncertified coffee), by other cooperatives and by ordinary traders.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, S.

Retailers and cafes in the rich countries can sell Fairtrade coffee at any price they like, so nearly all the extra price paid by consumers, 82% to 99%, is kept in the rich countries as increased profit.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm;Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., &amp; Niemi, N.

Cooperative traders and exporters can sell coffee as Fairtrade certified if they meet the political standards of FLO and they pay a certification and inspection fee. Other administration costs and production costs are incurred to meet these standards. The exporter (not the farmer) is paid a minimum price for Fairtrade certified coffee when the world market is oversupplied, and a Fairtrade premium of 15c per lb at other times. The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as Fairtrade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, S. (2010).

Fairtrade Standards for small farmers' organizations include requirements for democratic decision making, ensuring that producers have a say in how the Fairtrade Premiums are invested etc. They also include requirements for capacity building and economic strengthening of the organization.

Fairtrade Standards for hired labour situations ensure that employees receive minimum wages and [[collective bargaining|bargain collectively]]. Fairtrade-certified [[plantation]]s must also ensure that there is no forced or [[child labour]] and that health and safety requirements are met. (These labor standards do not apply to, Fairtrade "small farmer cooperatives" though some have an average of 2.39 ha per farmer of just one crop, coffee, with some single farmers having more than 23 ha coffee, implying substantial use of hired labor.)&lt;ref&gt;Weber, J. G. (2011). How much more do growers receive for Fair Trade organic coffee. Food Policy , 677-684.&lt;/ref&gt; In a hired labour situation, Fairtrade Standards require a "joint body" to be set up with representatives from both the management and the employees. This joint body decides on how Fairtrade Premiums will be spent to benefit [[plantation]] employees.

For some products, such as coffee, only Fairtrade Standards for small farmers' organizations are applicable. For others, such as tea, both small farmers' organizations and plantations can be certified.

Trade standards cover the payment of premiums, of minimum prices, where applicable, the provision of credit to buy the crop, and commercial relationships between the exporting cooperative or other organization and the importer.

Typically, in order for a product to be marked as "Fair-trade " at least 20% of its mass must be made up of a Fairtrade product.

Fairtrade Standards and procedures are approved by the Fairtrade International Standards Committee, an external committee comprising all FLO stakeholders (labeling initiatives, producers and traders) and external experts. Fairtrade Standards are set by FLO in accordance to the requirements of the ISEAL Code of Good Practice in standard setting and are in addition the result of a consultation process, involving a variety of stakeholders: producers, traders, external experts, inspectors, certification staff etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (2006).

==Fairtrade pricing==

The main aspects of the Fairtrade system are the Minimum Price and the Premium. These are paid to the exporting firm, usually a second tier cooperative, not to the farmer. They are not paid for everything produced by the cooperative members, but for that proportion of13their output they are able to sell with the brand 'Fairtrade Certified', typically 17% to as much as 60% of their turnover.
* The '''Fairtrade Premium''' is an extra payment over the market price (e.g. an extra 20c/lb for coffee) which is paid to the exporting organization. The residual after extra costs have been met must be spent on “social projects”  for social and economic development in the producing communities, rather than being given to farmers as extra payment.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 1 April 2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15 January 2013; Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

They are generally used for improvements in health, education or other social facilities, although it may also be used for certain development projects to enable farmers to improve productivity or reduce their reliance on single commodities. As part of the Fairtrade criteria, registered producers are accountable to [[FLO-CERT]] for the use of this money. 
* The '''Fairtrade Minimum Price''' is a guaranteed price to be paid for a few products like coffee when the world prices collapse. Again, it would usually be spent on "social projects" rather than going to the farmers.

There are complaints that the standards relating to paying of price premiums, minimum prices, provision of credit, etc. by importers in rich countries are not enforced.&lt;ref&gt;de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E.

They found that this kickback was 10c a pound over a period when the official price premium was 5c or 10c a pound, and this, plus the certification fee, meant that the cooperatives made a loss in years when a premium was payable, and were paid substantially less than the official minimum prices in years when a minimum price was payable. These should have been identified and rectified by the certification agency.

==Fairtrade inspection and certification==

Fairtrade inspection and certification are carried out, for a fee,&lt;ref name="flo-cert.net"&gt;FLO-CERT Gmbh, (2011) “. (2011). Fee System Small Producer Organization - Explanatory Document. Retrieved January 3, 2013, from http://www.flo-cert.net: http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/35.html.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[FLO-CERT]], an independent, for profit, body created by Fairtrade International in 2004. FLO-CERT certifies that both producers and traders have met with Fairtrade Standards and that producers have invested any surplus received through Fairtrade in social projects.

FLO-CERT works with a network of around 100 independent inspectors that regularly visit producer and trade organizations and report back to FLO-CERT. All certification decisions are then taken by a Certification Committee, composed of stakeholders from producers, traders, national labelling organisations and external experts. An Appeals Committee handles all appeals.

FLO-CERT inspections and certification follow the international ISO standards for product certification bodies (ISO 65).

There have been claims that adherence to fair trade standards by producers has been poor and that enforcement of standards by Fairtrade is very weak, notably by Christian Jacquiau.&lt;ref name="swissinfo.ch"&gt;Hamel, I.: 2006, 'Fairtrade Firm Accused of Foul Play', Swiss Info http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Fair_trade_firm_accused_of_foul_play.html?cid=5351232 23 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Paola Ghillani, who spent four years as president of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations.&lt;ref name="swissinfo.ch"/&gt; There is criticism of poor enforcement: labourers on Fairtrade farms in Peru are paid less than the minimum wage;&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H. (2006, August 9). ‘Fair’ coffee workers paid below minimum wage. Financial Times; Weitzman, H. (2006, September 9). ‘'Ethical-coffee’ workers paid below legal minimum.

Ecological Economics, 68, 3018-3025.&lt;/ref&gt; "some fair trade standards are not strictly enforced";&lt;ref&gt;Reed, D.: 2009, 'What do Corporations have to do with Fair Trade? Positive and normative analysis from a value chain perspective', Journal of Business Ethics, 86, 3-26. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and supermarkets may avoid their responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, G., Gibbon, J., &amp; Slack, R.: 2006, 'The mainstreaming of Fair Trade: a macromarketing perspective’,  Journal of Strategic Marketing, 14, 329-352.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist found that ten out of the ten mills they visited had sold uncertified coffee to co-operatives as certified. It reported that they were "also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received Fairtrade certification despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref name="ft.com"/&gt;

==Costs and returns==

Fairtrade farmers and marketing organizations incur a wide range of costs in achieving and maintaining certification. They incur these costs on all their production, but they can only recover costs on the small part of their production that they can sell as "Fairtrade certified". In practice they can sell only small of their output as Fairtrade, because of lack of demand, and must sell the rest as uncertified at world prices. For example, there is not enough demand to take all the certified coffee produced, so most has to be sold as uncertified. In 2001 only 13.6% could be sold as certified&lt;ref&gt;Muradian, R., and W. Pelupessy. 2005. "Governing the Coffee Chain: The Role of Voluntary Regulatory Systems” World Development 33(12): 2029-2044., cited in de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E. (2010).

Retrieved December 24, 2012, from http://are.berkeley.edu/~alain/workingpapers.html.&lt;/ref&gt; so limits were placed on new cooperatives joining the scheme. This plus an increased demand put up sales of certified to around 50% in 2003&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Margaret, and April Linton. 2003. “Fair Trade: A Cup at a Time?” Politics and Society 31(3): 407-32. cited in de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E.

Certified organizations such as cooperatives have to pay [[FLO-CERT]] a fee to become certified and a further annual fee for audit and continued certification Fairtrade inspection and certification are carried out, for a fee.&lt;ref name="flo-cert.net"/&gt; The first year certification fee per unit sold as "Fairtrade certified"  varies but has been over 6c/lb with an annual fee of 3c/lb to 3.4c/b for coffee up to 2006 in some countries, at a time when the "Fairtrade premium" was 5c to 10c/lb.&lt;ref&gt;de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E. (2010). Fair Trade and Free Entry:The Dissipation of Producer Benefits in a Disequilibrium Market. Retrieved December 24, 2012, from http://are.berkeley.edu/~alain/workingpapers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The cooperative or other certified organization has to spend money on conforming to the standards, with changed employment practices, the introduction and administration of the required democratic processes, changed processing, labelling and packing, changed material. They also incur extra costs in selling: . Weber&lt;ref name="Weber, J. 2006"/&gt; reports cooperatives not able to cover the extra costs of a marketing team for Fairtrade, with one covering only 70% of these costs after six years of Fairtrade membership.

Fairtrade farmers also have to meet a large range of criteria on production: there are limits on using child labour, pesticides, herbicides, genetically modified products etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V. (2011) “Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard,” p11  {{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}  accessed 15 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These cost money, mean that the farmers have to do more work in the hot sun, and that they have to hire labour instead of using family labour. In times when world prices are so low that there is no “social premium” and the minimum price is paid, some farmers have negotiated that some of the money is paid to them, rather than being used for social projects.

== History ==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[image:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|left|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]] --&gt;Fairtrade labelled coffee, the first [[Fairtrade labelling|Fairtrade labelled]] product, was first launched in the Netherlands in 1988. The label, launched by [[Nico Roozen]] and Dutch missionary [[Frans van der Hoff]], was then called [[Max Havelaar]] after a fictional Dutch character who opposed the exploitation of coffee pickers in Dutch colonies. Fairtrade labelling allowed Fairtrade Certified goods to be sold outside the [[World shops]] for the first time and into mainstream retailers, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting sales significantly.

The concept caught on: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America, called “Max Havelaar” (in Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and France), "Transfair" (in Germany, Luxembourg, Austria, Italy, the United States, Canada and Japan), or carrying a national name: “Fairtrade  Mark” in the UK and Ireland, "Rättvisemärkt" in Sweden, and "Reilu Kauppa" in Finland. Initially, the Max Havelaars and the Transfairs each had their own Fairtrade standards, product committees and monitoring systems. In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations – or "LIs" (for "Labelling Initiatives") – started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], now known simply as [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|Fairtrade International (FLO)]]. FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade Standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.

In 2002, [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|FLO]] launched a new FAIRTRADE Certification Mark. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, convey a dynamic, forward-looking image for [[Fairtrade]], facilitate cross border trade and simplify procedures for importers and traders.

The FAIRTRADE Mark harmonization process is still under way – as of March 2011, all but two labelling initiatives {{Dubious|date=June 2010}}([[TransFair USA]] and [[TransFair Canada]]) have fully adopted the new international Certification Mark.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2006). [http://www.fairtrade.net/certification_mark.html The Certification Mark]. URL accessed on November 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These two organizations currently use the [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]], however Canadian organization began actively promoting the new international Certification Mark in 2010 as part of a total transition toward it. TransFair USA has apparently elected to continue with its own mark for the time being,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transfairusa.org/content/resources/faq-advanced.php#bluegreen TransFair USA FAQ] - "Some LIs, including TransFair USA, have elected to continue using their current labels."&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, over 19 FLO Member Labelling Initiatives are using the International Fairtrade Certification Mark. There are now Fairtrade Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO’s certification for coffee, tea, rice, bananas, mangoes, cocoa, cotton, sugar, honey, fruit juices, nuts, fresh fruit, quinoa, herbs and spices, wine and footballs etc.&lt;ref name=FLOPRO/&gt;

==Criticism==
According to the economist [[Bruce Wydick]] with the median coffee drinker willing to pay a premium of 50 cents for a cup of fair-trade coffee even in the best-case scenario for fair trade, when world prices are at their lowest, the maximum amount a fair-trade grower from that same cup of coffee would receive is only one third of a cent&lt;ref name="zeit.de"&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Die Zeit|Title=Fairtrade: Keine langfristig positiven Effekte |PublicationPlace=Hamburg|ISSN=0044-2070|language=German|URL=http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2014-08/fairetrade-kaffee/seite-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wydick lists his points against the alleged benefits of fair trade:
* The flawed design of the system undermines its own benefits: zero benefits in the long run. 
* For certification Fair trade imposes significant costs on impoverished growers
* Fair trade attracts bad beans by making growers dump their bad beans into fair-trade channels.
* Costs to growers imposed by restrictions on fertilizers and other inputs diminish yields.
* Fair trade doesn’t help the poorest growers.
* Relatively little fair-trade coffee originates from the poorest countries. 
* Purported social investments of the fair-trade system lack transparency.
* The fair-trade system is inefficient at transferring coffee consumers’ goodwill to producers.
* Direct trade is probably more efficient and sustainable than fair trade.
* Artificially stimulating more coffee production keeps coffee growers poor, because overproduction makes the prices fall on the world markets.
* Fair-trade coffee fails to address the root of poverty issues which aren't payment of producers but social, political and educational conditions.
* Among the 16 best methods to fight poverty fair trade was the second but last with regard to cost efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost-Effective Compassion: The 10 Most Popular Strategies for Helping the Poor|trans-title=|periodical=ChristianityToday.com|publisher=|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/february/popular-strategies-helping-the-poor.html?paging=off|format=|accessdate=2016-06-18|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Reasons Fair-Trade Coffee Doesn't Work|trans-title=|periodical=The Huffington Post|publisher=|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-wydick/10-reasons-fair-trade-coffee-doesnt-work_b_5651663.html|format=|accessdate=2016-06-18|last=University of San Francisco; author Bruce Wydick Professor of economics and international studies|date=2014-08-07|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3282">The '''Konrad Lorenz Institute of Ethology''' (German: “Konrad-Lorenz-Institut für Vergleichende Verhaltensforschung“ or KLIVV) is a research institute in [[Vienna]], Austria, dedicated to studying behavioral biology and the links between animal behaviour and conservation. Founded by the animal photographer Otto Koenig and his wife, the illustrator Lilli Koenig as “Biologische Station Wilhelminenberg” (Biological Station Wilhelminenberg) in 1945, it was later named after the Nobel laureate [[Konrad Lorenz]] and incorporated into the [[University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna]] in 2011.

==History and organisation==
The “Biologische Station Wilheminenberg” was founded by the biologist couple Otto and Lilli Koenig in response to the ground-breaking research in the field of comparative ethology, including the work by Konrad Lorenz. The research institute was established in abandoned army barracks&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencev2.orf.at/stories/1671239/&lt;/ref&gt; in the outskirts of Vienna’s 16th district [[Ottakring]] at the onset of the [[Vienna Woods]], and endowed with substantial space and facilities supported by private means.

The facility developed and was re-structured into the Institute of Ethology of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in 1967. Otto Koenig, who became a public figure through his role as a presenter of nature documentaries,&lt;ref&gt;https://idw-online.de/de/news609724&lt;/ref&gt; remained director also after this re-structuring until his retirement in 1984. He was succeeded by the ornithologist Hans Winkler. When Konrad Lorenz died in 1989, the institute was renamed after him.

Under the leadership of Hans Winkler, the Konrad Lorenz Institute was gradually modernised and both laboratories and staff were extended. This resulted in substantial refurbishments between 1985 and 2002, when Dustin J. Penn succeeded Winkler as director.

In 2011, the Konrad Lorenz Institute was merged with the Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology and both facilities became part of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. Both research institutes combined now provide a facility for approximately 80 scientists. Director of the new institute is Walter Arnold. Since spring 2015, the Konrad Lorenz Institute is also the headquarter of the Austrian Ornithological Centre (AOC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/konrad-lorenz-institute-of-ethology/austrian-ornithological-centre-aoc/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The scientific work at the Konrad Lorenz Institute traditionally focusses on ethology and evolutionary aspects of animal behaviour, in particular related to sexual selection and sexual conflicts. The restructuring of 2011 broadened the research objectives to include physiological and ecological aspects of wild animals in interaction with their environment.

[[File:AACSB Accredited.svg|thumbnail|Logo of accredited schools]]
There are 182 schools that hold the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business's]] (AACSB) [[Accounting]] [[Accreditation]]. The AACSB accredits [[business school]]s by evaluating critical areas of each school to ensure that it provides top-quality education,&lt;ref name="AACSB Accreditation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accreditation|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/aacsb.asp|publisher=AACSB International}}&lt;/ref&gt; and schools can apply for the [[accounting]] accreditation, which focusses on the schools' accounting programs, in addition to business accreditation.&lt;ref name="AACSB Accounting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accounting Accreditation|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accounting/|publisher=AACSB International|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accreditation is gained and maintained via a peer-review system, and schools are assessed in the context of their respective missions rather than against a fixed standard.&lt;ref name="WSJ 2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Korn|first=Melissa|title=B-School Accrediting Body Retools Standards|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323820304578411071717286236|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To apply for accounting accreditation, a school is required either to already hold the business accreditation, or to apply for both the business and accounting accreditations at the same time.&lt;ref name="AACSB Accounting" /&gt;

The initial accounting accreditation process starts with the submission of an eligibility application, and includes self-evaluations and peer reviews.&lt;ref name="AACSB Accounting" /&gt; The business school and the accounting academic unit are evaluated on their alignment with the AACSB's accreditation standards; under the standard for accounting accreditation, an accounting academic unit is evaluated based on its mission, intellectual contributions, and financial strategies for achieving its mission. For example, one of the bases of evaluation is whether the academic unit has produced intellectual contributions that have affected [[accounting]], [[business]] and [[management]] "in ways that are consistent with the mission, expected outcomes, and strategies of the unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eligibility Procedures and Accreditation Standards for Accounting Accreditation |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accounting/standards/2013/2013-aacsb-accounting-accreditation-standards.pdf |publisher=AACSB |accessdate=22 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108093650/http://aacsb.edu/accreditation/accounting/standards/2013/2013-aacsb-accounting-accreditation-standards.pdf |archivedate= 8 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the accounting accreditation is extended via 5-year review cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbook For Joint Business And Accounting Continuous Improvement Reviews |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/docs/Handbooks/2013/Continuous%20Improvement%20Review%20Handbook%20for%20Business%20and%20Accounting%20Reviews%202013%20FINAL%2020130619.pdf |publisher=AACSB |accessdate=22 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201175301/http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/docs/Handbooks/2013/Continuous%20Improvement%20Review%20Handbook%20for%20Business%20and%20Accounting%20Reviews%202013%20FINAL%2020130619.pdf |archivedate= 1 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the AACSB estimated that 5% of all business programs internationally, and most top business programs in the [[United States]], held AACSB accreditation.&lt;ref name="WSJ 2013" /&gt; AACSB accreditation is seen as a standard requirement in graduate business education, and universities are more likely to accept [[transfer credit]] earned from accredited schools;&lt;ref name="HK 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilpert|first=Ditmar|author2=Thomas Kern |title=Success Factors of American Business Schools or "How Business Schools Attract Promising Students"|journal=Applied Marketing|year=2003|pages=995–1012|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-18981-4_87|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it has been called "the hallmark of excellence in business education".&lt;ref name=SMU&gt;{{cite web|title=SMU is one of the youngest universities to receive accreditation from oldest global accrediting body AACSB International|url=http://www.smu.edu.sg/news/2011/04/11/smu-one-youngest-universities-receive-accreditation-oldest-global-accrediting-body|publisher=Singapore Management University|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6106">[[File:Seymour Marine Discovery Center (2384861528).jpg|thumb|Seymour Marine Discovery Center, overlooking the Monterey Bay]]
The '''Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory''' is a research center located at the west edge of [[Santa Cruz, California]]. It is affiliated with the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] and is a field base for researchers of the [[Monterey Bay]].  Long Marine Lab focuses primarily on marine sciences, and is the oceanside research center for UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS).

Facilities at the lab include: The Center for Ocean Health, The Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center, The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), The Seabird/Raptor facility for the UCSC Predatory Bird Research Group, two large outdoor tanks for small marine mammals, four smaller pools with haulout areas for seals and sea lions, a three tank [[dolphinarium]] (acoustically engineered for the dolphin's sonar capabilities), and the Seymour Marine Discovery Center'''.'''

==History==
In many ways, the [[Monterey Bay]] presents an ideal place to study marine life for scientists and the general public alike. The development of an onshore marine laboratory had a high priority since the UCSC campus opened in 1965. The generous gift of land in 1972 by Mrs. Marion Stowell Younger and her late husband, Donald, made possible the development of the marine laboratory at the west edge of the city of Santa Cruz, less than a ten-minute drive from the UCSC campus. The {{convert|40|acre|m2|sing=on}} site contains a relatively undisturbed wetlands, the [[Younger Lagoon Reserve]], and flat terraces for the marine lab buildings. Long Marine Lab opened in late 1978, and supports the marine research of the Santa Cruz faculty and students and is essential to the development of marine program of international recognition, which UCSC now has.

== Seymour Marine Discovery Center==
[[File:Sunflower Seastar.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Sunflower seastar]] on exhibit at the Discovery Center]]
The '''Seymour Marine Discovery Center''' is the public outreach and marine education center located at Long Marine Lab. The building of the center was made possible by [[H. Boyd Seymour Jr.]], and opened March 11, 2000.

===The Aquarium===

The animals in the aquarium are all found in Monterey Bay, and give visitors a chance to get an up close look at the local biology of the area. The exhibits vary, but mainstays include several [[Swellshark|swell sharks]], [[Chrysaora fuscescens|sea nettles]], a [[Cabezon (fish)|cabezon]], and [[Strongylocentrotus purpuratus|purple urchins]]. There are several areas where visitors are encouraged to touch local wildlife, including swell sharks, [[Anthopleura xanthogrammica|giant green anemones]], [[Bat star|bat stars]], [[Leather star|leather stars]], and [[Macrocystis pyrifera|giant kelp]].

=== The Blue whale skeleton ===
[[File:BlueWhaleSkeleton.jpg|thumb|left|The Blue Whale skeleton outside the Long Marine Laboratory of the University of California, Santa Cruz.]]

"Ms. Blue" is the largest [[Blue whale]] skeleton displayed in the world. She washed ashore at [[Fiddlers Cove]] near [[Pescadero, California|Pescadero]] on September 6, 1979. Biologists and students from UC Santa Cruz began [[fleshing]] the whale, with the whole process taking about a month to complete. After being transported to UC Santa Cruz, the carcass was buried near the college. In the summer of 1985, the bones were unearthed and reconstruction began. Frank Perry was hired to mount the cleaned bones for display. He and a group of specialists successfully constructed a steel framework to support the bones and recreate the proper arch of the spine and completed it in 1986. In 1999 the skeleton was finally moved to its final resting place at the Long Marine Laboratory. Ms. Blue is decorated with rope lighting during the month of December. The whale is 5.5 m (18 ft) tall and 26.5 m (87 ft) long. She was not fully grown when she died.

==Marine Protected Area==
[[Natural Bridges State Marine Reserve]] is a marine protected area off the coast of Long Marine Laboratory.  Like an underwater park, this marine protected area helps conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.


== Desalination plant ==
Due to the drought in Santa Cruz in the late 1970s the Soquel Creek Water District has agreed to split the bill with the city of Santa Cruz on a desalination plant. The city has not added to its water supply since that drought so the desalination plant would alleviate the threat of another drought. “Currently, work is being done to build a $4 million test desalination facility at the city's Long Marine Lab.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityonahillpress.com/article.php?id=452 Desalination Plant Coming to Santa Cruz - City on a Hill Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328094631/http://www.cityonahillpress.com/article.php?id=452 |date=2007-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3703">'''Marchetti's constant''' is the average time spent by a person for [[commuting]] each day, which is approximately one hour. The term is a misnomer, because [[Italian people|Italian]] [[physicist]] Cesare Marchetti himself attributes the "one hour" finding to transportation analyst and engineer Yacov Zahavi.&lt;ref name="mar94"&gt;[http://www.cesaremarchetti.org/archive/electronic/basic_instincts.pdf Marchetti, C., 1994: Anthropological Invariants in Travel Behavior, Technological Forecasting and Social Change , 47 :75–88, Internal Publication, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marchetti posits that although forms of [[urban planning]] and [[transport]] may change, and although some live in villages and others in cities, people gradually adjust their lives to their conditions (including location of their homes relative to their workplace) such that the average travel time stays approximately constant.&lt;ref name="mar94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ausubel1998"&gt;[http://phe.rockefeller.edu/green_mobility/ Toward green mobility: the evolution of transport], Jesse H. Ausubel, Cesare Marchetti and Perrin Meyer, 1998 (accessed Nov 6, 2006); [http://phe.rockefeller.edu/TIP_transport/ The Evolution of Transport], April/May 2001, Jesse H. Ausubel and Cesare Marchetti. Includes observations on historical cities.&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since [[Neolithic]] times, people have kept the average time spent per day for travel the same, even though the distance may increase due to the advancements in the means of transportation.

A related concept is that of Zahavi, who also noticed that people seem to have a constant "travel time budget", that is, "a stable daily amount of time that people make available for travel."&lt;ref&gt;Metz, David, 2008: The Limits to Travel: How Far Will You Go?, 8, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt; David Metz, former chief scientist at the Department of Transport, UK, cites data of average travel time in Britain drawn from the British National Travel Survey in support of Marchetti's and Zahavi's conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The work casts doubt on the contention that investment in [[infrastructure]] saves travel time. Instead, it appears from Metz's figures that people invest travel time saved in travelling a longer distance,&lt;ref&gt;The point is also made in a 2009 paper by Yves Crozet: 'Economic Development and the Role of Travel time: The key concept of accessibility' published in Commissioned Papers for the 4th International Future Urban Transport Conference of the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations, Gothenburg, Sweden, April 19–21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; a particular example of [[Jevons paradox]] described by the [[Lewis–Mogridge position]]. Because of the constancy of travel times as well as induced travel, [[Robert Cervero]] has argued that the World Bank and other international aid agencies evaluate transportation investment proposals in developing and rapidly motorizing cities less on the basis of potential travel-time savings and more on the accessibility benefits they confer.&lt;ref&gt;Cervero, Robert, 2011: Beyond Travel-Time Savings: An Expanded Framework for Evaluating Urban Transport Projects, The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, Department for International Development, Transport Research Support Program.[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/466801468178764085/pdf/702060ESW0P1200s0in0Urban0Transport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arabic Script.jpg|thumb]]
'''Middle Eastern studies''' (sometimes referred to as '''Near Eastern studies''') is a name given to a number of academic programs associated with the study of the history, culture, politics, economies, and geography of the [[Middle East]], an area that is generally interpreted to cover a range of nations including [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], [[Syria]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Yemen]], and [[Oman]]. It is considered a form of [[area studies]], taking an overtly interdisciplinary approach to the study of a region. In this sense Middle Eastern Studies is a far broader and less traditional field than classical [[Islamic Studies]].

The subject was historically regarded as part of [[Oriental studies]], which also included [[East Asian studies]] and [[Egyptology]] and other specialisms in the ancient civilizations of the region; the growth of the field of study in the West is treated at that article. Many academic faculties still cover both areas. Although some academic programs combine Middle Eastern Studies with [[Islamic Studies]], based on the preponderance of [[Muslim]]s in the region (with Israel and Lebanon being the only exceptions), others maintain these areas of study as separate disciplines.

==Contentious issues==
In 1978 [[Edward Said]], a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[United States of America|American]] professor of [[Comparative Literature]] at [[Columbia University]], published his book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'', in which he accused earlier scholars of a "subtle and persistent [[Eurocentric]] prejudice against [[Arab]]o-Islamic peoples and their culture", claiming the bias amounted to a justification for [[imperialism]]. While other academics such as [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Irwin]] challenged Said's conclusions,&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;[[Flemming Rose]]: ''Forsvar for en profession'' [Defence of a profession], interview with Prof. Robert Irwin, ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'', 12 April 2008, section 1, page 17 (accessed via [http://infomedia.dk Infomedia.dk] and [http://www.jyllands-posten.dk/protected/premium/kultur/ECE3946459/forsvar-for-en-profession/ the newspaper's website])&lt;/ref&gt; the book soon became a standard text of [[literary theory]] and [[cultural studies]].

Israeli-American historian [[Martin Kramer]] in his 2001 book ''Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America'' accused Middle Eastern studies programs of ignoring the mounting threat of [[Islamic terrorism]]. In a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article published in 2001, Kramer claimed that Middle Eastern studies courses, as they stood, were "part of the problem, not its remedy". In a ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' review of the book, [[F. Gregory Gause]] said his analysis was, in part, "serious and substantive" but "far too often his valid points are overshadowed by academic score-settling and major inconsistencies."&lt;ref name="FGregoryGause"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57822/f-gregory-gause-iii/who-lost-middle-eastern-studies|title='Who Lost Middle-Eastern Studies?'|last1=Gause|first1=F.G.|date=March–April 2009|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[United States|American]] writer [[Daniel Pipes]] established an organisation called [[Campus Watch]] to combat what he perceived to be serious problems within the discipline, including "analytical failures, the mixing of politics with scholarship, intolerance of alternative views, apologetics, and the abuse of power over students". He encouraged students to advise the organization of problems at their campuses. In turn critics within the discipline such as [[John Esposito]] accused him of "[[McCarthyism]]".

In 2010, [[foreign policy]] analyst [[Mitchell Bard]] claimed in his 2010 book ''[[The Arab Lobby: The Invisible Alliance That Undermines America's Interests in the Middle East]]'' that elements of the [[Arab lobby in the United States|Arab lobby]] particularly [[Saudi Arabia]] and pro-[[Palestinian Arabs|Palestinian]] advocates were hijacking the academic field of Middle Eastern studies within several prominent American universities including [[Georgetown University]], [[Harvard University]], and [[Columbia University]].{{sfn|Bard|2010|pp=284; 306–11}} This has involved [[Saudi Arabia]] and other [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf States]] funding centers and chairs at universities to promote a pro-[[Arabist]] agenda.{{sfn|Bard|2010|p=284}} Bard has also accused several prominent Middle Eastern studies academics including [[John Esposito]] and [[Rashid Khalidi]] of abusing positions by advancing a pro-Palestinian political agenda.{{sfn|Bard|2010|pp=293–94; 307–08}}

In addition, Bard has criticized the Middle Eastern Studies Association (MESA) for adopting a pro-Palestinian standpoint. Bard has also alleged that MESA marginalizes non-Israel-related topics including the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict]] and the persecution of religious minorities like [[Christians]] and ethnic minorities that are non-Arabs such as [[Jews]] and [[Kurds]].{{sfn|Bard|2010|pp=295–97}} Finally, Bard has contended that since the [[September 11 attacks]], the Arab lobby working through Middle Eastern Studies university departments have sought to influence [[K–12 (education)|pre-university]] education by tailoring education programs and resources to reflect a pro-Arabist agenda.{{sfn|Bard|2010|pp=284; 322–23}}

[[File:Thrown, Combed tea bowl by Shoji Hamada (YORYM-2004.1.1957).JPG|thumb|Thrown, combed tea bowl by [[Shōji Hamada]]]]

{{nihongo|'''''Mingei'''''|民芸||"folk arts" or "arts of the people"}}, the [[Japan]]ese [[folk art]] movement, was developed in the late 1920s and 1930s in Japan. Its founding father was [[Yanagi Sōetsu]] (1889–1961).

==Origins==
In 1916, Yanagi made his first trip to [[Korea]] out of a curiosity for Korean crafts. The trip led to the establishment of the Korean Folk Crafts Museum in 1924, and the coining of the term ''mingei'' by Yanagi, potters [[Hamada Shōji]] (1894–1978) and [[Kawai Kanjirō]] (1890–1966). In 1926, the [[Folk Art]] Movement was formally declared by Yanagi Sōetsu. Yanagi rescued lowly pots used by commoners in the [[Edo]] and [[Meiji period]] that were disappearing in rapidly urbanizing Japan. In 1936, the Japanese Folk Crafts Museum was established.

==Theory==
The philosophical pillar of ''mingei'' is "hand-crafted art of ordinary people" ({{nihongo|民衆的な工芸|minshū-teki-na kōgei}}). Yanagi Sōetsu discovered beauty in everyday ordinary and utilitarian objects created by nameless and unknown craftsmen. According to Yanagi, utilitarian objects made by the common people are "beyond beauty and ugliness". Below are a few criteria of ''mingei'' art and crafts:

*made by anonymous crafts people
*produced by hand in quantity
*inexpensive
*used by the masses
*functional in daily life
*representative of the regions in which they were produced.

Yanagi's book ''The Unknown Craftsman'' has become an influential work since its first release in English in 1972. Yanagi's book examines the Japanese way of viewing and appreciating art and beauty in everyday crafts, including [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[lacquer]], [[textiles]], and [[woodwork]].

==Criticisms of Theory and Orientalism==
[[File:Thrown Bowl by Bernard Leach (YORYM-2004.1.166).JPG|thumb|Thrown bowl by [[Bernard Leach]]]]
In recent decades, scholars such as Yuko Kikuchi and Brian Moeran have claimed they have uncovered power relations and [[ultra-nationalism]] that lie at the core of the formation of ''mingei'' theory. In 1927, Yanagi put forward the "criterion of beauty in Japan" ({{lang|ja|日本における美の標準}} ''{{transl|ja|nihon ni okeru bi no hyōjun}}'') in ''The Way of Crafts'' ({{lang|ja|工芸の道}} ''{{transl|ja|kōgei no michi}}''). During the years of rising [[militarism]] in Japan, Sōetsu Yanagi extended his application of the "criterion of beauty" to the crafts of the [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawans]] and the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] in the Japanese peripheries, and to those of the [[Japanese colonies|colonies]] including [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Manchuria]]. These scholars argue that ''mingei'' theory, far from being an [[Oriental]] theory, is a "hybridization" and "appropriation" of [[Europe|Occidental]] ideas such as that of [[William Morris]] (1834–1896)&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/discussionpapers/2008/Nakanishi.html Wendy Jones Nakanishi, "The Anxiety of Influence: Ambivalent Relations Between Japan's 'Mingei' and Britain's 'Arts and Crafts' Movements", Electronic Journal of Japanese Studies, 28 October 2008'']&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Bernard Leach]] (1887–1979) introduced when he lived and worked in Japan from 1909 to 1920.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Citation

Yūko Kikuchi terms this phenomenon "Oriental Orientalism".

Yanagi’s ''Korea and its Art'' was severely criticized by Korean intellectuals as a "colonialist view of history" in 1974. Yanagi defined "beauty of sadness" ({{lang|ja|悲哀の美}} ''{{transl|ja|hiai no bi}}'') as the "innate, original beauty created by the Korean race" ({{lang|ja|民族の固有の美}} ''{{transl|ja|minzoku no koyū no bi}}''). Yanagi believed that the long history of foreign invasions of Korea was reflected in Korean art, and especially in its [[pottery]], in the "sad and lonely" lines. Such a theory has been criticized by Korean scholars as the "aesthetic of [[colonialism]]".

Nesin Mathematics Village hosts various mathematical activities, mostly short summer courses. Teaching in the mathematics village "is voluntary;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while the mathematics village does not provide honoria for the teachers, it provides free accommodations and meals".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krishnaswami Alladi and Gabriela Asli Rino Nesin|first=|year=2015|title=The Nesin Mathematics Village in Turkey|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201506/rnoti-p652.pdf|journal=Notices of the AMS|volume=62-6|pages=652–658|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courses range from high-school to graduate university courses. All high school courses are taught in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], as the students do not necessarily know foreign languages, but any undergraduate or postgraduate course may be taught in English.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Students usually stay in the village for a cycle of two weeks. Each Thursday, a vacation activity is organized. There are no TVs or broadcast music, although there are occasionally film screenings.

Around fifteen paid staff and nearly one hundred volunteers work there every year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The village has also been hosting domestic and international mathematics meetings recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://matematikkoyu.org/eng/events.php|title=Events {{!}} Nesin Mathematics Village|last=nesinvakfi.org|first=Nesin Vakfı -|website=matematikkoyu.org|language=tr|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Nesin is awarded the 2018 [[Leelavati Award]] for " his outstanding contributions towards increasing public awareness of mathematics in Turkey, in particular for his tireless work in creating the "Mathematical Village" as an exceptional, peaceful place for education, research and the exploration of mathematics for anyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mathunion.org/imu-awards/leelavati-prize/leelavati-prize-2018|title=Leelavati Prize 2018 {{!}} International Mathematical Union (IMU)|website=www.mathunion.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demolition scare==
According to a statement in July 2017 by Tekin Karadağ, the president of the Şirince Environment and Nature Association, Nesin Mathematics Village was slated for demolition by the authorities as being an "illegal construction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Şirince'de yıkım başlıyor|trans-title=Demolition begins in Şirince|author=Banu Şen|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/sirincede-yikim-basliyor-40536452|newspaper=[[Hürriyet]]|date=31 July 2017|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Harun Abuş, Director of Development and City Planning of Selçuk Municipality, declared that at this moment Nesin Mathematics Village is "not on the demolition calendar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Şirince'deki Matematik Köyü ve Nişanyan Evleri, yıkım takviminde yok"|trans-title="Mathematics Village and Nişanyan Houses in Şirince not on the demolition calendar"|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/sirincedeki-matematik-koyu-ve-nisanyan-evleri-yikim-takvimde-yok,417504|newspaper=T24|date=1 August 2017|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nazism and occultism''' describes a range of theories, speculation and research into the origins of [[Nazism]] and its possible relation to various [[occult]] traditions. Such ideas have been a part of [[popular culture]] since at least the early 1940s, and gained renewed popularity starting in the 1960s. There are documentaries and books on the topic, among the most significant are ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'' (1960) and ''[[Holy Lance#Trevor Ravenscroft|The Spear of Destiny]]'' (1972). Nazism and occultism has also been featured in numerous films, novels, comic books and other fictional media. A prominent example is the film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981).

Historian [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] analyzed the topic in ''[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]'' in which he argued there were in fact links between some ideals of [[Ariosophy]] and Nazi ideology. He also analyzed the problems of the numerous popular occult historiography books written on the topic. He sought to separate [[empiricism]] and [[sociology]] from the modern mythology of Nazi occultism that exists in many books which "have represented the Nazi phenomenon as the product of arcane and demonic influence". He considered most of these to be "sensational and under-researched".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 218–225&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ariosophy==
Historian [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]'s 1985 book, ''[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]'', discussed the possibility of links between the ideas of the [[Occult]] and those of Nazism. The book's main subject was the racist-occult movement of [[Ariosophy]], a major strand of Nationalist [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria]] during the 1800s and early 1900s. He described his work as "an underground history, concerned with the myths, symbols, and fantasies that bear on the development of reactionary, authoritarian, and Nazi styles of thinking". He focused on this unexamined topic of history because "fantasies can achieve a causal status once they have been institutionalized in beliefs, values, and social groups."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]'', Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

He describes the [[Völkisch movement]] as a sort of anti-modernist, anti-liberal reaction to the many political, social, and economic changes occurring in Germanic Europe in the late 1800s. Part of his argument is that the rapid [[industrialization]] and rise of cities changed the "traditional, rural social order" and ran into conflict with the "pre-capitalist attitudes and institutions" of the area. He described the racially elitist [[Pan-Germanism]] movement of [[ethnic German]] Austrians as a reaction to Austria not being included in the [[German Empire]] of Bismarck.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Goodrick-Clarke opined that the Ariosophist movement took Völkisch ideas but added occultish themes about things like Freemasonry, Kabbalism, and Rosicrucianism in order to "prove the modern world was based on false and evil principles". The Ariosophist "ideas and symbols filtered through to several anti-semitic and Nationalist groups in late Wilhelmian Germany, from which the early Nazi Party emerged in Munich after the First World War." He showed some links between two Ariosophists and [[Heinrich Himmler]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Modern mythology==
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a persistent idea, widely canvassed in a sensational genre of literature, that the Nazis were principally inspired and directed by occult agencies from 1920 to 1945.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 217"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Appendix E of Goodrick-Clarke's book is entitled ''The Modern Mythology of Nazi Occultism''. In it, he gives a highly critical view of much of the popular literature on the topic. In his words, these books describe Hitler and the Nazis as being controlled by a "hidden power . . . characterized either as a discarnate entity (e.g., '[[Black magic|black forces]]', '[[Cabal|invisible hierarchies]]', '[[Power behind the throne|unknown superiors]]') or as a magical elite in a remote age or distant location".&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 218"/&gt; He referred to the writers of this genre as "[[Pseudohistory|crypto-historians]]".&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 218"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 218.&lt;/ref&gt; The works of the genre, he wrote,
{{quote|were typically sensational and under-researched. A complete ignorance of the primary sources was common to most authors and inaccuracies and wild claims were repeated by each newcomer to the genre until an abundant literature existed, based on wholly spurious 'facts' concerning the powerful Thule Society, the Nazi links with the East, and Hitler's occult initiation.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224,225&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a new preface for the 2004 edition of ''The Occult Roots...'' Goodrick-Clarke comments that in 1985, when his book first appeared, "Nazi 'black magic' was regarded as a topic for sensational authors in pursuit of strong sales."&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2004: vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2002 work ''[[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|Black Sun]]'', which was originally intended to trace the survival of occult Nazi themes in the postwar period,&lt;ref name="GC02-6"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodrick-Clarke considered it necessary to readdress the topic. He devotes one chapter of the book to "the Nazi mysteries",&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 107–128.&lt;/ref&gt; as he terms the field of Nazi occultism there. Other reliable summaries of the development of the genre have been written by German historians. The German edition of ''The Occult Roots...'' includes an essay "Nationalsozialismus und Okkultismus" ("National Socialism and Occultism"), which traces the origins of the speculation about Nazi occultism back to publications from the late 1930s, and which was subsequently translated by Goodrick-Clarke into English. The German historian [[Michael Rißmann]] has also included a longer "excursus" about "Nationalsozialismus und Okkultismus" in his acclaimed book on [[Adolf Hitler's religious beliefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Rißmann 2001: 137–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Goodricke-Clarke the speculation of Nazi occultism originated from "post-war fascination with Nazism".&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 217"/&gt; The "horrid fascination" of Nazism upon the Western mind&lt;ref name="GC02-107"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 107.&lt;/ref&gt; emerges from the "uncanny interlude in modern history" that it presents to an observer a few decades later.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 217"/&gt; The idolization of Hitler in Nazi Germany, its short lived dominion on the European continent and Nazism's extreme [[antisemitism]] set it apart from other periods of modern history.&lt;ref name="GC02-107"/&gt; "Outside a purely secular frame of reference, Nazism was felt to be the embodiment of evil in a modern twentieth-century regime, a monstrous pagan relapse in the Christian community of Europe."&lt;ref name="GC02-107"/&gt;

By the early 1960s, "one could now clearly detect a mystique of Nazism."&lt;ref name="GC02-107"/&gt; A sensationalistic and fanciful presentation of its figures and symbols, shorn of all political and historical contexts", gained ground with thrillers, non-fiction books and films and permeated "the milieu of [[popular culture]]."&lt;ref name="GC02-107"/&gt;

===Historiography concerning ''The Occult Roots of Nazism''===
''The Occult Roots of Nazism'' is commended for specifically addressing the fanciful modern depictions of Nazi occultism, as well as carefully reflecting critical scholarly work that finds associations between Ariosophy with Nazi agency. As scholar [[Anna Bramwell]] writes, "One should not be deceived by the title into thinking that it belongs to the 'modern mythology of Nazi occultism', a world of salacious fantasy convincingly dismembered by the author in an Appendix," &lt;ref name="Bramwell, Anna 1988"&gt;Bramwell, Anna. 1988. "Review". The English Historical Review 103 (407). 156.&lt;/ref&gt; referring the various written, depicted, and produced material that delves into Nazi occultism without providing any reliable or relevant evidence. Instead, it is through Goodrick-Clarke's work that several scholarly criticisms addressing occult relevance in conjunction with Ariosophist practices arise.

Historians like [[Martyn Housden]] and [[Jeremy Noakes]] commend Goodrick-Clarke for addressing the relationship between Ariosophic ideologies rooted in certain Germanic cultures and the actual agency of Nazi hierarchy; the problem, as Housden remarks, lies in the efficacy of these Ariosophic practices. As he remarks, "The true value of this study, therefore, lies in its painstaking elucidation of an intrinsically fascinating subculture which helped colour rather than cause aspects of Nazism. In this context, it also leaves us pondering a central issue: why on earth were Austrian and German occultists, just like the Nazi leadership, quite so susceptible to, indeed obsessed by, specifically aggressive racist beliefs anyway?"&lt;ref&gt;Housden, Martyn. 1994. "Review". History 79 (255). 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Noakes continues this general thought by concluding, "(Goodrick-Clarke) provides not only a definitive account of the influence of Ariosophy on Nazism, a subject which is prone to sensationalism, but also fascinating insights into the intellectual climate of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Noakes, Jeremy. 1988. "Review". History 73 (238).364.&lt;/ref&gt; These reviews reflect the greatest dilemmas in Nazi occultist scholarship; the discernment between actual efficacy of possible Occult practices by Nazi leaders, purpose of these practices, and modern notions and applications of Occultism today largely impact the appropriate scholarship in general in making connections between plausible Nazi Ariosophic practices and blatant popular myth.&lt;ref name="Bramwell, Anna 1988"/&gt;

The linkages Goodrick-Clarke makes concerning Ariosophy and German society are further detailed in [[Peter Merkl]]'s ''Political Violence under the Swastika'', "pre-1933 Nazis", various NSDAP members, volunteered to write their memoirs and recollections about the rise of the Nazi Party in order to provide a coherent, statistical analysis of the motivations and ideals these early members hoped to pursue in German politics. From the findings, Merkl has found, through statistical evidence, that there were aspects of ideology within German society that favored intense German nationalism, ranging from what was considered to be a "German Romantic", one who was "beholden to the cultural and historical traditions of old Germany…"&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Merkl. 1975. Political Violence Under The Swastika: 581 Early Nazis. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; to someone classified as a part of an alleged "Nordic/Hitler Cult", one who followed [[Voelkisch]] (traditional, anti-Semitic) beliefs. To further prove the point, Merkl discovered that of those willing to submit their testimonies, "Protestants tended to be German Romantics, Catholics to be anti-Semites, superpatriots, and solidarists. Areas of religious homogeneity were particularly high in anti-Semitism or in the Nordic-German cult,"&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Merkl. 1975. Political Violence Under The Swastika: 581 Early Nazis. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; of which members of both religious groups were prone to [[Judenkoller]], an alleged sudden and violent sickness that would manifest either in blatant hatred or hysteria at being within proximity of Jewish persons. Coincidentally, Merkl mentions a relationship to this Nordic/German- agrarian cult in relation to 19th-century to a "crypto-Nazi tradition", despite being written ten years prior to ''The Occult Roots of Nazism''.

Some of this modern mythology even touches Goodrick-Clarke's topic directly. The rumor that Adolf Hitler had encountered the Austrian monk and anti-semitic publicist, [[Lanz von Liebenfels]], already at the age of 8, at Heilgenkreuz abbey, goes back to ''Les mystiques du soleil'' (1971) by Michel-Jean Angbert. "This episode is wholly imaginary."&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Michel-Jean Angbert and the other authors discussed by Goodrick-Clarke present their accounts as real, so that this modern mythology has led to several legends that resemble [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], concerning, for example, the [[Vril|Vril Society]] or rumours about [[Karl Haushofer]]'s connection to the occult. The most influential books were [[The Spear of Destiny (Ravenscroft)|Trevor Ravenscroft's ''The Spear of Destiny'']] and ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'' by Pauwels and Bergier.

===Claims===
One of the earliest claims of Nazi occultism can be found in [[Lewis Spence]]'s book ''Occult Causes of the Present War'' (1940). According to Spence, [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and his book ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' were responsible for promoting pagan, occult and anti-Christian ideas that motivated the Nazi party.

====Demonic possession of Hitler====
For a [[demon]]ic influence on Hitler, [[Hermann Rauschning]]'s ''Hitler Speaks'' is brought forward as source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plim.org/demonleaders.htm Demonic Possession of World Leaders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927063944/http://www.plim.org/demonleaders.htm |date=2006-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most modern scholars do not consider Rauschning reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Schieder (1972), ''Hermann Rauschnings "Gespräche mit Hitler" als Geschichtsquelle'' (Oppladen, Germany: Westdeutscher Verlag) and Wolfgang Hänel (1984), ''Hermann Rauschnings "Gespräche mit Hitler": Eine Geschichtsfälschung'' (Ingolstadt, Germany: Zeitgeschichtliche Forschungsstelle), cit. in Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke (2003), ''Black Sun'', p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; (As Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke summarises, "recent scholarship has almost certainly proved that Rauschning's conversations were mostly invented".)&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (2003: 110). The best that can be said for Rauschning's claims may be Goodrick-Clarke's judgment that they "record ... the authentic voice of Hitler by inspired guesswork and imagination" (''ibid.'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly to Rauschning, [[August Kubizek]], one of Hitler's closest friends since childhood, claims that Hitler—17 years old at the time—once spoke to him of "returning Germany to its former glory"; of this comment August said, "It was as if another being spoke out of his body, and moved him as much as it did me."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetrumpet.com/index.php?page=book&amp;q=1194.6.0.4 “Hitler and the Holy Roman Empire”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213128/http://www.thetrumpet.com/index.php?page=book&amp;q=1194.6.0.4 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article "Hitler's Forgotten Library" by Timothy Ryback, published in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' (May 2003),&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, Timothy W. [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200305/ryback "Hitler's Forgotten Library"]. ''[[The Atlantic]]'', May 2003. Accessed 27 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions a book from [[Hitler's private library]] authored by [[Ernst Schertel]]. Schertel, whose interests were [[flagellation]], dance, occultism, [[nudism]] and [[BDSM]], had also been active as an activist for [[Sexual revolution|sexual liberation]] before 1933. He had been imprisoned in Nazi Germany for seven months and his doctoral degree was revoked. He is supposed to have sent a dedicated copy of his 1923 book ''[[Magic: History, Theory and Practice]]'' to Hitler some time in the mid-1920s. Hitler is said to have marked extensive passages, including one which reads "He who does not have the demonic seed within himself will never give birth to a magical world".&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, JH. [http://www.prlog.org/10238075-new-translation-of-german-book-links-hitler-to-satanism.html "New Translation of German Book Links Hitler to Satanism"] (press release). PRLog, May 17, 2009. Accessed 28 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]] [[Alice A. Bailey]] stated during [[World War II]] that Adolf Hitler was possessed by what she called the ''Dark Forces''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957 (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Lucis Publishing Co. Page 425&lt;/ref&gt; Her follower [[Benjamin Creme]] has stated that through Hitler (and a group of equally evil men around him in Nazi Germany, together with a group of militarists in Japan and a further group around Mussolini in Italy&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957 (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Lucis Publishing Co. Page 258&lt;/ref&gt;) was released the energies of the [[Antichrist]],&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''[[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]]'s Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 416&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to theosophical teachings is not an individual person but forces of destruction.

According to [[James Herbert Brennan]] in his book ''[[Occult Reich]]'', Hitler's mentor, [[Dietrich Eckhart]] (to whom Hitler dedicates ''[[Mein Kampf]]''), wrote to a friend of his in 1923: "Follow Hitler! He will dance, but it is I who have called the tune. We have given him the 'means of communication' with Them. Do not mourn for me; I shall have influenced history more than any other German."

====New World Order====
Conspiracy theorists "frequently identify German National Socialism [[inter alia]] as a precursor of the New World Order".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 288.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to Hitler's later ambition of imposing a National Socialist regime throughout Europe, [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]] used the term ''Neuordnung'' (often poorly translated as "the [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order"]], while actually referring to the "re-structurization" of state borders on the European map and the resulting post-war economic hegemony of Greater Germany),&lt;ref&gt;Safire, William. [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/17/magazine/on-language-the-new-new-world-order.html "On Language; The New, New World Order"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 17, 1991. Accessed 27 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; so one could probably say that the Nazis pursued [[New world order (politics)|a new world order]] in terms of politics. But the claim that Hitler and the [[Thule Society]] conspired to create a [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]] (a conspiracy theory, put forward on some webpages)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswatchmagazine.org/weekly_editor/9.22.00.htm Historic Results of Hitler's Thule Societies pursuit of the NWO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207074923/http://www.newswatchmagazine.org/weekly_editor/9.22.00.htm |date=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is completely unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 201; Johannes Hering, ''Beiträge zur Geschichte der Thule-Gesellschaft'', typescript dated June 21, 1939, [[Bundesarchiv]], Koblenz, NS26/865.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aleister Crowley====
There are also unverifiable rumours that the occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] sought to contact Hitler during World War II. Despite several allegations and speculations to the contrary (e.g. [[Giorgio Galli]]) there is no evidence of such an encounter.&lt;ref name=Hakl205&gt;Hakl 1997: 205.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, [[John Symonds]], one of Crowley's [[literary executor]]s published a book: ''The Medusa's Head or Conversations between Aleister Crowley and Adolf Hitler'', which has definitively been shown to be literary fiction.&lt;ref name=Hakl205/&gt; That the edition of this book was limited to 350 also contributed to the mystery surrounding the topic.&lt;ref name=Hakl205/&gt; Mention of a contact between Crowley and Hitler—without any sources or evidence—is also made in a letter from [[René Guénon]] to [[Julius Evola]] dated October 29, 1949, which later reached a broader audience.&lt;ref name=Hakl205/&gt;

====Erik Jan Hanussen====
When ''[[Hitler and the Occult]]'' describes how Hitler "seemed endowed with even greater authority and charisma" after he had resumed public speaking in March 1927, the documentary states that "this may have been due to the influence" of the clairvoyant performer and publicist, [[Erik Jan Hanussen]]. It is said that "Hanussen helped Hitler perfect a series of exaggerated poses," useful for speaking before a huge audience. The documentary then interviews [[Dusty Sklar]] about the contact between Hitler and Hanussen, and the narrator makes the statement about "occult techniques of mind control and crowd domination".

Whether Hitler had met Hanussen at all is not certain. That he even encountered him before March 1927 is not confirmed by other sources about Hanussen. In the late 1920s to early 1930s Hanussen made political predictions in his own newspaper, ''Hanussens Bunte Wochenschau'', that gradually started to favour Hitler, but until late 1932 these predictions varied.&lt;ref name="Frei-85"&gt;Frei 1980: 85.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, Hanussen predicted, for example, that [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] would return to Germany in 1930 and that the problem of unemployment would be solved in 1931.&lt;ref name="Frei-85"/&gt;

====Winston Churchill====
Sir [[Winston Churchill]] wrote in his memoir "The Gathering Storm" about Hitler and [[Moloch]]: "[Hitler] had conjured up the fearful idol of an all-devouring Moloch of which he was the priest and incarnation".&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston S. ''The Gathering Storm: The Second World War, Volume 1'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=Daxn4IOTqC4C&amp;pg=PA64] Page 64&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nazi mysticism, occultism and science fiction====
Nazi mysticism in German culture is further expanded upon within [[Manfred Nagl]]'s article "SF (Science Fiction), Occult Sciences, and Nazi Myths", published in the journal ''[[Science Fiction Studies]]''. In it, Nagl writes that the racial narratives described in contemporary German Science Fiction stories, like The Last Queen of Atlantis, by Edmund Kiss, provide further notions of racial superiority under the auspices of Ariosophy, Aryanism, and alleged historic racial Mysticism, suggesting that writings associated with possible Occultism, Ariosophy, or Aryanism were products intended to influence and justify in a socio-political manner, rather than simply establish cultural heritage. The stories themselves dealt with "...heroes, charismatic leader types, (who) have been chosen by fate – with the resources of a sophisticated and extremely powerful technology"."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Nagl, Manfred. "SF, Occult Sciences, and Nazi Myths". Science Fiction Studies. 1 (3): 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Nagl considers science fiction pieces like Atlantis further fueled the violent persuasiveness of Nazi leaders, such as Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler, as further justification for a "Nazi elite (envisioning) for itself in occupied East European territories".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This, in turn, allegedly propagated public support of Nazi ideology, summated by Nagl as "a tremendous turning back of culture, away from the age of reason and consciousness, toward the age of a 'sleepwalking certainty', the age of supra-rational magic".&lt;ref&gt;Nagl, Manfred. "SF, Occult Sciences, and Nazi Myths". Science Fiction Studies 1 (3): 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crypto-historic books===
In the essay that is included in the German edition of ''The Occult Roots...'', H. T. Hakl, an Austrian publisher of esoteric works,&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-nb.info/gnd/123134625 Entry for Hans Thomas Hakl] from the [[German National Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; traces the origins of the speculation about National Socialism and Occultism back to several works from the early 1940s. His research was also published in a short book, ''Unknown sources: National Socialism and the Occult'', translated by Goodrick-Clarke. Already in 1933 a pseudonymous ''Kurt van Emsen'' described Hitler as a "demonic personality", but his work was soon forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Hakl 1997: 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The first allusions that Hitler was directed by occult forces which were taken up by the later authors came from French [[Esoteric Christianity|Christian esotericist]] René Kopp.&lt;ref name="hakl97-210"&gt;Hakl 1997: 210.&lt;/ref&gt; In two articles published in the monthly esoteric journal ''Le Chariot'' from June 1934 and April 1939, he seeks to trace the source of Hitler's power to supernatural forces.&lt;ref name="hakl97-210"/&gt; The second article was titled: "''L'Enigme du Hitler''".&lt;ref name="hakl97-210"/&gt; In other French esoteric journals of the 1930s, Hakl could not find similar hints.&lt;ref name="hakl97-210"/&gt; In 1939 another French author, Edouard Saby, published a book: ''Hitler et les Forces Occultes''.&lt;ref name="hakl97-212"&gt;Hakl 1997: 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Saby already mentions Hanussen and [[Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="hakl97-214"&gt;Hakl 1997: 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Hakl even hints that Edouard Saby would have the copyright on the myth of Nazi occultism.&lt;ref name="hakl97-214"/&gt; However, another significant book from 1939 is better known: [[Hermann Rauschning]]'s ''Hitler Speaks''. There it is said (in the chapter "Black and White Magic"), that "Hitler surrendered himself to forces that carried him away. (...) He turned himself over to a spell, which can, with good reason and not simply in a figurative analogy, be described as demonic magic." &lt;!--translated from German, if you have a quote from an English edition, please correct!--&gt; The chapter "Hitler in private" is even more dramatic, and was left out in the German edition from 1940.&lt;ref name="hakl97-211"&gt;Hakl 1997: 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodrick-Clarke examines several pseudo-historic "books written about Nazi occultism between 1960 and 1975", that "were typically sensational and under-researched".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224, 225.&lt;/ref&gt; He terms this genre "crypto-history", as its defining element and "final point of explanatory reference is an agent which has remained concealed to previous historians of National Socialism".&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 218"/&gt; Characteristic tendencies of this literature include: (1) "a complete ignorance of primary sources" and (2) the repetition of "inaccuracies and wild claims", without the attempt being made to confirm even "wholly spurious 'facts'".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Books debunked in Appendix E of ''[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]'' are:

* [[Louis Pauwels]] and [[Jacques Bergier]], 1960, ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]''&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dietrich Bronder, 1964, ''Bevor Hitler kam''&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 221"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 221.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trevor Ravenscroft, 1972, ''The Spear of Destiny''&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 221–223.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michel-Jean Angbert, 1971, ''Les mystiques du soleil''&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224"/&gt;
* [[James Herbert Brennan|J. H. Brennan]], 1974, ''[[The Occult Reich]]''&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 221"/&gt;
* [[Otto Rahn]], 1937, ''Luzifers Hofgesind, eine Reise zu den guten Geistern Europas'' (Lucifer's Court: A Heretic's Journey in Search of the Light Bringers).

These books are only mentioned in the Appendix. Otherwise the whole book by Goodrick-Clarke does without any reference to this kind of literature; it uses other sources. This literature is not reliable; however, books published after the emergence of ''The Occult Roots of Nazism'' continue to repeat claims that have been proven false:

* Wulf Schwarzwaller, 1988, ''The Unknown Hitler''&lt;ref&gt;If ''The Unknown Hitler'' is quoted correctly in [http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/NWO/Vril_Society.htm The Vril Society, the Luminous Lodge and the Realization of the Great Work], then this book makes false allegations about [[Karl Haushofer]] and [[G. I. Gurdjieff]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alan Baker, 2000, ''[[Invisible Eagle]]. The History of Nazi Occultism''&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5 of the [http://plausible.custompublish.com/getfile.php/217726.476.xauysabydy/invisible.eagle_alan.baker.pdf Free online version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715143102/https://plausible.custompublish.com/getfile.php/217726.476.xauysabydy/invisible.eagle_alan.baker.pdf |date=2007-07-15 }} of ''Invisible Eagle'' is mainly based on Ravenscroft.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentaries==
More than 60 years after the end of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], National Socialism and Adolf Hitler have become a recurring subject in history [[Documentary film|documentaries]]. Among these documentaries, there are several that focus especially on the potential relations between Nazism and Occultism, such as [[History (U.S. TV channel)|the History Channel]]'s documentary ''[[Hitler and the Occult]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The History Channel online Store: [http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=76782 The Unknown Hitler DVD Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106023116/http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=76782 |date=2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another critique of Hitler documentaries: [http://www1.salon.com/may97/media/media970508.html Mark Schone – All Hitler, all the time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129163121/http://www1.salon.com/may97/media/media970508.html |date=2012-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As evidence of Hitler's "occult power" this documentary offers, for example, the infamous statement by [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] of his continued subservience to Hitler at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].&lt;ref&gt;"Even with all I know, if in this cell Hitler should come to me and say 'Do this!', I would still do it." – [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], 1946&lt;/ref&gt; After the author [[Dusty Sklar]] has pointed out that [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's suicide]] happened at the night of April 30/May 1, which is [[Walpurgis Night]], the narrator continues: "With Hitler gone, it was as if a spell had been broken". A much more plausible reason for Hitler's suicide (that does not involve the paranormal) is that the Russians had already closed to within several hundred meters of [[Führerbunker|Hitler's bunker]] and he did not want to be captured alive.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-04051A, Reichsparteitag, Rede Adolf Hitlers.jpg|thumb|right|Hitler speaking at a huge mass meeting, the [[Nuremberg Rally]] 1934]]
From the perspective of academic history, these documentaries on Nazism, if ever commented, are seen as problematic because they do not contribute to an actual understanding of the problems that arise in the study of Nazism and Neo-Nazism. Without referring to a specific documentary [[Mattias Gardell]], a historian who studies contemporary separatist groups, writes:

{{quote|In documentaries portraying the Third Reich, Hitler is cast as a master magician; these documentaries typically include scenes in which Hitler is speaking at huge mass meetings. [...] Cuts mix Hitler screaming with regiments marching under the sign of the swastika. Instead of providing a translation of his verbal crescendos, the sequence is overlaid with a speaker talking about something different. All this combines to demonize Hitler as an evil wizard spellbinding an unwitting German people to become his zombified servants until they are liberated from the spell by the Allied victory after which, suddenly, there were no German Nazis left among the populace. How convenient it would be if this image were correct. National socialism could be defeated with garlic. Watchdog groups could be replaced with a few vampire killers, and resources being directed into anti-racist community programs could be directed at something else. [...]

The truth, however, is that millions of ordinary German workers, farmers and businessmen supported the national socialist program. [...] They were people who probably considered themselves good citizens, which is far more frightening than had they merely been demons.&lt;ref&gt;Gardell 2003, 331, 332&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;!--If Hitler (and also [[Stalin]]) or the Nazis in general, were the agents of Satan, or "'black forces', 'invisible hierarchies', 'unknown superiors' or any other 'discarnate entity'",&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985, 218"/&gt; this would be a convenient explanation. Explaining [[Hitler's rise to power]], the Second World War and possibly even [[The Holocaust]] by the means of the [[paranormal]] seems to serve the [[Functionalism (sociology)|function]] of protecting the authors and readers alike from having to deal with this [[Rationalist movement|rationally]].--&gt;
''[[Hitler and the Occult]]'' includes a scene in which Hitler is seen as speaking at a huge mass meeting. While Hitler's speech is not translated, the narrator talks about the German occultist and stage [[mentalist]] [[Erik Jan Hanussen]]: "Occultists believe, Hanussen may also have imparted occult techniques of mind control and crowd domination on Hitler" (see below). When historians have noted the existence of such "myths" as those about Erik Jan Hanussen, they have displayed nothing but academic contempt for their originators.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Ernst Schäfer's expedition to Tibet===
At least one documentary, ''Hitler's Search for the Holy Grail,'' includes footage from the [[1939 German expedition to Tibet]]. The documentary describes it as "the most ambitious expedition" of the SS. This original video material was made accessible again by Marco Dolcetta in his series ''Il Nazismo Esoterico'' in 1994.&lt;ref name="Hakl-204"&gt;Hakl 1997: 204&lt;/ref&gt; An interview that Dolcetta conducted with Schäfer does not support the theories of Nazi occultism, neither does Reinhard Greve's 1995 article ''Tibetforschung im SS Ahnenerbe'' (''Tibet Research Within the SS Ahnenerbe''),&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Greve: ''Tibetforschung im SS Ahnenerbe''; in: Thomas Hauschild: ''Lebenslust durch Fremdenfurcht'', Frankfurt (Main), 1995, pp. 168–209.&lt;/ref&gt; although the latter does mention the occult thesis.&lt;ref name="Hakl-204"/&gt; Hakl comments that Greve should have emphasized the unreliability of authors like Bergier and Pauwels or Angbert more.&lt;ref name="Hakl-204"/&gt; [[Ernst Schäfer]]'s expedition report explicitly remarks on the "worthless goings-on" &lt;!--wertloses Treiben--&gt;  by "a whole army of quacksalvers" concerning Asia and especially Tibet.&lt;ref name="Hakl-204"/&gt;

The image of a connection between Nazism and the occult is a common theme in [[fantasy fiction]]. One could also ask whether ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'' should not be considered as fiction, since the authors fail to clearly state that it was supposed to be fact. Aside from such considerations, there are also many accounts of Nazi occultism that are clearly fictional.

===Literature===
* [[Dennis Wheatley]]'s novel ''[[They Used Dark Forces]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denniswheatley.info/firsteditions08.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Occult-obsessed Nazis have long been a staple of [[superhero]] [[comic book]]s:
** Neo-Nazis are recurring villains in ''[[Warrior Nun Areala]]'', most notably [[Characters in Warrior Nun Areala#The Nazis|Dr. Frederick Ottoman]], a mad scientist with fleets of Nazi-UFOs and spies in every government.
** In the 1980s, [[DC Comics]] writer [[Roy Thomas]] invented a [[retcon]] to explain why [[Superman]], the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], and the [[Justice Society of America]] had been unable to defeat the Nazis: Hitler possessed the [[Spear of Destiny|Spear of Destiny (Spear of Longinus)]] which gave him magical control over any superheroes who ventured into his territory. Later appearances of the Spear in DC continuity also suggested that it was the [[Gungnir]], the spear wielded by [[Odin]] in Norse mythology.
** In the [[Marvel Comics]] comic book series ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'', [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] was summoned by Hitler to battle that superhero group; however, Thor soon realized he was being used, and returned to [[Asgard]].
** The Thule Society appears in [[Steve Gerber]]'s brief run on ''[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]''.
** The [[Hellboy]] comic books and movies also portray the Nazis and the [[Thule Society]] as powerful occult figures; in that universe, Hitler lived until 1958 and waged a "secret war" from [[South America]] after the collapse of the Third Reich.
** [[David Brin]]'s [[Novella|novelette]] "[[Thor Meets Captain America]]" and [[graphic novel]] ''[[The Life Eaters]]'' center on this theme, as well.
** The [[Danger Girl]] comic book features as its villains a modern-day Nazi group called 'The Hammer', which intends to use occult artifacts from [[Atlantis]] to establish a Fourth Reich.
** The [[Zenith (comics)|Zenith]] series, which appeared in the British science fiction comic ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' heavily features Nazi mysticism as the earthly conduit of extra-dimensional entities that threaten to destroy the universe.
* [[James Herbert]]'s novel, [[The Spear]], deals with a neo-Nazi cult in Britain and an international conspiracy which includes a right-wing US general and a sinister arms dealer, and their obsession with and through the occult with resurrecting Himmler.
* [[Katherine Kurtz]]'s novel ''[[Lammas Night]]'' presents Nazis as powerful magicians who must be opposed by British [[witches]].
* The villains of [[Clive Cussler]]'s novel ''[[Atlantis Found]]'' are modern Nazis who operate out of a secret base in Antarctica and are linked to the ancient culture of [[Atlantis]].

* [[Kouta Hirano|Kouta Hirano's]] [[manga]] series ''[[Hellsing]]'' features [[Millennium (Hellsing)|Millennium]], a group of Nazis with the purpose of creating a [[reich]] that will last a thousand years (in accordance with Hitler's vision). This organization is heavily mystical, including among its number a [[werewolf]], a [[catgirl|catboy]], and an army of 1,000 [[vampire]]s known as the ''Letztes Bataillon'' ("Last Battalion"). It is led by a former [[SS]] officer whose true intention is the pursuit of [[absolute war]].

* Nazi occult-hunters have been featured in Steven Spielberg's [[Indiana Jones]] films. The ''[[Ahnenerbe]]'' organization was the basis for the Nazi archaeologist villains in these movies. They involve several plots related to Nazi mysticism, especially as related to [[Nazi archaeology|archaeology]]. As one of the characters in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' says, Hitler is "obsessed with the occult." ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' connects the [[Holy Grail]] legend with Nazi occultism.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca A. Umland and Samuel J. Umland, "''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' (1989)," ''The Use of Arthurian Legend in Hollywood Film: From Connecticut Yankees to Fisher Kings'' (Contributions to the Study of Popular Culture) (Greenwood Press, 1996.), 167–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===
* The [[computer game]] ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' featured a plotline involving Nazi obsession with the occult. It portrays an organization (SS Paranormal Division) based on the Ahnenerbe practicing occult rituals and magic. The game drew themes of Nazi mysticism, among other things, from its predecessors, ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' and its prequel, ''[[Spear of Destiny (computer game)|Spear of Destiny]]'', the latter of which also featured a storyline concerning Nazi mysticism. ''[[Wolfenstein (series)|Wolfenstein]]'', for example, features a number of inspirations from the real-world Nazi regime but departs from historical reality in a number of ways. For example, the game aggrandizes the [[Kreisau Circle]] to be "an extensive resistance network of paramilitary fighters and informants that aides and abets B.J. [the protagonist] in his exploits," depicts the [[Thule Society]] (that Hitler formally disavowed while in power) as a "powerful nest of high-ranking Nazi officials within the Third Reich who are heavily involved in, and in some cases personally lead, the Reich's paranormal research efforts," and goes beyond Himmler's symbolic use of the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]] to make it a "limitless energy source that the Nazis are hell-bent on manipulating toward their own nefarious ends."&lt;ref&gt;"Real-life Insanity: ''Wolfenstein's'' events are fictional, but are inspired by the reality of the Nazi regime," ''Game Informer'' 184 (August 2008): 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[video game]] ''[[BloodRayne]]'' involves a plotline concerning the Thule society and its members and features a lot of in-game Thule society imagery (especially the character High Priest Von Blut).
* A fictional division of the [[Ahnenerbe]], the Karotechia, has a prominent place in the mythology of the [[Delta Green]] setting for the [[role playing game|role-playing game]] ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', and stories based upon the setting. In it, the survivors of the Karotechia, a group founded to study occult tomes and conduct magical research, live on in South America, training sorcerers, and cultists to found the Fourth Reich, all under the sway of Hitler's ghost (actually [[Nyarlathotep]] in disguise).
* The [[role playing game]] [[Hollow Earth Expedition]] features a fictionalized [[Thule Society]]'s attempts at infiltrating the [[Hollow Earth]].  The sourcebook, Secrets of the Surface World, further expands the efforts of Nazis to discover and use occult relics.
* The [[action game]] ''[[Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb]]'' revolves around a fictional Chinese artifact called the "Heart of the Dragon" which grants the wielder immense power. A large number of the opponents encountered by the protagonist, [[Indiana Jones]], works for the Nazi commander Albrecht Von Beck who intends to bring the artifact to Hitler.
* The PlayStation game ''[[Medal of Honor: Underground]]'' featured a mission where the main character had to infiltrate [[Wewelsburg|Wewelsburg Castle]]. The intro video and end video for the mission described occultism in the SS. During the mission, the character had to retrieve the Knife of Abraham, fight knights, and eventually ended up in a room with the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]] found on the floor, where the Nazis planned to bury their leaders, codenamed [[Valhalla]].
* The Xbox 360 game ''[[Operation Darkness]]'' features supernatural British commandos (werewolves etc.) fighting Nazi vampires, zombies, and other monsters conjured by Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Villoria, "[http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/operation-darkness/822418p1.html ''Operation: Darkness'' Preview]," ''GameSpy'' (September 23, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the game ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' the main character [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]] comes across a derelict, long-abandoned Nazi [[U-Boat]] stranded on rocks below a waterfall in the jungles of Central America. On it, he finds that the crew are dead and mutilated as well as a map to a mysterious island where the statue of [[El Dorado]] was taken to by the [[Spanish Conquistadors]]. Near the end of the game, Nathan finds himself in an abandoned German U-Boat base built into the island in which he finds that the Germans had sought to unlock the power of the statue of El Dorado but learned too late that it carried a curse that had mutated them into monsters.
* In ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'', Nathan Drake discovers the bodies of Nazi SS members in the [[Himalayas]]. It is revealed that they were [[German expedition to Tibet|attempting to find]] [[Shambhala]] and the [[Cintamani Stone]].
* In ''[[Clive Barker's Jericho]]'', an entire chapter of the game throws the Jerichos into World War II, where they are to defeat undead Nazis and their occultist leader Hanne Lichthammer.
* ''[[Tannhauser (board game)|Tannhauser]]'' pits Allies against agents of the defeated [[Third Reich]] using occult powers.
* ''[[Day After Ragnarok]]'' is a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[role-playing game]] by [[Kenneth Hite]] set in a devastated world following the Nazi's summoning of the [[Jörmungandr|world serpent]].
* The [[eroge]] [[11eyes]] deals with the occultist [[Thule Society]] as being a collaboration between the Nazi Party and the witch Lieselotte Werckmeister and its battle against the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s secret agents.

'''Paul M. Leonardi''' is the Duca Family Professor of Technology Management at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tmp.ucsb.edu/files/leonardi/CV.Leonardi.pdf|title=Curriculum Vitae: Paul M.

Leonardi moved to UCSB to found the [[Technology Management Program]] and start its [[Master of Technology Management]] and Ph.D. programs. Before joining UCSB, Leonardi was a faculty member in the School of Communication, the McCormick School of Engineering, and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

Leonardi’s research focuses on how companies can design their organizational networks and implement new technologies to more effectively create and share knowledge. He is particularly interested in how data intensive technologies, such as simulation and social media tools, enable new ways to access, store, and share information; how the new sources of information these technologies provide can change work routines and communication partners; and how shifts in employees’ work and communication alter the nature of an organization's expertise. His work on these topics cuts across the fields of [[Organization Studies]], [[Communication Studies]], and [[Information Systems]] and has been published in leading journals in these fields, such as ''[[Academy of Management Journal]]'', ''[[Academy of Management Review]]'', ''[[Journal of Communication]]'', ''[[Human Communication Research]]'', ''[[Information Systems Research]]'',  ''[[MIS Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Organization Science (journal)|Organization Science]].'' He is also the author of three books ''[[Car Crashes Without Cars: Lessons About Simulation Technology and Organizational Change from Automotive Design]]'' (2012, MIT Press), ''[[Materiality and Organizing: Social Interaction in a Technological World]]''(2012, Oxford University Press), and ''[[Technology Choices: Why Occupations Differ in Their Embrace of New Technologies]]'' (2015, MIT Press).

He has won awards for his research from the [[Academy of Management]],&lt;ref name="Gerardine DeSanctis Award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocis.aomonline.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=438&amp;Itemid=1|title=Gerardine DeSanctis Award :|publisher=Academy of Management |accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24222">'''Political economy of climate change''' is an approach that applies the [[political economy]] thinking of collective or political processes to study the critical issues surrounding the decision-making on climate change.

As the issue of [[climate change]] reaching the top of international agenda, the complexity of the [[environmental problems]] in combination with various other social political challenges have put great pressures on the scholars to explore a better understanding of the multiple actors and influencing factors that affect the climate change negotiation and to seek more effective solutions to [[Climate change mitigation|tackle climate change]]. Analyzing these issues from a political economy perspective helps to explain the complex interactions between different stakeholders in respond to climate change impacts and provides broader opportunities to achieve better implementation of [[Climate change policy|climate change policies]].

Climate Change is first and foremost a political issue now that it has become a widely believed fact. Before tackling the issue, it is important to determine how drastic the effects can be in order to address it in an appropriate manner. When dealing with climate change, the inhabitants of countries must see themselves as “global citizens” rather than separate entities if any real long-term progress is to be made. In accordance with a global perspective, countries balance legislation regarding climate change in a way that benefits developing nations while refraining from discouraging developed nations from contributing to the effort. 

== Introduction ==
=== Background ===
Climate change and [[global warming]] have become one of the most pressing [[environmental concerns]] and the greatest global challenges in society today, despite the fact that a consensus has never been reached in the debates over its causes and consequences. As this issue continues to dominate the international agenda, researchers from different academic sectors have for long been devoting great efforts to explore effective solutions to climate change, with technologists and planners devising ways of [[Climate change adaptation|mitigating]] and [[Climate change adaptation|adapting]] to climate change; economists estimating the cost of climate change and the cost of tackling it; development experts exploring the impact of climate change on social services and public goods. However, Cammack (2007)&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Cammack, D. (2007) ''Understanding the political economy of climate change is vital to tackling it'', Prepared by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] for UN Climate Change Conference in Bali, December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; points out two problems with many of the above discussions, namely the disconnection between the proposed solutions to climate change from different disciplines; and the devoid of politics in addressing climate change at the local level. Further, the issue of climate change is facing various other challenges, such as the problem of elite-resource capture, the resource constraints in [[Developing country|developing countries]] and the conflicts that frequently result from such constraints, which have often been less concerned and stressed in suggested solutions. In recognition of these problems, it is advocated that “understanding the political economy of climate change is vital to tackling it”.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the unequal distribution of the impacts of climate change and the resulting inequity and unfairness on the poor who contribute least to the problem have linked the issue of climate change with development study,&lt;ref&gt;Adger, W.N., Paavola, Y., Huq, S. and Mace, M.J. (2006) ''Fairness in Adaptation to Climate Change'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tol | first1 = R.S.J. | last2 = Downing | first2 = T.E. | last3 = Kuik | first3 = O.J. | last4 = Smith | first4 = J.B. | year = 2004 | title = Distributional Aspects of Climate Change Impacts | url = | journal = [[Global Environmental Change]] | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 259–72 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2004.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has given rise to various programmes and policies that aim at addressing climate change and promoting development.&lt;ref&gt;IEA, UNDP and UNIDO (2010) Energy Poverty: ''How to Make Modern Energy Access Universal?,'' special early excerpt of the [[World Energy Outlook]] 2010 for the UN General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals, Paris: OECD/IEA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nabuurs, G.J., Masera, O., Andrasko, K., Benitez-Ponce, P., Boer, R., Dutschke, M., Elsiddig, E., Ford-Robertson, J., Frumhoff, P., Karjalainen, T., Krankina, O., Kurz, W.A., Matsumoto, M., Oyhantcabal, W., Ravindranath, N.H., Sanz Sanchez, M.J. and Zhang, X. (2007) ‘Forestry’, in: ''Mitigation of Climate Change'', Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Although great efforts have been made on international negotiations concerning the issue of climate change, it is argued that much of the theory, debate, evidence-gathering and implementation linking climate change and development assume a largely apolitical and linear policy process.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;6.	Tanner, T. and Allouche, J. (2011) 'Towards a New Political Economy of Climate Change and Development', ''IDS Bulletin Special Issue: Political Economy of Climate Change'', '''42'''(3): 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, Tanner and Allouche (2011) suggest that [[List of climate change initiatives|climate change initiatives]] must explicitly recognise the political economy of their inputs, processes and outcomes so as to find a balance between effectiveness, efficiency and equity.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

=== Definition ===
In its earliest manifestations, the term “political economy” was basically a [[synonym]] of [[economics]],&lt;ref&gt;Groenewegen, E.(1987) 'Political economy and economics', in: Eatwell J. et al., eds., ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', Vol.3: 904-907, Macmillan &amp; Co., London.&lt;/ref&gt; while it is now a rather elusive term that typically refers to the study of the collective or political processes through which public economic decisions are made.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;Oates, W.E.and Portney, P.R.(2003) 'The political economy of environmental policy', in: ''Handbook of Environmental Economics'', chapter 08: p325-54&lt;/ref&gt; In the climate change domain, Tanner and Allouche (2011) define the political economy as “the processes by which ideas, power and resources are conceptualised, negotiated and implemented by different groups at different scales”.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; While there have emerged a substantial literature on the political economy of [[environmental policy]], which explains the “political failure” of the environmental programmes to efficiently and effectively protect the environment,&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; systematic analysis on the specific issue of climate change using the political economy framework is relatively limited.

== Current Context: The Urgent Need for Political Economy ==

=== Characteristics of Climate Change ===
The urgent need to consider and understand the political economy of climate change is based on the specific characteristics of the problem.

The key issues include:
* '''The cross-sectoral nature of climate change''': The issue of climate change usually fits into various sectors, which means that the integration of climate change policies into other policy areas is frequently called for.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2009) ''Policy Guidance on Integrating Climate Change Adaptation into Development Co-operation'', Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, this has resulted in the highly complexity of the issue, as the problem needs to be addressed from multiple scales with diverse actors involved in the complex [[governance]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rabe | first1 = B.G. | year = 2007 | title = Beyond Kyoto: Climate Change Policy in Multilevel Governance Systems | url = | journal = [[Governance (journal)|Governance: An International Journal of Policy, Administration, and Institutions]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 423–44 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2007.00365.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction of these facets leads to the political processes with multiple and overlapping conceptualisation, negotiation and governance issues, which requires the understanding of political economy processes.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;
* '''The problematic perception of climate change as simply a “global” issue''': Climate change initiatives and governance approaches have tended to be driven from the global scale. While the development of international agreements has witnessed a progressive step of global political action, this globally-led governance of climate change issue may be unable to provide adequate flexibility for specific national or sub-national conditions. Besides, from the development perspective of view, the issue of equity and global environmental justice would require a fair international regime within which the impact of [[climate change and poverty]] could be simultaneously prevented. In this context, climate change is not only a global crisis that needs the presence of international politics, but also a challenge for national or [[Sub-national entity|sub-national]] governments. The understanding of the political economy of climate change could explain the formulation and translation of international initiatives to specific national and sub-national policy context, which provides an important perspective to tackle climate change and achieve [[environmental justice]].&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;
* '''The growth of climate change finance''': Recent years have witnessed a growing number of financial flows and development of financing mechanisms in the climate change arena. The [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Cancun]], Mexico has committed significant amount of money from [[developed countries]] to developing world in supportive of the adaptation and mitigation technologies. In short terms, the fast start finance will be transferred through variety channels including bilateral and multilateral official development assistance, the [[Global Environment Facility]] and the [[UNFCCC]].&lt;ref&gt;Harmeling, S. and Kaloga, A. (2011)'Understanding the Political Economy of the Adaptation Fund', ''IDS Bulletin Special Issue: Political Economy of Climate Change'', '''42'''(3): 23-32&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, a growing number of public funds have provided greater incentives to tackle climate change in developing countries. For instance, the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience aims at creating an integrated and scaled-up approach of climate change adaptation in some low-income countries and preparing for future finance flows. In addition, climate change finance in developing countries could potentially change the traditional aid mechanisms, through the differential interpretations of [[Kyoto Protocol|‘common but differentiated responsibilities’]] by developing and developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Okereke | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Equity Norms in Global Environmental Governance | url = | journal = Global Environmental Politics | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 25–50 | doi=10.1162/glep.2008.8.3.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of equity and [[climate justice]], climate change resource flows are increasingly called on developed world according to the culpability for damages.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah, A., Muyungi, R., Jallow, B., Reazuddin, M. and Konate, M. (2009) ''National Adaptation Funding: Ways Forward for the Poorest Countries'', IIED Briefing Paper, International Institute for Environment and Development, London.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is inevitable to change the governance structures so as for developing countries to break the traditional donor-recipient relationships. Within these contexts, the understanding of the political economy processes of financial flows in climate change arena would be crucial to effectively governing the resource transfer and to tackling the climate change.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;
* '''Different [[ideological]] worldviews of responding to climate change''': Nowadays, because of the perception of science as a dominant policy driver, much of the policy prescription and action in climate change arena have concentrated on assumptions around standardised governance and planning systems, linear policy processes, readily transferable technology, economic rationality, and the ability of science and technology to overcome resource gaps.&lt;ref&gt;Leach, M., Scoones, I. and Stirling, A. (2010), ''Dynamic Sustainabilities–Technology, Environment, Social Justice'', London: [[Earthscan]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there tends to be a bias towards technology-led and managerial approaches to address climate change in apolitical terms. Besides, a wide range of different ideological worldviews would lead to a high divergence of the perception of climate change solutions, which also has a great influence on decisions made in response to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carvalho | first1 = A | year = 2007 | title = Ideological Cultures and Media Discourses on Scientific Knowledge: Re-reading News on Climate Chang | url = | journal = [[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 223–43 | doi=10.1177/0963662506066775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring these issues from a political economy perspective provides the opportunity to better understand the “complexity of politic and decision-making processes in tackling climate change, the power relations mediating competing claims over resources, and the contextual conditions for enabling the adoption of technology”.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;
* '''Unintended negative consequences of adaptation policies that fail to factor in environmental-economic trade-offs''': Successful adaptation to climate change requires balancing competing economic, social, and political interests. In the absence of such balancing, harmful unintended consequences can undo the benefits of adaptation initiatives. For example, efforts to protect coral reefs in Tanzania forced local villagers to shift from traditional fishing activities to farming that produced higher greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Editorial|title=Adaptation trade-offs|journal=Nature Climate Change|date=November 2015|volume=5|page=957|url=http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n11/pdf/nclimate2853.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2016|doi=10.1038/nclimate2853}} See also Sovacool, B. and Linnér, B.-O. (2016), ''The Political Economy of Climate Change Adaptation,'' Palgrave Macmillan UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socio-political Constraints ===
The role of political economy in understanding and tackling climate change is also founded upon the key issues surrounding the domestic socio-political constraints:&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

* '''The problems of''' '''[[fragile state]]s''': Fragile states—defined as poor performers, conflict and/or post-conflict states—are usually incapable of using the aid for climate change effectively. The issues of power and social equity have exacerbated the climate change impacts, while insufficient attention has been paid to the dysfunction of fragile states. Considering the problems of fragile states, the political economy approach could improve the understanding of the long-standing constraints upon capacity and resilience, through which the problems associated with weak capacity, state-building and conflicts could be better addressed in the context of climate change.
* ''' Informal governance:''' In many poorly performing states, [[decision-making]] around the distribution and use of state resources is driven by informal relations and private incentives rather than formal state institutions that are based on equity and law. This informal governance nature that underlies in the domestic social structures prevents the political systems and structures from rational functioning and thus hinders the effective response towards climate change. Therefore, domestic institutions and incentives are critical to the adoption of reforms. Political economy analysis provides an insight into the underlying social structures and systems that determine the effectiveness of climate change initiatives (1).
* '''The difficulty of social change:''' Developmental change underdeveloped countries is painfully slow because of a series of long-tem collective problems, including the societies’ incapacity of working collectively to improve wellbeing, the lack of technical and social ingenuity, the resistance and rejection to innovation and change. In the context of climate change, these problems significantly hinder the promotion of climate change agenda. Taking a political economy view at the underdeveloped countries could help to understand and create incentives to promote transformation and development, which lays a foundation for the expectation of implementing a climate change adaptation agenda.

== Research focuses and approaches ==

Brandt and Svendsen (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, U.S. and  Svendsen, G.T. (2003) ''The Political Economy of Climate Change Policy in the EU: Auction and Grandfathering'', IME Working Papers No. 51/03.&lt;/ref&gt; introduce a political economy framework that based on the political support function model by Hillman (1982)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hillman | first1 = A.L. | year = 1982 | title = Declining industries and political-support protec-tionist motives | url = | journal = [[The American Economic Review]] | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 1180–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; into the analysis of the choice of instruments to control climate change in the [[European Union]] policy to implement its [[Kyoto Protocol]] target level. In this political economy framework, the climate change policy is determined by the relative strength of stakeholder groups. By examining the different objective of different interest groups, namely industry groups, consumer groups and environmental groups, the authors explain the complex interaction between the choices of instrument for the EU climate change policy, specifically the shift from the green taxation to a grandfathered permit system.

A report by the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD) (2011) takes a political economy approach to explain why some countries adopt climate change policies while others do not, specifically among the countries in the transition region.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD (2011) 'Political economy of climate change policy in the transition region', in: ''Special Report on Climate Change: The Low Carbon Transition, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development'', Chapter Four.&lt;/ref&gt; This work analyzes the different political economy aspects of the characteristics of climate change policies so as to understand the likely factors driving climate change mitigation outcomes in many [[Transition country#Countries in transition|transition countries]]. The main conclusions are listed below:
* The level of [[democracy]] alone is not a major driver of climate change policy adoption, which means that the expectations of contribution to global climate change mitigation are not necessarily limited by the political regime of a given country.
* Public knowledge, shaped by various factors including the threat of climate change in a particular country, the national level of education and existence of free media, is a critical element in climate change policy adoption, as countries with the public more aware of the climate change causes are significantly more likely to adopt climate change policies. The focus should therefore be on promoting public awareness of the urgent threat of climate change and prevent [[information asymmetry|information asymmetries]] in many transition countries.
* The relative strength of the carbon-intensive industry is a major deterrent to the adoption of climate change policies, as it partly accounts for the information asymmetries. However, the carbon-intensive industries often influence government’s decision-making on climate change policy, which thus calls for a change of the incentives perceived by these industries and a transition of them to a low-carbon production pattern. Efficient means include the energy price reform and the introduction of international [[Emissions trading|carbon trading]] mechanisms.
* The competitive edge gained national economies in the transition region in a global economy, where increasing international pressure is put to reduce emissions, would enhance their political regime’s domestic legitimacy, which could help to address the inherent economic weaknesses underlying the lack of economic diversification and global economic crisis.

Tanner and Allouche (2011)&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; propose a new conceptual and methodological framework for analysing the political economy of climate change in their latest work, which focuses on the climate change policy processes and outcomes in terms of ideas, power and resources. The new political economy approach is expected to go beyond the dominant political economy tools formulated by international development agencies to analyse climate change initiatives&lt;ref&gt;DFID (2009) ''Political Economy Analysis: How to Note'', DFID Practice Paper, [[Department for International Development]], London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (2009) ''Problem-Driven Governance and Political Economy Analysis: Good Practice Framework'', [[World Bank]], Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (2004) ''Operationalizing Political Analysis: The Expected Utility Stakeholder Model and Governance Reforms'', PREM Notes 95, World Bank, Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; that have ignored the way that ideas and ideologies determine the policy outcomes (see [[#table-comparison|table]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, M.N. and Finnemore, M. (2004) ''Rules for the World: International Organizations in Global Politics'', [[Cornell University Press]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors assume that each of the three lenses, namely ideas, power and resources, tends to be predominant at one stage of the policy process of the political economy of climate change, with “ideas and ideologies predominant in the conceptualisation phase, power in the negotiation phase and resource, institutional capacity and governance in the implementation phase”.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; It is argued that These elements are critical in the formulation of international climate change initiatives and their translation to national and sub-national policy context.

'''Postdevelopment theory''' (also '''post-development''' or '''anti-development''' or '''development criticism''') holds that the whole concept and practice of [[regional development|development]] is a reflection of Western-Northern hegemony over the rest of the world. Postdevelopment thought arose in the 1980s out of criticisms voiced against development projects and [[development theory]], which justified them.

==Development as ideology==
The postdevelopment critique holds that modern [[development theory]] is a creation of academia in tandem with an underlying political and economic ideology. The academic, political, and economic nature of development means it tends to be policy oriented, problem-driven, and therefore effective only in terms of and in relation to a particular, pre-existing social theory.

The actual development projects thus initiated, by both governments and NGOs, are directed in accordance with this development theory. Development theory itself, however, assumes a framework already set in place by government and political culture in order to implement it. The development process is therefore ''socially constructed''; Western interests are guiding its direction and outcome, and so development itself fundamentally reflects the pattern of Western hegemony.

Development as an ideology and a social vision is ingrained in the ideals of modernization, which holds western economic structure and society as a universal model for others to follow and emulate. Rooted in western influence, the developmental discourse reflects the unequal power relations between the west and the rest of the world, whereby the western knowledge of development, approach toward development, and conception of what development entails, as well as perceptions of progress, directs the course for the rest of the world.

==Reviewing development==
Influenced by [[Ivan Illich]] and other critics of colonialism and postcolonialism, a number of post-development theorists like [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]] and [[Gustavo Esteva]] have challenged the very meaning of development. According to them, the way we understand development is rooted in the earlier colonial discourse that depicts the North as "advanced" and "progressive", and the South as "backward", "degenerate" and "primitive".

They point out that a new way of thinking about development began in 1949 with President [[Harry Truman]]'s declaration: "The old imperialism—exploitation for foreign profit—has no place in our plans. What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealings."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Truman Inaugural Address, January 20, 1949|url=https://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/50yr_archive/inagural20jan1949.htm|website=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library &amp; Museum|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While claiming that the "era of development" began at this point, post development theorists do not suggest that the concept of development was new. What ''was'' new was the definition of  development in terms of an escape from [[underdevelopment]]. Since the latter referred to two-thirds of the world, this meant that most societies were made to see themselves as having fallen into the undignified condition of "underdevelopment", and thus to look outside of their own cultures for salvation.

Development, according to these critics, was now a euphemism for post-war [[American hegemony]]; it was the ideals and development programs of the United States and its (Western) European allies that would form the basis of development everywhere else.

==Post-development theory==
Post-development theory arose in the 1980s and 1990s through the works of scholars like [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]], [[Gustavo Esteva]], [[Majid Rahnema]], [[Wolfgang Sachs]], [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]], [[Serge Latouche]], and [[Gilbert Rist]]. Leading members of the post-development school argue that development was always unjust, never worked, and at this point has clearly failed. According to [[Wolfgang Sachs]], a leading member of the post-development school, "the idea of development stands like a ruin in the intellectual landscape" and "it is time to dismantle this mental structure."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Sachs, "Introduction" in Sachs 1992: 1-5, citation p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

To cite an example of this "mental structure", development theorists point out how the concept of development has resulted in the hierarchy of developed and underdeveloped nations, where the developed nations are seen as more advanced and superior to the underdeveloped nations that are conceived as inferior, in need of help from the developed nations, and desiring to be like the developed nations. The post-development school of thought points out that the models of development are often ethnocentric (in this case Eurocentric), universalist, and based on western models of industrialization that are unsustainable in this world of limited resources and ineffective for their ignorance of the local, cultural and historical contexts of the peoples to which they are applied. In essence, the problem post-development theorists see in development and its practice is an imbalance of influence or domination by the west. Post development theorists promote more pluralism in ideas about development.

===Critique of ethnocentrism and universalism===
Among the starting points and basic assumptions of post-development thought is the idea that a middle-class, Western lifestyle and all that goes with it (which might include the nuclear family, mass consumption, living in suburbia and extensive private space), may neither be a realistic nor a desirable goal for the majority of the world's population. In this sense, development is seen as requiring the loss, or indeed the deliberate extermination (ethnocide)  of indigenous culture&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Futures: learning from Ladakh'' by Helena Norberg-Hodge. Sierra Club Books, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; or other psychologically and environmentally rich and rewarding modes of life. As a result, formerly satisfactory ways of life become dissatisfying because development changes people's perception of themselves.

[[Majid Rahnema]] cites [[Helena Norberg-Hodge]]: "To take an example, Helena Norberg-Hodge mentions how the notion of poverty hardly existed in [[Ladakh]] when she visited that country for the first time in 1975. Today she says, it has become part of the language. When visiting an outlying village some eight years ago, Helena asked a young Ladakhi where were the poorest houses. 'We have no poor houses in our village,' was the proud reply. Recently Helena saw the same Ladakhi talking to an American tourist and overheard him say, 'if only you could do something for us, we are so poor.'"&lt;ref&gt;Majid Rahnema, "Poverty" in: Sachs 1992: 158-176, citation p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Majid Rahnema also refers to Peter Bunyard, "Can Self-sufficient Communities survive the onslaught of Development?", The Ecologist, Vol. 14, 1984, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Development is seen as a set of knowledges, interventions and worldviews (in short, discourses) which are also powers: to intervene, to transform and to rule.  Post-development critiques challenge the notion of a single path to development and demands acknowledgment of diversity of cultural perspectives and priorities.

For example, the politics of defining and satisfying [[needs]] is a crucial dimension of development thought, deeply entwined in the concept of [[agency (sociology)|agency]]. But who voices development concerns, what power relations are played out, how do the interests of development "experts" (the [[World Bank]], IMF officials, professionals, and so on) rule the development priorities, and which voices are excluded as a result? The post-development approach attempts to overcome the inequality of this discourse by opening up spaces for non-Western peoples and their concerns.

Postdevelopment theory is, above all, a critique of the standard assumptions about progress: who possesses the key to it and how it may be implemented.

===Alternatives to development===
While the postdevelopment school provides a plethora of development critiques, it also considers alternative methods for bringing about positive change. The postdevelopment school proposes a particular vision of society removed from the discourse of development, modernity, politics, cultural and economic influences from the west, and market oriented and centralized authoritarian societies.

In his works, [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Escobar]] has outlined the common features of post-development thought and societal vision. According to Escobar, the post-development school of thought is interested (in terms of searching for an alternative to development) in "local culture and knowledge; a critical stance toward established scientific discourses; and the defense and promotion of localized, pluralistic grassroots movements." Grassroots movements, Escobar argues, are "local, pluralistic, and distrust organized politics and development establishment." ([https://books.google.at/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=M0NRDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT7&amp;dq=arturo+escobar+designs+for+the+pluriverse&amp;ots=NzHTavKElr&amp;sig=4ypQm3eI3YI89k-4LshndRAXp7E&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=arturo%20escobar%20designs%20for%20the%20pluriverse&amp;f=false Escobar, 2017])

Post-development thought takes inspiration from vernacular societies, the informal sector and frugal rather than materialistic lifestyles. Furthermore, post-development theorists advocate for structural changes. According to Escobar, post-developmental thinking believes that the economy must be based around solidarity and reciprocity; policy must focus on direct democracy; and knowledge systems should be traditional, or at least a hybrid of modern and traditional knowledge.

===James Ferguson===
{{Further|James Ferguson (anthropologist)}}
One of the leading anti-development writers, James Ferguson contributed to what John Rapley termed "the most important of the opening salvos" of post-development theory with his book ''The Anti-Politics Machine: Development, Depoliticization, and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho''. In ''The Anti-Politics Machine'' Ferguson describes the failure of the development project to properly understand the cultural and economic values of the people of Lesotho. This misunderstanding led to misappropriation of resources by the international community and myriad negative consequences for Basotho (residents of Lesotho), prompting Ferguson to comment that "Capitalist interests [...] can only operate through a set of social and cultural structures so complex that the outcome may be only a baroque and unrecognizable transformation of the original intention."&lt;ref name="Anti-Politics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=James|title=The Anti-Politics Machine: Development, Depoliticization, and Bureacratic Power in Lesotho|journal=The Ecologist|date=September–October 1994|volume=24|issue=5|pages=176–181|url=http://exacteditions.theecologist.org/read/resurgence/ecologist-vol-24-no-5-sep-oct-1994-6241/18/3|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development projects cannot simply create a desired result, but instead have a number of unexpected consequences.

Ferguson suggests that although development projects often end in failure, they still produce tangible impacts in the physical and social-political environment. In ''The Anti-Politics Machine'', he asks, "What do aid programs do besides fail to help poor people?"&lt;ref name="Anti-Politics"/&gt; In the case of Lesotho, Ferguson proposes that, "while the project did not transform livestock-keeping it did build a road to link to Thaba-Tsea more strongly with the capital."&lt;ref name="Anti-Politics"/&gt; Ferguson argues that there is value to understanding and thinking about the [[unintended consequences]] for an environment.

===Arturo Escobar===
{{Further|Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)}}
Critics of development do not deny the need for change. They argue instead that to enact proper and effective change, change itself must first be conceived in different terms. Arturo Escobar, another leading member of the post-development school, argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While social change has probably always been part of the human experience, it was only within the European modernity that 'society', i.e. the whole way of life of a people, was open to empirical analysis and made the subject of planned change. And while communities in the Third World may find that there is a need for some sort of organised or directed change—in part to reverse the damage done by development—this undoubtedly will not take the form of 'designing life' or social engineering. In this long run, this means that categories and meanings have to be redefined; through their innovative political practice, new social movements of various kinds are already embarked on this process of redefining the social, and knowledge itself.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Majid Rahnema===
{{Further|Majid Rahnema}}
Majid Rahnema addresses the question of which path to take directly in his conclusion to the ''Post-Development Reader''. Rahnema admits that it may be true that a large majority of people, whose lives are in fact difficult, do want change. But the answer he suggests is not development but the "end of development". He says that the end of development is not "An end to the search for new possibilities of change, for a relational world of friendship, or for genuine processes of regeneration able to give birth to new forms of solidarity". Rather, Rahnema argues, the "inhumane and the ultimately destructive approach to change is over. It should resemble a call to the 'good people' everywhere to think and work together."{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Serge Latouche===
{{Further|Serge Latouche}}
Serge Latouche is a [[French people|French]] [[emeritus]] [[professor]] in economy at the [[University of Paris-Sud]]. A  specialist in North-South economic and cultural relations, and in social sciences epistemology, he has developed a critical theory towards economic orthodoxy. He denounces [[economism]], [[utilitarianism]] in social sciences, [[Consumerism|consumer society]] and the notion of [[sustainable development]]. He particularly criticizes the notions of [[economic efficiency]] and [[economic rationalism]]. He is one of the thinkers and most renowned partisans of the [[Degrowth|degrowth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solutionslocales-lefilm.com/en/characters/serge-latouche {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231170033/http://www.solutionslocales-lefilm.com/en/characters/serge-latouche |date=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latouche has also published in the [[Mouvement Anti-Utilitariste dans les Sciences Sociales|Revue de Mauss]], a French anti-utilitarian journal.

===Wolfgang Sachs and ''The Development Dictionary''===
{{Further|Wolfgang Sachs}}
Wolfgang Sachs is a leading writer in post-development thought. Most of his writing is focused on environmentally sustainable development and the idea that past notions of development are naturally unsustainable practices on our finite planet. However, in 1992 he co-authored and edited ''The Development Dictionary: A Guide to Knowledge as Power'' which contributed greatly to the compilation of post development literature as a general theory.

This manifesto posits that the new era of development that emerged in the 1950s was created by the United States in order to secure its new hegemonic position in the global community. Sachs explains that the concept of "underdevelopment" was actually constructed in [[Harry S. Truman's 1949 inaugural address]], which popularized the term. Sachs argues that the creation of this term was a discrete, strategic move to secure American hegemony by reinforcing the idea that the United States is at the top, and other countries on a lower pillar, of a linear and singular trajectory of development. It created a homogeneous identity for these countries and stripped them of their own diverse characteristics. "It converts participation into a manipulative trick to involve people in struggles for getting what the powerful want to impose on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Wolfgang|title=The Development Dictionary: A Guide to Knowledge as Power|year=1992|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-85649-044-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Development Dictionary'' describes a biological metaphor for development. This biological metaphor was transferred to the social sphere and perpetuated the ideal that there is one natural way to develop into the perfect form. To develop in a manner disparate from the "natural order of things" was to become a disfigured anomaly. This definition held the potential to provide morally ambiguous justification for imperialist behavior and can be connected to colonial discourse and mainstream development theories. Under such categorization, Sachs explains, development was reduced to a simple measurement of the economic growth of per capita production.

Sachs issues a cry for public awareness of the "limits of development." He leaves the reader with the idea of the "New Commons" and posits that men and women should begin with this awareness before attempting to introduce new political policies with room for creativity and innovation in diverse development paths.

==Criticisms==

There is a large body of works which are critical of post-development theory and its proponents.  It has been noted that post-development theory sees all development as imposed upon the developing world by the West.  This dualist perspective of development may be unrealistic, and Marc Edelman notes that a large proportion of development has risen from, rather than been imposed upon, the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edelman|first=Marc|title=Peasants Against Globalization: Rural Social Movements in Costa Rica|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0804734011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Citing Jonathan Crush's point that "Development, for all its power to speak and to control the terms of speaking, has never been impervious to challenge and resistance, nor, in response, to reformulation and change"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crush|first=Jonathan|title=Power of Development|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-11176-8|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Kiely argues that "The post-development idea is thus part of a long history within the development discourse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiely|first=Ray|title=The Last Refuge of the Nohle Savage? A Critical Assessment of Post-Development Theory|journal=European Journal of Development Research|date=1 June 1999|volume=11|issue=1|pages=30–55|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=395bfdd5-ba80-4be4-a31c-e338a540617e%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=108|accessdate=12 February 2013|doi=10.1080/09578819908426726}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, Kiely argues that post-development theory is merely the latest version of a set of criticisms that have long been evident within writing and thought in the field of development. Development has always been about choices, Kiely explains.  Choices with resulting losers and winners, dilemmas and destruction, as well as creative possibility.

There are a number of more fundamental objections to the postdevelopment school. The first is that it overstates its case. A rejection of ''all development'' is a rejection of the possibility for material advancement and transformation. It ignores the tangible transformations in life opportunities and health and material well-being that has been evident in parts of the developing world. Moreover, development itself is so varied and carries so many meanings that critiques need to be specific about their intention when they claim to be "post- development". By damning development all together, post-development theorists fail to notice the heterogeneity within development discourse. They categorize all development under the umbrella of Western hegemony, contradictively applying the same sort of essentialist generalization post-development theorists reject.

Critics also argue that post-development perpetuates cultural relativism: the idea that cultural beliefs and practices can be judged only by those who practice them. By accepting all cultural behaviors and beliefs as valid and rejecting a universal standard for living and understanding life, critics of post-development argue, post-development represents the opposite extreme of universalism, extreme relativism.  Such a relativist extreme, rather than besting extreme universalism, has equally dangerous implications.  John Rapley points out that "rejection of essentialism rests itself on an essentialist claim – namely, that all truth is constructed and arbitrary[...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rapley|first=John|title=Development studies and the post-development critique|journal=Progress in Development Studies|date=1 October 2004|volume=4 | issue = 4|pages=350–354|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218128258|accessdate=12 February 2013|doi=10.1191/1464993404ps095pr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiely also argues that by rejecting a top-down, centralized approach to development and promoting development through local means, post-development thought perpetuates neo-liberal ideals. Kiely remarks that "The argument — upheld by [[Dependency theory|dependency]] and post-development theory — that the [[First World]] needs the [[Third World]], and vice versa, rehearses neo-liberal assumptions that the world is an equal playing field in which all nation states have the capacity to compete equally[...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiely|first=Ray|title=Development Theory and Industrialisation: Beyond the Impasse|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|year=1994|volume=24|issue=2|pages=133–160|doi=10.1080/00472339480000101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, making locals responsible for their own predicament, post-development unintentionally agrees with neo-liberalist ideology that favors decentralized projects and ignores the possibility of assisting impoverished demographics, instead making the fallacious assumption that such demographics must succeed on their own initiative alone. Kiely notes that not all grassroots movements are progressive. Post-development is seen to empower anti-modern fundamentalists and traditionalists, who may hold non-progressive and oppressive values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiely|first=Ray|title=The Last Refuge of the Noble Savage?

'''Willowbank''' is an independent educational institution located on the Willowbank [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] and in the village centre of [[Queenston, Ontario]], along the Canada-United States border. It operates a School of Restoration Arts which offers a three-year post-secondary diploma in conservation skills and theory, and a Centre for Cultural Landscape, a forum for [[cultural landscape]] theory and practice in Canada and the world. Willowbank was created from the rescue of a 19th-century estate which today forms the centre of its campus, and it is one of a handful of Canadian organisations of which His Royal Highness [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] is [[List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage|Royal Patron]].

==School of Restoration Arts==

Founded in 2006, the School of Restoration Arts offers a three-year, post-secondary Diploma in Heritage Conservation which combines academic and apprenticeship learning, taught by over 50 faculty associates who are leading practitioners in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.willowbank.ca/asset/1970/Willowbank_Release.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031135/http://www.willowbank.ca/asset/1970/Willowbank_Release.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} Press Release, The Prince of Wales becomes Royal Patron of Willowbank, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The School accepts a maximum of 18 students each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/school-of-restoration-arts/program/admissions/index/] Willowbank Admissions&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centre for Cultural Landscape==

The Willowbank Centre for Cultural Landscape is an initiative that builds on its exploration of [[cultural landscape]] theory and practice to define a particularly Canadian perspective in this area of current discussion and debate. It facilitates a program of lecture series, workshops and publications to promote a connection between cultural landscape and cultural practice, and to advocate for its ecological view of cultural and natural heritage conservation. The Centre also coordinates Willowbank’s seat in global deliberations about conservation, whose participants include a cross-section of board, staff and students. In 2013, Willowbank signed an agreement with the [[UNESCO]]-affiliated World Heritage Institute in Shanghai, China, with a focus on the UNESCO Recommendation for Historic Urban Landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/about-us/new/new/ Willowbank agreement with UNESCO-affiliated World Heritage Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was created in 2012 through a multi-year grant from the [[Ontario Trillium Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otf.ca/school-restoration-arts-willowbank?redirected=1] Ontario Trillium Foundation, 2012-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

Willowbank's campus is composed of two main parts, a 19th-century estate, and a former village elementary school with its surrounding lands. The former, described in further detail below, traces its history to 8,000 years of human habitation. The landscape of the estate includes a ravine and a hill upon which sits a 19th-century stone mansion. Newly built and re-built outbuildings have been constructed to house student workshops, including a barn and a forge and stone studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/national-historic-site/index/#menu-2] Willowbank National Historic Site&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjacent to the estate is the former Laura Secord School in the centre of the village, bought in 2012 by Willowbank after it was abandoned. The transfer is designed to house school activities while also returning the building and lands to community use and creating affordable housing. Its original wing was constructed in 1914, with substantial additions made in the 1950s. The original, two-classroom building housed students upstairs while the lower level was a centre of village life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2012/03/22/willowbank-buys-old-laura-secord-school] Willowbank buys old Laura Secord School, Niagara Falls Review, March 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field School==
Willowbank runs a three-week field school every summer in partnership with the Canova Association in the [[Ossola|Ossola Valley]] in Northern Italy. It is a microcosm of the diploma program, with an introduction to cultural landscape theory and practice, an experience of documentation and design, and then a major hands-on component. The work involves creative restoration and adaptive reuse of abandoned medieval stone structures, carried out under the direction of Italian masons and craftsmen. It coincides with the International Architect Encounter in the same place, an annual, intimate conference of world leaders in conservation and ecological design, with whom the field school’s participants are able to engage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/centre-for-cultural-landscape/short-courses/italy/index/] Willowbank Italy Field School&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Historic Site==

Willowbank's campus includes a designated [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] in the century estate to which it traces its name, also designated under Part IV of the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]'', and further protected by a heritage easement granted to The [[Ontario Heritage Trust]]. It is named after [[willow]] trees that were once located on its grounds, is an example of the rural estates of the wealthy settlers of early 19th century [[Upper Canada]]. Its mansion, which is the centre of campus, was built between 1832 and 1834 for Alexander Hamilton, third son of Robert Hamilton, one of the founders  of Upper Canada. Constructed in the [[Greek Revival]] style of [[architecture]] then at its height in North America for such grand houses, Willowbank's is an example of such buildings on the continent. Designed by architect, John Latshaw, and built of local [[Whirlpool]] [[sandstone]], the building is characterised by the rare features of eight hand-carved columns running its full two-story height, and by a front doorway of Greek design. The 13-acre estate today forms the centre of the Willowbank campus.

{{Conversion}}

In the [[sociology of religion]], '''secondary conversion''' is the [[religious conversion]] of an individual that results from a relationship with another convert, rather than from any particular aspect of the new religion. For example, someone might join a religious group primarily because their spouse or partner has done so; such a person would be a secondary convert. Secondary converts are people who join a religion only because of a relationship with the other convert.

Secondary conversion can greatly expand a movement's influence,&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2982">In high concentrations, [[selenium]] acts as an environmental [[contaminant]].  Sources of pollution include waste materials from certain mining, agricultural, petrochemical, and industrial manufacturing operations.  In [[Belews Lake]] North Carolina, 19 species of fish were eliminated from the lake due to 150-200&amp;nbsp;μg Se/L wastewater discharged from 1974 to 1986 from a Duke Energy coal-fired power plant.  At the [[Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge]] in California, thousands of fish and waterbirds were poisoned by selenium in agricultural irrigation drainage.

Substantial physiological changes may occur in fish with high tissue concentrations of selenium.  Fish affected by selenium may experience swelling of the gill [[lamella (zoology)|lamella]]e, which impedes oxygen diffusion across the gills and blood flow within the gills.  Respiratory capacity is further reduced due to selenium binding to [[hemoglobin]].  Other problems include degeneration of liver tissue, swelling around the heart, damaged egg follicles in ovaries, cataracts, and accumulation of fluid in the body cavity and head.  Selenium often causes a malformed fish fetus which may have problems feeding or respirating, distortion of the fins or spine is also common.  Adult fish may appear healthy despite their inability to produce viable offspring.

Selenium is [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulated]] in aquatic habitats, this results in higher concentrations in organisms than the surrounding water.  Organoselenium compounds can be concentrated over 200,000 times by [[zooplankton]] when water concentrations are in the 0.5 to 0.8&amp;nbsp;μg Se/L range.  Inorganic selenium bioaccumulates more readily in [[phytoplankton]] than zooplankton.  Phytoplankton can concentrate inorganic selenium by a factor of 3000.  Further concentration through bioaccumulation occurs along the food chain, as predators consume selenium rich prey.  It is recommended that a water concentration of 2&amp;nbsp;μg Se/L be considered highly hazardous to sensitive fish and aquatic birds.  Selenium poisoning can be passed from parents to offspring through the egg, and selenium poisoning may persist for many generations.Reproduction of mallard ducks is impaired at dietary concentrations of 7&amp;nbsp;ug Se/L.  Many benthic invertebrates can tolerate selenium concentrations up to 300&amp;nbsp;μg Se/L in their diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Like its analogs &amp;ndash; printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages &amp;ndash; the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]]), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on [[computer screen]]s and the development of [[scorewriter]] computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, "play back" the notated music using a [[synthesizer]] or [[virtual instrumentation|virtual instruments]].

Use of the term "sheet" is intended to differentiate written or printed forms of music from [[sound recording]]s (on [[vinyl record]], [[compact cassette|cassette]], [[Compact disc|CD]]), radio or TV broadcasts or recorded live performances, which may capture film or video footage of the performance as well as the audio component. In everyday use, "sheet music" (or simply "music") can refer to the print publication of commercial sheet music in conjunction with the release of a new [[Movie|film]], [[TV show]], [[record album]], or other special or popular event which involves music. The first printed sheet music made with a [[printing press]] was made in 1473.

Sheet music is the basic form in which Western [[classical music]] is notated so that it can be learned and performed by solo singers or instrumentalists or [[musical ensemble]]s. Many forms of [[traditional music|traditional]] and [[popular music|popular]] Western music are commonly learned by singers and musicians "by ear", rather than by using sheet music (although in many cases, traditional and pop music may also be available in sheet music form).

The term ''score'' is a common alternative (and more generic) term for sheet music, and there are several types of scores, as discussed below. The term ''score'' can also refer to [[theatre music]], [[orchestra]]l music or [[song]]s written for a [[play (theatre)|play]], [[musical theatre|musical]], [[opera]] or [[ballet]], or to music or songs written for a [[television program]]me or [[Movie|film]]; for the last of these, see [[Film score]].

===Title and credit===
Sheet music from the 20th and 21st century typically indicates the title of the song or composition on a [[title page]] or cover, or on the top of the first page, if there is no title page or cover. If the song or piece is from a [[movie]], [[Musical theatre|Broadway musical]], or [[opera]], the title of the main work from which the song/piece is taken may be indicated.

If the [[songwriter]] or [[composer]] is known, her or his name is typically indicated along with the title. The sheet music may also indicate the name of the [[lyrics|lyric-writer]], if the lyrics are by a person other than one of the songwriters or composers. It may also the name of the [[arranger]], if the song or piece has been arranged for the publication. No songwriter or composer name may be indicated for old [[folk music]], [[traditional music|traditional]] songs in genres such as [[blues]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and very old traditional [[hymn]]s and [[spirituals]], because for this music, the authors are often unknown; in such cases, the word ''Traditional'' is often placed where the composer's name would ordinarily go.

===Musical notation===
The type of [[musical notation]] varies a great deal by genre or style of music. In most [[classical music]], the [[melody]] and [[accompaniment]] parts (if present) are notated on the lines of a [[staff (music)|staff]] using round note heads. In classical sheet music, the staff typically contains:

# a [[clef]], such as [[bass clef]] {{music|bass}} or [[treble clef]] {{music|treble}}
# a [[key signature]] indicating the [[key (music)|key]]—for instance, a key signature with three [[Sharp (music)|sharps]] {{music|a major}} is typically used for the key of either [[A major]] or [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|sharp}} minor]]
# a [[time signature]], which typically has two numbers aligned vertically with the bottom number indicating the [[note value]] that represents one [[Beat (music)|beat]] and the top number indicating how many beats are in a [[Bar (music)|bar]]—for instance, a time signature of {{music|time|2|4|}} indicates that there are two [[quarter note]]s (crochets) per bar.

Most songs and pieces from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (ca. 1750) onward indicate the piece's [[tempo]] using an [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|expression]]—often in Italian—such as ''Allegro'' (fast) or ''Grave'' (slow) as well as its [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness or softness). The [[lyrics]], if present, are written near the melody notes. However, music from the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] (ca. 1600–1750) or earlier eras may have neither a tempo marking nor a dynamic indication. The singers and musicians of that era were expected to know what tempo and loudness to play or sing a given song or piece due to their musical experience and knowledge. In the [[contemporary classical music]] era (20th and 21st century), and in some cases before (such as the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] period in German-speaking regions), composers often used their native language for tempo indications, rather than Italian (e.g., "fast" or "''schnell''") or added [[metronome]] markings (e.g., {{music|quarternote}} = 100 beats per minute).

[[File:DwtkII-as-dur-fuga.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.5|A page from the autograph score of Fugue No. 17 in A{{music|flat}} major from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]''.]]

These conventions of classical music notation, and in particular the use of English tempo instructions, are also used for sheet music versions of 20th and 21st century [[popular music]] songs. Popular music songs often indicate both the tempo and genre: "slow blues" or "uptempo rock". Pop songs often contain chord names above the staff using letter names (e.g., C Maj, F Maj, G7, etc.), so that an [[acoustic guitar]]ist or pianist can improvise a chordal [[accompaniment]].

In other styles of music, different musical notation methods may be used. In [[jazz]], while most professional performers can read "classical"-style notation, many jazz tunes are notated using [[chord chart]]s, which indicate the [[chord progression]] of a song (e.g., C, A7, d minor, G7, etc.) and its [[song form|form]]. Members of a jazz [[rhythm section]] (a [[jazz piano|piano]] player, [[jazz guitar]]ist and [[jazz bass|bassist]]) use the chord chart to guide their [[jazz improvisation|improvised]] [[accompaniment]] parts, while the "lead instruments" in a jazz group, such as a [[saxophone]] player or [[trumpet]]er, use the chord changes to guide their solo improvisation. Like popular music songs, jazz tunes often indicate both the tempo and genre: "slow blues" or "fast bop".

Professional [[country music]] [[session musician]]s typically use music notated in the [[Nashville Number System]], which indicates the chord progression using numbers (this enables [[bandleader]]s to change the key at a moment's notice). Chord charts using letter names, numbers, or [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]] (e.g., I–IV–V) are also widely used for notating music by [[blues]], [[R&amp;B]], [[rock music]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] musicians. Some chord charts do not provide any rhythmic information, but others use slashes to indicate beats of a bar and [[rhythm]] notation to indicate [[syncopation|syncopated]] "hits" that the songwriter wants all of the band to play together. Many guitar players and [[electric bass]] players learn songs and note tunes using [[tablature]], which is a graphic representation of which frets and strings the performer should play. "Tab" is widely used by rock music and heavy metal guitarists. Singers in many [[popular music]] styles learn a song using only a lyrics sheet, learning the melody "by ear" from the recording.

== Purpose and use ==
[[File:Oregon, My Oregon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The sheet music for the song "[[Oregon, My Oregon]]".]]
Sheet music can be used as a record of, a guide to, or a means to perform, a [[song]] or piece of music. Sheet music enables instrumental performers who are able to read [[music notation]] (a pianist, [[orchestra|orchestral instrument players]], a [[jazz]] band, etc.) or singers to perform a song or piece. In [[classical music]], authoritative musical information about a piece can be gained by studying the written [[Sketch (music)|sketches]] and early versions of compositions that the composer might have retained, as well as the final autograph score and personal markings on proofs and printed scores.

Comprehending sheet music requires a special form of literacy: the ability to read [[music notation]]. An ability to read or write music is not a requirement to compose music. There have been a number of [[composer]]s and [[songwriter]]s who have been capable of producing music without the capacity themselves to read or write in musical notation, as long as an [[amanuensis]] of some sort is available to write down the [[melody|melodies]] they think of. Examples include the blind 18th-century composer [[John Stanley (composer)|John Stanley]] and the 20th-century songwriters [[Lionel Bart]], [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. As well, in [[traditional music]] styles such as the [[blues]] and [[folk music]], there are many prolific songwriters who could not read music, and instead played and sang music "by ear".

The skill of [[sight reading]] is the ability of a musician to perform an unfamiliar work of music upon viewing the sheet music for the first time. Sight reading ability is expected of professional musicians and serious amateurs who play classical music, jazz and related forms. An even more refined skill is the ability to look at a new piece of music and hear most or all of the sounds ([[Melody|melodies]], [[Harmony|harmonies]], [[timbre]]s, etc.) in one's head without having to play the piece or hear it played or sung. Skilled composers and conductors have this ability, with [[Beethoven]] being a noted historical example.
[[File:Full score.jpg|thumb|A [[Conductor (music)|conductor]]'s score and [[Baton (conducting)|baton]]|left]]
Classical musicians playing [[orchestra]]l works, [[chamber music]], [[sonata]]s and singing [[choral]] works ordinarily have the sheet music in front of them on a [[music stand]] when performing (or held in front of them in a music folder, in the case of a [[choir]]), with the exception of solo instrumental performances of solo pieces, [[concerto]]s, or solo vocal pieces ([[art song]], [[opera]] [[aria]]s, etc.), where memorization is expected. In [[jazz]], which is mostly [[improvisation|improvised]], sheet music (called a ''[[lead sheet]]'' in this context) is used to give basic indications of [[melody|melodies]], [[chord (music)|chord]] changes, and [[arrangement]]s. Even when a jazz band has a lead sheet, chord chart or arranged music, many elements of a performance are improvised.

Handwritten or printed music is less important in other traditions of musical practice, however, such as [[traditional music]] and [[folk music]], in which singers and instrumentalists typically learn songs "by ear" or from having a song or tune taught to them by another person. Although much [[popular music]] is published in notation of some sort, it is quite common for people to [[Learning music by ear|learn a song by ear]]. This is also the case in most forms of western [[folk music]], where songs and dances are passed down by oral &amp;ndash; and aural &amp;ndash; tradition. Music of other cultures, both folk and classical, is often transmitted orally, though some non-Western cultures developed their own forms of [[musical notation]] and sheet music as well.

Although sheet music is often thought of as being a platform for new music and an aid to composition (i.e., the composer "writes" the music down), it can also serve as a visual record of music that already exists. Scholars and others have made transcriptions to render Western and non-Western music in readable form for study, analysis and re-creative performance. This has been done not only with folk or traditional music (e.g., [[Béla Bartók|Bartók's]] volumes of [[Magyars|Magyar]] and [[Romanians|Romanian]] folk music), but also with sound recordings of improvisations by musicians (e.g., [[jazz piano]]) and performances that may only partially be based on notation.  An exhaustive example of the latter in recent times is the collection ''The Beatles: Complete Scores'' (London: Wise Publications, 1993), which seeks to transcribe into [[Staff (music)|staves]] and [[tablature]] all the songs as recorded by [[the Beatles]] in instrumental and vocal detail.

==Types==&lt;!--[[Short score]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
Modern sheet music may come in different formats. If a piece is composed for just one instrument or voice (such as a piece for a solo instrument or for ''[[a cappella]]'' solo voice), the whole work may be written or printed as one piece of sheet music. If an instrumental piece is intended to be performed by more than one person, each performer will usually have a separate piece of sheet music, called a [[Part (music)|''part'']], to play from. This is especially the case in the publication of works requiring more than four or so performers, though invariably a ''full score'' is published as well. The sung parts in a vocal work are not usually issued separately today, although this was historically the case, especially before music printing made sheet music widely available.

Sheet music can be issued as individual pieces or works (for example, a popular song or a [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] sonata), in collections (for example works by one or several composers), as pieces performed by a given artist, etc.

When the separate instrumental and vocal parts of a musical work are printed together, the resulting sheet music is called a ''score''. Conventionally, a score consists of [[musical notation]] with each instrumental or vocal part in vertical alignment (meaning that concurrent events in the notation for each part are orthographically arranged). The term ''score'' has also been used to refer to sheet music written for only one performer. The distinction between ''score'' and ''part'' applies when there is more than one part needed for performance.

Scores come in various formats.

=== Full scores, variants, and condensations {{anchor|full score}} ===

A '''full score''' is a large book showing the music of all instruments or voices in a composition lined up in a fixed order. It is large enough for a [[Conducting|conductor]] to be able to read while directing [[orchestra]] or [[opera]] rehearsals and performances. In addition to their practical use for conductors leading ensembles, full scores are also used by [[musicologist]]s, [[music theory|music theorists]], [[composer]]s and music students who are studying a given work.

A '''miniature score''' is like a full score but much reduced in size. It is too small for use in a performance by a conductor, but handy for studying a piece of music, whether it be for a large ensemble or a solo performer. A miniature score may contain some introductory remarks.

A '''study score''' is sometimes the same size as, and often indistinguishable from, a miniature score, except in name. Some study scores are [[Octavo (book)|octavo]] size and are thus somewhere between full and miniature score sizes. A study score, especially when part of an anthology for academic study, may include extra comments about the music and markings for learning purposes.

A '''piano score''' (or [[reduction (music)|'''piano reduction''']]) is a more or less literal [[Transcription (music)|transcription]] for piano of a piece intended for many performing parts, especially orchestral works; this can include purely instrumental sections within large vocal works (see ''vocal score'' immediately below). Such arrangements are made for either piano solo (two hands) or piano [[duet]] (one or two pianos, four hands). Extra small staves are sometimes added at certain points in piano scores for two hands to make the presentation more complete, though it is usually impractical or impossible to include them while playing.

As with vocal score (below), it takes considerable skill to reduce an orchestral score to such smaller forms because the reduction needs to be not only playable on the keyboard but also thorough enough in its presentation of the intended [[Harmony|harmonies]], [[Texture (music)|textures]], [[Figuration (music)|figurations]], etc. Sometimes markings are included to show which instruments are playing at given points.

While piano scores are usually not meant for performance outside of study and pleasure ([[Franz Liszt]]'s [[Beethoven Symphonies (Liszt)|concert transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies]] being one group of notable exceptions), [[ballet]]s get the most practical benefit from piano scores because with one or two pianists they allow the ballet to do many rehearsals at a much lower cost, before an [[orchestra]] has to be hired for the final rehearsals. Piano scores can also be used to train beginning conductors, who can conduct a pianist playing a piano reduction of a symphony; this is much less costly than conducting a full orchestra. Piano scores of operas do not include separate staves for the vocal parts, but they may add the sung text and stage directions above the music.

A [[Part (music)|'''part''']] is an extraction from the full score of a particular instrument's part. It is used by orchestral players in performance, where the full score would be too cumbersome. However, in practice, it can be a substantial document if the work is lengthy, and a particular instrument is playing for much of its duration.
[[File:CuiVil3 2p204.png|thumb|upright=1.5|An excerpt of a piano-vocal score for [[César Cui]]'s opera ''[[William Ratcliff (Cui)|William Ratcliff]]''. {{audio|CuiVil3 2p204.mid|Play}}|left]]

===Vocal scores===
A '''[[vocal score]]''' (or, more properly, '''piano-vocal score''') is a reduction of the full score of a vocal work (e.g., [[opera]], [[Musical theatre|musical]], [[oratorio]], [[cantata]], etc.) to show the vocal parts (solo and [[Choir|choral]]) on their [[musical staff|staves]] and the orchestral parts in a [[Piano Reduction|piano reduction]] (usually for two hands) underneath the vocal parts; the purely orchestral sections of the score are also reduced for piano. If a portion of the work is ''[[a cappella]]'', a piano reduction of the vocal parts is often added to aid in [[rehearsal]] (this often is the case with ''a cappella'' religious sheet music).

Piano-vocal scores serve as a convenient way for vocal soloists and choristers to learn the music and rehearse separately from the orchestra. The vocal score of a [[Musical theatre|musical]] typically does not include the spoken dialogue, except for cues. Piano-vocal scores are used to provide piano accompaniment for the performance of operas, musicals and oratorios by amateur groups and some small-scale professional groups. This may be done by a single piano player or by two piano players. With some 2000s-era musicals, keyboardists may play [[synthesizer]]s instead of piano.
[[File:Chichester-Psalms.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A choral score for [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[Chichester Psalms]]''.]]
The related but less common '''choral score''' contains the choral parts with reduced accompaniment.

The comparable '''organ score''' exists as well, usually in association with church music for voices and orchestra, such as arrangements (by later hands) of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''. It is like the piano-vocal score in that it includes staves for the vocal parts and reduces the orchestral parts to be performed by one person. Unlike the vocal score, the organ score is sometimes intended by the arranger to substitute for the orchestra in performance if necessary.

A collection of songs from a given [[Musical theatre|musical]] is usually printed under the label '''vocal selections'''. This is different from the vocal score from the same show in that it does not present the complete music, and the piano accompaniment is usually simplified and includes the melody line.

===Other types===
A '''short score''' is a reduction of a work for many instruments to just a few staves. Rather than composing directly in full score, many composers work out some type of short score while they are composing and later expand the complete orchestration. An opera, for instance, may be written first in a short score, then in full score, then reduced to a vocal score for rehearsal. Short scores are often not published; they may be more common for some performance venues (e.g., band) than in others. Because of their preliminary nature, short scores are the principal reference point for those composers wishing to attempt a 'completion' of another's unfinished work (e.g. Movements 2 thru 5 of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 10 (Mahler)|10th Symphony]] or the third Act of [[Alban Berg]]'s opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'').

An '''open score''' is a score of a [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] piece showing each voice on a separate staff. In Renaissance or Baroque keyboard pieces, open scores of four staves were sometimes used instead of the more modern convention of one staff per hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Open score|author=Lalage Cochrane|access-date=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes synonymous with full score (which may have more than one part per staff).

Scores from the Baroque period (1600-1750) are very often in the form of a [[bass line]] in the bass clef and the melodies played by instrument or sung on an upper stave (or staves) in the treble clef. The bass line typically had figures written above the bass notes indicating which intervals above the bass (e.g., chords) should be played, an approach called ''[[figured bass]]''. The figures indicate which intervals the [[harpsichord]]ist, [[pipe organ]]ist or [[lute]] player should play above each bass note.
[[File:Trifle In Pyjamas lead sheet.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The lead sheet for the song "Trifle in Pyjamas"|left]]

===Popular music===
A '''[[lead sheet]]''' specifies only the melody, lyrics and harmony, using one staff with [[chord symbol]]s placed above and lyrics below. It is commonly used in [[popular music]] and in [[jazz]] to capture the essential elements of song without specifying the details of how the song should be arranged or performed.

A '''[[chord chart]]''' (or simply, '''chart''') contains little or no melodic information at all but provides fundamental harmonic information. Some chord charts also indicate the rhythm that should be played, particularly if there is a [[syncopation|syncopated]] series of "hits" that the arranger wants all of the rhythm section to perform. Otherwise, chord charts either leave the rhythm blank or indicate slashes for each beat.

This is the most common kind of written music used by professional [[session musician]]s playing [[jazz]] or other forms of [[Genres (popular music)|popular music]] and is intended for the [[rhythm section]] (usually containing piano, guitar, bass and drums) to improvise their [[accompaniment]] and for any [[jazz improvisation|improvising]] soloists (e.g., [[saxophone]] players or [[trumpet]] players) to use as a reference point for their extemporized lines.

A [[fake book]] is a collection of [[jazz]] songs and tunes with just the basic elements of the music provided. There are two types of fake books: (1) collections of lead sheets, which include the melody, chords, and lyrics (if present), and (2) collections of songs and tunes with only the chords. Fake books that contain only the chords are used by [[rhythm section]] performers (notably chord-playing musicians such as [[electric guitar]]ists and [[piano]] players and the bassist) to help guide their improvisation of [[accompaniment]] parts for the song. Fake books with only the chords can also be used by "lead instruments" (e.g., [[saxophone]] or [[trumpet]]) as a guide to their improvised solo performances. Since the melody is not included in chord-only fake books, lead instrument players are expected to know the melody.
[[File:Diatonic scale on C tablature clef.png|thumb|A C major scale in regular notation (above) and in [[tabulature]] for [[guitar]] (below).]]
A '''[[tablature]]''' (or '''tab''') is a special type of musical score &amp;ndash; most typically for a solo instrument &amp;ndash; which shows ''where'' to play the pitches on the given instrument rather than ''which'' pitches to produce, with rhythm indicated as well. Tabulature is widely used in the 2000s for guitar and electric bass songs and pieces in popular music genres such as [[rock music]] and [[heavy metal music]]. This type of notation was first used in the late [[Middle Ages]], and it has been used for keyboard (e.g., [[pipe organ]]) and for fretted string instruments (lute, guitar).

== History ==

===Precursors to sheet music===
[[Musical notation]] was developed before parchment or paper were used for writing. The earliest form of musical notation can be found in a [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablet that was created at [[Nippur]], in [[Sumer]] (today's [[Iraq]]) in about 2,000 BC. The tablet represents fragmentary instructions for performing music, that the music was composed in harmonies of thirds, and that it was written using a [[diatonic scale]].&lt;ref name="Kilmer1986"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kilmer |first1=Anne D. |date=1986 |title=Old Babylonian Musical Instructions Relating to Hymnody |jstor=1359953 |journal=Journal of Cuneiform Studies |publisher=The American Schools of Oriental Research  |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=94–98 |doi=10.2307/1359953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tablet from about 1,250 BC shows a more developed form of notation.&lt;ref name="Kilmer 1965"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kilmer |first=Anne D. |editor1-last=Güterbock |editor1-first=Hans G. |editor2-last=Jacobsen |editor2-first=Thorkild |date=21 April 1965 |title=The Strings of Musical Instruments: their Names, Numbers, and Significance |url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/as16.pdf |journal=Assyriological Studies |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |volume=16 |pages=261–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the interpretation of the notation system is still controversial, it is clear that the notation indicates the names of strings on a [[lyre]], the tuning of which is described in other tablets.&lt;ref name="West 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West |first1=M.L. |author-link1=Martin Litchfield West |date=1994 |title=The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts |jstor=737674  |journal=[[Music &amp; Letters]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=161–179 |doi=10.1093/ml/75.2.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are fragmentary, these tablets represent the earliest notated [[melody|melodies]] found anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name="West 1994" /&gt;

[[File:Delphichymn.jpg|thumb|The original stone at Delphi containing the second of the two [[Delphic Hymns]] to [[Apollo]]. The music notation is the line of occasional symbols ''above'' the main, uninterrupted line of Greek lettering.|left]]
[[Music of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] musical notation was in use from at least the 6th century BC until approximately the 4th century AD; several complete compositions and fragments of compositions using this notation survive. The notation consists of symbols placed above text syllables. An example of a complete composition is the [[Seikilos epitaph]], which has been variously dated between the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD.

In [[Music of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek music]], three hymns by [[Mesomedes]] of [[Crete]] exist in manuscript. One of the oldest known examples of music notation is a papyrus fragment of the Hellenic era play ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'' (408 BC) has been found, which contains musical notation for a choral ode. Ancient Greek notation appears to have fallen out of use around the time of the [[Decline of the Roman Empire]].

===Western manuscript notation===
Before the 15th century, Western music was written by hand and preserved in [[manuscript]]s, usually bound in large volumes. The best-known examples of Middle Ages music notation are medieval manuscripts of [[Monophony|monophonic]] [[chant]]. Chant notation indicated the notes of the chant melody, but without any indication of the rhythm. In the case of [[Medieval music|Medieval]] [[polyphony]], such as the [[motet]], the parts were written in separate portions of facing pages. This process was aided by the advent of [[mensural notation]], which also indicated the [[rhythm]] and was paralleled by the medieval practice of composing parts of [[polyphony]] sequentially, rather than simultaneously (as in later times). Manuscripts showing parts together in score format were rare and limited mostly to [[organum]], especially that of the [[Notre Dame school]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], if an [[Abbess]] wanted to have a copy of an existing composition, such as a composition owned by an Abbess in another town, she would have to hire a [[copyist]] to do the task by hand, which would be a lengthy process and one that could lead to transcription errors.

Even after the advent of music printing in the mid-1400s, much music continued to exist solely in composers' hand-written manuscripts well into the 18th century.

===Printing===
{{see also|History of music publishing|Music engraving}}

====15th century====
There were several difficulties in translating the new [[printing press]] technology to music. In the first printed book to include music, the ''[[Mainz Psalter]]'' (1457), the music notation (both staff lines and notes) was added in by hand. This is similar to the room left in other [[Incunabulum|incunabulae]] for [[Capital letters|capitals]]. The psalter was printed in [[Mainz]], Germany by [[Johann Fust]] and [[Peter Schöffer]], and one now resides in [[Windsor Castle]] and another at the [[British Library]]. Later, staff lines were printed, but scribes still added in the rest of the music by hand. The greatest difficulty in using [[movable type]] to print music is that all the elements must line up &amp;ndash; the note head must be properly aligned with the staff. In vocal music, text must be aligned with the proper notes (although at this time, even in manuscripts, this was not a high priority).

[[Music engraving]] is the [[art]] of drawing [[music notation]] at high quality for the purpose of mechanical reproduction. The first machine-printed music appeared around 1473, approximately 20 years after [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]] introduced the [[printing press]]. In 1501, [[Ottaviano Petrucci]] published ''[[Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A]]'', which contained 96 pieces of printed music. Petrucci's printing method produced clean, readable, elegant music, but it was a long, difficult process that required three separate passes through the printing press. Petrucci later developed a process which required only two passes through the press. But it was still taxing since each pass required very precise alignment for the result to be legible (i.e., so that the note heads would be correctly lined up with the staff lines). This was the first well-distributed printed polyphonic music. Petrucci also printed the first [[tablature]] with movable type. Single impression printing, in which the staff lines and notes could be printed in one pass, first appeared in London around 1520. [[Pierre Attaingnant]] brought the technique into wide use in 1528, and it remained little changed for 200 years.
[[File:Petrucci2.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece to Petrucci's Odhecaton]]

A common format for issuing multi-part, polyphonic music during the Renaissance was ''[[partbook]]s''. In this format, each voice-part for a collection of five-part [[Madrigal (music)|madrigals]], for instance, would be printed separately in its own book, such that all five part-books would be needed to perform the music. The same partbooks could be used by singers or instrumentalists. Scores for multi-part music were rarely printed in the Renaissance, although the use of score format as a means to compose parts simultaneously (rather than successively, as in the late Middle Ages) is credited to [[Josquin des Prez]].

The effect of printed music was similar to the effect of the printed word, in that information spread faster, more efficiently, at a lower cost, and to more people than it could through laboriously hand-copied manuscripts. It had the additional effect of encouraging amateur musicians of sufficient means, who could now afford sheet music, to perform. This in many ways affected the entire [[music industry]]. Composers could now write more music for amateur performers, knowing that it could be distributed and sold to the [[middle class]].

This meant that composers did not have to depend solely on the patronage of wealthy aristocrats. Professional players could have more music at their disposal and they could access music from different countries. It increased the number of amateurs, from whom professional players could then earn money by teaching them. Nevertheless, in the early years, the cost of printed music limited its distribution. Another factor that limited the impact of printed music was that in many places, the right to print music was granted by the monarch, and only those with a special dispensation were allowed to do so, giving them a [[monopoly]]. This was often an honour (and economic boon) granted to favoured court musicians or composers.

====16th century====
Mechanical [[Engraving|plate engraving]] was developed in the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Four Hundred Years of Music Printing|last = King|first = A. Hyatt|publisher = Trustees of the British Museum|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although plate engraving had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. [[Copper]] was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century, [[pewter]] became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early American Music Engraving and Printing|last = Wolfe|first = Richard J.|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = Urbana, IL|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate engraving was the methodology of choice for music printing until the late nineteenth century, at which point its decline was hastened by the development of photographic technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, the technique has survived to the present day and is still occasionally used by select publishers such as [[G. Henle Verlag]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.henle.com/en/the-publishing-house/music-engraving/index.html |title = Music Engraving |date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014 |website = G. Henle Publishers |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As musical composition increased in complexity, so too did the technology required to produce accurate musical scores. Unlike literary printing, which mainly contains printed words, music engraving communicates several different types of information simultaneously. To be clear to musicians, it is imperative that engraving techniques allow absolute precision. Notes of [[Chord (music)|chords]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamic markings]], and other notation line up with vertical accuracy. If text is included, each syllable matches vertically with its assigned melody. Horizontally, subdivisions of beats are marked not only by their flags and [[Beam (music)|beams]], but also by the relative space between them on the page.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The logistics of creating such precise copies posed several problems for early music engravers, and have resulted in the development of several music engraving technologies.

====19th century====
[[File:Tinpanalley.jpg|thumb|left|Buildings of New York City's [[Tin Pan Alley]] music publishing district in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlorsongs.com/insearch/tinpanalley/tinpanalley.php |title=America's Music Publishing Industry — The story of Tin Pan Alley |website=The Parlor Songs Academy }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the 19th century, the music industry was dominated by sheet music publishers. In the United States, the sheet music industry rose in tandem with [[blackface minstrelsy]]. The group of New York City-based music publishers, songwriters and composers dominating the industry was known as "[[Tin Pan Alley]]". In the mid-19th century, [[copyright]] control of melodies was not as strict, and publishers would often print their own versions of the songs popular at the time. With stronger copyright protection laws late in the century, songwriters, composers, lyricists, and publishers started working together for their mutual financial benefit.  New York City publishers concentrated on vocal music. The biggest music houses established themselves in New York City, but small local publishers &amp;ndash; often connected with commercial printers or music stores &amp;ndash; continued to flourish throughout the country. An extraordinary number of East European immigrants became the music publishers and songwriters on Tin Pan Alley-the most famous being [[Irving Berlin]]. Songwriters who became established producers of successful songs were hired to be on the staff of the music houses.

The late-19th century saw a massive explosion of [[parlor music]], with ownership of, and skill at playing the [[piano]] becoming ''de rigueur'' for the middle-class family. In the late-19th century, if a middle-class family wanted to hear a popular new song or piece, they would buy the sheet music and then perform the song or piece in an amateur fashion in their home. But in the early 20th century the [[phonograph]] and recorded music grew greatly in importance. This, joined by the growth in popularity of [[radio broadcasting]] from the 1920s on, lessened the importance of the sheet music publishers. The [[record industry]] eventually replaced the sheet music publishers as the music industry's largest force.

===20th century and early 21st century===
[[File:Screenshot general 3 large.png|thumb|The screenshot from a 2000s-era [[scorewriter]] program. While the first scorewriter programs from the 1980s had poor-quality notation, 2016-era scorewriters provide professional-looking music notation.]]
In the late 20th and into the 21st century, significant interest has developed in representing sheet music in a computer-readable format (see [[Scorewriter|music notation software]]), as well as downloadable files. [[Music OCR]], software to "read" scanned sheet music so that the results can be manipulated, has been available since 1991.

In 1998, virtual sheet music evolved further into what was to be termed [[digital sheet music]], which for the first time allowed publishers to make copyright sheet music available for purchase online. Unlike their hard copy counterparts, these files allowed for manipulation such as instrument changes, transposition and [[MIDI]] (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) playback. The popularity of this instant delivery system among musicians appears to be acting as a catalyst of new growth for the industry well into the foreseeable future.

An early computer notation program available for home computers was [[Music Construction Set]], developed in 1984 and released for several different platforms. Introducing concepts largely unknown to the home user of the time, it allowed manipulation of notes and symbols with a pointing device such as a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]; the user would "grab" a note or symbol from a palette and "[[Drag and drop|drop]]" it onto the staff in the correct location. The program allowed playback of the produced music through various early sound cards, and could print the musical score on a graphics printer.

Many software products for modern [[digital audio workstation]] and [[List of scorewriters|scorewriters]] for general personal computers support generation of sheet music from MIDI files, by a performer playing the notes on a MIDI-equipped keyboard or other [[MIDI controller]] or by manual entry using a mouse or other computer device.

In 1999, [[Harry Connick, Jr.]] invented a system and method for coordinating music display among players in an orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|6348648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connick's invention is a device with a computer screen which is used to show the sheet music for the musicians in an orchestra instead of the more commonly used paper. Connick uses this system when touring with his [[big band]], for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macobserver.com/article/2002/03/07.6.shtml |title=Harry Connick Jr. Uses Macs at Heart of New Music Patent |publisher=The Mac Observer |date=2002-03-07 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the classical music world, some [[string quartet]] groups use computer screen-based parts. There are several advantages to computer-based parts. Since the score is on a computer screen, the user can adjust the contrast, brightness and even the size of the notes, to make reading easier. In addition, some systems will do "page turns" using a foot pedal, which means that the performer does not have to miss playing music during a page turn, as often occurs with paper parts.

Of special practical interest for the general public is the [[Mutopia project]], an effort to create a library of [[public domain]] sheet music, comparable to [[Project Gutenberg]]'s library of public domain books. The [[International Music Score Library Project]] (IMSLP) is also attempting to create a virtual library containing all [[public domain]] musical scores, as well as scores from composers who are willing to share their music with the world free of charge.

Some [[scorewriter]] computer programs have a feature that is very useful for composers and arrangers: the ability to "play back" the notated music using [[synthesizer]] sounds or [[virtual instrumentation|virtual instruments]]. Due to the high cost of hiring a full symphony orchestra to play a new composition, before the development of these computer programs, many composers and arrangers were only able to hear their orchestral works by arranging them for piano, organ or string quartet. While a scorewiter program's playback will not contain the nuances of a professional orchestra recording, it still conveys a sense of the tone colors created by the piece and of the interplay of the different parts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4960">'''Signal Corps Radios''' were [[U.S. Army]] military communications components that comprised "sets". Under the Army Nomenclature System, the abbreviation '''SCR''' initially designated "Set, Complete Radio", but was later misinterpreted as "Signal Corps Radio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Getting the message through: A Branch History of the U.S. Army Signal Corps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noEBBvjbwVMC&amp;pg=PA172|year=1996|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-087281-5|pages=172–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Scr300.png|thumb|right|200px|Example of a Signal Corps Radio set: the [[SCR-300]]-A]]

==Nomenclature==
The term SCR was part of a nomenclature system developed for the [[U.S. Signal Corps]], used at least as far back as [[World War I]]. Three-letter designators beginning with "SC" were used to denote complete systems, while one and two-letter designators (such as "BC", for basic component, "FT" for mounting, etc.) were used for components. Only a few system designators were used:

:::SCM   Set, Complete, Meteorological
:::SCR   Set, Complete, Radio
:::SCS   Set, Complete, System

==SCR radio sets==
The U.S. Signal Corps used the term "sets" to denote specific groupings of individual components such as transmitters, receivers, power supplies, handsets, cases, and antennas.  SCR radio sets ranged from the relatively small [[SCR-536]] "handie talkie" to high-powered, truck-mounted mobile communications systems like the [[SCR-299]] and large [[microwave radar]] systems such as the [[SCR-584 radar]].

==SCS==
The SCS designator was applied to groups of SCR-numbered sets comprising an extensive system, such as multiple radio sets employed in a ground-based fighter direction/control center.  The SCR designator could be a single transmitting or receiving set, or a full set of both transmitting and receiving equipment.

==Additional Designators==
An additional designator, "RC" was used for subsystems or groups of accessories. The [[Joint Electronics Type Designation System]] which came into use in 1943 absorbed or superseded the SC designations.&lt;ref name=ER&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mote|first1=Ray|title=World War Two Nomenclature Systems|url=http://www.hypertools.com/nomenclature.html|publisher=Electric Radio Magazine, June/July 1995|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Situational Crisis Communication Theory''' ('''SCCT''', 2007), posited by W. Timothy Coombs is a theory in the field of [[crisis communication]]. It suggests that crisis managers should match strategic crisis responses to the level of crisis responsibility and [[reputation]]al threat posed by a crisis.&lt;ref name="coombs a"&gt;Coombs, W. T. (2007a). Crisis management and communications. Retrieved March 20, 2012 from http://www.instituteforpr.org/topics/crisis-management-and-communications/&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluating the crisis type, crisis history and prior relationship reputation will help crisis managers predict the level of reputational threat of an organization and how that organization’s publics will perceive the crisis and attribute crisis responsibility. Thus SCCT can be applied in an organization's [[crisis management]].

Coombs created his experimentally based SCCT to give communicators scientific evidence to guide their decisions, essentially stating that the actions an organization takes post-crisis depends on the crisis situation. "SCCT identifies how key facets of the crisis situation influence attributions about the crisis and the reputations held by stakeholders. In turn, understanding how stakeholders will respond to the crisis informs the post-crisis communication".&lt;ref name="coombs b"&gt;Coombs, W.T. (2007b). Protecting organization reputations during a crisis: The development and application of situational crisis communication theory. ''Corporate Reputation Review'', 10(3), 163-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coombs would later expand his work with SCCT through reflections of [[meta-analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=6&amp;sid=59897697-78d5-44cb-891d-dedfd9b8dae7@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Reflections on a meta-analysis: Crystallizing thinking about SCCT.: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[empirical evidence]] to support his theory, Coombs&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt; provided a summary of crisis response strategy guidelines for crisis managers, given here in Table 1. SCCT provides crisis managers with an evidence-based guide to assessing and responding to crises, allowing them to make informed, strategic, and beneficial decisions. 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!'''''Table 1: SCCT crisis response strategy guidelines'''''
|-
| 1.	Informing and adjusting information alone can be enough when crises have minimal attributions of crisis responsibility (victim crises), no history of similar crises and a neutral or positive prior relationship reputation.
|-
| 2.	Victimage can be used as part of the response for workplace violence, product tampering, natural disasters and rumors.
|-
| 3.	Diminish crisis response strategies should be used for crises with minimal attributions of crisis responsibility (victim crises) coupled with a history of similar crises and/or negative prior relationship reputation.
|-
| 4.	Diminish crisis response strategies should be used for crises with low attributions of crisis responsibility (accident crises), which have no history of similar crises, and a neutral or positive prior relationship reputation.
|-
| 5.	Rebuild crisis response strategies should be used for crises with low attributions of crisis responsibility (accident crises), coupled with a history of similar crises and/or negative prior relationship reputation.
|-
| 6.	Rebuild crisis response strategies should be used for crises with strong attributions of crisis responsibility (preventable crises) regardless of crisis history or prior relationship reputation.
|-
| 7.	The deny posture crisis response strategies should be used for rumor and challenge crises, when possible.
|-
| 8.	Maintain consistency in crisis response strategies. Mixing deny crisis response strategies with either the diminish or rebuild strategies will erode the effectiveness of the overall response.

== Theoretical framework ==
The roots for SCCT can be found in [[Attribution Theory]]. Attribution Theory holds that people constantly look to find causes, or make attributions, for different events, especially if those events are particularly negative or unexpected. People will attribute responsibility for the event and react emotionally to that event.&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt; In the case of organizations, attributions of [[causality]] elicit emotional reactions from stakeholders, especially negative emotions if the organization is attributed as the cause for a crisis. These negative emotions, like anger, affect stakeholders’ future interactions with the organization, changing behaviors like purchases and word-of-mouth recommendations. 
 
Attribution Theory provided one of the first links between crisis situations and crisis responses. Attributions of responsibility that shape strategic crisis responses formed the foundation for SCCT. Coombs built upon Attribution Theory, using it as a base to predict the severity of potential reputational harm—or reputational threat—a crisis may bring to an organization and, using that prediction, guide communication response decisions to minimize damage.

Coombs draws on William Benoit's [[image restoration theory]] in his conceptualization of responsibility and reputational threat, stating that perception is fundamental to assessments of both components. If the audience perceives that the organization is at fault, a reputational threat is put into existence and the organization is held responsible.

== Crisis responsibility and reputational threat ==
SCCT suggests that the key to determining the most effective strategic crisis response is understanding the crisis situation and the amount of reputational threat being posed by the crisis. Reputational threat is how much damage a crisis could inflict on an organization if no action is taken to respond to it. Reputational threat is influenced by three elements: (1) initial crisis responsibility, (2) crisis history and (3) prior relational reputation.&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt;

Initial crisis responsibility is how much the organization’s stakeholders attribute the crisis to the organization; how responsible the key publics hold the organization itself for the crisis. In assessing the level of reputational threat facing an organization, crisis managers must first determine the type of crisis facing the organization.

== Types of crises ==
Coombs has identified three "crisis clusters," or types of crises, in his SCCT research: the victim cluster, the accidental cluster, and the intentional cluster.&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt; Table 2 outlines these crisis clusters. In the victim cluster, the organization is not attributed as the cause of the crisis; rather, the organization is viewed as a victim. In the accidental cluster, the organization has been nominally attributed as the cause of the crisis, but the situation is generally viewed by stakeholders as being unintentional or simply accidental. In the intentional cluster, the organization is given all or most of the attributions for the crisis and shoulders the responsibility. In this case the crisis is considered deliberate.

One example where SCCT was used was the lockout that began within the National Hockey League in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=8&amp;sid=59897697-78d5-44cb-891d-dedfd9b8dae7@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Game off!: Understanding newspaper portrayals of the NHL lockout through si...: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| (Weak attributions of crisis responsibility = Mild reputational threat)
|-
| ''Natural disaster'': Acts of nature damage an organization such as an earthquake.
|-
| ''Rumor'': False and damaging information about an organization is being circulated.

Once it is determined which type of crisis, or which cluster, the organization’s situation falls under, managers can predict how much attribution will be placed on the organization and how much reputational threat it is facing. In fact, Coombs’ own prior research showed that crisis responsibility and organizational reputation are negatively related.&lt;ref name="c&amp;h96"&gt;Coombs, W. T., &amp; Holladay, S. J. (1996). Communication and attributions in a crisis: An experimental study of crisis communication. ''Journal of Public Relations Research'', 8(4), 279-295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="c&amp;h01"&gt;Coombs, W. T., &amp; Holladay, S. J. (2001). An extended examination of the crisis situation: A fusion of the relational management and symbolic approaches. ''Journal of Public Relations Research'', 13(4), 321-340.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crisis history and relational reputation==
Another element that threatens an organization's reputation is its history of crisis, whether it has faced similar crises in the past. Within this context, how well an organization has treated its stakeholders in the past—its prior relational reputation—also plays a part in assessing reputational threat. These two elements are involved in the second step crisis managers must take in evaluating the reputational threat facing the organization: if either of these elements exist within the organization, it will intensify attributions of the organization and increase the level of reputational threat. If an organization has a history of facing crises or a poor history of dealing with its stakeholders, attributions of crisis responsibility and the level of reputational threat are greater.

Because of crisis responsibility and reputational threat, crises can effect changes in emotions, and as a result, behaviors. If a person perceives an organization to have a high level of crisis responsibility, he or she is more likely to have feelings of anger toward the organization. Conversely, lower levels of crisis responsibility can evoke feelings of sympathy. Both of these feelings can affect the behaviors of the person toward the organization, whether that person will act positively or negatively toward the organization.

== Crisis response strategies ==

Once the levels of crisis responsibility and reputational threat have been determined, SCCT provides crisis managers with a theoretical base to their strategic crisis response. SCCT’s list for responding to crises assumes that the organization has accepted some level of responsibility for the crisis. Coombs found that the primary responses to crises in SCCT form three groups: deny, diminish, and rebuild. The SCCT list of crisis response strategies is shown in Table 3.

Each of these strategies helps the organization get its side of the story into the media. After all how the crisis is framed in the media will determine how the organization’s publics view the situation.&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt; The media’s frames become the stakeholders’ frames. The ''deny'' strategies help establish a crisis frame and sever any perceived connection between the organization and the crisis. If the organization is not involved, or if the crisis is a rumor the organization can dispel, and stakeholders and the media accept that there is no crisis, no reputational harm will be done.

''Diminish'' crisis responses attempt to assure the organization’s publics that the crisis is not as bad as it seems or that the organization had nothing to do with the situation. These strategies help lessen the connection between the organization and the crisis and help the organization’s publics see the crisis in a less negative light. However, these strategies must be reinforced with credible evidence. If conflicting crisis frames are presented in the media, the organization’s publics will adopt whichever frame comes from the most credible source. ''Rebuild'' strategies help change perceptions of an organization during a crisis by offering real or symbolic forms of aid to victims and asking their forgiveness. These strategies attempt to take the focus off the crisis by taking positive action.

A secondary type of responses, ''bolstering'', attempts to increase positive reputational perceptions by presenting "new, positive information about the organization and/or remind[ing] stakeholders of past good works by the organization".&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt; This strategy can bolster goodwill and arouse feelings of sympathy toward the organization, but Coombs warns, should be used to supplement the primary responses, not as replacements.&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt;

SCCT suggests that how an organization communicates with its publics—what it says—will affect its publics’ perceptions of the organization. Those perceptions can shape how an organization’s publics emotionally react to or behave toward to the organization. Therefore, the communication decisions crisis managers make in the wake of a crisis could have great consequences, either positive or negative. It is imperative that crisis managers act strategically to save the organization’s reputation. According to Coombs:&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt;
"Crisis response strategies have three objectives relative to protecting reputations: (1) shape attributions of the crisis, (2) change perceptions of the organization in crisis and (3) reduce the negative effect generated by the crisis."

'''Supplementary process''' is a method of [[debt collection]] where the debtor who has a court money judgement against him is brought into court, "requiring the judgment debtor to appear at a time and place named therein and submit to an examination relative to his or its property and ability to pay."&lt;ref&gt;M.G.L. Ch. 224, s. 14 https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleII/Chapter224/Section14&lt;/ref&gt; The process is common in [[Massachusetts]] under M.G.L. Ch. 224, s. 14.  If the debtor does not appear in court, a [[Capias ad respondendum]] may issue where a sheriff brings the debtor into court to respond.

The term should not be confused with [[weapons engineering]], which is the actual engineering design and development of weapon systems.

The [[United States Department of Defense]] defines the term as the process of determining the quantity of a specific type of lethal or nonlethal weapons required to achieve a specific level of damage to a given target, considering target vulnerability, weapon effect, munitions delivery accuracy, damage criteria, probability of kill and weapon reliability.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

'''World Book Day''' is a charity event held annually in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on the first Thursday in March. It is the local manifestation of ''[[World Book and Copyright Day]]'' (also known as ''International Day of the Book'' or ''World Book Days'') organized by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] to promote [[reading (activity)|reading]], [[publishing]] and [[copyright]]. On World Book Day, every child in full-time education in the UK is given a voucher to be spent on books.

The Day was first celebrated in 1995 in the United Kingdom. The original, global [[World Book Day]] event is generally observed on 23 April - it was changed in the UK to avoid clashes with Easter school holidays and with [[St George's Day]]. Conversely, a separate event [http://www.worldbooknight.org/ World Book Night] organized by independent charity [[The Reading Agency]] is held on 23 April.

==History==
The United Kingdom's own version of World Book Day began in 1998, launched by [[British Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] at the [[Globe Theatre]] in London.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Several million schoolchildren in the UK were given a special £1 World Book Day Book Token (€1.50 in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) which could be redeemed against any book in any UK bookshop. A specially created WBD anthology priced at £1 (€1.50 in Ireland) was also published. All World Book Day [[point of sale]] and the £1 book carried the special World Book Day logo to help unify the initiative through all outlets.

Since then, World Book Day UK has followed a similar pattern, gradually growing each year to encompass more initiatives, such as ''Spread The Word'', ''[[Quick Reads Initiative]]'' and ''Books for Hospitals''. Every year, the number of children receiving a World Book Day Book Token has increased.

In 2000, instead of a single £1 special anthology, four separate £1 [[List of World Book Day Books|books]] were published, covering a wider age-range.  Since then, each year has seen a new set of special £1 books published.

In 2006, World Book Day began its support of and association with the ''Quick Reads''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/vitallink/Quickreads.html#background Quick Reads website]&lt;/ref&gt; initiative for adult emergent readers.

In 2007, World Book Day celebrated its 10th anniversary with the publication of 10 £1 books. Since then every child in full-time education in the UK and Ireland is entitled to receive a £1 World Book day Book token every year. They can swap their WBD token for one of specially-produced [[List of World Book Day Books|£1 WBD books]] or they can get £1 off a full-price book or audio book priced £2.99 or more.

==Administration==
World Book Day is a registered [[Charitable organization|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?remchar=&amp;chyno=1079257  Charity Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; It does not raise funds for itself but does support [http://www.bookaid.org Book Aid International]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookaid.org/cms.cgi/site/  Book Aid International website]&lt;/ref&gt; and Readathon as its nominated charities, encouraging schools to hold special fundraising events for children less fortunate than themselves. World Book Day is not funded by the British Government although the Quick Reads element does receive support from ACE, DIUS and NIACE. The funding for World Book Day activities comes principally from the major sponsor, National Book Tokens&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalbooktokens.com/index.asp?m=32&amp;c=1157  National Book Tokens website]&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK book trade (publishers and booksellers).

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''''Wu''''' ({{zh|c=巫|p=''wū''|w=''wu''|l=[[shaman]]}}) are spirit mediums who have practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, rainmaking, and healing in Chinese traditions dating back over 3,000 years.

==The word ''wu''==
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word ''wu'' {{linktext|巫}} "spirit medium; shaman; shamaness; sorcerer; doctor; proper names" was first recorded during the [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600–1046 BCE), when a ''wu'' could be of either sex. During the late [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045-256 BCE) ''wu'' was used to specify "female shaman; sorceress" as opposed to ''xi'' 覡 "male shaman; sorcerer" (which first appears in the 4th century BCE [[Guoyu (book)|''Guoyu'']]). Other sex-differentiated shaman names include ''nanwu'' 男巫 for "male shaman; sorcerer; wizard"; and ''nüwu'' 女巫, ''wunü'' 巫女, ''wupo'' 巫婆, and ''wuyu'' 巫嫗 for "female shaman; sorceress; witch".

''Wu'' is used in compounds like ''[[Gu (poison)|wugu]]'' 巫蠱 "sorcery; cast harmful spells", ''wushen'' 巫神 or ''shenwu'' 神巫 (with [[Shen (Chinese religion)|''shen'']] "spirit; god") "wizard; sorcerer", and ''wuxian'' 巫仙 (with [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] "immortal; alchemist") "immortal shaman".

The word ''[[Tongji (spirit medium)|tongji]]'' 童乩 (lit. "youth diviner") "shaman; spirit-medium" is a near-synonym of ''wu''. Chinese uses phonetic [[transliteration into Chinese characters|transliteration]] to distinguish native ''wu'' from "[[Shamanism in Siberia|Siberian shaman]]": ''saman'' 薩滿 or ''saman'' 薩蠻. "Shaman" is occasionally written with Chinese Buddhist transcriptions of [[Shramana]] "wandering monk; ascetic": ''shamen'' 沙門, ''sangmen'' 桑門, or ''sangmen'' 喪門.

[[Joseph Needham]] (1954:134) suggests "shaman" was transliterated ''xianmen'' 羨門 in the name of [[Zou Yan]]'s disciple Xianmen Gao 羨門高 (or Zigao 子高). He quotes the ''[[Shiji]]'' that Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] (r. 221–210 BCE), "wandered about on the shore of the eastern sea, and offered sacrifices to the famous mountains and the great rivers and the eight Spirits; and searched for ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "immortals", [''xianmen''], and the like." Needham (1954:134) compares two later Chinese terms for "shaman": ''shanman'' 珊蛮, which described the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] leader [[Wanyan Xiyin]], and ''sizhu'' 司祝, which was used for imperial [[Manchu]] shamans during the [[Qing Dynasty]].

===Translations===
''Shaman'' is the common English translation of Chinese ''wu'', but some scholars (de Groot 1910, Mair 1990:35) maintain that the Siberian ''shaman'' and Chinese ''wu'' were historically and culturally different shamanic traditions. [[Arthur Waley]] (1955:9) defines ''wu'' as "spirit-intermediary" and says, "Indeed the functions of the Chinese ''wu'' were so like those of Siberian and Tunguz shamans that it is convenient (as has indeed been done by Far Eastern and European writers) to use shaman as a translation of ''wu''. In contrast, Schiffeler (1976:20) describes the "untranslatableness" of ''wu'', and prefers using the romanization "''wu'' instead of its contemporary English counterparts, "witches," "warlocks," or "shamans"," which have misleading connotations. Taking ''wu'' to mean "female shaman", [[Edward H. Schafer]] translates it as (1951:153) "shamaness" and (1980:11) "shamanka". The transliteration-translation "''wu'' shaman" or "''wu''-shaman" (Unschuld 1985:344) implies "Chinese" specifically and "shamanism" generally. ''Wu'', concludes Falkenhausen (1995:280), "may be rendered as "shaman" or, perhaps, less controversially as "spirit medium"." Paper (1995:85) criticizes "the majority of scholars" who use one word ''shaman'' to translate many Chinese terms (''wu'' 巫, ''xi'' 覡, ''yi'' 毉, ''xian'' 仙, and ''zhu'' 祝), and writes, "The general tendency to refer to all ecstatic religious functionaries as shamans blurs functional differences."

===Pronunciations===
The [[Modern Standard Chinese]] pronunciation of 巫 is ''wu'', which [[historical Chinese phonology|phonologically]] descends from (ca. 6th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] and (ca. 6th century BCE) [[Old Chinese]]. Compare these Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions of ''wu'' 巫: ''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u'' &lt; *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;wo'' ([[Bernhard Karlgren]]), ''mjuo'' &lt; *''{{IPA|mjwaɣ}}'' (Zhou Fagao), *''mjag'' ([[Li Fanggui]]), ''mju'' &lt; *''ma'' (Axel Schuessler), and *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;ag'' ([[Victor H. Mair]]) . Linguists disagree whether ''wu'' had an Old Chinese [[velar]] final ''-g'' or ''-ɣ''. This 巫 is pronounced ''mouh'' in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], ''vu'' in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], ''mu'' in [[Korean language|Korean]], and ''fu'' or ''[[miko]]'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

===Characters===

The contemporary [[Chinese character]] [[Wikt:巫|巫]] for ''wu'' combines the graphic [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] ''gong'' [[Wikt:工|工]] "work" and ''ren'' [[Wikt:人|人]] "person" doubled (cf. ''cong'' [[Wikt:从|从]]). This 巫 character developed from [[Seal script]] characters that depicted dancing shamans, which descend from [[Bronzeware script]] and [[Oracle bone script]] characters that resembled a [[cross potent]].

The first [[Chinese dictionary]] of characters, the (121 CE) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' defines ''wu'' as ''zhu'' [[Wikt:祝|祝]] "sacrifice; prayer master; invoker; priest" (祝也 女能以舞降神者也 象从工 两人舞形, tr. Hopkins 1920:432) and analyzes the Seal graph, "An Invoker. A woman who can serve the Invisible, and by posturing bring down the spirits. Depicts a person with two sleeves posturing."  This Seal graph for ''wu'' is interpreted as showing "the 工 work of two dancing figures set to each other – a shamanistic dance" (Karlgren 1923:363) or "two human figures facing some central object (possibly a pole, or in a tent-like enclosure?)" (Schafer 1951:153).

This dictionary also includes a variant [[Great Seal script]] (called a ''guwen'' "ancient script") that elaborates ''wu'' 巫.  Hopkins (1920:433) analyzes this ''guwen'' graph as ''gong'' 廾 "two hands held upward" at the bottom (like ''shi'' 筮's Seal graph) and two "mouths" with the "sleeves" on the sides; or (1920:424) "jade" because the ''Shuowen'' defines ''ling'' 靈 "spiritual; divine" as synonymous with ''wu'' and depicting (巫以玉事神, tr. Hopkins 1920:424), "an inspired shaman serving the Spirits with jade."

Schafer (1951:154) compares the Shang Dynasty oracle graphs for ''wu'' and ''nong'' [[Wikt:弄|弄]] "play with; cause" (written with 玉 "jade" over 廾 "two hands") that shows "hands (of a shaman?) elevating a piece of jade (the rain-compelling mineral) inside an enclosure, possibly a tent. The Seal and modern form 巫 may well derive from this original, the hands becoming two figures, a convergence towards the dancer-type graph."

Tu Baikui 塗白奎 (quoted by Boileau 2002:354) believes the ''wu'' oracle character "was composed of two pieces of jade and originally designated a tool of divination." Citing Li Xiaoding 李孝定 that ''gong'' 工 originally pictured a "carpenter's square", Allan (1991:77) argues that oracle inscriptions used ''wu'' 巫 interchangeably with ''fang'' [[Wikt:方|方]] "square; side; place" for sacrifices to the ''sifang'' 四方 "four directions".

This 巫 component is semantically significant in several characters:
*''wu'' [[Wikt:誣|誣]] (with the "speech radical" 言) "deceive; slander; falsely accuse"
*''shi'' [[Wikt:筮|筮]] (with the "bamboo radical" 竹) "[[Achillea millefolium]] (used for divination)"
*''xi'' [[Wikt:覡|覡]] (with the "vision radical" 見) "male shaman; male sorcerer"
*''ling'' [[Wikt:靈|靈]] (with the "cloud radical" 雨 and three 口 "mouths" or "raindrops") "spirit; divine; clever"
*''yi'' [[Wikt:毉|毉]] "doctor", which is an old "shaman" [[Variant Chinese character|variant character]] for ''yi'' [[Wikt:醫|醫]] (with the "wine radical" 酉)

===Meanings===
The comprehensive ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'' dictionary (1989 1:412) lists five meanings of ''wu'' 巫, translatable as:
#"[[Mediumship|spirit medium]]; [[shaman]]; [[Witchcraft|witch]]; [[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]]"
#"[[witch doctor]]; [[medicine man]]"
#"mountain name"
#"[[Toponym|place name]]"
#"[[Wu (surname)|surname]]"
The former two "shaman" and "doctor" ''wu'' meanings are discussed below in detail. The latter three "[[proper name]]" meanings of apply to mountains, places, and people. ''[[Wushan County, Chongqing|Wushan]]'' [[Wikt:|巫山]] "Wu Mountain" is located near [[Chongqing]] in [[Sichuan]] Province. In Chinese, it is known through the [[Chengyu|four-character idiom]] ''Wushanyunyu'' 巫山雲雨 (with "clouds and rain") "lovers' rendezvous; coitus" (for example, see ''[[Rain Clouds over Wushan]]''). In English, Wu Mountain is known as the archeological site where [[Wushan Man]] "taxon of ''[[Homo erectus]]''" was discovered. Two nearby place names are ''[[Wuxi County|Wuxi]]'' 巫溪 (Wu Stream) and ''[[Wu Gorge]]'' (Wuxia 巫峽), which is in the [[Yangtze River]]'s [[Three Gorges]] region. The [[Chinese surname]] ''Wu'' goes back to the Shang Dynasty (for example, legendary [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸), but is comparatively uncommon today (but does appear, for example, in the name of recording artist Wu Qixian 巫啟賢 "[[Eric Moo]]"). Wuma 巫馬 (lit. "shaman horse") is both a [[Chinese compound surname]] (for example, the Confucian disciple [[Disciples of Confucius#Wuma Shi|Wuma Shi/Qi]] 巫馬施/期) and a name for "horse shaman; equine veterinarian" (for example, the ''Zhouli'' official).

===Etymologies===
[[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] hypothetically connect the [[etymology]] of Chinese ''wu'' "spirit medium; shaman" not only with [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] languages, but also with [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] language groups.

[[Berthold Laufer]] (1917:370) proposed a relation between [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] ''bügä'' "shaman", [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''bögü'' "shaman", "Chinese ''bu'', ''wu'' (shaman), ''buk'', ''puk'' (to divine), and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''aba'' (pronounced ''ba'', sorcerer)".

Coblin (1986:107) puts forward a Sino-Tibetan root **''{{IPA|mjaɣ}}'' "magician; sorcerer" for Chinese ''wu'' &lt; ''mju'' &lt; *''mjag'' 巫 "magician; shaman" and [[Tibetan script|Written Tibetan]]'' 'ba'-po'' "sorcerer" and'' 'ba'-mo'' "sorcereress" (of the [[Bön]] religion).

Schuessler (2007:516) notes Chinese ''xian'' &lt; ''sjän'' &lt; *''sen'' [[仙]] "transcendent; immortal; alchemist" was probably borrowed as Written Tibetan ''gšen'' "shaman" and [[Thai language|Thai]] {{IPA-th|mɔɔ|}} &lt; Proto-Tai *''{{IPA|hmɔ}}'' "doctor; sorcerer". In addition, the [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] and Proto-Western-Austronesian  *''{{IPA|səmaŋ}}'' "shaman" may also be connected with ''wu''. Schuessler lists four proposed etymologies.

First, ''wu'' could be the same word as ''wu'' 誣 "to deceive" (Karlgren 1923:363). Schuessler notes a Written Tibetan semantic parallel between "magical power" and "deceive": ''sprul-ba'' "to juggle, make phantoms; miraculous power" cognate with {{IPA-bo|pʰrul|}} "magical deception".

[[File:Tomb brick g.JPG|thumb|Han Dynasty tomb-tile showing "long-sleeved dancers" and attendants.]]
Second, ''wu'' could be cognate with ''wu'' [[Wikt:舞|舞]] "to dance". Based on analysis of ancient characters, Hopkins (1920, 1945) proposed that ''wu'' 巫 "shaman", ''wu'' [[Wikt:無|無]] "not have; without", and ''wu'' 舞 "dance", "can all be traced back to one primitive figure of a man displaying by the gestures of his arms and legs the [[thaumaturgic]] powers of his inspired personality" (1945:5). Many Western Han Dynasty tombs contained jade plaques or pottery images showing "long-sleeved dancers" performing at funerals, who Erickson (1994:52-54) identifies as shamans, citing the ''Shuowen jiezi'' that early ''wu'' characters depicted a dancer's sleeves.

Third, ''wu'' could also be cognate with ''mu'' 母 "mother" since ''wu'', as opposed to ''xi'' 覡, were typically female. [[Edward H. Schafer|Edward Schafer]] associates ''wu'' shamanism with fertility rituals.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Linguistic facts reveal the intimate relationships between the word ''wu'' (*''myu'') "shamanka" and such words as "mother", "dance", "fertility", "egg", and "receptacle". The ancient shamanka, then, was closely related to the fecund mother, to the fertile soil, to the receptive earth. The textual evidence supports these philological associations. In Shang and Chou times, shamankas were regularly employed in the interests of human and natural fertility, above all in bringing rain to parched farmlands – a responsibility they shared with ancient kings. They were musicians and dancers and oracles. (1973:10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Jensen (1995:421) cites the Japanese sinologist Shirakawa Shizuka 白川静's hypothesis that the mother of [[Confucius]] was a ''wu''.

[[Image:Cross-Potent-Heraldry.svg|thumb|Cross potent]]
Fourth, ''wu'' could be a loanword from [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] *''maguš'' "magi; magician" (cf. [[Old Persian]] ''maguš'', [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''mogu''), meaning an "able one; specialist in ritual". Mair (1990) provides archaeological and linguistic evidence that Chinese ''wu'' &lt; *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;ag'' 巫 "shaman; witch, wizard; magician" was a [[loanword]] from [[Old Persian]] *''maguš'' "magician; [[magi]]".

Mair connects the nearly identical Chinese Bronze script for ''wu'' 巫 (above) and Western [[heraldic]] [[cross potent]] '''☩''', an ancient symbol of a ''magi'' or ''magician'', for which both words were ultimately borrowed from the same Iranian word.&lt;ref&gt;Victor H. Mair, “The Earliest Identifiable Written Chinese Character”, ''Archaeology and Language: Indo-European Studies Presented to James P. Mallory'', eds. Martin E. Huld, Karlene Jones-Bley &amp; Dean Miller (Washington, D.C.: Institute for the Study of Man, 2012), 265–279.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early records of ''wu''==
The oldest written records of ''wu'' are Shang Dynasty oracle inscriptions and Zhou Dynasty classical texts. Boileau notes the disparity of these sources.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning the historical origin of the ''wu'', we may ask: were they a remnant of an earlier stage of the development of archaic Chinese civilization? The present state of the documentation does not allow such a conclusion for two reasons: first, the most abundant data about the ''wu'' are to be found in Eastern Zhou texts; and, second, these texts have little in common with the data originating directly from the Shang civilization; possible ancestors of the Eastern Zhou ''wu'' are the cripples and the females burned in sacrifice to bring about rain. They are mentioned in the oracular inscriptions but there is no mention of the Shang character ''wu''. Moreover, because of the scarcity of information, many of the activities of the Zhou ''wu'' cannot be traced back to the Shang period. Consequently, trying to correlate Zhou data with Neolithic cultures appears very difficult. (2002:376) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Wu'' in Shang oracular inscriptions===
Shima's (1971:418) concordance of oracle inscriptions lists 58 occurrences of the character ''wu'': 32 in repeated compounds (most commonly 巫帝 "''wu'' spirit/sacrifice" and 氐巫 "bring the ''wu'') and 26 in miscellaneous contexts. Boileau (2002:354-5) differentiates four meanings of these oracular ''wu'':
#"a spirit, ''wu'' of the north or east, to which sacrifices are offered"
#"a sacrifice, possibly linked to controlling the wind or meteorology"
#"an equivalent for ''shi'' 筮, a form of divination using achilea"
#"a living human being, possibly the name of a person, tribe, place, or territory"
The inscriptions about this living ''wu'', which is later identified as "shaman", reveal six characteristics:&lt;blockquote&gt;
#whether the ''wu'' is a man or a woman is not known;
#it could be either the name for a function or the name of a people (or an individual) coming from a definite territory or nation;
#the wu seems to have been in charge of some divinations, (in one instance, divination is linked to a sacrifice of appeasement);
#the wu is seen as offering a sacrifice of appeasement but the inscription and the fact that this kind of sacrifice was offered by other persons (the king included) suggests that the ''wu'' was not the person of choice to conduct all the sacrifices of appeasement;
#there is only one inscription where a direct link between the king and the ''wu'' appears. Nevertheless, the nature of the link is not known, because the status of the ''wu'' does not appear clearly;
#he follows (being brought, presumably, to Shang territory or court) the orders of other people; he is perhaps offered to the Shang as a tribute. (Boileau 2002:355) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based on this ancient but limited Shang-era oracular record, it is unclear how or whether the ''Wu'' spirit, sacrifice, person, and place were related.

===''Wu'' in Zhou received texts===
Chinese ''wu'' 巫 "shaman" occurs over 300 times in the [[Chinese classics]], which generally date from the late Zhou and early Han periods (6th-1st centuries BCE). The following examples are categorized by the common specializations of ''wu''-shamans:
&lt;blockquote&gt;men and women possessed by spirits or gods, and consequently acting as seers and soothsayers, exorcists and physicians; invokers or conjurers bringing down gods at sacrifices, and performing other sacerdotal functions, occasionally indulging also in imprecation, and in sorcery with the help of spirits. (De Groot 1910 6:1212) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A single text can describe many roles for ''wu''-shamans. For instance, the ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'' idealizes their origins in a [[Golden Age]]. It contains a story about [[King Zhao of Chu|King Zhao]] of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] (r. 515-489 BCE) reading in the ''Shujing'' that the sage ruler [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] "commissioned Chong and Li to cut the communication between heaven and earth". He asks his minister to explain and is told.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Anciently, men and spirits did not intermingle. At that time there were certain persons who were so perspicacious, single-minded, and reverential that their understanding enabled them to make meaningful collation of what lies above and below, and their insight to illumine what is distant and profound. Therefore the spirits would descend upon them. The possessors of such powers were, if men, called ''xi'' (shamans), and, if women, ''wu'' (shamanesses). It is they who supervised the positions of the spirits at the ceremonies, sacrificed to them, and otherwise handled religious matters. As a consequence, the spheres of the divine and the profane were kept distinct. The spirits sent down blessings on the people, and accepted from them their offerings. There were no natural calamities.
:In the degenerate time of &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Shaohao]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (traditionally put at the twenty-sixth century B.C.), however, the Nine Li threw virtue into disorder. Men and spirits became intermingled, with each household indiscriminately performing for itself the religious observances which had hitherto been conducted by the shamans. As a consequence, men lost their reverence for the spirits, the spirits violated the rules of men, and natural calamities arose. Hence the successor of [Shaohao], &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Zhuanxu]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;..., charged &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Chong&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Governor of the South, to handle the affairs of heaven in order to determine the proper place of the spirits, and Li, Governor of Fire, to handle the affairs of Earth, in order to determine the proper place of men. And such is what is meant by cutting the communication between Heaven and Earth. (tr. Bodde 1961:390-391) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as healers====
The belief that [[demonic possession]] caused disease and sickness is well documented in many cultures, including ancient China. The early practitioners of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|Chinese medicine]] historically changed from ''wu'' 巫 "spirit-mediums; shamans" who used divination, exorcism, and prayer to ''yi'' 毉 or 醫 "doctors; physicians" who used herbal medicine, [[moxibustion]], and [[acupuncture]].

As mentioned above, ''wu'' 巫 "shaman" was depicted in the ancient 毉 variant character for ''yi'' 醫 "healer; doctor". This archaic ''yi'' 毉, writes Carr (1992:117), "ideographically depicted a shaman-doctor in the act of exorcistical healing with (矢 'arrows' in) a 医 'quiver', a 殳 'hand holding a lance', and a ''wu'' 巫 'shaman'." Unschuld believes this 毉 character depicts the type of ''wu'' practitioner described in the ''Liji''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several times a year, and also during certain special occasions, such as the funeral of a prince, hordes of exorcists would race shrieking through the city streets, enter the courtyards and homes, thrusting their spears into the air, in an attempt to expel the evil creatures. Prisoners were dismembered outside all gates to the city, to serve both as a deterrent to the demons and as an indication of their fate should they be captured. (1985:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Replacing the exorcistical 巫 "shaman" in 毉 with medicinal 酒 "wine" in ''yi'' 醫 "healer; doctor" signified, writes Schiffeler (1976:27), "the practice of medicine was not any longer confined to the incantations of the ''wu'', but that it had been taken over (from an official standpoint) by the "priest-physicians," who administered elixirs or wines as treatments for their patients."
[[File:iching-hexagram-32.svg|thumb|Hexagram 32, ''Heng'' 恆]]
''Wu'' and ''yi'' are compounded in the word ''wuyi'' 巫醫 "shaman-doctor; shamans and doctors", translated "exorcising physician" (De Groot 1910), "sorcerer-physician" (Schiffeler 1976), or "physician-shaman" (Mainfort 2004). Confucius quotes a "Southern Saying" that a good ''wuyi'' must have ''heng'' [[Wikt:恆|恆]] "constancy; ancient tradition; continuation; perseverance; regularity; proper name (e.g., ''Yijing'' [[I Ching hexagram 32#Hexagram 32|Hexagram 32]])". The (ca. 5th century BCE) ''[[Lunyu]]'' "Confucian Analects" and the (ca. 1st century BCE) ''[[Liji]]'' "Record of Rites" give different versions of the Southern Saying.

First, the ''Lunyu'' quotes Confucius to mention the saying and refer to the Heng Hexagram:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master said, The men of the south have a saying, Without stability a man will not even make a good shaman or witch-doctor. Well said! Of the maxim; if you do not stabilize an act of ''te'' 德, you will get evil by it (instead of good), the Master said, They (i.e. soothsayers) do not simply read the omens. (13/22, tr. Waley 1938:77) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Confucius refers to a ''Yijing'' line interpretation of the Heng "Duration" Hexagram (tr. Wilhelm 1967:127-9): "Nine in the third place means: He who does not give duration to his character meets with disgrace." In Waley's earlier article about the ''Yijing'', he translated "If you do not stabilize your "virtue," Disgrace will overtake you", and quoted the ''Lunyu''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The people of the south have a saying, 'It takes ''heng'' to make even a soothsayer or medicine-man.' It's quite true. 'If you do not stabilize your virtue, disgrace will overtake you'." Confucius adds 不占而已矣, which has completely baffled his interpreters. Surely the meaning is 'It is not enough merely to get an omen,' one must also ''heng'' 'stabilize it'. And if such a rule applies even to inferior arts like those of the diviner and medicine-man, Confucius asks, how much the more does it apply to the seeker after [''de''] in the moral sense? Surely he too must 'make constant' his initial striving! (1933:136-137)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, the ''Liji'' quotes Confucius to elaborate upon the Southern Saying.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master said, 'The people of the south have a saying that "A man without constancy cannot be a diviner either with the tortoise-shell or the stalks." This was probably a saying handed down from antiquity. If such a man cannot know the tortoise-shell and stalks, how much less can he know other men? It is said in the ''Book of Poetry'' (II, v, ode 1, 3) "Our tortoise-shells are wearied out, And will not tell us anything about the plans." The Charge to [Yue] says ([''Shujing''], IV, VIII, sect. 2, 5, 11), "Dignities should not be conferred on men of evil practices. (If they be), how can the people set themselves to correct their ways? If this be sought merely by sacrifices, it will be disrespectful (to the spirits). When affairs come to be troublesome, there ensues disorder; when the spirits are served so, difficulties ensue." 'It is said in the [''Yijing''], "When one does not continuously maintain his virtue, some will impute it to him as a disgrace; (in the position indicated in the Hexagram.) 'When one does maintain his virtue continuously (in the other position indicated), this will be fortunate in a wife, but in a husband evil'." (55, tr. Legge 1885 2:363-364) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This ''Liji'' version makes five changes from the ''Lunyu'' (Carr 1992:121-122). (1) It writes ''bushi'' 卜筮 "diviner" instead of ''wuyi'' 巫醫 "shaman-doctor", compounding ''bu'' "divine by bone or shell, [[scapulimancy]] or [[plastromancy]]" and ''shi'' (also with "shaman") "divine by milfoil stalks, [[cleromancy]] or sortilege". (2) Instead of quoting Confucius to remark "well said!"; he describes the southern proverb as "probably a saying handed down from antiquity" and rhetorically questions the efficacy of divination. (3) The ''Liji'' correctly quotes the ''Shijing'' (195, tr. Karlgren 1950:142) criticizing royal diviners: "Our tortoises are (satiated =) weary, they do not tell us the (proper) plans." (4) It quotes the "Charge to Yue" 說命 (traditionally attributed to Shang king [[Wu Ding]]) differently from the fabricated ''Guwen'' "[[Old Texts]]" ''[[Shujing]]'' "Classic of History" chapter with this name.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dignities may not be conferred on man of evil practices, but only on men of worth. Anxious thought about what will be good should precede your movements. Your movements also should have respect to the time for them. … Officiousness in sacrifices is called irreverence; ceremonies when burdensome lead to disorder. To serve the spirits in this way is difficult. (17, tr. Legge 1865:256-8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(5) It cites an additional ''Yijing'' Hexagram 32 line (tr. Wilhelm 1967:129) that gender determines the auspiciousness of ''heng''. "Six in the fifth place means: Giving duration to one's character through perseverance. This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man."

The mytho-geography ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' "Classic of Mountains and Seas" associates ''wu''-shamans with medicinal herbs.
&lt;blockquote&gt;East of the Openbright there are Shaman Robust, Shaman Pushaway, Shaman Sunny, Shaman Shoe, Shaman Every, and Shaman Aide. They are all on each side of the corpse of Notch Flaw and they hold the neverdie drug to ward off decay. (tr. Birrell 2000:141) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is Mount Divinepower. This is where Shaman Whole, Shaman Reach, Shaman Share, Shaman Robust, Shaman Motherinlaw, Shaman Real, Shaman Rite, Shaman Pushaway, ShamanTakeleave, and Shaman Birdnet ascend to the sky and come down from Mount Divinepower. This is where the hundred drugs are to be found. (tr. Birrell 2000:174) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Shaman Whole" translates [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸 below.

Boileau contrasts Siberian and Chinese shamanic medicines.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning healing, a comparison of the ''wu'' and the Siberian shaman shows a big difference: in Siberia, the shaman is also in charge of cures and healing, but he does this by identifying the spirit responsible for the disease and negotiates the proper way to appease him (or her), for example by offering a sacrifice or food on a regular basis. In archaic China, this role is performed through sacrifice: exorcism by the ''wu'' does not seem to result in a sacrifice but is aimed purely and simply at expelling the evil spirit. (2002:361) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as rainmakers====
''Wu'' anciently served as intermediaries with [[nature spirit]]s believed to control rainfall and flooding. During a [[drought]], ''wu''-shamans would perform the ''yu'' [[Wikt:雩|雩]] "sacrificial [[rain dance]] ceremony". If that failed, both ''wu'' and ''wang'' [[Wikt:尪|尪]] "cripple; lame person; emaciated person" engaged in "ritual exposure" (Schafer 1951) [[rainmaking]] techniques based upon [[homeopathic]] or [[sympathetic magic]]. As Unschuld (1985:33-34) explains, "Shamans had to carry out an exhausting dance within a ring of fire until, sweating profusely, the falling drops of perspirations produced the desired rain." These ''wu'' and ''wang'' procedures were called ''pu'' [[Wikt:曝|曝]]/[[Wikt:暴|暴]] "expose to open air/sun", ''fen'' [[Wikt:焚|焚]] "burn; set on fire", and ''pulu'' [[Wikt:暴露|暴露]] "reveal; lay bare; expose to open air/sun".

For the year 639 BCE, the ''Chunqiu'' records, "In summer, there was a great drought" in [[State of Lu|Lu]], and the ''Zuozhuan'' notes a discussion about ''fen wu wang'' 焚巫尪:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The duke (Xi) wanted to burn a ''wu'' and a cripple at the stake. [[Zang Wenzhong]] 臧文仲 said: this is no preparation for the drought. Repair the city walls, limit your food, be economic in your consumption, be parsimonious and advise (people) to share (the food), this is what must be done. What use would be ''wu'' and cripple? If Heaven wanted to have them killed, why were they born at all? If they (the cripple and the ''wu'') could produce drought, burning them would augment very much (the disaster). (tr. Boileau 2002:363, cf. Legge 1872:180) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The duke followed this advice, and subsequently "scarcity was not very great".

The ''Liji'' uses the words ''puwang'' 暴尪 and ''puwu'' 暴巫 to describe a similar rainmaking ritual during the reign (407-375 BCE) of Duke Mu 穆公 of Lu.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a drought during the year. Duke Mu called on Xianzi and asked him about the reason for this. He said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time. I want to expose to the sun a cripple and what about that?' (Xianzi) said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time but to expose to the sun the crippled son of somebody, that would be cruel. No, this cannot be allowed.' (the duke said): 'Well, then I want to expose to the sun a ''wu'' and what about that?' (Xianzi) answered: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time but to put one's hope on an ignorant woman and offer her to pray (for rain), no, this is too far (from reason).' (tr. Boileau 2002:364, cf. Legge 1885 1:201) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Commentators interpret the ''wu'' as a female shaman and the ''wang'' as a male cripple.

De Groot connects the ''Zuozhuan'' and ''Liji'' stories about ritually burning ''wu''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;These two narratives evidently are different readings of one, and may both be inventions; nevertheless they have their value as sketches of ancient idea and custom. Those 'infirm or unsound' ''wang'' were non-descript individuals, evidently placed somewhat on a line with the ''wu''; perhaps they were queer hags or beldams, deformed beings, idiotic or crazy, or nervously affected to a very high degree, whose strange demeanour was ascribed to possession. (1910 6:1194) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as oneiromancers====
[[Oneiromancy]] or [[dream interpretation]] was one type of divination performed by ''wu'' 巫. The ''Zuozhuan'' records two stories about ''wu'' interpreting the guilty dreams of murderers.

First, in 581 BCE the lord of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], who had slain two officers from the [[Zhao (surname)|Zhao]] (趙) family, had a nightmare about their ancestral spirit, and called upon an unnamed ''wu'' "shaman" from Sangtian 桑田 and a ''yi'' "doctor" named Huan 緩 from [[Qin (state)|Qin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;The marquis of [Jin] saw in a dream a great demon with disheveled hair reaching to the ground, which beat its breast, and leaped up, saying: "You have slain my descendants unrighteously, and I have presented my request to the High God in consequence." It then broke the great gate (of the palace), advanced to the gate of the State chamber, and entered. The duke was afraid and went into a side-chamber, the door of which it also broke. The duke then awoke, and called the witch of [Sangtian], who told him everything which he had dreamt. "What will be the issue?" asked the duke. "You will not taste the new wheat," she replied. &lt;br&gt;
After this, the duke became very ill, and asked the services of a physician from [Qin], the earl of which sent the physician [Huan] to do what he could for him. Before he came, the duke dreamt that his disease turned into two boys, who said, "That is a skilful physician; it is to be feared he will hurt us; how shall we get out of his way?" Then one of them said: "If we take our place above the heart and below the throat, what can he do to us?" When the physician arrived, he said, "Nothing can be done for this disease. Its seat is above the heart and below the throat. If I assail it (with medicine), it will be of no use; if I attempt to puncture it, it cannot be reached. Nothing can be done for it." The duke said, "He is a skilful physician", gave him large gifts, and send him back to [Qin].&lt;br&gt;
In the sixth month, on the day [bingwu], the marquis wished to taste the new wheat, and made the superintendent of his fields present some. While the baker was getting it ready, [the marquis] called the witch of [Sangtian], showed her the wheat and put her to death. As the marquis was about to taste the wheat, he felt it necessary to go to the privy, into which he fell, and so died. One of the servants that waited on him had dreamt in the morning that he carried the marquis on his back up to heaven. The same at mid-day carried him on his back out from the privy, and was afterwards buried alive with him. (tr. Legge 1872:374, note "witch" translates ''wu'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Commentators have attempted to explain why the ''wu'' merely interpreted the duke's dream but did not perform a healing ritual or exorcism, and why the duke waited until the prediction had failed before ordering the execution. Boileau (2002:368) suggests the ''wu'' was executed in presumed responsibility for the Zhao ancestral spirit's attack.

Second, in 552 BCE a ''wu'' named Gao 皋 both appears in and divines about a dream of Zhongxing Xianzi. After conspiring in the murder of Duke Li of Jin, Zhongxing dreams that the duke's spirit gets revenge.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In autumn, the marquis of [Jin] invaded our northern border. [Zhongxing Xianzi] prepared to invade [Qi]. (Just then), he dreamt that he was maintaining a suit with duke [Li], in which the case was going against him, when the duke struck him with a [''[[Dagger-axe|ge]]''] on his head, which fell down before him. He took his head up, put it on his shoulders, and ran off, when he saw the wizard [Gao] of [Gengyang]. A day or two after, it happened that he did see this [Gao] on the road, and told him his dream, and the wizard, who had had the same dream, said to him: "Your death is to happen about this time; but if you have business in the east, you will there be successful [first]". Xianzi accepted this interpretation. (tr. Legge 1872:478, note "wizard" translates ''wu'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Boileau questions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;why wasn't the ''wu'' asked by Zhongxin to expel the spirit of the duke? Perhaps because the spirit went through him to curse the officer. Could it be that the ''wu'' was involved (his involvement is extremely strong in this affair) in a kind of deal, or is it simply that the ''wu'' was aware of two different matters concerning the officer, only one connected to the dream? (2002:369) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to these two stories, ''wu'' were feared and considered dangerous. This attitude is also evident in a ''Zhuangzi'' story about the ''shenwu'' 神巫 "[[Shen (Chinese religion)|spirit/god]] shaman" Jixian 季咸 from [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;In [Zheng], there was a shaman of the gods named [Jixian]. He could tell whether men would live or die, survive or perish, be fortunate or unfortunate, live a long time or die young, and he would predict the year, month, week, and day as though he were a god himself. When the people of [Zheng] saw him, they all ran out of his way. (tr. Watson 1968:95) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
"As soothsayers." writes de Groot (1910 6:1195), "the ''wu'' in ancient China no doubt held a place of great importance."

====Wu-shamans as officials====
Sinological controversies have arisen over the political importance of ''wu'' 巫 in ancient China. Some scholars (e.g., Eliade 1964 and Chang 1983) believe Chinese ''wu'' used "techniques of ecstasy" like shamans elsewhere; others (e.g., Keightley 1983) believe ''wu'' were "ritual bureaucrats" or "moral metaphysicians" who did not engage in shamanistic practices.

[[Chen Mengjia]] wrote a seminal article (1936) that proposed Shang kings were ''wu''-shamans.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the oracle bone inscriptions are often encountered inscriptions stating that the king divined or that the king inquired in connections with wind- or rain-storms, rituals, conquests, or hunts. There are also statements that "the king made the prognostication that …," pertaining to weather, the border regions, or misfortunes and diseases; the only prognosticator ever recorded in the oracle bone inscriptions was the king ... There are, in addition, inscriptions describing the king dancing to pray for rain and the king prognosticating about a dream. All of these were activities of both king and shaman, which means in effect that the king was a shaman. (1936:535, tr. Chang 1983:46-47) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Chen's shaman-king hypothesis was supported by [[Kwang-chih Chang]] who cited the ''Guoyu'' story about Shao Hao severing heaven-earth communication (above).
&lt;blockquote&gt;This myth is the most important textual reference to shamanism in ancient China, and it provides the crucial clue to understanding the central role of shamanism in ancient Chinese politics. Heaven is where all the wisdom of human affairs lies. … Access to that wisdom was, of course, requisite for political authority. In the past, ''everybody'' had had that access through the shamans. Since heaven had been severed from earth, only those who controlled that access had the wisdom – hence the authority – to rule. Shamans, therefore, were a crucial part of every state court; in fact, scholars of ancient China agree that the king himself was actually head shaman. (1983:45) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some modern scholars disagree. For instance, Boileau (2002:350) calls Chen's hypothesis "somewhat antiquated being based more on an a priori approach than on history" and says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the case of the relationship between ''wu'' and ''wang'' [king], Chen Mengjia did not pay sufficient attention to what the king was able to do as a king, that is to say, to the parts of the king's activities in which the ''wu'' was not involved, for example, political leadership as such, or warfare. The process of recognition must also be taken into account: it is probable that the ''wu'' was chosen or acknowledged as such according to different criteria to those adopted for the king. Chen's concept of the king as the head ''wu'' was influenced by [[James George Frazer|Frazer]]'s theories about the origin of political power: for Frazer the king was originally a powerful sorcerer. (2002:351) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Shujing'' "Classic of History" lists [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸 and Wu Xian 巫賢 as capable administrators of the Shang royal household. The [[Duke of Zhou]] tells Prince [[Shao]] 召 that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have heard that of ancient time, when [[Tang of Shang|King Tang]] had received the favoring decree, he had with him [[Yi Yin]], making his virtue like that of great Heaven. [[Tai Jia]], again, had Bao Heng. [[Tai Wu]] had Yi Zhi and Chen Hu, through whom his virtue was made to affect God; he had also [巫咸] Wu Xian, who regulated the royal house; [[Zu Yi]] had [巫賢] Wu Xian. [[Wu Ding]] had Gan Pan. These ministers carried out their principles and effected their arrangements, preserving and regulating the empire of [Shang], so that, while its ceremonies lasted, those sovereigns, though deceased, were assessors to Heaven, while it extended over many years. (tr. Legge 1865:206, n.b., names standardized to pinyin) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Boileau,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In some texts, Wu Xian senior is described as being in charge of the divination using  [''shi'' 筮] achilea. He was apparently made a high god in the kingdom of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] 秦 during the Warring States period. The Tang subcommentary interprets the character ''wu'' of Wu Xian father and son as being a [[cognomen]], the name of the clan from which the two Xian came. It is possible that in fact the text referred to two Shang ministers, father and son, coming from the same eponymous territory ''wu''. Perhaps, later, the name (''wu'' 巫) of these two ministers has been confused with the character ''wu'' (巫) as employed in other received texts. (2002:358) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Wu''-shamans participated in court scandals and dynastic rivalries under [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141-87 BCE), particularly regarding the crime of ''wugu'' 巫蠱 (with [[Gu (poison)|''gu'']] "venom-based poison") "sorcery; casting harmful spells". In 130 BCE, [[Empress Chen Jiao]] was convicted of using shamans from [[State of Yue|Yue]] to conduct ''wugu'' magic. She "was dismissed from her position and a total of 300 persons who were involved in the case were executed" (tr. Loewe 1970:169), their heads were cut off and exposed on stakes. In 91 BCE, an attempted coup against crown prince [[Liu Ju]] involved accusations of practicing ''wugu'', and subsequently "no less than nine long months of bloody terrorism, ending in a tremendous slaughter, cost some tens of thousands their lives!" (tr. Groot 1910 5:836).

Ever since Emperor Wu of Han established Confucianism as the state religion, the ruling classes have shown increasing prejudice against shamanism (de Groot 1910:1233-42, Waley 1955:11-12). Some modern writers view the traditional Confucianist disdain for female shamans as [[sexism]]. Schafer wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the opinion of the writer, the Chou ruling class was particularly hostile to [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Han dynasty|women in government]], and regarded the ancient fertility rites as impure. This anti-female tendency was even more marked in the state of Lu, where Confucius approved of the official rain-ceremony in which men alone participated. There was, within ancient China, a heterogeneity of culture areas, with female shamans favored in some, males in others. The "licentiousness" of the ceremonies of such a state as Cheng (doubtless preserving the ancient Shang traditions and customs) was a byword among Confucian moralists. Confucius' state seems on the other hand to have taken the "respectable" attitude that the sexes should not mingle in the dance, and that men were the legitimate performers of the fertility rites. The general practice of the later Chou period, or at least the semi-idealized picture given of the rites of that time in such books as the ''Chou li'', apparently prescribed a division of magical functions between men and women. The former generally play the role of exorcists, the latter of petitioners. This is probably related to the metaphysical belief that women, embodying the principle ''yin'', were akin to the spirits, whereas men, exemplifying the element ''yang'', were naturally hostile to them. (1951:158) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Accepting the tradition that Chinese shamans were women (i.e., ''wu'' 巫 "shamaness" as opposed to ''xi'' 覡 "shaman"), Kagan believes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the main themes in Chinese history is the unsuccessful attempt by the male Confucian orthodoxy to [[Women in ancient and imperial China|strip women of their public and sacred powers]] and to limit them to a role of service ... Confucianists reasserted daily their claim to power and authority through the promotion of the phallic ancestor cult which denied women religious representation and excluded them from the governmental examination system which was the path to office, prestige, and status. (1980:3-4) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition, Unschuld (1980:125-128) refers to a "Confucian medicine" based upon systematic correspondences and the idea that illnesses are caused by excesses (rather than demons).

The ''Zhouli'' provides detailed information about the roles of ''wu''-shamans. It lists (Falkenhausen 1995:282), "Spirit Mediums as officials on the payroll of the Zhou Ministry of Rites (''Liguan'' 禮官, or Ministry of Spring, ''Chun guan'' 春官)." This text differentiates three offices: the Siwu 司巫 "Manager/Director of Shamans", Nanwu 男巫 "Male Shamans", and ''Nüwu'' 女巫 "Female Shamans".

The managerial Siwu, who was of [[Chinese nobility#Fengjian and Zongfa of the Zhou Dynasty|''Shi'']] 士 "Gentleman; Yeoman" feudal rank, yet was not a ''wu'', supervised "the many ''wu''".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Managers of the Spirit Mediums are in charge of the policies and orders issued to the many Spirit Mediums. When the country suffers a great drought, they lead the Spirit Mediums in dancing the rain-making ritual (''yu'' 雩). When the country suffers a great calamity, they lead the Spirit Mediums in enacting the long-standing practices of Spirit Mediums (''wuheng'' 巫恆). At official sacrifices, they [handle] the ancestral tablets in their receptacles, the cloth on which the spirits walk, and the box containing the reeds [for presenting the sacrificial foodstuffs]. In all official sacrificial services, they guard the place where the offerings are buried. In all funerary services, they are in charge of the rituals by which the Spirit Mediums make [the spirits] descend (''jiang'' 降). (tr. von Falkenhausen 1995:285, cf. de Groot 1910 6:1189-1190) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Nanwu and Nüwu have different shamanic specializations, especially regarding inauspicious events like sickness, death, and natural disaster.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Male Spirit Mediums are in charge of the ''si'' 祀 and ''yan'' 衍 Sacrifices to the Deities of the Mountains and Rivers. They receive the honorific titles [of the deities], which they proclaim into the [four] directions, holding reeds. In the winter, in the great temple hall, they offer [or: shoot arrows] without a fixed direction and without counting the number. In the spring, they make proclamations and issue bans so as to remove sickness and disease. When the king offers condolence, they together with the invocators precede him. &lt;br&gt;
The Female Mediums are in charge of anointing and ablutions at the exorcisms that are held at regular times throughout the year. When there is a drought or scorching heat, they dance in the rain-making ritual (''yu''). When the queen offers condolence, they together with the invocators precede her. In all great calamities of the state, they pray, singing and wailing. (26, tr. von Falkenhausen 1995:290, cf. de Groot 1910 6:1189) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Von Falkenhausen concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we are to generalize from the above enumeration, we find that the Spirit Mediums' principal functions are tied up with averting evil and pollution. They are especially active under circumstances of inauspiciousness and distress. In case of droughts and calamities, they directly address the supernatural powers of Heaven and Earth. Moreover, they are experts in dealing with frightful, dangerous ghosts (the ghosts of the defunct at the time of the funeral, the evil spirits at the exorcism, and the spirits of disease) and harmful substances (unburied dead bodies during visits of condolence and all manner of impure things at the lustration festival). (1995:293)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Chu Ci''===
{{Main|Chu Ci}}
The poetry anthology ''Chu Ci'', especially its older pieces, is largely characterized by its shamanic content and style, as explicated to some extent by sinologist [[David Hawkes (Sinologist)|David Hawkes]].(1985[2011]:''passim'') Among other points of interest are the intersection of Shamanic traditions and mythology/folk religion in the earlier textual material, such as ''[[Heavenly Questions|Tianwen]]'' (possibly based on even more ancient shamanic temple murals), the whole question of the interpretation of the 11 verses of the ''[[Jiu Ge]]'' (''Nine Songs'') as the libretto of a shamanic dramatic performance, the motif of shamanic spirit flight from ''[[Li Sao]]'' through subsequent pieces, the evidence of possible regional variations in wu shamanism between [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]], and other states (or shamanic colleges associated with those regions), and the suggestion that some of the newer textual material was modified to please Han Wudi, by [[Liu An]], the Prince of Huainan, or his circle. The [[List of Chu Ci contents|''Chu Ci'' contents]] have traditionally been chronologically divided into an older, pre-[[Han dynasty]] group, and those written during the Han Dynasty. Of the traditionally-considered to be the older works (omitting the mostly prose narratives, "[[Bu Ju]]" and "[[Yu Fu]]") David Hawkes considers the following sections to be "functional, explicitly shamanistic": ''[[Jiu Ge]]'', ''Tian Wen'', and the two shamanic summons for the soul, "[[The Great Summons]]" and "[[Summons of the Soul]]".(1985[2011]:38) Regarding the other, older pieces he considers that "shamanism, if there is any" to be an incidental poetic device, particularly in the form of descriptions of the shamanic spirit journey.

====Background====
The mainstream of Chinese literacy and literature is associated with the [[oracle bone|shell and bone]] oracular inscriptions from recovered archeological artifacts from the [[Shang dynasty]] and with the literary works of the Western [[Zhou dynasty]], which include the classic Confucian works. Both are associated with the northern Chinese areas. South of the traditional Shang and Zhou areas was the land (and water) of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. Politically and to some extent culturally distinct from the Zhou dynasty and its later 6 devolved hegemonic states, Chu was the original source and inspiration for the poems anthologized during the [[Han dynasty]] under the title ''[[Chu Ci]]'', literally meaning something like "the literary material of Chu".(Hawkes:16-17 and 28-29) Despite the tendency of Confucian-oriented  government officials to suppress wu shamanic beliefs and practice, in the general area of Chinese culture, the force of colonial conservatism and the poetic voice of [[Qu Yuan]] and other poets combined to contribute an established literary tradition heavily influenced by wu shamanism to posterity.(Hawkes:19-20) Shamanic practices as described anthropologically are generally paralleled by descriptions of wu practices as found in the ''Chu Ci'', and in Chinese mythology more generally.(Hawkes:42-47)

====''Li Sao'', ''Yuan You'', and ''Jiu Bian''====
{{Main|Li Sao|Yuan You|Jiu Bian}}
The signature poem of the ''Chu Ci'' is the poem ''[[Li Sao]]''. By China's "first poet", [[Qu Yuan]], a major literary device of the poem is the shamanic spirit journey. "[[Yuan You]]", literally "The Far-off Journey" features shamanic spirit flight as a literary device, as does ''[[Jiu Bian]]'', as part of its climactic ending. In the ''Li Sao'', two individual shaman are specified, Ling Fen (靈氛) and Wu Xian (巫咸).(Hawkes:45, note 9) This Wu Xian may or may not be the same as the (one or more) historical person(s) named [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]]. Hawkes suggests an equation of the word ''ling'' in the Chu dialect with the word ''wu''.(46 and 84)

====Questioning Heaven====
{{Main|Heavenly Questions}}
The ''[[Heavenly Questions]]'' (literally "Questioning Heaven") is one of the ancient repositories of Chinese myth and a major cultural legacy. Propounded as a series of questions, the poem provides incite and provokes questions about the role of wu shaman practitioners in society and history.

====''Jiu Ge''====
{{Main|Jiu Ge}}
The ''Jiu Ge'' may be read as the lyrical preservation of a shamanic dramatic performance. Apparently typical of at least one variety of shamanism of the Chu area of the [[Yangzi River]] basin, the text exhibits a marked degree of eroticism in connection with shamanic invocations.

====Summoning the soul====
{{Further|Hun and po}}
Summoning the soul (''hun'') of the possibly dead was a feature of ancient culture. The 2 ''Chu Ci'' pieces of this type may be authentic transcriptions of such a process.

====Individual wu shaman====
{{Main|List of wu shaman}} 
Various individual wu shaman are alluded to in the ''Chu Ci''. In some cases the binomial nomenclature is unclear, referring perhaps to one or two persons; for example, in the case of Peng Xian, who appears likely to represent Wu Peng and Wu Xian,(Hawkes:70 and 84-86) which is a common type of morphological construction in Classical Chinese poetry. David Hawkes refers to some wu shaman as "Shaman Ancestors". Additionally, the distinction between humans and transcendent divinities tends not to be explicit in the received ''Chu Ci'' text. In some cases, the individual wu shaman are known from other sources, such as the ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' (''Classic of Mountains and Seas''). The name of some individual shaman includes "Wu" (巫) in the normal position of the family surname, for example, in the case of Wu Yang (巫陽, "Shaman Bright"). Wu Yang is the major speaker in ''Zhao Hun''/''Summons for the Soul''. He also appears in ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' together with Wu Peng (巫彭): 6 wu shaman are depicted together reviving a corpse, with Wu Peng holding the Herb of Immortality.(Hawkes:45 and 230-231)

==Modern wu==

The ancient Chinese traditions of ''wu''-shamans continue in the contemporary cultures of China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Popular practices include clairvoyance, fortune telling, exorcism, invocation, and prayer.

Scholars have studied many aspects of modern ''wu''. De Groot (1910 6:1243-1268) provided descriptions and pictures of hereditary shamans in [[Fujian]], called ''saigong'' (pinyin ''shigong'') 師公. Paper (1999) analyzed ''tongji'' mediumistic activities in the Taiwanese village of Bao'an 保安. Noll (2004) documented Chuonnasuan (1927–2000), the last shaman of the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] in northeast China.

Jordan Paper summarizes the present-day shaman's religious significance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mediums, frequently associated with local temples … are ubiquitous aspects of popular Chinese religion. They are (or at least were into the mid-twentieth century) common from far north in Manchuria to the extreme south of Hainan and Guangtung, and from the eastern island of Taiwan to Tibet in China's far west. (1995:117-8) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
