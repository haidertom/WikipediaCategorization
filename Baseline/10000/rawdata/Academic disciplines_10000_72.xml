      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1348">'''Acid growth''' refers to the ability of [[plant cell]]s and [[plant cell wall]]s to elongate or expand quickly at low (acidic) [[pH]]. This form of growth does not involve an increase in cell number. During acid growth, plant cells enlarge rapidly because the cell walls are made more extensible by [[expansin]], a pH-dependent wall-loosening protein. Expansin loosens the network-like connections between cellulose [[microfibril]]s within the cell wall, which allows the cell volume to increase by [[turgor pressure|turgor]] and [[osmosis]]. A typical sequence leading up to this would involve the introduction of a [[plant hormone]] ([[auxin]], for example) that causes [[proton]]s (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions) to be [[proton pump|pumped out]] of the cell into the cell wall. As a result, the cell wall solution becomes more [[acid]]ic. This activates expansin activity, causing the wall to become more extensible and to undergo [[wall stress relaxation]], which enables the cell to take up water and to expand.&lt;ref&gt;Rayle, D. L. and R. E. Cleland. 1992.

An '''amoeba''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|iː|b|ə}}; rarely spelled '''''amœba'''''; plural ''am(o)ebas'' or ''am(o)ebae'' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|iː|b|i}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/amoeba "Amoeba"] at Oxforddictionaries.com&lt;/ref&gt; often called '''''amoeboid''''', is a type of [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organism]] which has the ability to alter its shape, primarily by extending and retracting [[pseudopodia|pseudopods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, 3rd Edition, revised|last = Singleton|first = Paul|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-470-03545-0 |location = Chichester, UK|pages = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amoebas do not form a single [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic group]]; instead, they are found in every major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms. Amoeboid cells occur not only among the [[protozoa]], but also in [[fungi]], [[algae]], and [[animals]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=51|title=Amoebae: Protists Which Move and Feed Using Pseudopodia|author=David J.

Microbiologists often use the terms "amoeboid" and "amoeba" interchangeably for any organism that exhibits [[amoeboid movement]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Marée, Athanasius FM, and Paulien Hogeweg. "How amoeboids self-organize into a fruiting body: multicellular coordination in Dictyostelium discoideum." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 98.7 (2001): 3879–3883.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackerras, M. J., and Q. N. Ercole. "Observations on the action of paludrine on malarial parasites." Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 41.3 (1947): 365–376.&lt;/ref&gt;

In older classification systems, most amoebas were placed in the [[Class (biology)|class]] or [[subphylum]] [[Sarcodina]], a grouping of [[Unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; that possess pseudopods or move by [[protoplasm]]ic flow. However, [[molecular phylogenetic]] studies have shown that Sarcodina is not a [[monophyletic]] group whose members share [[common descent]]. Consequently, amoeboid organisms are no longer classified together in one group.&lt;ref name="Pawlowski"&gt;Jan Pawlowski: ''The twilight of Sarcodina: a molecular perspective on the polyphyletic origin of amoeboid protists''. Protistology, Band 5, 2008, S. 281–302. [http://protistology.ifmo.ru/num5_4/pawlowski.pdf (pdf, 570 kB)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known amoeboid [[protists]] are the "giant amoebae" ''[[Chaos carolinense]]'' and ''[[Amoeba proteus]]'', both of which have been widely cultivated and studied in classrooms and laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan et al.|first=|date=2005|title=A  simple  mass  culture  of  the  amoeba Chaos carolinense: revisit|url=http://protistology.ifmo.ru/num4_2/tan.pdf|journal=Protistology|volume=4|pages=185–90|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://davidwangblog.wordpress.com/relationship-with-humans/|title=Relationship with Humans|date=2013-04-12|work=Amoeba proteus|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other well known species include the so-called "brain-eating amoeba" ''[[Naegleria fowleri]]'', the intestinal parasite ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', which causes [[amoebic dysentery]], and the multicellular "social amoeba" or [[slime mould]] ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]''.

==Shape, movement and nutrition==
[[File:PseudopodiaFormsDavidPatterson.jpg|thumb|250px|The forms of [[pseudopodia]], from left: polypodial and lobose; monopodial and lobose; filose; conical; reticulose; tapering actinopods; non-tapering actinopods]]
Amoebae move and feed by using pseudopods, which are bulges of [[cytoplasm]] formed by the coordinated action of [[actin]] [[microfilaments]] pushing out the [[plasma membrane]] that surrounds the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Molecular Biology of the Cell 5th Edition|last = Alberts  Eds.|publisher = Garland Science|year = 2007|isbn = 9780815341055|location = New York|pages = 1037|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance and internal structure of pseudopods are used to distinguish groups of amoebae from one another. [[Amoebozoan]] species, such as those in the genus [[Amoeba (genus)|Amoeba]], typically have bulbous (lobose) pseudopods, rounded at the ends and roughly tubular in cross-section. [[Cercozoan]] amoeboids, such as ''[[Euglypha]]'' and ''[[Gromia]]'', have slender, thread-like (filose) pseudopods. [[Foraminifera]] emit fine, branching pseudopods that merge with one another to form net-like (reticulose) structures. Some groups, such as the [[Radiolaria]] and [[Heliozoa]], have stiff, needle-like, radiating [[pseudopodia#Morphology|axopodia]] (actinopoda) supported from within by bundles of [[microtubules]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kingdoms and Domains|last = Margulis|first = Lynn|publisher = Academic Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-12-373621-5|location = |pages = 206–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amoeba (PSF).png|thumb|250px|Morphology of a naked lobose amoeba]]
Free-living amoebae may be "[[testate amoebae|testate]]" (enclosed within a hard shell), or "naked" (also known as [[wikispecies:gymnamoebae|gymnamoebae]], lacking any hard covering). The shells of testate amoebae may be composed of various substances, including [[calcium]], [[silica]], [[chitin]], or agglutinations of found materials like small grains of sand and the [[frustules]] of [[diatoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Atlas of Freshwater Testate Amoeba|last = Ogden|first = C. G.|publisher = Oxford University Press, for British Museum (Natural History)|year = 1980|isbn = 978-0198585022|location = Oxford, London, and Glasgow|pages = 1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Difflugia acuminata.jpg|thumb|250px|Shell of the [[Testate amoebae|testate amoeba]] ''Difflugia acuminata''.]]
To regulate [[osmotic pressure]], most freshwater amoebae have a contractile [[vacuole]] which expels excess water from the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Molecular Biology of the Cell 5th Edition|last = Alberts  Eds.|publisher = Garland Science|year = 2007|isbn = 9780815341055|location = New York|pages = 663|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[organelle]] is necessary because freshwater has a lower concentration of [[solutes]] (such as salt) than the amoeba's own internal fluids ([[cytosol]]). Because the surrounding water is [[tonicity|hypotonic]] with respect to the contents of the cell, water is transferred across the amoeba's cell membrane by [[osmosis]].  Without a contractile vacuole, the cell would fill with excess water and, eventually, burst.

Marine amoebae do not usually possess a contractile vacuole because the concentration of solutes within the cell are in balance with the [[tonicity]] of the surrounding water.&lt;ref&gt;Kudo, Richard Roksabro. "Protozoology." Protozoology 4th Edit (1954). p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phagocytosis -- amoeba.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Amoeba phagocytosis of bacteria]]
The food sources of amoebae vary. Some amoebae are predatory and live by consuming bacteria and other [[protist]]s. Some are [[detritivore]]s and eat dead organic material.

Amoebae typically ingest their food by [[phagocytosis]], extending pseudopods to encircle and engulf live prey or particles of scavenged material.  Amoeboid cells do not have a mouth or [[cytostome]], and there is no fixed place on the cell at which phagocytosis normally occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Thorp, James H. (2001). Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates. San Diego: Academic. p. 71. {{ISBN|0-12-690647-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some amoebae also feed by [[pinocytosis]], imbibing dissolved nutrients through [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] formed within the cell membrane .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biology of Amoeba|last = Jeon|first = Kwang W.|publisher = Academic Press|year = 1973|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size range==
[[File:Ammonia tepida.jpg|thumb|[[Foraminifera]] have reticulose (net-like) pseudopods, and many species are visible with naked eye]]

The size of amoeboid cells and species is extremely variable. The marine amoeboid ''[[Massisteria|Massisteria voersi]]'' is just 2.3 to 3 [[micrometre]]s in diameter,&lt;ref name="Mylnikov"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mylnikov|first=Alexander P.|last2=Weber|first2=Felix|last3=Jürgens|first3=Klaus|last4=Wylezich|first4=Claudia|date=2015-08-01|title=Massisteria marina has a sister: Massisteria voersi sp. nov., a rare species isolated from coastal waters of the Baltic Sea|journal=European Journal of Protistology|volume=51|issue=4|pages=299–310|doi=10.1016/j.ejop.2015.05.002|issn=1618-0429|pmid=26163290}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the size range of many bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classes.midlandstech.edu/carterp/courses/bio225/chap04/lecture2.htm|title=The Size, Shape, And Arrangement Of Bacterial Cells|website=classes.midlandstech.edu|access-date=2016-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809135552/http://classes.midlandstech.edu/carterp/courses/bio225/chap04/lecture2.htm|archive-date=9 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the other extreme, the shells of deep-sea [[xenophyophore]]s can attain 20&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gooday|first=A.

==Amoebae as specialized cells and life cycle stages==
[[File:Neutrophil with anthrax copy.jpg|thumb|left|Neutrophil (white blood cell) engulfing anthrax bacteria]]
Some [[multicellular organisms]] have amoeboid cells only in certain phases of life, or use amoeboid movements for specialized functions. In the immune system of humans and other animals, amoeboid [[white blood cells]] pursue invading organisms, such as bacteria and pathogenic protists, and engulf them by [[phagocytosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedl, Peter, Stefan Borgmann, and Eva-B. Bröcker. "Amoeboid leukocyte crawling through extracellular matrix: lessons from the Dictyostelium paradigm of cell movement." Journal of Leukocyte Biology 70.4 (2001): 491–509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amoeboid stages also occur in the multicellular fungus-like protists, the so-called [[slime mold|slime mould]]s. Both the plasmodial slime moulds, currently classified in the class [[Myxogastria]], and the cellular slime moulds of the groups [[Acrasida]] and [[Dictyosteliida]], live as amoebae during their feeding stage. The amoeboid cells of the former combine to form a giant [[multinucleate]] organism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6803/abs/407470a0.html|title = Intelligence: Maze-solving by an amoeboid organism|last = Nakagaki|date = 2000|journal = Nature|accessdate = 14 September 2014|doi = 10.1038/35035159|pmid = 11028990|volume=407|issue=6803|pages=470|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the cells of the latter live separately until food runs out, at which time the amoebae aggregate to form a multicellular migrating "slug" which functions as a single organism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Amoebae as organisms==

===Early history and origins of Sarcodina===
[[File:Der Kleine Proteus from Roesel.jpg|thumb|250x250px|The first illustration of an amoeboid, from Roesel von Rosenhof's ''Insecten-Belustigung'' (1755).]]
The earliest record of an amoeboid organism was produced in 1755 by [[August Johann Rösel von Rosenhof]], who named his discovery "Der Kleine Proteus" ("the Little Proteus").&lt;ref&gt;Rosenhof, R. (1755). ''Monatlich herausgegebene Insektenbelustigungen'', vol. 3, p. 621, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q9JCAQAAMAAJ&amp;hl=&amp;pg=PA621#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; Rösel's illustrations show an unidentifiable freshwater amoeba, similar in appearance to the common species now known as [[Amoeba proteus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biology of Amoeba|last = Jeon|first = Kwang W.|publisher = Academic Press|year = 1973|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 2–3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J0vniMFGPukC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;hl=&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "Proteus animalcule" remained in use throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, as an informal name for any large, free-living amoeboid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biological atlas: a guide to the practical study of plants and animals|last = McAlpine|first = Daniel|publisher = W. &amp; A. K. Johnston|year = 1881|isbn = |location = Edinburgh and London|pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822, the genus ''Amiba'' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀμοιβή ''amoibe'', meaning "change") was erected by the French naturalist [[Bory de Saint-Vincent]].&lt;ref&gt;Bory de Saint-Vincent, J. B. G. M. "Essai d'une classification des animaux microscopiques." Agasse, Paris (1826).p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EOS1"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first = Kimberley |editor1-last = McGrath |editor2-last=Blachford |editor2-first=Stacey | title = Gale Encyclopedia of Science Vol. 1: Aardvark-Catalyst |edition=2nd | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-7876-4370-6 | publisher = Gale Group | oclc = 46337140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bory's contemporary, [[C. G. Ehrenberg]], adopted the genus in his own classification of microscopic creatures, but changed the spelling to ''Amoeba''.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, Christian Gottfried.

Druckerei der Königlichen akademie der wissenschaften, 1832. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, [[Félix Dujardin]] coined the term "''sarcode''" (from Greek σάρξ ''sarx'', "flesh," and εἶδος ''eidos'', "form") for the "thick, glutinous, homogenous substance" which fills protozoan cell bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Histoire Naturelle des Zoophytes Infusoires|last = Dujardin|first = Felix|publisher = Librarie Encyclopedique de Roret|year = 1841|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term originally referred to the protoplasm of any protozoan, it soon came to be used in a restricted sense to designate the gelatinous contents of amoeboid cells.&lt;ref name="Pawlowski"/&gt; Thirty years later, the Austrian zoologist [[Ludwig Karl Schmarda]] used "sarcode" as the conceptual basis for his Division Sarcodea, a [[phylum]]-level group made up of "unstable, changeable" organisms with bodies largely composed of 'sarcode.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Zoologie|last = Schmarda|first = Ludwig Karl|publisher = W. Braumüller|year = 1871|isbn = |location = |pages = 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later workers, including the influential taxonomist [[Otto Bütschli]], emended this group to create the class Sarcodina,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Klassen und Ordnungen des Thier-Reichs I. Abteilung: Sarkodina und Sporozoa|last = Bütschli|first = Otto|publisher = Paleontologische Entwicklung der Rhisopoda von C. Scwager|year = 1882|isbn = |location = |pages = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[taxon]] that remained in wide use throughout most of the 20th century.

Within the traditional Sarcodina, amoebae were generally divided into [[Morphology (biology)|morphological categories]], on the basis of the form and structure of their [[pseudopod]]s.  Amoebae with pseudopods supported by regular arrays of [[microtubule]]s (such as the freshwater [[Heliozoa]] and marine [[Radiolaria]]) were classified as [[species:Actinopoda#Calkins .281909.29|Actinopods]]; whereas those with unsupported pseudopods were classified as [[species:Rhizopoda|Rhizopods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Protozoölogy|last = Calkins|first = Gary N.|publisher = Lea &amp; Febiger|year = 1909|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhizopods were further subdivided into lobose, filose, and reticulose amoebae, according to the morphology of their pseudopods.

===Dismantling of Sarcodina===
In the final decade of the 20th century, a series of molecular phylogenetic analyses confirmed that Sarcodina was not a [[monophyletic]] group. In view of these findings, the old scheme was abandoned and the amoebae of Sarcodina were dispersed among many other high-level taxonomic groups. Today, the majority of traditional sarcodines are placed in two eukaryote [[Kingdom (biology)#How many kingdoms are present in the Eukarya?|supergroups]]: [[Amoebozoa]] and [[Rhizaria]]. The rest have been distributed among the [[excavata|excavates]], [[opisthokonts]], and [[stramenopiles]].  Some, like the [[Centrohelida]], have yet to be placed in any supergroup.&lt;ref name="Pawlowski"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Revised Classification of Eukaryotes|last = Adl|first = Sina M.|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology|doi = 10.1111/j.1550-7408.2012.00644.x|pmid = 23020233|display-authors=etal|volume=59|issue = 5|pages=429–93|pmc=3483872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naked filose amoebae also includes [[vampyrellid]]s.
* Reticulose pseudopods ([[Endomyxa]]): Reticulose pseudopods are cytoplasmic strands that branch and merge to form a net. They are found most notably among the [[Foraminifera]], a large group of marine protists that generally produce multi-chambered shells.

Some of the amoeboid groups cited (e.g., part of [[chrysophyte]]s, part of [[xanthophyte]]s, [[chlorarachniophyte]]s) were not traditionally included in Sarcodina, being classified as [[algae]] or [[flagellate]]d protozoa.

==Pathogenic interactions with other organisms==
[[File:Trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica with ingested erythrocytes.JPG|thumb|[[Trophozoite]]s of the pathogenic ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'' with ingested [[red blood cell]]s]]

Some amoebae can infect other organisms [[pathogen]]ically, causing disease:

*''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'' is the cause of [[amoebiasis]], or ''amoebic dysentery''.
*''[[Naegleria fowleri]]'' (the "brain-eating amoeba") is a fresh-water-native species that can be fatal to humans if introduced through the nose.
*''[[Acanthamoeba]]'' can cause amoebic [[keratitis]] and [[encephalitis]] in humans.
*''[[Balamuthia mandrillaris]]'' is the cause of (often fatal) [[granulomatous amoebic meningoencephalitis]]
* Amoeba have been found to [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180116144229.htm harvest and grow] the bacteria implicated in [[Plague (disease)|plague]].

== Meiosis ==
Recent evidence indicates that several Amoebozoa lineages undergo [[meiosis]].

[[Homology (biology)#Orthology|Orthologs]] of genes employed in [[meiosis]] of sexual [[eukaryote]]s have recently been identified in the ''[[Acanthamoeba]]'' [[genome]].  These genes included ''[[Spo11]], [[MRE11A|Mre11]], [[Rad50]], [[RAD51|Rad51]], [[RAD52|Rad52]], Mnd1, [[DMC1 (gene)|Dmc1]], [[MSH2|Msh]]'' and ''[[MLH1#Meiosis|Mlh]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid25800982"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khan NA, Siddiqui R |title=Is there evidence of sexual reproduction (meiosis) in Acanthamoeba? |journal=Pathog Glob Health |volume=109 |issue=4 |pages=193–5 |year=2015 |pmid=25800982 |doi=10.1179/2047773215Y.0000000009 |url=|pmc=4530557 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This finding suggests that the ‘’Acanthamoeba‘’ are capable of some form of meiosis and may be able to undergo sexual reproduction.

The meiosis-specific [[recombinase]], [[DMC1 (gene)|Dmc1]], is required for efficient meiotic [[homologous recombination]], and ''Dmc1'' is expressed in ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''.&lt;ref name=Kelso&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kelso AA, Say AF, Sharma D, Ledford LL, Turchick A, Saski CA, King AV, Attaway CC, Temesvari LA, Sehorn MG |title=Entamoeba histolytica Dmc1 Catalyzes Homologous DNA Pairing and Strand Exchange That Is Stimulated by Calcium and Hop2-Mnd1 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=e0139399 |year=2015 |pmid=26422142 |pmc=4589404 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0139399 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The purified Dmc1 from ''E. histolytica'' forms [[Synapsis|presynaptic]] filaments and catalyses [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-dependent [[Homologous recombination|homologous DNA pairing]] and DNA strand exchange over at least several thousand [[base pairs]].&lt;ref name=Kelso /&gt;  The DNA pairing and strand exchange reactions are enhanced by the eukaryotic meiosis-specific recombination accessory factor (heterodimer) Hop2-Mnd1.&lt;ref name=Kelso /&gt;  These processes are central to meiotic recombination, suggesting that ''E. histolytica'' undergoes meiosis.&lt;ref name=Kelso /&gt;

Studies of  ''[[Entamoeba invadens]]'' found that, during the conversion from the [[Polyploid|tetraploid]] [[uninucleate]] [[Apicomplexan life cycle#Glossary of cell types|
trophozoite]] to the tetranucleate cyst, [[homologous recombination]] is enhanced.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh N, Bhattacharya A, Bhattacharya S |title=Homologous recombination occurs in Entamoeba and is enhanced during growth stress and stage conversion |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=e74465 |year=2013 |pmid=24098652 |pmc=3787063 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0074465 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expression of genes with functions related to the major steps of meiotic recombination also increase during encystations.&lt;ref name=Singh /&gt;  These findings in ''E. invadens'', combined with evidence from studies of ''E. histolytica'' indicate the presence of meiosis in the ''Entamoeba''.

''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'' in the supergroup [[Amoebozoa]] can undergo mating and [[sexual reproduction]] including meiosis when food is scarce.&lt;ref name="pmid20617172"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Flowers JM, Li SI, Stathos A, Saxer G, Ostrowski EA, Queller DC, Strassmann JE, Purugganan MD |title=Variation, sex, and social cooperation: molecular population genetics of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e1001013 |year=2010 |pmid=20617172 |pmc=2895654 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21929567"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Day DH, Keszei A |title=Signalling and sex in the social amoebozoans |journal=Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=313–29 |year=2012 |pmid=21929567 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00200.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Amoebozoa diverged early from the [[eukaryotic]] family tree, these results suggest that meiosis was present early in eukaryotic evolution. Furthermore, these findings are consistent with the proposal of Lahr et al.&lt;ref name="pmid21429931"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lahr DJ, Parfrey LW, Mitchell EA, Katz LA, Lara E |title=The chastity of amoebae: re-evaluating evidence for sex in amoeboid organisms |journal=Proc.

In molecular biology, the '''ankyrin-G binding motif of KCNQ2-3''' is a [[protein motif]] found in the [[potassium channels]] [[KvLQT2|KCNQ2]] and [[KvLQT3|KCNQ3]].

Interactions with ankyrin-G ([[ANK3|ankyrin-3]]) are crucial to the localisation of [[Voltage-gated channel|voltage-gated]] [[sodium channels]] (VGSCs) at the [[axon]] initial segment and for [[neurons]] to initiate [[action potential]]s. This [[conserved sequence|conserved]] 9-[[amino acid]] [[protein motif|motif]] (([[Valine|V]]/[[Alanine|A]])[[Proline|P]]([[Isoleucine|I]]/[[Leucine|L]])AXX[[Glutamic acid|E]]([[Serine|S]]/[[Aspartic acid|D]])D) is required for ankyrin-G binding and functions to localise sodium channels to a variety of 'excitable' [[Cell membrane|membrane]] domains both inside and outside of the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name="pmid12716895"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lemaillet G, Walker B, Lambert S | title = Identification of a conserved ankyrin-binding motif in the family of sodium channel alpha subunits | journal = J.

'''Biological functionalism''' is an [[anthropological]] paradigm, asserting that all [[social organisation|social institutions]], beliefs, values and practices serve to address pragmatic concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~n51ls801/340life.html |title=The Meaning of "Life" |author=Austin, D.F. |year=2000 |accessdate=23 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624005750/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~n51ls801/340life.html |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the theorem derives from the longer-established [[structural functionalism]], yet the two theorems diverge from one another significantly.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-rathouse.com/EvenMoreAustrianProgram/EMACulturevsGMProg.html |title=Comparing "The Strong Program in Cultural Theory |accessdate=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both maintain the fundamental belief that a [[social structure]] is composed of many interdependent [[frame of reference|frames of reference]], biological functionalists criticise the structural view that a [[solidarity (sociology)|social solidarity]] and collective conscience is required in a functioning system.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; By that fact, biological functionalism maintains that our individual survival and health is the driving provocation of actions, and that the importance of social rigidity is negligible.

==Everyday application==
Although the actions of humans without doubt do not always engender positive results for the individual, a biological functionalist would argue that the intention was still [[self-preservation]], albeit unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/basic_needs.pdf |title=Biological Adaptation in Human Societies: A 'Basic Needs' Approach |author=Corning, Peter A. |accessdate=23 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725082133/http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/basic_needs.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the belief in luck as an entity; while a disproportionately strong belief in good luck may lead to undesirable results, such as a huge loss in money from gambling, biological functionalism maintains that the newly created ability of the gambler to condemn luck will allow them to be free of individual blame, thus serving a practical and individual purpose. In this sense, biological functionalism maintains that while bad results often occur in life, which do not serve any pragmatic concerns, an entrenched [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychological]] motivation was attempting to create a positive result, in spite of its eventual failure.

'''Biological interface engineering''' is a branch of [[bioengineering]] (specifically a subset of tissue and biological materials engineering) dedicated to the study of biological response to materials and material response to biologicals. Most applications of biological interface engineering are related (but not limited to) material, structural and geometric configurations of: [[vasculature devices]], [[orthopedic devices]], [[neurological devices]] and [[organ replacement devices]]. Biological interface engineering involves the marriage of analytical, organic and physical chemistry with genetic, cellular and whole body system biological sciences. Further, biological interface engineering uses concepts developed in traditional [[materials engineering]] to describe phenomena observed at the interface of a biological device and a living organism.

A '''ceramic valve''' is a [[valve]] with [[ceramic]] trim, ball, seat, disc or lining.  A carbon or stainless steel body is used to protect the ceramic trim from being damaged by sudden thermal or mechanical shock. Advanced ceramics are used in the manufacture including [[alumina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=11082|title=Zirconia – Properties and Applications by Precision Ceramics|accessdate=2014-07-14|publisher=azom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[zirconia]] and [[silicon nitride]]. Significant benefits of the use of ceramic in valves (when compared to steel or other traditional materials) include resistance to wear and their lower mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=15th Annual Conference on Composites and Advanced Ceramic |number=9|page=1935|author=John B. Wachtman|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the excellent corrosion resistance, abrasive  resistance and wear resistance, ceramic valves are often used in severe corrosive and abrasive applications, such as [[Flue-gas desulfurization|FGD]], and [[pneumatic refuse conveying system]]s.

[[File:Oosterscheldekering, Netherlands.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Oosterscheldekering]] sea wall, the Netherlands.]]

'''Coastal management''' is defence against [[flooding]] and [[erosion]], and techniques that stop erosion to claim lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/Natural_Disasters/coastalzones.htm|title=Coastal Zones|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coastal zones occupy less than 15% of the Earth's land area, while they host more than 45% of the world population. Nearly 1.4 billion people live within 100&amp;nbsp;km of a shoreline and 100 m of sea level, with an average density 3 times higher than the global average for population.{{sfn|Small|Nicholls|2003}} With three-quarters of the world population expected to reside in the coastal zone by 2025, human activities originating from this small land area will impose heavy pressure on coasts. Coastal zones contain rich resources to produce goods and services and are home to most commercial and industrial activities.

In the [[European Union]], almost half of the population lives within 50 kilometres of the sea and coastal resources produce much of the Union's economic wealth. The fishing, shipping and tourism industries all compete for space along Europe's estimated 89,000&amp;nbsp;km of coastline and coastal zones contain some of Europe's most fragile and valuable natural [[habitat]]s.

Protection against rising sea levels in the 21st century is crucial, as [[sea level rise]] accelerates. Changes in sea level damage beaches and coastal systems are expected to rise at an increasing rate, causing coastal sediments to be disturbed by tidal energy.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
Coastal engineering of [[harbour]]s began with the origin of maritime traffic, perhaps before 3500 B.C. [[Dock (maritime)|Dock]]s, [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] and other harbour works were built by hand, often in a grand scale.

Ancient harbour works are still visible. Most of the grander ancient harbor works disappeared following the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]].

Most coastal efforts were directed to port structures. [[Venice]] and its lagoon is an example of measures not related to ports. Protection of the shore in Nathan Heenan, England and the Netherlands began in the 6th century or earlier. The ancients understood phenomena such as Mediterranean currents and wind patterns and the wind-wave cause-effect link.

[[Roman engineering|The Romans]] introduced many innovations in harbor design. They built walls underwater and constructed solid [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]]. These structures were made using [[roman concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/04/why-roman-concrete-still-stands-strong-while-modern-version-decays Roman breakwaters were made with roman concrete]&lt;/ref&gt;In some cases wave reflection was used to prevent silting. They used surface-height breakwaters to trip the waves before they reached the main breakwater. They were the first dredgers in the Netherlands to maintain the harbour at [[Velsen]]. Silting problems there were solved when the previously sealed solid piers were replaced with new "open"-piled [[jetties]].

 Middle Ages 
Attack from the sea caused many coastal towns and their harbours to be abandoned. Other harbours were lost due to natural causes such as rapid silting, shoreline advance or retreat, etc. The [[Venetian Lagoon]] was one of the few populated coastal areas with continuous prosperity and development where written reports document the evolution of coastal protection works.

=== Modern Age ===
Little improvement took place beyond the Roman approach to harbour construction after the [[Renaissance]]. Then in the early 19th century, the advent of the [[steam engine]], the search for new lands and trade routes, the expansion of the [[British Empire]] through her colonies, and other influences, all contributed to the revitalization of sea trade and a renewed interest in port works.

=== Twentieth century ===
Prior to the 1950s, the general practice was to use hard structures to protect against [[beach erosion]] or [[storm]] damages. These structures included [[seawall]]s and [[revetment]]s or sand-trapping structures such as groynes. During the 1920s and '30s, private or local community interests protected many coastal areas using these techniques on an ad hoc basis. In certain resort areas, structures proliferated to such an extent that the protection impeded recreational uses. Erosion continued, but the structures remained, resulting in a loss of beach area.

The obtrusiveness and cost of these structures led in the late 1940s and early 1950s, to a more dynamic approach. Projects attempted to replicate the protective characteristics of natural beach and dune systems. The resultant use of artificial beaches and stabilized dunes as an engineering approach was economically viable and more environmentally friendly.

Limited knowledge of coastal sediment transport processes often resulted in inappropriate measures of coastal erosion mitigation. In many cases, measures worked locally, but exacerbated problems at other locations -up to tens of kilometers away- or generated other environmental problems.

==== European Code of Conduct ====
The essential source on coastal engineering is the ''European Code of Conduct for Coastal Zones'' issued by the [[European Council]] in 1999. This document was prepared by the Group of Specialists on Coastal Protection and underlies national legislation and practice.

The Group of Specialists originated in 1995, pursuant to a decision by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. It emphasized the need for integrated management and planning, but that coastal areas continued to deteriorate. The Group claimed that this was due to difficulties in implementing the concept of "integrated management". The Group proposed that the [[Council of Europe]], cooperate with the [[Coastal &amp; Marine Union (EUCC)]] and [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP).

==Planning approaches==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
[[File:Fivepolicies.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Five general coastal management strategies]]
Five generic strategies are involved in coastal defense:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosion.org/shoreline/table.htm|title=Shoreline Management Guide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Abandonment
* Managed retreat or realignment, which plans for retreat and adopts engineering solutions that accommodate natural processes of adjustment
* Armoring by constructing seawalls and other hard structures
* Construct defenses seaward of the coast
* Adapting vertically by elevating land and buildings

The choice of strategy is site-specific, depending on pattern of sea-level change, geomorphological setting, sediment availability and erosion, as well as social, economic and political factors.

Alternatively, [[integrated coastal zone management]] approaches may be used to prevent development in erosion- or flood-prone areas, reducing the need to address the changes. [[Growth management]] can be a challenge for [[local governments|local authorities]] who must provide the [[infrastructure]] required by new residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seachangetaskforce.org.au/|title=Australian Coastal Councils Association|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Managed retreat===
{{Main|Managed retreat}}

Managed retreat is an alternative to constructing or maintaining coastal structures. Managed retreat allows an area to erode. Managed retreat is often a response to a change in [[sediment budget]] or to [[sea level rise]]. The technique is used when the land adjacent to the sea is low in value. A decision is made to allow the land to erode and flood, creating new shoreline habitats. This process may continue over many years.

The earliest managed retreat in the UK was an area of 0.8 ha at [[Northey Island]] flooded in 1991. This was followed by [[Tollesbury]] and Orplands in [[Essex]], where the sea walls were breached in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.uea.ac.uk/~e130/Tollesbury.htm|title=The Tollesbury and Orplands Managed Retreat Sites|website=archive.uea.ac.uk|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ebro Delta]] (Spain) coastal authorities planned a managed retreat.&lt;ref&gt;MMA 2005, Sitges, Meeting on Coastal Engineering; [http://www.eurosion.org/shoreline/table.htm EUROSION project]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main cost is generally the purchase of land to be abandoned. Relocation compensation may be needed. Human-made structures that will be engulfed by the sea may need to be removed. In some cases, armouring is used to protect land beyond the area to be flooded. Costs may be lowest if existing defences are left to fail naturally, but the realignment project may be more actively managed, for example by creating an artificial breach in existing defences to allow the sea in at a particular place in a controlled fashion, or by pre-forming drainage channels for created salt-marsh.

===Hold the line===
Holding the line typically involves shoreline hardening techniques, e.g., using permanent concrete and rock constructions. These techniques--[[seawall]]s, [[groynes]], detached [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]], and [[revetments]]—represent more than 70% of protected shoreline in Europe.

Alternatively, soft engineering techniques supporting natural processes and relying on natural elements such as dunes and vegetation can prevent erosive forces from reaching the back-shore. These techniques include [[beach nourishment]] and [[sand dune stabilisation]].

Historically coastal strategies were heavily based on static structures, while coastal areas otherwise reflect a [[dynamic equilibrium]].{{sfn|Schembri|2009}} Armouring often has the unintended consequence of moving the problem to another part of the coast. Soft options such as [[beach nourishment]] protect coastlines and help to restore the natural dynamism, although they require repeated applications. Maintenance costs can eventually require a strategy change.

===Move seaward===
In some cases a seaward strategy can be adopted. Examples from erosion include: Koge Bay (Dk), Western [[Scheldt]] estuary (Nl), [[Chatelaillon]] (Fr) and Ebro delta (Sp).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

There is an obvious downside to this strategy. Coastal erosion is already widespread, and there are many coasts where exceptional high tides or storm surges result in encroachment on the shore, impinging on human activity. If the sea rises, many coasts that are developed with infrastructure along or close to the shoreline will be unable to accommodate erosion. They will experience a so-called "coastal squeeze" whereby ecological or geomorphological zones that would normally retreat landwards encounter solid structures and can migrate no further. Wetlands, salt marshes, mangroves and adjacent fresh water wetlands are particularly vulnerable to such a squeeze.

An upside to the strategy is that moving seaward (and upward) can create land of high value which can bring investment.

===Limited intervention===
Limited intervention is an action taken whereby the management only addresses the problem to a certain extent, usually in areas of low economic significance. Limited intervention often includes the succession of [[halosere]]s, including salt marshes and sand dunes. This normally results in protecting the land behind the halosere, as wave energy dissipates throughout the accumulated sediment and additional vegetation in the new habitat. Although the halosere is not strictly man-made, as many natural processes contribute to the succession, anthropogenic factors are partially responsible for the formation, since an initial factor was needed to help start the process of succession.

===Hard engineering methods===

====Groynes====
[[File:Groyne at Mundesley, Norfolk.JPG|thumb|Groyne at [[Mundesley]], Norfolk, UK]]
{{Main|Groyne}}

Groynes are barriers or walls perpendicular to the coastline, often made of greenharts, concrete, rock or wood. Material builds up on the downdrift side, where [[longshore drift|littoral drift]] is predominantly in one direction, creating a wider and a more plentiful beach, thereby protecting the coast because the sand material filters and absorbs wave energy. However, there is a corresponding loss of beach material on the updrift side, requiring another groyne there. Groynes do not protect the beach against storm-driven waves and if placed too close together create currents that carry material offshore.

Groynes are cost-effective, require little maintenance and are one of the most common defences. However, groynes are increasingly viewed as detrimental to the aesthetics of the coastline and face opposition in many coastal communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/11762731.__47_3m_project_to_protect_Bournemouth___s_beaches_from_erosion_over_next_100_years/|title=£47.3m project to protect Bournemouth’s beaches from erosion over next 100 years|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groynes can be considered a "soft" solution because of the beach enhancement.

Groyne construction creates a problem known as terminal groyne syndrome. The terminal groyne prevents [[longshore drift]] from bringing material to other nearby places. This is a problem along the Hampshire and Sussex coastline in the UK; e.g., at [[Worthing]].

==== Seawalls ====
{{main|Seawall}}
Walls of concrete or rock, are used to protect a settlement against erosion or flooding. They are typically about {{convert|3|-|5|m|0}} high. Older-style vertical seawalls reflected all the energy of the waves back out to sea, and for this purpose were often given recurved crest walls which increased local turbulence, and thus increased entrainment of sand and sediment. During storms, sea walls help longshore drift.

Modern seawalls aim to re-direct most of the incident energy in the form of sloping revetments, resulting in low reflected waves and much reduced turbulence. Designs use porous designs of rock, concrete armour (Seabees, SHEDs, [[Xblocs]]) with flights of steps for beach access.

The location of a seawall, must consider the swept prism of the beach profile, the consequences of long-term beach recession and amenity crest level, including cost implications.

Sea walls can cause beaches to dissipate. Their presence also alters the landscape that they are trying to protect.

Modern examples can be found at Cronulla (NSW, 1985-6),&lt;ref&gt;Armour Units – Random Mass or Disciplined Array, – C.T.Brown ASCE Coastal Structures Specialty Conference, Washington, March 1979; The Design &amp; Construction of Prince St. Seawall, Cronulla, EHW Hirst &amp; D.N.Foster – 8th CCOE, Nov 1987, Launceston, Tasmania&lt;/ref&gt; Blackpool (1986–2001),&lt;ref&gt;Blackpool South Shore Physical Model Studies, ABP Research Report R 526, December 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Lincolnshire (1992–1997)&lt;ref&gt;Mablethorpe to Skegness, Model tests of three design options, P Holmes et al., Imperial College, September 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and Wallasey (1983–1993).&lt;ref&gt;M. N. Bell, P. C. Barber and D. G. E. Smith. The Wallasey Embankment. [http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/IssueContentPage.aspx?journalID=iicep&amp;Volume=58&amp;Issue=4 Proc. Instn Civ. Engrs 1975 (58)]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} pp. 569—590.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Sandwich, Kent]] the Seabee seawall is buried at the back of the beach under the shingle with crest level at road kerb level.

Sea walls typically cost £10,000 per metre (depending on material, height and width), £10,000,000 per km (depending on material, height and width).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

====Revetments====
{{Main|Revetments}}

Revetments are slanted or upright blockades, built parallel to the coast, usually towards the back of the beach to protect the area  beyond. The most basic revetments consist of timber slants with a possible rock infill. Waves break against the revetments, which dissipate and absorb the energy. The shoreline is protected by the beach material held behind the barriers, as the revetments trap some of the material. They may be watertight, covering the slope completely, or porous, to allow water to filter through after the wave energy has been dissipated. Most revetments do not significantly interfere with transport of longshore drift. Since the wall absorbs energy instead of reflecting, the surf progressively erodes and destroys the revetment; therefore, maintenance is ongoing, as determined by the structural material and product quality.

====Rock armour====
{{Main|Riprap}}
Rock armour is large rocks placed at the sea edge using local material. This is generally used to absorb wave energy and hold beach material. Although effective, this solution is unpopular for aesthetic reasons. Longshore drift is not hindered. Rock armour has a limited lifespan, is not effective in storm conditions and reduces recreational values.

====Gabions====
{{Main|Gabion}}
Boulders and rocks are wired into mesh cages and placed in front of areas vulnerable to erosion: sometimes at cliffs edges or at right angles to the beach. When the ocean lands on the gabion, the water drains through leaving sediment, while the structure absorbs a moderate amount of wave energy.

Gabions need to be securely tied to protect the structure.

Downsides include wear rates and visual intrusiveness.

====Offshore breakwater====
{{Main|Breakwater (structure)}}
Concrete blocks and/or boulders are sunk offshore to alter wave direction and to filter wave and tide energy. The waves break further offshore and therefore lose erosive power. This leads to wider beaches, which further absorb wave energy. [[Dolos]] has replaced the use of concrete blocks because it is more resistant to wave action and requires less concrete to produce a superior result. Similar concrete objects like Dolos are [[A-jack]], [[Akmon]], [[Xbloc]], [[Tetrapod (structure)|Tetrapod]] and [[Accropode]].

====Cliff stabilization====
{{Main|Cliff stabilization}}

[[Cliff stabilization]] can be accomplished through drainage of excess rainwater of through terracing, planting and wiring to hold cliffs in place.

====Entrance training walls====

{{Main|Training (civil)}}

Training walls are built to constrain a river or creek as it discharges across a sandy coastline. The walls stabilise and deepen the channel which benefits navigation, flood management, river erosion and water quality, but can cause coastal erosion by interrupting longshore drift. One solution is a sand bypassing system to pump sand under/around the training walls.

====Floodgates====
{{Main|Floodgate}}

Storm surge barriers, or [[floodgates]], were introduced after the [[North Sea flood of 1953|North Sea Flood of 1953]] and prevent damage from storm surges or any other type of natural disaster that could harm the area they protect. They are habitually open and allow free passage, but close under threat of a storm surge. The [[Thames Barrier]] is an example of such a structure.

===Soft engineering methods===

====Beach replenishment====
{{Main|Beach replenishment}}
Beach replenishment/nourishment involves importing sand from elsewhere and adding it to the existing beach. The imported sand should be of a similar quality to the existing beach material so it can meld with the natural local processes and without adverse effects. Beach nourishment can be used in combination with groynes. The scheme requires repeated applications on an annual or multi-year cycle.

====Dune stabilisation====

Stabilising dunes can help protect beaches by catching windblown sand, increasing natural beach formation. Dune stabilisation/sand dune management employs public amenities such as car parks, footpaths, [[Dutch sand ladder|Dutch Ladders]] and [[boardwalk]]s to reduce erosion and the removal of sand by humans. Noticeboards, leaflets and beach wardens explain to visitors how to avoid damaging the area. Beach areas can be closed to the public to reduce damage. Fences can allow sand traps to create [[Blowout (geology)|blowouts]] and increase windblown sand capture. Plants such as [[Ammophila (plant)|Ammophila]] (Marram grass) can bind the sediment.

====Beach drainage====&lt;!-- note [[Beach drainage]] links here --&gt;
Beach drainage or beach face dewatering lowers the [[water table]] locally beneath the beach face. This causes [[Accretion (coastal management)|accretion]] of sand above the drainage system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105736/http://www.shoregro.com/P04_BD-how%20it%20works.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beach watertables have an important bearing on deposition/erosion across the foreshore.{{sfn|Grant|1946}} In one study a high watertable coincided with accelerated beach erosion, while a low watertable coincided with pronounced aggradation of the foreshore. A lower watertable (unsaturated beach face) facilitates deposition by reducing flow velocities during backwash and prolonging laminar flow. With the beach in a saturated state, backwash velocity is accelerated by the addition of groundwater seepage out of the beach within the effluent zone.

However, no case studies provide indisputable evidence of positive results, although in some cases overall positive performance was reported. Long-term monitoring was not undertaken at a frequency high enough to discriminate the response to high energy erosive events.

A useful side effect of the system is that collected seawater is relatively pure because of sand's filtration effect. Such water may be discharged or be used to oxygenate stagnant inland lagoons/marinas or used as feed for heat pumps, desalination plants, land-based aquaculture, aquariums or swimming pools.

Beach drainage systems have been installed in many locations around the world to halt and reverse erosion trends in sand beaches. Twenty four beach drainage systems have been installed since 1981 in Denmark, USA, UK, Japan, Spain, Sweden, France, Italy and Malaysia.

==== Costs ====
The costs of installation and operation vary due to:
* system length (non-linear cost elements)
* pump flow rates (sand permeability, power costs)
* soil conditions (presence of rock or impermeable strata)
* discharge arrangement /filtered seawater utilization
* drainage design, materials selection &amp; installation methods
* geographical considerations (location logistics)
* regional economic considerations (local capabilities /costs)
* study requirements /consent process.

==Monitoring ==
Coastal managers must compensate for error and uncertainty in the information regarding the erosive processes. Video-based monitoring can collect data continuously and produce analyses of shoreline processes.

===Event warning systems===
Event warning systems, such as [[tsunami warning system|tsunami warnings]] and [[storm surge]] warnings, can be used to minimize the human impact of catastrophic events that cause coastal erosion. Storm surge warnings can help determine when to close [[floodgate]]s.

Wireless sensor networks can aid monitoring.

===Shoreline mapping===

Defining the shoreline is a difficult task due to its dynamic nature and the intended application.{{sfn|Graham|Sault|Bailey|2003}}{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}} The relevant mapping scale is dependent on the context of the investigation.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}} Generally, the coast comprises the interface between land and sea, and the shoreline is represented by the margin between the two.{{sfn|Woodroffe|2002}} Investigators adopt the use of shoreline indicators to represent the true shoreline position.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}}

====Shoreline indicator====

[[File:Mcwillizind.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Figure 1. A diagram representing the spatial relationship between many of the commonly used indicators.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from {{harvnb|Boak|Turner|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The choice of shoreline indicator is a primary consideration. Indicators must be easily identified in the field and on [[aerial photography]].{{sfn|Leatherman|2003}} Shoreline indicators may be morphological features such as the [[berm]] crest, scarp edge, [[vegetation]] line, [[dune]] toe, dune crest and cliff or the bluff crest and toe. Alternatively, non-morphological features may be used such as water level (high water line (HWL), mean high water line) wet/dry boundary and the physical water line.{{sfn|Pajak|Leatherman|2002}} Figure 1 provides a sketch of the spatial relationships between commonly used shoreline indicators.

The HWL (H in Figure 1) is the most commonly used shoreline indicator because it is visible in the field, and can be interpreted on both colour and grey scale aerial photographs.{{sfn|Leatherman|2003}}{{sfn|Crowell|Leatherman|Buckley|1991}} The HWL represents the landward extent of the most recent [[high tide]] and is characterised by a change in sand colour due to repeated, periodic inundation by high tides. The HWL is portrayed on aerial photographs by the most landward change in colour or grey tone.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}}

====Importance and application====

The shoreline location and its changing position over time is of fundamental importance to coastal scientists, engineers and managers.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}} {{sfn|Pajak|Leatherman|2002}} Shoreline monitoring campaigns provide information about historic shoreline location and movement, and about predictions of future change.{{sfn|Appeaning Addo|Walkden|Mills|2008}} More specifically the position of the shoreline in the past, at present and where it is predicted to be in the future is useful for in the design of coastal protection, to calibrate and verify [[computer simulation|numerical models]] to assess [[sea level rise]], map hazard zones and to regulate coastal development. The location of the shoreline also provides information regarding shoreline reorientation adjacent to structures, [[beach]] width, volume and rates of historical change.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}}{{sfn|Pajak|Leatherman|2002}}

====Data sources====

A variety of data sources are available for examining shoreline position. However, the availability of historical data is limited at many coastal sites and so the choice of data source is largely limited to what is available for the site at a given time.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}} Shoreline mapping techniques have become more automated. The frequent changes in technology prevented the emergence of one standard mapping approach. Each data source and associated method have capabilities and shortcomings.{{sfn|Moore|2000}}

=====Historical maps=====

In the event that a study requires the shoreline position from before aerial photographs, or if the location has poor photographic coverage, historical maps provide an alternative.{{sfn|Moore|2000}} Many errors are associated with early maps and charts. Such errors may be associated with scale, [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] changes, distortions from uneven shrinkage, stretching, creases, tears and folds, different [[surveying]] standards, different publication standards and [[map projection|projection]] errors.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}} The severity of these errors depends on the accuracy of the map and the physical changes that occurred after it was made.{{sfn|Anders|Byrnes|1991}} The oldest reliable source of shoreline data in the United States dates is the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|U.S Coast and Geodetic Survey]]/[[National Ocean Service]] T-sheets and dates to the early-to-mid-19th century.{{sfn|Morton|1991}} In the United Kingdom, many pre-1750 maps and charts were deemed to be inaccurate. The founding of the [[Ordnance Survey]] in 1791 improved mapping accuracy.

=====Aerial photographs=====
Aerial photographs began to be used in the 1920s to provide [[topography|topographical]] data. They provide a good [[database]] for compilation of shoreline change maps. Aerial photographs are the most commonly used data source because many coastal areas have extensive aerial photo coverage.{{sfn|Moore|2000}}Aerial photographs generally provide good spatial coverage. However, temporal coverage is site specific. The interpretation of shoreline position is subjective given the dynamic nature of the coastal environment. This combined with various distortions inherent in aerial photographs can lead to [[statistical significance|significant]] error levels.{{sfn|Moore|2000}} The minimisation of further errors is discussed below.

======Object space displacements======

[[File:Displacement1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Figure 2. An example of relief displacement. All objects above ground level are displaced outwards from the centre of the photograph. The displacement becomes more evident near the edges.]]

Conditions outside of the camera can cause objects in an image to appear displaced from their true ground position. Such conditions may include ground relief, camera [[tilt (optics)|tilt]] and [[atmospheric refraction]].

Relief displacement is prominent when photographing a variety of [[elevation]]s. This situation causes objects above sea level to be displaced outward from the centre of the photograph and objects below ground level to be displaced toward the centre of the image (Figure 2). The severity of the displacement is negatively associated with decreases in flight altitude and as [[radial distance (geometry)|radial distance]] from the centre of the photograph increases. This distortion can be minimised by photographing multiple [[swath width|swaths]] and creating a [[mosaic]] of the images. This technique creates a focus for the centre of each photograph where distortion is minimised. This error is not common in shoreline mapping as the relief is fairly constant. It is however important to consider when mapping cliffs.{{sfn|Moore|2000}}

Ideally aerial photographs are taken so the [[optical axis]] of the camera is perfectly [[perpendicular]] to the ground surface, thereby creating a [[Vertical direction|vertical]] photograph. Unfortunately this is often not the case and virtually all aerial photographs experience tilt up to 3°.{{sfn|Camfield|Morang|1996}} In this situation the scale of the image is larger on the upward side of the tilt axis and smaller on the downward side. Many coastal researchers do not consider this in their work.{{sfn|Moore|2000}}

======Radial lens distortion======
[[photographic lens|Lens]] distortion varies as a function of radial distance from the iso-centre of the photograph meaning that the centre of the image is relatively distortion free, but as the [[angle]] of view increases distortion. This is a significant source of error in earlier aerial photography. Such a distortion is impossible to correct for without knowing the details of the lens used to capture the image. Overlapping images can be used to resolve errors.{{sfn|Crowell|Leatherman|Buckley|1991}}

====== Shoreline delineation ======
The dynamic nature of coasts compromises shoreline mapping. This uncertainty arises because at any given time the position of the shoreline is influenced by the immediate tidal effects and a variety of long-term effects such as relative sea-level rise and along [[shore]] [[littoral zone|littoral]] [[sediment]] movement. This affects the accuracy of computed historic shoreline position and predictions.{{sfn|Appeaning Addo|Walkden|Mills|2008}} HWL is most commonly used as a shoreline indicator. Many errors are associated with using the wet/dry line as a proxy for the HWL and shoreline. The errors of largest concern are the short-term migration of the wet/dry line, interpretation of the wet/dry line on a photograph and measurement of the interpreted line position.{{sfn|Leatherman|2003}}{{sfn|Moore|2000}} Systematic errors such as the migration of the wet/dry line arise from tidal and [[seasonal]] changes. [[Erosion]] may cause the wet/dry line to migrate. Field investigations have shown that these changes can be minimised by using only summertime data.;{{sfn|Moore|2000}} {{sfn|Leatherman|2003}} Furthermore, the error bar can be significantly reduced by using the longest record of reliable data to calculate erosion rates.{{sfn|Leatherman|2003}} Errors may arise due to the difficulty of measuring a single line on a photograph. For example, where the pen line is 0.13&amp;nbsp;mm thick this translates to an error of ±2.6 m on a 1:20000 scale photograph.

=====Beach profiling surveys=====
Beach profiling surveys are typically repeated at regular intervals along the coast in order to measure short-term (daily to annual) variations in shoreline position and beach volume.{{sfn|Smith|Zarillo|1990}} Beach profiling is a very accurate source of information. However, measurements are generally subject to the limitations of conventional surveying techniques. Shoreline data derived from beach profiling is often spatially and temporally limited due to the high cost associated with that labour-intensive activity. Shorelines are generally derived by [[interpolation|interpolating]] from a series of discrete beach profiles. The distance between the profiles is usually quite large, limiting the accuracy of the interpolating. Survey data is limited to smaller lengths of shoreline generally less than ten kilometres.{{sfn|Boak|Turner|2005}} Beach profiling data is commonly available in from regional councils in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071017223708/http://www.hbrc.govt.nz/PORTALS/0/CHA/CHA%20Vol%203%20Appendix%20A.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Remote sensing=====
A range of airborne, [[satellite]] and land based [[remote sensing]] techniques can provide additional, mappable data.{{sfn|Smith|Zarillo|1990}} Remotely sensed data sources include:

*[[Multispectral]] and [[hyperspectral]] imaging
*[[Microwave]] sensors
*[[Global positioning system]] (GPS)
*[[LIDAR|Airborne light detection and ranging technology]] (LIDAR)

Remote sensing techniques can be cost effective, reduce manual error and reduce the subjectivity of conventional field techniques.{{sfn|Maiti|Bhattacharya|2009}} Remote sensing is a relatively new concept, limiting extensive historical observations. Coastal morphology observations must be quantified by coupling remotely sensed data with other sources of information detailing historic shoreline position from archived sources.{{sfn|Appeaning Addo|Walkden|Mills|2008}}

=====Video analysis=====
[[Video]] analysis provides quantitative, cost-effective, continuous and long-term monitoring beaches.{{sfn|Turner|Aarninkhof|Dronkers|McGrath|2004}} The advancement of coastal video systems in the twenty-first century enabled the extraction of large amounts of geophysical data from images. The data describes coastal morphology, surface currents and wave parameters. The main advantage of video analysis lies in the ability to reliably quantify these parameters with high resolution space and time coverage. This highlights their potential as an effective coastal monitoring system and an aid to coastal zone management.{{sfn|Van Koningsveld|Davidson|Huntly|Medina|2007}} Interesting case studies have been carried out using video analysis. One group used a video-based ARGUS coastal imaging system{{sfn|Turner|Aarninkhof|Dronkers|McGrath|2004}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coastalwiki.org/coastalwiki/Argus_video_monitoring_system|title=Argus video monitoring system - Coastal Wiki|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to monitor and quantify the regional-scale coastal response to sand nourishment and construction of the world-first [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] artificial surfing [[reef]] in Australia. Another assessed the added value of high [[Image resolution|resolution]] video observations for short-term predictions of near shore hydrodynamic and morphological processes, at temporal scales of meters to kilometres and days to seasons.{{sfn|Smit|Aarninkhof|Wijnberg|Gonzalez|2007}}

Video analysis gives coastal zone managers the opportunity to obtain [[bathymetry]].{{sfn|Plant|Holland|Haller|2008}}{{sfn|Holman|Plant|Holland|2013}}{{sfn|Bergsma|Conley|Davidson|O'Hare|2016}} It can be used to obtain inter-tidal topographies and sub-tidal bathymetries and measure coastal zone resilience [as in available beach volume as well as sub-tidal bar configuration]. Video-based depth estimations were applied in micro/meso tidal environments at DUCK, NC{{sfn|Holman|Plant|Holland|2013}} and highly energetic wave climates with a macro tidal regime at Porthtowan in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Bergsma|Conley|Davidson|O'Hare|2016}} The latter showed the application of video-based depth estimations during extreme storms.{{sfn|Masselink|Scott|Poate|Russell|2016}}{{sfn|Castelle|Marieu|Bujana|Splinter|2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25183">'''Community fingerprinting''' is a set of [[molecular biology]] techniques that can be used to quickly profile the [[biodiversity|diversity]] of a [[microorganism|microbial]] community. Rather than directly identifying or counting individual cells in an environmental sample, these techniques show how many variants of a [[gene]] are present. In general, it is assumed that each different gene variant represents a different type of microbe. Community fingerprinting is used by [[microbiologist]]s studying a variety of microbial systems (e.g. marine, freshwater, soil, and human microbial communities) to measure biodiversity or track changes in community structure over time. The method analyzes environmental samples by assaying genomic [[DNA]]. This approach offers an alternative to [[microbiological culture|microbial culturing]], which is important because most microbes cannot be cultured in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Madigan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Madigan|first=M.T.|title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=San Francisco, CA|edition=12th |author2=J.M. Martinko |author3=P.V. Dunlap |author4=D.P. Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community fingerprinting does not result in identification of individual microbe species; instead, it presents an overall picture of a microbial community.  These methods are now largely being replaced by high throughput sequencing, such as targeted [[microbiome]] analysis (e.g., 16s rRNA sequencing) and [[metagenomics]].

==Use==
A fingerprinting analysis begins with an environmental sample (e.g. seawater or soil), from which total DNA is extracted. (Total DNA contains a mix of genetic material from all the microbes present in the sample.) A particular gene or DNA region is then selected as a target for analysis, under the assumption that each microbe species will have a different gene variant (also called a "[[phylotype]]"). Different methods (see below) can be used to visualize the phylotypes present in a sample. Because the aim of community fingerprinting is to gain an overall understanding of community structure, it is a particularly useful technique for analyzing [[Time series|time-series]] data collected from the field. For example, one could study the pattern of microbial [[ecological succession|succession]] in a habitat, or one could examine the response of a microbial community to an environmental perturbation, such as the release of a pollutant. Depending on what information is desired, different genes may be targeted. The most common are small subunit [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) genes, such as [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]]. These genes are frequently used in microbial [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analyses, so well-established techniques exist for their study. Other genes of interest might be those that are key in various metabolic processes.&lt;ref name="Madigan" /&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The advantages of community fingerprinting are that it can be performed quickly and relatively cheaply, and the analyses can accommodate a large number of samples simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Marsh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=T.L.|title=Culture-independent microbial community analysis with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism|journal=Methods in Enzymology|year=2005|volume=397|pages=308–329|doi=10.1016/s0076-6879(05)97018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=A.|author2=L.A. Ogilvie|title=Name that microbe: rapid identification of taxa responsible for individual fragments in fingerprints of microbial community structure|journal=Molecular Ecology Notes|year=2004|volume=4|issue=1|pages=133–136|doi=10.1111/j.1471-8286.2004.00590.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These properties make community fingerprinting especially useful for monitoring changes in microbial communities over time. Also, fingerprinting techniques do not require one to have ''a priori'' sequence data for organisms in a sample.
A disadvantage of community fingerprinting is that it results in largely qualitative, not quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Osborn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osborn|first=A.M. |author2=E.R.B. Moore |author3=K.N. Timmis|title=An evaluation of terminal-restriction  fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis for the study of microbial community  structure and dynamics|journal=Environmental Microbiology|year=2000|volume=2|issue=1|pages=39–50|doi=10.1046/j.1462-2920.2000.00081.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using qualitative data, it can be difficult to compare patterns observed in different studies or between different investigators.  Also, community fingerprinting does not directly identify taxa in an environmental sample, though the data output from certain techniques (e.g. [[DGGE]]) can be analyzed further if one desires identification. Some authors point to poor reproducibility of results for certain fingerprinting methods,&lt;ref name="Grant" /&gt; while other authors have criticized the inaccuracy of abundance estimates and the inability of some techniques to capture the presence of rare taxa.&lt;ref name="Bent"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bent|first=S.J. |author2=J.D. Pierson |author3=L.J. Forney|title=Measuring species richness based on microbial  community fingerprints: the emperor has no clothes|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=2007|volume=73|issue=7|pages=2399–2401|doi=10.1128/aem.02383-06|pmid=17403942|pmc=1855686}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is difficult for the DGGE method to detect microbes that comprise less than 0.5%-1% of a bacterial community.&lt;ref name="Kan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kan|first=J.|author2=K.

==Techniques==
This section presents three methods of community fingerprinting.

===Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP)===

[[Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (T-RFLP) is a method that uses [[fluorescence|fluorescently]]-labeled DNA fragments to produce a community fingerprint.&lt;ref name="Marsh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=W.-T. |author2=T. L. Marsh |author3=H. Cheng |author4=L.J. Forney|title=Characterization of microbial  diversity by determining terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms of genes  encoding 16S rRNA|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1997|volume=63|issue=11|pages=4517–4522}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section presents a brief explanation of T-RFLP ''in the specific context of community fingerprinting''. For a more detailed explanation, refer to the [[Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism|T-RFLP]] article.

====Procedure====
To perform T-RFLP (Figure 1), one must select a target gene (e.g. the 16S rRNA gene) to amplify by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. At least one [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]] used in the PCR reaction is fluorescently labeled at the [[directionality (molecular biology)|5´]] end. After PCR amplification, each copied DNA segment carries the fluorescent label. Next, [[restriction enzyme]]s are used to cut the amplified DNA at specific [[recognition site]]s. The underlying assumption is that each microbe in the sample will have a different sequence on the target gene, so a restriction enzyme will cut each microbe's DNA in a different place. (Each different restriction site is considered to represent a single [[operational taxonomic unit]] [OTU]). Thus, the enzyme will produce one fragment length for each type of microbe present in the sample. The result of digestion is a set of restriction fragments of different lengths, each of which is fluorescently labeled at one end. These are known as "terminal fragments" because they are labeled at the end where the PCR primer attached.  (The unlabeled ends are not recorded in the final analysis.) Next, the fragments are separated by size through either [[gel electrophoresis|gel]] or [[capillary electrophoresis]]. Laser detection captures the size and fluorescence-intensity patterns of the terminal fragments. DNA standards of known size and fluorescence are included in the analysis as references. By setting a minimum threshold for fluorescence, background noise will be excluded.&lt;ref name="Osborn" /&gt;
[[File:Step-by-step procedure of using T-RFLP analysis in microbiology.pdf|thumb|right|Figure 1. Steps of Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis for a single microbial community with 3 phylotypes]]

====Data output and interpretation====
The output of the laser detection step is an [[electropherogram]] that shows a series of peaks, with fragment length on the horizontal axis and fluorescence intensity on the vertical axis (Figure 1). A second output&lt;ref name="Osborn" /&gt; is a data table that lists the migration time of the fragments, the size in [[base pairs]] of each peak, and the height of and area under each peak.

The theoretical basis of T-RFLP assumes that peaks at different positions along the horizontal axis represent different types of organisms (or OTUs). The area under each fluorescence intensity peak is a proxy for relative abundance of each phylotype in the community. However, a number of caveats must be taken into account. Different types of organisms may share a restriction site in the gene of interest; if that is the case, these organisms would not be distinguished as different peaks on the electropherogram. Furthermore, area under a peak represents relative abundance rather than absolute abundance, and there are biases in abundance measurement and PCR amplification. For example, organisms that are scarce in the original total DNA sample will not be amplified enough to be detected in the final analysis.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt; This leads to underestimation of community diversity. Liu ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt; cite other possible factors that may distort results, including "differences in gene copy number between species and biases introduced during cell lysis, DNA extraction, and PCR amplification" (p.&amp;nbsp;4521). For those who seek detailed technical information, Marsh&lt;ref name="Marsh" /&gt; provides a catalog of potential biases that could be introduced in each step of the T-RFLP process.

====Advantages and disadvantages{{anchor|Advantages and disadvantages of T-RFLP}}====
The major advantages of T-RFLP are that it is fast and can easily accommodate many samples.&lt;ref name="Marsh" /&gt; Also, the visual output simplifies comparison of community structure patterns across different samples. A disadvantage is the broad, qualitative nature of the data output, which must be interpreted with the above caveats in mind.

The authors collected environmental water samples from reservoirs in a time series. After comparison of samples with known terminal restriction fragments (from a database built from cultures), they concluded that T-RFLP can be used effectively as a technique for monitoring ''changes'' in the phytoplankton community. However, diversity and abundance estimates were found to be less accurate than those found through other methods.

===Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)===

====Procedure====
[[Dgge|Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)]] is a microbial fingerprinting technique that separates [[amplicon]]s of roughly the same size based on sequence properties&lt;ref name="Madigan" /&gt; (Figure 2). These properties dictate the threshold at which DNA denatures. The DGGE gel uses a gradient DNA denaturant (a mixture of urea and formamide), or a linear temperature gradient.&lt;ref name=Muyzer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muyzer|first=G.|title=DGGE/TGGE a method for identifying genes from natural ecosystems|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|year=1999|volume=2|pages=317–322|doi=10.1016/s1369-5274(99)80055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fragment reaches its melting point (threshold of enough denaturant), it stops moving. This is due to the fact that a partially melted double-stranded DNA can no longer migrate through the gel.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=S.G.|author2=L.S. Lerman|title=DNA fragments differing by single base-pair substitutions are separated in denaturing electrophoreseis analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified genes coding for 16S rRN|journal=PNAS|year=1983|volume=80|number=6|pages=1579–1583|doi= 10.1073/pnas.80.6.1579 |pmc=393645}}&lt;/ref&gt; A GC clamp (about 40 bases with high GC content) is used as a special [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] to anchor the [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] fragments together once they have [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]].&lt;ref name=Rettedal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rettedal|first=E.A.|author2=S.

[[File:Step-by-step procedure of using DGGE analysis in microbiology.pdf|thumb|right|Figure 2. The microbial fingerprinting technique called Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. The diagram demonstrates how samples from different microbial communities can be compared.]]

====Data output and interpretation====
Each lane on a gel represents one microbial community. The shared bands among the samples are the same size and roughly the same position on the gel. The gene variants that are not shared amongst microbial community samples do not match up horizontally with others. For example, if the gene of interest is 16S rRNA, as it was when the technique was first described, the PCR-amplified fragments will be in the same vertical location because they are all roughly the same size.&lt;ref name=Muyzer2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muyzer|first=G. |author2=E.C. De Waal |author3=A.G. Uitterlinden |title=Profiling of complex microbial populations by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified genes coding for 16S rRN|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1993|volume=59|pages=695–700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another target gene may have greater variation in length, but the denaturant gradient uses a second element (of melting point) to further distinguish between the samples. The DGGE gel will separate genes of the same size based on base sequence.

This technique shows to what extent microbial communities are the same or different in taxonomic composition. Each band in a different location on the gel represents a different phylotype (one unique sequence of a phylogenetic marker gene).&lt;ref name="Madigan" /&gt; For microbial communities this method profiles many individual 16S rRNA sequences.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=D.M.|author2=M. J. Ferris |author3=S. C. Nold |author4=M. M. Bateson |title=A natural view of microbial biodiversity within hot spring cyanobacterial mat communities|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|year=1998|volume=62|pages=1353–1370|pmid=9841675 |pmc=98949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of bands at differing horizontal positions can be used to estimate the level of biodiversity in that sample and infer phylogenetic affiliation.&lt;ref name="Muyzer" /&gt; In order to know more about phylogenetic affiliation, one could excise those bands from the gel and then sequence them.

====Advantages and disadvantages{{anchor|Advantages and disadvantages of DGGE}}====
The use of denaturing profile serves as a way to separate DNA fragments of similar sizes. This is beneficial in assessing microbial diversity due to the fact that the 16S rRNA gene does not vary much in size across bacterial phyla. The DGGE gel provides a quick way of looking at biodiversity in a microbial sample and does not preclude the option of sequencing the bands of interest. This method does not require that the microbes be cultured in the lab and does not require any sequence data needed to design probes for hybridization methods.&lt;ref name="Muyzer" /&gt; The main disadvantage is that this is a qualitative assessment of biodiversity and one must sequence the genes in order to make inferences about the phylogenetic relatedness. Another disadvantage is that the GC clamp can be variable each time it is synthesized. This leads to the potential for different DGGE profiles for the same 16S rRNA sequence.&lt;ref name="Rettedal" /&gt;

They obtained an initial assessment of microbial diversity in their environmental samples from soil maintained for 36 years at the various pH values. They combined DGGE and hybridization techniques by probing the DNA fragments to obtain more detail about the natural populations. In this study, they were looking at a group of closely related bacterial types, all autotrophic β–proteobacterial ammonia oxidizers. The 16S rDNA samples yielded ambiguous overlapping bands when run out on a gel. The ambiguous overlapping bands were separated with cluster-specific radiolabelled probes, which yielded information of the relative abundance of the different genotypes in samples.

Ward ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt; examined cyanobacterial mat communities in a Yellowstone hot spring by using DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene segments of aerobic chemoorganotrophic populations. DGGE allowed them to profile the community gaining new insight to diversity. They characterized the bands of interest by purifying and sequencing and detected many lineages previously unknown to be present.

===(Automated) ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) ===

====Procedure====

(Automated) [[ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis]], or (A)RISA (Figure 3), takes advantage of the fact that prokaryotic DNA encodes for two highly conserved genes, the 16SrRNA gene and the 23SrRNA gene. These encode the small and large subunit genes in the rRNA operon. Between these two genes, there is an internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Due to the fact it is non-coding for proteins, it is a highly variable nucleotide sequence and length. Once DNA is isolated from a community, PCR amplifies this spacer region. The fragments can be run out on a gel (RISA), or the fluorescent primers can be translated into peaks in abundance of the different fragments lengths on an [[electropherogram]] (ARISA).&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=M.M.|author2=E.W. Triplett|title=Automated approach for ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis of microbial diversity and its application to freshwater bacterial communities|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1999|volume=65|pages=4630–4636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ranjard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranjard|first=L. |author2=F.

====Data output and interpretation====
Due to variable non-coding regions, the output for RISA is a gel with different banding patterns, and output for ARISA is an electropherogram  with different peaks (similar to T-RFLP).

The brightness of the fluorescently labeled primers correlates to how prevalent that bacterial type is in the community. The banding pattern on the gel can be interpreted as a community-specific profile. Each DNA band or peak indicates at least one representative of that organism.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; In RISA, the bands on gel that do not match up in length represent different organisms in the community because they have different spacer regions between the two highly conserved genes. The electropherogram shows peaks correlating to the relative abundance of that spacer region in the sample.

====Advantages and disadvantages{{anchor|Advantages and disadvantages of ARISA}}====
ARISA can have a higher resolution in detecting microbial diversity as compared to [[Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism|T-RFLP]].&lt;ref name=Danovaro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danovaro|first=R. |author2=G. M. Luna |author3=A. Dell’Anno |author4=B. Pietrangeli|title=Comparison of two fingerprinting techniques, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, for determination of bacterial diversity in aquatic environments|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=2006|volume=72|pages=5982–5989|doi=10.1128/aem.01361-06 |pmid=16957219 |pmc=1563681}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fingerprinting method is a quick and sensitive method to estimate microbial diversity. The observed length heterogeneities can be compared to databases for overlap with culturable organisms.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; One can design phylum-level oligonucleotide primers to get at questions regarding phylogenetic groups.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; One disadvantage to ARISA is the fact that a single organism may contribute more than one peak to the community profile. Unrelated organisms can also have similar spacer lengths, which leads to underestimates of community diversity. Due to these biases, researchers often use this method on multiple samples from each community in order to get an average assessment.

====Applications{{anchor|Applications of ARISA}}====
Ranjard ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Ranjard" /&gt; discuss several examples of types of studies in which RISA can be used. They cite several studies that have used this technique to fingerprint bacterial communities following such disturbances as antibiotic treatment, mercury stress and deforestation. They also demonstrated the successful use of ARISA for characterizing fungal communities, which is an aspect of microbial ecology that remains to be fully explored.

Schloss ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Schloss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schloss|first=P.D. |author2=A.G. Hay |author3=D.B. Wilson |author4=L.P.

They used ARISA to profile the community structure and look at microbial succession over stages in the composting process. They took DNA samples and sequenced the 16S rRNA gene to identify community members at the different phases of the process. Then they used ARISA to look at community-wide changes and then matched up the 16S rRNA gene sequence with the most common ARISA fragments to identify these microbial community members.

'''Design''' is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction. Design has different [[connotation]]s in different fields (see [[#Design disciplines|design disciplines]] below). In some cases, the direct construction of an object (as in [[pottery]], [[engineering]], management, [[software development|coding]], and [[graphic design]]) is also considered to use design thinking.

Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, [[Functionalism (architecture)|functional]], economic, and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable [[research]], [[thought]], [[Physical model|modeling]], interactive [[problem solving|adjustment]], and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including [[clothing]], [[graphical user interface]]s, products, skyscrapers, [[corporate identity|corporate identities]], [[business process]]es, and even methods or processes of designing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brinkkemper, S. |year=1996|title= Method engineering: engineering of information systems development methods and tools|journal= Information and Software Technology |volume=38|issue=4|pages=275–280|doi=10.1016/0950-5849(95)01059-9|url=http://doc.utwente.nl/18012/1/Brinkkemper96method.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus "design" may be a substantive referring to a categorical abstraction of a created thing or things (the design of something), or a verb for the process of creation as is made clear by grammatical context.

== Definitions ==
More formally design has been defined as follows:
{{Quote|(noun) a specification of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]], manifested by an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]], intended to accomplish [[goal]]s, in a particular [[Environment (systems)|environment]], using a set of primitive components, satisfying a set of [[requirement]]s, subject to constraints; (verb, transitive) to create a design, in an [[Environment (systems)|environment]] (where the designer operates)&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P. and Wand, Y. (2009). A proposal for a formal definition of the design concept. In Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., editors, Design Requirements Workshop (LNBIP 14), pp. 103–136. Springer-Verlag, p. 109 {{DOI|10.1007/978-3-540-92966-6_6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another definition for design is "a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone to achieve a unique expectation. It defines the specifications, plans, parameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal, political, social, environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving that objective."&lt;ref&gt;Don Kumaragamage, Y. (2011). Design Manual Vol 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, a "specification" can be manifested as either a plan or a finished product, and "primitives" are the elements from which the design object is composed.

The person designing is called a designer, which is also a term used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a textile designer, fashion designer, product designer, concept designer, web designer or interior designer). A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process while the scientific study of design is called [[design science]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, C. (1964) Notes on the Synthesis of Form, Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eekels, J. |year=2000|title=On the Fundamentals of Engineering Design Science: The Geography of Engineering Design Science, Part 1|journal= Journal of Engineering Design |volume=11|pages=377–397|doi=10.1080/09544820010000962|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="design theory"&gt;Braha, D. and Maimon, O. (1998) A Mathematical Theory of Design, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of design is planning to manufacture an object, system, component or structure. Thus the word "design" can be used as a noun or a verb. In a broader sense, design is an applied art and engineering that integrates with technology.

While the definition of design is fairly broad, design has a myriad of specifications that professionals utilize in their fields.

Major examples of design are [[blueprint|architectural blueprints]], [[engineering drawing]]s, [[business process]]es, [[circuit diagram]]s, and [[Pattern (sewing)|sewing patterns]]&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary meanings in the [//dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/design Cambridge Dictionary of American English], at [//www.dictionary.com/browse/design Dictionary.com] (esp. meanings 1–5 and 7–8) and at [//en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/design AskOxford] (esp. verbs).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design as a process{{anchor|Process}}==
Substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields, whether amateur or professional, alone or in teams, produce designs. Kees Dorst and Judith Dijkhuis, both designers themselves, argued that "there are many ways of describing design processes" and discussed "two basic and fundamentally different ways",&lt;ref&gt;Dorst and Dijkhuis 1995, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; both of which have several names. The prevailing view has been called "the rational model",&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "technical problem solving"&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"&gt;Schön 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and "the reason-centric perspective".&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"&gt;Ralph 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative view has been called "reflection-in-action",&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"/&gt; "evolutionary design",&lt;ref name="design theory"/&gt; "co-evolution",&lt;ref&gt;Dorst and Cross 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and "the action-centric perspective".&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt;

===The rational model===
The rational model was independently developed by [[Herb Simon|Herbert A. Simon]],&lt;ref&gt;Newell and Simon 1972; Simon 1969&lt;/ref&gt; an American scientist, and Gerhard Pahl and Wolfgang Beitz, two German engineering design theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Pahl and Beitz 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that:
# designers attempt to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimize]] a design candidate for known [[constraint optimization|constraints]] and [[Goal|objectives]],
# the design process is plan-driven,
# the design process is understood in terms of a discrete sequence of stages.

The rational model is based on a [[Rationalism|rationalist philosophy]]&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt; and underlies the [[waterfall model]],&lt;ref&gt;Royce 1970&lt;/ref&gt; [[systems development life cycle]],&lt;ref&gt;Bourque and Dupuis 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and much of the [[engineering design]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Pahl et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rationalist philosophy, design is informed by research and knowledge in a predictable and controlled manner.

====Example sequence of stages====
Typical stages consistent with the rational model include the following:
* Pre-production design
** [[Design brief]] or ''[[Parti pris]]''&amp;nbsp;– an early (often the beginning) statement of design goals
** [[Analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– analysis of current design goals
** [[Research]]&amp;nbsp;– investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics
** [[Specification]]&amp;nbsp;– specifying requirements of a design solution for a product ([[product design specification]])&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N., 2006. T211 Design and Designing: Block 2, p. 99. Milton Keynes: The Open University.&lt;/ref&gt; or service.
** [[Problem solving]]&amp;nbsp;– [[wikt:conceptualize|conceptualizing]] and [[document]]ing design solutions
** [[Presentation]]&amp;nbsp;– presenting design solutions
* Design during production
** [[Product development|Development]]&amp;nbsp;– continuation and improvement of a designed solution
** Testing&amp;nbsp;– ''[[in situ]]'' testing of a designed solution
* Post-production design feedback for future designs
** [[Implementation]]&amp;nbsp;– introducing the designed solution into the environment
** [[Evaluation]] and [[logical consequence|conclusion]]&amp;nbsp;– summary of process and results, including [[constructive criticism]] and suggestions for future improvements
* Redesign&amp;nbsp;– any or all stages in the design process repeated (with corrections made) at any time before, during, or after production.

Each stage has many associated [[best practices]].&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, David G. (2009) The Mechanical Design Process, Mc Graw Hill, 4th edition {{ISBN|0-07-297574-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of the rational model====
The rational model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds:

# Designers do not work this way&amp;nbsp;– extensive empirical evidence has demonstrated that designers do not act as the rational model suggests.&lt;ref name="Cross 1983"&gt;Cross et al. 1992; Ralph 2010; Schön 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
# Unrealistic assumptions&amp;nbsp;– goals are often unknown when a design project begins, and the requirements and constraints continue to change.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks 2010; McCracken and Jackson 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

===The action-centric model===
The action-centric perspective is a label given to a collection of interrelated concepts, which are antithetical to the rational model.&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt; It posits that:

# designers use [[creativity]] and [[emotion]] to generate design candidates,
# the design process is [[Improvisation|improvised]],
# no universal sequence of stages is apparent&amp;nbsp;– analysis, design and implementation are contemporary and inextricably linked&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt;

The action-centric perspective is based on an [[Empiricism|empiricist philosophy]] and broadly consistent with the [[Agile software development|agile approach]]&lt;ref&gt;Beck et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and amethodical development.&lt;ref&gt;Truex et al. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial empirical evidence supports the veracity of this perspective in describing the actions of real designers.&lt;ref name="Cross 1983"/&gt; Like the rational model, the action-centric model sees design as informed by research and knowledge. However, research and knowledge are brought into the design process through the judgment and common sense of designers&amp;nbsp;– by designers "thinking on their feet"&amp;nbsp;– more than through the predictable and controlled process stipulated by the rational model.

====Descriptions of design activities====
At least two views of design activity are consistent with the action-centric perspective. Both involve three basic activities.

In the [[Reflective practice|reflection-in-action paradigm]], designers alternate between "[[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]", "making moves", and "evaluating moves". "Framing" refers to conceptualizing the problem, i.e., defining goals and objectives. A "move" is a tentative design decision. The evaluation process may lead to further moves in the design.&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"/&gt;

In the sensemaking–coevolution–implementation framework, designers alternate between its three titular activities. [[Sensemaking (information science)|Sensemaking]] includes both framing and evaluating moves. Implementation is the process of constructing the design object. Coevolution is "the process where the design agent simultaneously refines its mental picture of the design object based on its mental picture of the context, and vice versa".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph 2010, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the [[design cycle]] is understood as a circular time structure,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Fischer: ''Design Enigma. A typographical metaphor for enigmatic processes, including designing'', in: T. Fischer, K. De Biswas, J.J. Ham, R. Naka, W.X. Huang, Beyond Codes and Pixels: Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia, p. 686&lt;/ref&gt; which may start with the thinking of an idea, then expressing it by the use of visual or verbal means of communication (design tools), the sharing and perceiving of the expressed idea, and finally starting a new cycle with the critical rethinking of the perceived idea. Anderson points out that this concept emphasizes the importance of the means of expression, which at the same time are means of perception of any design ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Anderson: ''Architectural Design'', Basics Architecture 03, Lausanne, AVA academia, 2011, {{ISBN|978-2-940411-26-9}}, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophies and studies of design==
There are countless philosophies for guiding design as design values and its accompanying aspects within modern design vary, both between different schools of thought{{which|date=February 2018}} and among practicing designers.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Design philosophies are usually for determining design goals. A design goal may range from solving the least significant individual problem of the smallest element, to the most [[holistic]] influential [[utopian]] goals. Design goals are usually for guiding design. However, conflicts over immediate and minor goals may lead to questioning the purpose of design, perhaps to set better long term or ultimate goals.  John Heskett, a 20th-century British writer on design claimed, "Design, stripped to its essence, can be defined as the human nature to shape and make our environment in ways without precedent in nature, to serve our needs and give meaning to our lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heskett|first1=John|title=Toothpicks and Logos: Design in Everyday Life|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophies for guiding design===
Design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. Reflections on [[material culture]] and environmental concerns ([[sustainable design]]) can guide a design philosophy. One example is the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]] which was launched within the graphic design community and states "We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication&amp;nbsp;– a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."&lt;ref name="maxbruinsma.nl"&gt;[http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm First Things First 2000 a design manifesto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219160927/http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm |date=2011-12-19 }}. manifesto published jointly by 33 signatories in: Adbusters, the AIGA journal, Blueprint, Emigre, Eye, Form, Items fall 1999/spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Sciences of the Artificial'' by polymath [[Herbert A. Simon]], the author asserts design to be a meta-discipline of all professions. "Engineers are not the only professional designers. Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so construed, is the core of all professional training; it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences. Schools of engineering, as well as schools of architecture, business, education, law, and medicine, are all centrally concerned with the process of design."&lt;ref name="Herbert A. Simon 1996"&gt;Simon (1996), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approaches to design===
A design approach is a general philosophy that may or may not include a guide for specific methods. Some are to guide the overall goal of the design. Other approaches are to guide the tendencies of the designer. A combination of approaches may be used if they don't conflict.

Some popular approaches include:
* [[Sociotechnical system]] design, a philosophy and tools for participative designing of work arrangements and supporting processes - for organizational purpose, quality, safety, economics and customer requirements in core work processes, the quality of peoples experience at work and the needs of society
* [[KISS principle]], (Keep it Simple Stupid), which strives to eliminate unnecessary complications.
* [[There is more than one way to do it]] (TIMTOWTDI), a philosophy to allow multiple methods of doing the same thing.
* [[Use-centered design]], which focuses on the goals and tasks associated with the use of the artifact, rather than focusing on the end user.
* [[User-centered design]], which focuses on the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user of the designed artifact.
* [[Critical design]] uses designed artifacts as an embodied critique or commentary on existing values, morals, and practices in a culture.
* [[Service design]] designing or organizing the experience around a product and the service associated with a product's use.
* [[Transgenerational design]], the practice of making products and environments compatible with those physical and sensory impairments associated with human aging and which limit major activities of daily living.
* Speculative design, the speculative design process doesn't necessarily define a specific problem to solve, but establishes a provocative starting point from which a design process emerges. The result is an evolution of fluctuating iteration and reflection using designed objects to provoke questions and stimulate discussion in academic and research settings.
* [[Participatory design|Participatory Design]] (originally co-operative design, now often co-design) is the practice of collective creativity to design, attempting to actively involve all stakeholders (e.g. employees, partners, customers, citizens, end users) in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable. Participatory design is an approach which is focused on processes and procedures of design and is not a design style&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://studiolab.ide.tudelft.nl/manila/gems/contextmapping/PreprintDraft.pdf|title=Co-creation and the new landscape of design|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of designing===
{{Main article|Design methods}}
Design methods is a broad area that focuses on:
* [[Exploring]] possibilities and constraints by focusing critical thinking skills to research and define problem spaces for existing [[Product (business)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]]—or the creation of new categories (see also [[Brainstorming]])
* [[Definition|Redefining]] the specifications of design solutions which can lead to better guidelines for traditional design activities (graphic, industrial, architectural, etc.);
* [[Management|Managing]] the process of exploring, defining, creating artifacts continually over time
* [[Prototyping]] possible scenarios, or solutions that incrementally or significantly improve the inherited situation
* Trendspotting; understanding the trend process.

==Terminology==
The word "design" is often considered ambiguous, as it is applied in varying contexts.
[[File:M-T4.jpg|thumb|166px|left|The new terminal at [[Barajas airport]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]]]

===Design and art===
Today, the term design is widely associated with the [[applied arts]] as initiated by [[Raymond Loewy]] and teachings at the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Ulm School of Design]] (HfG Ulm) in Germany during the 20th century.

The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications both for the term 'art' and the term 'design'. [[Applied arts]] has been used as an umbrella term to define fields of [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[fashion design]], etc. The term '[[decorative arts]]' is a traditional term used in historical discourses to describe craft objects, and also sits within the umbrella of [[applied arts]]. In [[graphic art]]s (2D image making that ranges from photography to illustration), the distinction is often made between [[fine art]] and [[commercial art]], based on the context within which the work is produced and how it is traded.

To a degree, some methods for creating work, such as employing intuition, are shared across the disciplines within the [[applied arts]] and [[fine art]]. Mark Getlein, writer, suggests the principles of design are "almost instinctive", "built-in", "natural", and part of "our sense of 'rightness'."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Getlein, ''Living With Art'', 8th ed. (New York: 2008) 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the intended application and context of the resulting works will vary greatly.

[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to design, with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]

===Design and engineering===
In [[engineering]], design is a component of the engineering process. Many overlapping methods and processes can be seen when comparing [[Product design]], [[Industrial design]] and [[Engineering]]. The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] defines design as: ''"To conceive or fashion in the mind; invent,"'' and ''"To formulate a plan"'', and defines engineering as: ''"The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems."''.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association (APA): [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/design design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108172005/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/design |date=2007-01-08 }}. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved January 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association (APA): [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/engineering engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102052421/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/engineering |date=2007-01-02 }}. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved January 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Both are forms of problem-solving with a defined distinction being the application of "scientific and mathematical principles". The increasingly scientific focus of engineering in practice, however, has raised the importance of more new "human-centered" fields of design.&lt;ref&gt;Faste 2001&lt;/ref&gt; How much science is applied in a design is a question of what is considered "[[science]]". Along with the question of what is considered science, there is [[social science]] versus [[natural science]]. Scientists at [[Xerox PARC]] made the distinction of design versus engineering at "moving minds" versus "moving atoms" (probably in contradiction to the origin of term "engineering - engineer" from Latin "in genio" in meaning of a "genius" what assumes existence of a "mind" not of an "atom").

[[File:Aluminium MacBook.png|thumb|166px|left|[[Jonathan Ive]] has received several awards for his design of [[Apple Inc.]] products like this MacBook. In some design fields, [[personal computer]]s are also used for both design and production]]

===Design and production===
The relationship between design and [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] is one of planning and executing. In theory, the plan should anticipate and compensate for potential problems in the execution process. Design involves problem-solving and [[creativity]]. In contrast, production involves a routine or pre-planned process. A design may also be a mere plan that does not include a production or engineering processes although a working knowledge of such processes is usually expected of designers. In some cases, it may be unnecessary or impractical to expect a designer with a broad [[multidisciplinary]] knowledge required for such designs to also have a detailed [[Division of labour|specialized]] knowledge of how to produce the product.

Design and production are intertwined in many [[creative professional]] careers, meaning problem-solving is part of execution and the reverse. As the cost of rearrangement increases, the need for separating design from production increases as well. For example, a high-budget project, such as a [[skyscraper]], requires separating (design) [[architect]]ure from (production) [[construction]]. A Low-budget project, such as a [[Multifunction printer|locally printed]] office party invitation [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]], can be rearranged and printed dozens of times at the low cost of a few sheets of paper, a few drops of ink, and less than one hour's pay of a [[desktop publishing|desktop publisher]].

This is not to say that production never involves problem-solving or creativity, nor that design always involves creativity. Designs are rarely perfect and are sometimes repetitive. The imperfection of a design may task a production position (e.g. [[production artist]], [[construction worker]]) with utilizing creativity or problem-solving skills to compensate for what was overlooked in the design process. Likewise, a design may be a simple repetition (copy) of a known preexisting solution, requiring minimal, if any, creativity or problem-solving skills from the designer.

===Process design===
{{See also|Business process management|Method engineering}}
"Process design" (in contrast to "design process" mentioned [[#Design as a process|above]]) refers to the planning of routine steps of a process aside from the expected result. Processes (in general) are treated as a product of design, not the method of design. The term originated with the industrial [[Process design (chemical engineering)|designing of]] [[chemical process]]es. With the increasing complexities of the [[information age]], consultants and executives have found the term useful to describe the [[Business process modeling|design of business processes]] as well as [[manufacturing|manufacturing processes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4086">'''Design Space Exploration''' (DSE) refers to systematic analysis and pruning of unwanted design points based on parameters of interest. While the term DSE can apply to any kind of system, we refer to electronic and embedded system design in this article.

Given the complex specification of electronic systems and the plethora of design choices ranging from the choice of components, number of components, operating modes of each of the components, connections between the components, choice of algorithm, etc.; design decisions need to be based on a systematic exploration process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pimentel|first1=Andy|title=Exploring Exploration: A Tutorial Introduction to Embedded Systems Design Space Exploration|journal=IEEE Design &amp; Test|date=Feb 2017|volume=34|issue=1|page=77-90|doi=10.1109/MDAT.2016.2626445|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738470}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the exploration process is complex because of a variety of ways in which the same functionality can be implemented. A tradeoff analysis between each of the implementation option based on a certain parameter of interest forms the basis of DSE. The parameter of interest could vary across systems, but the commonly used parameters are power, performance, and cost. Additional factors like size, shape, weight, etc. can be important for some handheld systems like cellphone and tablets. With growing usage of mobile devices, energy is also becoming a mainstream optimization parameter along with power and performance.

Owing to the complexity of the exploration process, researchers have proposed automated DSE where the exploration software is able to take decisions and comes up with the optimal solution. However, it is not possible to have an automated DSE for all kind of systems and hence there are semi-automated methods of DSE where the designer has to steer the tool after every iteration towards convergence. Since the exploration is a complex process which takes large computational time, researchers have developed exploration tools which can give an approximate analysis of the system behavior in a fraction of time compared to accurate analysis. Such tools are very important for quick comparison of design decisions and are becoming more important with increasing complexity of designs.

To simplify the complexity of DSE, researchers have been continuously striving to raise the abstractions of component and system definition to be able to cater to larger and complex systems. For example, instead of modeling a digital system at transistor or gate level, there have been attempts to use RTL or behavioral modeling. Further higher abstractions like SystemC or block diagram based modeling are also used depending on the system requirements. Modeling at higher abstractions allows fast exploration of various design choices for the lower level implementation.

The ability to operate on the space of design candidates makes DSE useful for many engineering tasks, such as rapid prototyping, optimization, and system integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2023014|title = An approach for effective design space exploration|last = Kang|first = Eunsuk|date = 2010|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = |series = FOCS'10 Proceedings of the 16th Monterey conference on Foundations of computer software: modeling, development, and verification of adaptive systems|isbn = 978-3-642-21291-8|last2 = Jackson|first2 = Ethan|last3 = Schulte|first3 = Wolfram|publisher = Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Experience''' is the [[knowledge]] or mastery of an event or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare various contemporary definitions given in the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] (2nd edition, 1989): "[...] 3. The actual [[observation]] of facts or events, considered as a source of knowledge.[...]  4. a. The fact of being consciously the subject of a state or condition, or of being consciously affected by an event. [...]  b. In religious use: A state of mind or feeling forming part of the inner religious life; the mental history (of a person) with regard to religious emotion. [...]  6. What has been experienced; the events that have taken place within the knowledge of an individual, a community, mankind at large, either during a particular period or generally. [...]  7. a. Knowledge resulting from actual observation or from what one has undergone. [...] 8. The state of having been occupied in any department of study or practice, in affairs generally, or in the intercourse of life; the extent to which, or the length of time during which, one has been so occupied; the aptitudes, skill, judgement, etc. thereby acquired."
&lt;/ref&gt; Terms in [[philosophy]] such as "[[empirical knowledge]]" or "''a posteriori'' knowledge" are used to refer to knowledge based on experience. A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an [[expert]]. The concept of experience generally refers to [[know-how]] or [[procedural knowledge]], rather than [[propositional knowledge]]: [[on-the-job training]] rather than book-learning.

The interrogation of experience has a long term tradition in continental philosophy. Experience plays an important role in the [[philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard]]. The [[German language|German]] term ''[[wiktionary:Erfahrung|Erfahrung]]'', often translated into English as "experience", has a slightly different implication, connoting the coherency of [[personal life|life]]'s experiences.

Certain [[religious]] [[traditions]] (such as [[Buddhism]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[mysticism]] and [[Pentecostalism]]) and educational [[paradigms]] with, for example, the [[physical exercise|conditioning]] of military [[recruit training|recruit-training]] (also known as "boot camps"), stress the experiential nature of human [[epistemology]]. This stands in contrast to alternatives: traditions of [[dogma]], [[logic]] or [[reason]]ing. Participants in activities such as [[tourism]], [[extreme sports]] and [[recreational drug use|recreational drug-use]] also tend to stress the importance of experience.

The history of the word ''experience'' aligns it closely with the concept of [[experiment]].

== Types of experience ==
The word "experience" may refer, somewhat ambiguously, both to [[mind|mentally]] unprocessed immediately perceived events as well as to the purported [[wisdom]] gained in subsequent reflection on those events or [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of them.

Some wisdom-experience accumulates over a period of [[time]],&lt;ref&gt;

though one can also experience (and gain general wisdom-experience from) a single specific momentary event.

One may also [[wikt:differentiate|differentiate]] between (for example) [[Human body|physical]], [[mind|mental]], [[emotional]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[wikt:vicarious|vicarious]] and [[virtual reality|virtual]] experience(s).

=== Physical ===

Physical experience occurs whenever an object or environment changes.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, physical experiences relate to [[observable]]s. They need not involve [[modal property|modal properties]] nor [[Mind|mental experiences]].

=== Mental ===
{{Main|Mind}}

Mental experience involves the aspect of [[intellect]] and [[consciousness]] experienced as combinations of [[thought]], [[perception]], [[memory]], [[emotion]], [[free will|will]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and [[imagination]], including all unconscious [[cognitive]] processes. The term can refer, by implication, to a thought process. Mental experience and its relation to the physical brain form an area of philosophical debate: some identity theorists originally argued that the identity of brain and mental states held only for a few sensations. Most theorists, however, generalized the view to cover all mental experience.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematicians]] can exemplify cumulative mental experience in the approaches and skills with which they work. [[Mathematical realism]], like realism in general, holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover and experience it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. This point of view regards only one sort of mathematics as discoverable; it sees triangles, right angles, and curves, for example, as real entities, not just the creations of the human mind. Some working mathematicians have espoused mathematical realism as they see themselves experiencing naturally occurring objects. Examples include [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]. Gödel believed in an objective mathematical reality that could be perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (for example: for any two objects, there is a collection of objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but some conjectures, like the [[continuum hypothesis]], might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. Gödel suggested that quasi-empirical methodology such as experience could provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture. With experience, there are distinctions depending on what sort of existence one takes mathematical entities to have, and how we know about them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

=== Emotional ===
{{Main|Emotion}}

Humans can rationalize [[falling in love|falling in (and out) of love]] as "emotional experience". Societies which lack institutional arranged marriages can call on emotional experience in individuals to influence [[mate selection|mate-selection]].&lt;ref&gt;

People can likewise achieve such experiences more deliberately through recognized [[mystical practice]]s such as [[sensory deprivation]] or [[mind control|mind-control]] techniques, [[hypnosis]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], or [[mystical discipline]]s such as [[mantra meditation]], [[yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[dream yoga]], or [[surat shabd yoga|surat shabda yoga]]. Some practices encourage [[spiritual experience]]s through the ingestion of [[psychoactive drug]]s such as alcohol and opiates, but more commonly with [[entheogen]]ic plants and substances such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], ''[[salvia divinorum]]'', [[psilocybin]] mushrooms, [[peyote]], [[Dextromethorphan|DXM]], [[ayahuasca]], or ''[[datura]]''. Another way to induce spiritual experience through an altered state of consciousness involves [[psychoacoustics]], [[binaural beats]], or light-and-sound stimulation.

[[Role-playing game]]s treat "experience" (and its acquisition) as an important, measurable, and valuable commodity. Many [[role-playing video game]]s, for instance, feature units of measurement used to quantify or assist a player-character's progression through the game - called [[experience point]]s or XP.

=== Subjective ===

Subjective experience can involve a state of [[individual]] [[subjectivity]], [[perception]] on which one builds one's own state of [[reality]]; a reality based on one’s [[interaction]] with one's environment. The ''subjective'' ''experience'' depends on one’s [[individual]] ability to process [[data]], to store and [[internalize]] it. For example: our senses collect data, which we then process according to [[biological]] programming (genetics), [[neurological]] network-relationships and other variables such as [[Cultural relativity|relativity]] etc.,{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} all of which affect our individual experience of any given situation in such a way as to render it subjective.

== Immediacy of experience ==

Someone able to recount an event they witnessed or took part in has "[[wikt:firsthand|first hand]] experience". First hand experience of the "you had to be there" variety can seem especially valuable and privileged, but it often remains potentially subject to errors in [[sense]]-[[perception]] and in personal [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]].

[[Second hand|Second-hand]] experience can offer richer resources: recorded and/or summarised from first-hand observers or experiencers or from instruments, and potentially expressing multiple [[Perspective (cognitive)|points of view]].

Third-hand experience, based on indirect and possibly unreliable [[rumour]] or [[hearsay]], can (even given reliable accounts) potentially stray perilously close to blind honouring of [[authority]].

== Changes through history ==

Some [[post-modernism|post-modernist]]s suggest that the nature of human experiencing (quite apart from the details of the experienced surrounds) has undergone qualitative change during transition from the pre-modern through the [[modernity|modern]] to the [[post-modernity|post-modern]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== Alternatives to experience ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] contrasted experience with [[reason]]:
:"Nothing, indeed, can be more harmful or more unworthy of the philosopher, than the vulgar appeal to so-called experience. Such experience would never have existed at all, if at the proper time, those institutions had been established in accordance with ideas."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

These views of Kant are mirrored in the research of [[ideasthesia]], which demonstrates that one can experience the world only if one has the appropriate concepts (i.e., the ''ideas'') about the objects that are being experienced.

=== Writing ===
American author [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote an essay entitled "[[Experience (Emerson)|Experience]]" (published in 1844), in which he asks readers to disregard [[emotion]]s that could alienate them from the divine; it provides a somewhat [[pessimism|pessimistic]] representation of the [[transcendentalism]] associated with Emerson.

[[File:Blast Area Security.webm|thumb|A video on safety when using explosives in the workplace]]
'''Explosives safety''' originated as a formal program in the [[United States]] in the aftermath of [[World War I]] when several ammunition storage areas were destroyed in a series of mishaps. The most serious occurred at [[Picatinny Arsenal Ammunition Storage Depot]], New Jersey, in July, 1926 when an electrical storm led to fires that caused explosions and widespread destruction. The severe property damage and 19 fatalities led Congress to empower a board of Army and Naval officers to investigate the Picatinny Arsenal disaster and determine if similar conditions existed at other ammunition depots. The board reported in its findings that this mishap could recur, prompting [[United States Congress|Congress]] to establish a permanent board of colonels to develop explosives safety standards and ensure compliance beginning in 1928. This organization evolved into the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) and is chartered in Title 10 of the US Code. Today, the DDESB authors DOD Manual 6055.9, Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards. It also evaluates scientific data which may adjust those standards, reviews and approves all explosives site plans for new construction, and conducts worldwide visits to locations containing US title munitions.

==US Air Force==
The [[United States Air Force]] counterpart to the DDESB is the [[Air Force Safety Center]] (AFSEC/SEW). Similarly safety functions are found at major command headquarters, intermediate command headquarters and at unit level as the weapons safety office. Quantity-Distance (QD) has evolved into the foundation of DOD 6055.9-STD, Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards.  The current Air Force regulation governing explosives safety is Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 91-201.  AFMAN 91-201 was written using DODI 6055.9 as a parent regulation, and in most cases will follow the limitations set forth in the DODI (excluding mission specific requirements).  The Air Force deviates from DODI 6055.9 using AFMAN 91-201 as their primary source document to allow for deviation from many of the requirements of the DODI as long as the risks of doing so are accepted at the appropriate level.

==US Army==
The [[United States Army]] counterpart to the DDESB is the U.S. Army Technical Center for Explosives Safety (USATCES). The USATCES is located with the [[Defense Ammunition Center (United States)|Defense Ammunition Center]] on [[McAlester Army Ammunition Plant]], near McAlester, Oklahoma . USATCES is responsible for providing ammunition and explosives (A&amp;E) safety worldwide by acting as the field office of the Department of Army Safety responsible for A&amp;E safety. The USATCES also acts as the Army agency having safety oversight of clean-up of [[Formerly Used Defense Sites|Former Used Defense Sites (FUDS)]]&lt;ref&gt;1 [http://www.azdeq.gov/environ/waste/sps/download/state/fuds.pdf azdeq.gov] retrieved 2011-11-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2 [https://environment.usace.army.mil/what_we_do/fuds/ U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).] retrieved 2011-11-23&lt;/ref&gt; and Former Toxic Chemical Agent Sites where munitions from all branches of service disposed of A&amp;E by burial or dumping up until the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. The USATCES acts as the Army’s safety watchdog for disposal of chemical ammunition at the Army’s Chemical Disposal Facilities. As part of Army's Ordinance Corps under TRADOC Specially trained Civilian Explosives Safety Personnel [Quality Assurance Specialist (Ammunition Surveillance) (QASAS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r702_12.pdf apd.army.mil] retrieved 2011-11-23&lt;/ref&gt;]  and Safety Specialist that have received specialized training in A&amp;E Safety) from the USATCES are deployed worldwide, wherever the U.S. Army has A&amp;E. Their mission is to provide A&amp;E safety to the soldier, the public, and the environment making sure the Army’s A&amp;E is not only stored safely but ready, reliable, and lethal when the U.S. military needs it.

==Net Explosives Weight (NEW)==
The net explosives weight (NEW) (or TNT Equivalence) is based on explosives compounds that are equal to one  expressed by the value of “K,” using the terminology K9, K11, K18, to mean K = 9, K = 11, and K = 18.

==Blast Wave Phenomena==
A Blast Wave Phenomenon is an incident involving the violent release of energy created by detonation of an explosive device. The sudden and intense pressure disturbance is termed the “blast wave.” The blast wave is characterized by an almost instantaneous rise from ambient pressure to a peak incident pressure (Pi). This pressure increase or “shock front,” travels radially outward from the detonation point, with a diminishing velocity that is always in excess of the speed of sound in that medium. Gas molecules making up the front move at lower velocities. This velocity, which is called the “particle velocity,” is associated with the “dynamic pressure,” or the pressure formed by the winds produced by the shock front. As the shock front expands into increasingly larger volumes of the medium, the incident pressure decreases and, generally, the duration of the pressure-pulse increase. If the shock wave strikes a rigid surface (e.g., a building) at an angle to the direction of the wave’s propagation, a reflected pressure is instantly developed on the surface and this pressure rises to a value that exceeds the incident pressure. This reflected pressure is a function of the incident wave’s pressure and the angle formed between the rigid surface and the plane of the shock front.

==Fragments==
An important consideration in the analysis of the hazards associated with an explosion is the effect of any fragments produced. Fragmentation most commonly occur in high explosives events, fragmentation may occur in any incident involving ammunition and explosives (A&amp;E). Depending on their origin, fragments are referred to as “primary” or “secondary” fragments.

Primary fragments result from the shattering of a container (e.g., shell casings, kettles, hoppers, and other containers used in the manufacture of explosives and rocket engine housings) in direct contact with the explosive. These fragments usually are small, initially travel at thousands of feet per second, and may be lethal at long distances from an explosion.

Secondary fragments are debris from structures and other items in close proximity to the explosion. These fragments, which are somewhat larger in size than primary fragments and initially travel at hundreds of feet per second, do not normally travel as far as primary fragments.

==Thermal Hazards==
Generally, thermal hazards from explosives events are of less concern than blast and fragment hazards. With the release of energy from an explosion is heat. The amount of heat varies with the energetic compound (explosive). All explosives compound molecules are potentially unstable held together with weak bonds in their outer shell. When this weak bond is broken heat and energy is violently released. It normally takes longer for the thermal blast to incur. Injury from thermal effects follows the blast and fragmentation effects which happen almost instantaneously.  This does not imply that there is a time lapse between blast and fragmentation effects of explosives; in fact it happens so fast that humans cannot notice the delay without specialized equipment.  The time available to react to a thermal event does increases survivability by rapid equipment designed to react in a fragment of a second. The primary effect of the thermal effect from an explosive detonation on structures, material, and ammunition and explosives (A&amp;E) is their partial or total destruction by fire. The primary concern for explosives safety with a fire involving A&amp;E is that it may transition to a more severe reaction, causing detonations of additional or more hazardous explosives devises and placing more people or property at a greater degree of risk of damage, destruction, injury, or death.

==Susan Test==
{{redirect|Susan Test|the ''Johnny Test'' character|List of Johnny Test characters#Susan and Mary Test}}
Following the [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash]] and the [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash]], accident investigators concluded that the conventional explosives used at the time in nuclear weapons were not [[Chemical stability|stable]] enough to withstand the forces involved in an [[aircraft]] accident.  The finding triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives that could be used in nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l77rP6LA8TEC|title=Explosive Effects and Applications|author=Jonas A. Zukas, William P. Walters|pages=305–307|isbn=0-387-95558-5|publisher=Springer|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] developed the "Susan Test" — a standard test that uses a special projectile whose design simulates an aircraft accident by squeezing and nipping explosive material between metal surfaces.  The test projectile is fired under controlled conditions at a hard surface to measure the reactions and thresholds of different explosives to an impact.

==Explosives Safety Specialist==
This is a highly trained and skilled civilian professional usually a QASAS or a Safety Specialist that has been trained to evaluate risk and hazards involved with conventional, guided missiles and toxic chemical ammunition operations. Department of Defense Standards requires that only trained and certified personnel are permitted to participate in operations involving ammunition, explosives, and/or explosive components, guided missiles, and toxic chemicals. They are responsible for providing protection from the effects of ammunition and explosives by evaluation of a set of standards developed by the Department of Defense and reinforced by additional regulations by the branch of military service responsible for the explosives item. 
They develop safety programs to minimize losses due to injuries and property damage. They try to eliminate unsafe practices and conditions on sites where ammunition and explosives (A&amp;E) are used or stored. Military explosives safety specialist are deployed along with U.S. Military forces to maintain safe storage and use of A&amp;E.   They are responsible to recommend to military command ways to store A&amp;E that reduce the risk of injury or death to service men and women in case of an accidental detonation or if the A&amp;E supply is hit by enemy attack.  
 
Much of the work of military explosives safety specialist is identical to their civilian counterparts. They have offices where they analyze data and write reports to upper commands on the storage of A&amp;E.  Much of their time is spent reviewing or preparing explosives safety site plans. An explosives site plan (ESS) is the composite risk management (CRM) process associated with explosives/toxic chemical activities to ensure the minimum risk to personnel, equipment, and assets, while meeting mission requirements. The damage or injury potential of explosions is determined by the separation distance between potential explosion sites (PES) and exposed sites (ES); the ability of the PES to suppress blast overpressure, primary and secondary fragments; and the ability of the ES to resist explosion effects. Planning for the proper location and construction of A&amp;E facilities and surrounding facilities exposed to A&amp;E facilities is a key element of the explosives/toxic chemical site planning process. This management process also ensures that risks above those normally accepted for A&amp;E activities are identified and approved at the proper level of command.

Explosives Safety Specialist must often travel to different storage sites to verify that the military installation is meeting the service explosives safety regulations.

Explosives Safety Specialist often works with other safety professionals. They are required to know OSHA, EPA, NFPA and other consensus standards when looking at safety and if these regulations are stricter than their service regulation they must apply these standards and regulations. They must also know Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) regulations dealing with A&amp;E and apply those standards if it is required.  They must be able to convince people the need for following prescribes explosives safety standards/regulations. They must also work with ammunition cleanup sites insuring that safety laws and regulations as well as industry standards are followed. They should be good at solving problems.

The military is not the only industry to use explosives safety specialist but are by far the largest employer.  Mining and construction also use explosives safety specialist to evaluate hazard and risk from explosives and blasting operations. Ammunition and explosives manufactures also use these professionals. Outside the military explosives safety specialist must apply and be knowledgeable of ATF, OSHA, EPA, NFPA, as well as state and local regulations dealing with safety of A&amp;E.

'''''Fahrenheit 451''''' is a [[dystopia]]n novel by American writer [[Ray Bradbury]], first published in 1953. It is regarded as one of his best works.&lt;ref name=reid_p53_1&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Robin Anne|title=Ray Bradbury: A Critical Companion|series=Critical Companions to Popular Contemporary Writers|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-313-30901-9|page=53|quote=''Fahrenheit 451'' is considered one of Bradbury's best works.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel presents a future American society where books are outlawed and "firemen" burn any that are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seed|first=David |title=A Companion to Science Fiction|series=Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture|volume=34|publisher=Blackwell Publications|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-1218-5|pages=491–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's tagline explains the title: "[[Fahrenheit]] 451 – the temperature at which [[book paper]] catches fire, and burns..." The lead character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who becomes disillusioned with his role of censoring literature and destroying knowledge, eventually quitting his job and committing himself to the preservation of literary and cultural writings.

The novel has been the subject of interpretations focusing on the historical role of [[book burning]] in suppressing dissenting ideas.

==Plot summary==

''Fahrenheit 451'' is set in an unspecified city (likely in the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]]) in the year 1999 (according to Ray Bradbury’s Coda), though it is written as if set in a distant future.&lt;ref group=note&gt;During Captain Beatty's recounting of the history of the firemen to Montag, he says, "Out of the nursery into the college and back to the nursery; there's your intellectual pattern for the past five centuries or more." The text is ambiguous regarding which century he is claiming began this pattern. One interpretation is that he means the 20th century, which would place the novel in at least the 24th century. "The Fireman" novella, which was expanded to become ''Fahrenheit 451'', is set in October 2052.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest editions make clear that it takes place no earlier than the year 1960.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In early editions of the book, Montag says, "We've started and won two [[Nuclear warfare|atomic wars]] since 1960", in the first pages of ''The Sieve and the Sand''. This sets a lower bound on the time setting. In later decades, some editions have changed this year to 1990 or 2022.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reid_p59_1&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Robin Anne|title=Ray Bradbury: A Critical Companion|series=Critical Companions to Popular Contemporary Writers|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-313-30901-9|page=53|quote=''Fahrenheit 451'' is set in an unnamed city in the United States, possibly in the Midwest, in some undated future.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Greasley|editor-first=Philip A.|author=Society for the Study of Midwestern Literature|title=Dictionary of Midwestern Literature|volume=1, The Authors|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253336095|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZnuYKJSoHCMC&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=%22Fahrenheit%20451%20is%20not%20set%20in%20any%20specific%20locale%22&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fahrenheit%20451%20is%20not%20set%20in%20any%20specific%20locale%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 5, 2014|page=78|quote=''Fahrenheit 451'' is not set in any specific locale...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel is divided into three parts: "The Hearth and the Salamander", "The Sieve and the Sand", and "Burning Bright".

==="The Hearth and the Salamander"===

[[Guy Montag]] is a "fireman" employed to burn the possessions of those who read outlawed books. He is married but has no children. One fall night while returning from work, he meets his new neighbor, a teenage girl named Clarisse McClellan, whose free-thinking ideals and liberating spirit cause him to question his life and his own perceived happiness. Montag returns home to find that his wife Mildred has overdosed on sleeping pills, and he calls for medical attention. Two uncaring [[Emergency medical technician|EMTs]] pump Mildred's stomach, drain her poisoned blood, and fill her with new blood. After the EMTs leave to rescue another overdose victim, Montag goes outside and overhears Clarisse and her family talking about the way life is in this hedonistic, illiterate society. Montag's mind is bombarded with Clarisse's subversive thoughts and the memory of his wife's near-death. Over the next few days, Clarisse faithfully meets Montag each night as he walks home. She tells him about how her simple pleasures and interests make her an outcast among her peers and how she is forced to go to therapy for her behavior and thoughts. Montag looks forward to these meetings, and just as he begins to expect them, Clarisse goes missing. He senses something is wrong.&lt;ref name=koster_p35&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=De Koster|editor-first=Katie|title=Readings on Fahrenheit 451|year=2000|series=Literary Companion Series|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=1-56510-857-4|page=35|quote=Montag does not realize at first that she is gone, or that he misses her; he simply feels that something is the matter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following days, while at work with the other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice. The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and [[self-immolation|burn herself alive]]. Jarred by the woman's suicide, Montag returns home and hides the stolen book under his pillow. Later, Montag wakes Mildred from her sleep and asks her if she has seen or heard anything about Clarisse McClellan. She reveals that Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse was hit by a speeding car and died four days ago. Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of "The Mechanical Hound", an eight-legged&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=De Koster|editor-first=Katie|title=Readings on Fahrenheit 451|year=2000|series=Literary Companion Series|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=1-56510-857-4|page=32|quote=The Mechanical Hound is an eight-legged glass and metal contraption that serves as a surveillance tool and programmable killing machine for the firemen, who use it to track down suspected book hoarders and readers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen in hunting book hoarders.

Montag awakens ill the next morning. Mildred tries to care for her husband but finds herself more involved in the "parlor wall" entertainment in the living room – large televisions filling the walls. Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night, and Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall "family". Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing his concerns, Beatty recounts the history of how books lost their value and how the firemen were adapted for their current role: over the course of several decades, people began to embrace new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and an ever-quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate short [[attention span]]s while minority groups protested the controversial, outdated content they perceived in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines remained, as these fed into the mainstream population's desire for mindless entertainment). At the same time, advances in technology resulted in nearly all buildings being made out of fireproof materials, and the traditional role of firemen in preventing fires was no longer necessary. The government instead turned the firemen into officers of society's peace of mind: instead of putting out fires they became responsible for starting them, specifically for the purpose of burning books, which were condemned as sources of confusing and depressing thoughts that only complicated people's lives. After an awkward encounter between Millie and Montag over the book hidden under Montag's pillow, Beatty becomes suspicious and casually adds a passing threat as he leaves, telling Montag that if a fireman had a book, he would be asked to burn it within the next 24 hours. If he refused, the other firemen would come and burn his house down for him. The encounter leaves Montag shaken.

After Beatty leaves, Montag reveals to Mildred that, over the last year, he has accumulated a stash of books that he has kept hidden in the air-conditioning duct in their ceiling. In a panic, Mildred grabs a book and rushes to throw it in the kitchen incinerator. Montag subdues her and tells her that the two of them are going to read the books to see if they have value. If they do not, he promises the books will be burned and all will return to normal.

==="The Sieve and the Sand"===

Montag and Mildred discuss the stolen books, and Mildred refuses to go along with it, questioning why she or anyone else should care about books. Montag goes on a rant about Mildred's suicide attempt, Clarisse's disappearance and death, the old woman who burned herself, and the imminent threat of war that goes ignored by the masses. He suggests that perhaps the books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction. The conversation is interrupted by a call from Mildred's friend, Mrs. Bowles, and they set up a date to watch the "parlor walls" that night at Mildred's house.

Montag concedes that Mildred is a lost cause and he will need help to understand the books. He remembers an old man named Faber, an English professor before books were banned, whom he once met in a park. Montag makes a subway trip to Faber's home along with a rare copy of the [[Bible]], the book he stole at the woman's house. Once there, Montag forces the scared and reluctant Faber into helping him by methodically ripping pages from the Bible. Faber concedes and gives Montag a homemade ear-piece communicator so he can offer constant guidance.

At home, Mildred's friends, Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Phelps, arrive to watch the "parlor walls". Not interested in this insipid entertainment, Montag turns off the walls and tries to engage the women in meaningful conversation, only for them to reveal just how indifferent, ignorant, and callous they truly are. Enraged by their idiocy, Montag leaves momentarily and returns with a book of poetry. This confuses the women and alarms Faber, who is listening remotely. Mildred tries to dismiss Montag's actions as a tradition firemen act out once a year: they find an old book and read it as a way to make fun of how silly the past is. Montag proceeds to recite the poem ''[[Dover Beach]]'', causing Mrs. Phelps to cry. At the behest of Faber in the ear-piece, Montag burns the book. Mildred's friends leave in disgust, while Mildred takes more sleeping pills.

Montag hides his books in the backyard before returning to the firehouse late at night with just the stolen Bible. He finds Beatty playing cards with the other firemen. Montag hands Beatty a book to cover for the one he believes Beatty knows he stole the night before, which is unceremoniously tossed into the trash. Beatty tells Montag that he had a dream in which they fought endlessly by quoting books to each other. Thus Beatty reveals that, despite his disillusionment, he was once an enthusiastic reader. A fire alarm sounds, and Beatty picks up the address from the dispatcher system. They drive recklessly in the fire truck to the destination: Montag's house.

==="Burning Bright"===

Beatty orders Montag to destroy his own house, telling him that his wife and her friends reported him after what happened the other night. Montag watches as Mildred walks out of the house, too traumatized about losing her parlor wall family to even acknowledge her husband's existence or the situation going on around her, and catches a taxi. Montag obeys the chief, destroying the home piece by piece with a [[flamethrower]], but Beatty discovers Montag's ear-piece and plans to hunt down Faber. Montag threatens Beatty with the flamethrower and, after Beatty taunts him, burns his boss alive and knocks his coworkers unconscious. As Montag escapes the scene, the Mechanical Hound attacks him, managing to inject his leg with a tranquilizer. He destroys the Hound with the flamethrower and limps away. Before he escapes, however, he realizes that Beatty had wanted to die a long time ago and had purposely goaded Montag as well as provided him with a weapon.

Montag runs through the city streets towards Faber's house. Faber urges him to make his way to the countryside and contact the exiled [[Bibliophiles|book-lovers]] who live there. He mentions he will be leaving on an early bus heading to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and that he and Montag can rendezvous there later. On Faber's television, they watch news reports of another Mechanical Hound being released, with news helicopters following it to create a public spectacle. After wiping his scent from around the house in hopes of thwarting the Hound, Montag leaves Faber's house. He escapes the manhunt by wading into a river and floating downstream. Montag leaves the river in the countryside, where he meets the exiled drifters, led by a man named Granger. Granger shows Montag the ongoing manhunt on a portable battery TV and predicts that “Montag” will be caught within the next few minutes; as predicted, an innocent man is then caught and killed.

The drifters are all former intellectuals. They have each memorized books should the day arrive that society comes to an end and is forced to rebuild itself anew, with the survivors learning to embrace the literature of the past. Granger asks Montag what he has to contribute to the group and Montag finds that he had partially memorized the [[Ecclesiastes|Book of Ecclesiastes]]. While learning the philosophy of the exiles, Montag and the group watch helplessly as bombers fly overhead and annihilate the city with nuclear weapons: the imminent war has begun and ended in the same night. While Faber would have left on the early bus, everyone else (including Mildred) is immediately killed. Montag and the group are injured and dirtied, but manage to survive the shockwave.

The following morning, Granger teaches Montag and the others about the legendary [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and its endless cycle of long life, death in flames, and rebirth. He adds that the phoenix must have some relationship to mankind, which constantly repeats its mistakes, but explains that man has something the phoenix does not: mankind can remember its mistakes and try never to repeat them. Granger then muses that a large factory of mirrors should be built so that people can take a long look at themselves and reflect on their lives. When the meal is over, the exiles return to the city to rebuild society.

==Characters==

*'''[[Guy Montag]]''' is the [[protagonist]] and a fireman who presents the dystopian world in which he lives first through the eyes of a worker loyal to it, then as a man in conflict about it, and eventually as someone resolved to be free of it. Through most of the book, Montag lacks knowledge and believes only what he hears.
*'''Clarisse McClellan''' is a young girl one month short of her 17th birthday who is Montag's neighbor. She walks with Montag on his trips home from work.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Clarisse tells Montag she is "seventeen and crazy", later admitting that she will actually be seventeen "next month".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=koster_p31&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=De Koster|editor-first=Katie|title=Readings on Fahrenheit 451|year=2000|series=Literary Companion Series|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=1-56510-857-4|page=31|quote=Montag's new neighbor, the sixteen-year-old Clarisse, appears in only a few scenes at the beginning of the novel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is an unusual sort of person compared to the others inhabiting the bookless, hedonistic society: outgoing, naturally cheerful, unorthodox, and intuitive. She is unpopular among peers and disliked by teachers for asking "why" instead of "how" and focusing on nature rather than on technology. A few days after her first meeting with Montag, she disappears without any explanation; Mildred tells Montag (and Captain Beatty confirms) that Clarisse was hit by a speeding car and that her family moved away following her death. In the afterword of a later edition, Bradbury notes that the film adaptation changed the ending so that Clarisse (who, in the film, is now a 20-year-old schoolteacher who was fired for being unorthodox) was living with the exiles. Bradbury, far from being displeased by this, was so happy with the new ending that he wrote it into his later stage edition.
*'''Mildred "Millie" Montag''' is Guy Montag's wife. She is addicted to sleeping pills, absorbed in the shallow dramas played on her "parlor walls" (flat-panel televisions), and indifferent to the oppressive society around her. She is described in the book as "thin as a [[praying mantis]] from dieting, her hair burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw, and her flesh like white bacon." Despite her husband's attempts to break her from the spell society has on her, Mildred continues to be shallow and indifferent. After Montag scares her friends away by reading ''Dover Beach'', and finding herself unable to live with someone who has been hoarding books, Mildred betrays Montag by reporting him to the firemen and abandoning him, and dies when the city is bombed.
*'''Captain Beatty''' is Montag's boss and the book's main antagonist. Once an avid reader, he has come to hate books due to their unpleasant content and contradicting facts and opinions. After attempting to force Montag to burn his house, Montag kills him with a flamethrower, only to later realize that Beatty had given him the flamethrower and goaded him on purpose so that Montag would kill him. However, it is still unclear whether or not Beatty was ever on Montag's side, or if he was just suicidal. In a scene written years later by Bradbury for the ''Fahrenheit 451'' play, Beatty invites Montag to his house where he shows him walls of books left to molder on their shelves.
*'''Stoneman '''and '''Black''' are Montag's coworkers at the firehouse. They do not have a large impact on the story and function only to show the reader the contrast between the firemen who obediently do as they are told and someone like Montag, who formerly took pride in his job but subsequently realizes how damaging it is to society. Black is later framed by Montag for possessing books.
*'''Faber''' is a former English professor. He has spent years regretting that he did not defend books when he saw the moves to ban them. Montag turns to him for guidance, remembering him from a chance meeting in a park sometime earlier. Faber at first refuses to help Montag, and later realizes Montag is only trying to learn about books, not destroy them. He secretly communicates with Montag through an electronic ear-piece and helps Montag escape the city, then gets on a bus to [[St. Louis]] and escapes the city himself before it is bombed. Bradbury notes in his afterword that Faber is part of the name of a German manufacturer of pencils, [[Faber-Castell]].
*'''Mrs. Ann Bowles '''and '''Mrs. Clara Phelps''' are Mildred's friends and representative of the anti-intellectual, hedonistic mainstream society presented in the novel. During a social visit to Montag's house, they brag about ignoring the bad things in their lives and have a cavalier attitude towards the upcoming war, their husbands, their children, and politics. Mrs. Phelps' husband Pete was called in to fight in the upcoming war (and believes that he'll be back in a week because of how quick the war will be) and thinks having children serves no purpose other than to ruin lives. Mrs. Bowles is a thrice-married single mother. Her first husband divorced her, her second died in a jet accident, and her third committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. She has two children who do not like or respect her due to her permissive, often negligent and abusive parenting; Mrs. Bowles brags that her kids beat her up, and she's glad she can hit back. When Montag reads ''Dover Beach'' to them, he strikes a chord in Mrs. Phelps, who starts crying over how hollow her life is. Mrs. Bowles chastises Montag for reading "silly awful hurting words".
*'''Granger''' is the leader of a group of wandering intellectual exiles who memorize books in order to preserve their contents.

==Historical context==

Bradbury's lifelong passion for books began at an early age. After graduating from high school, Bradbury's family could not afford for him to attend college so Bradbury began spending time at the Los Angeles Public Library where he essentially educated himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Orelan |first1=Susan |title=The Library Book |date=2018 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4767-4018-8 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a frequent visitor to his local libraries in the 1920s and 1930s, he recalls being disappointed because they did not stock popular science fiction novels, like those of [[H. G. Wells]], because, at the time, they were not deemed literary enough. Between this and learning about the destruction of the [[Library of Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cusatis|first=John|title=Research Guide to American Literature: Postwar Literature 1945–1970|series=Facts on File Library of American Literature|volume=6|year=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4381-3405-5|edition=New|quote=He 'wept' when he learned at the age of nine that the ancient library of Alexandria had been burned.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a great impression was made on the young man about the vulnerability of books to censure and destruction.

So, it became very personal, didn't it? Then I found out about Russia burning the books behind the scenes. But they did it in such a way that people didn't know about it. They killed the authors behind the scenes. They burned the authors instead of the books. So I learned then how {{sic|dangerously}} it all was.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For further details on the history of book burning, see [[Bonfire of the vanities]].

Shortly after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] at the conclusion of [[World War II]], the United States focused its concern on the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] and the expansion of [[communism]]. The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC), formed in 1938 to investigate American citizens and organizations suspected of having communist ties, held hearings in 1947 to investigate alleged communist influence in Hollywood movie-making. These hearings resulted in the [[blacklisting]] of the so-called "[[Hollywood Ten]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Ken|title=Playboy Interview: Ray Bradbury|url=http://www.raybradbury.com/articles_playboy.html|work=[[Playboy]]|publisher=raybradbury.com|date=May 1996|quote=In the movie business the [[Hollywood Ten]] were sent to prison for refusing to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], and in the [[Screen Writers Guild]] Bradbury was one of the lonely voices opposing the loyalty oath imposed on its members.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group of influential screenwriters and directors.

'I was angry about the blacklisting and the Hollywood 10. I was a $100 a week screenwriter, but I wasn't scared—I was angry.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury was bitter and concerned about the workings of his government, and a late 1949 nighttime encounter with an overzealous police officer would inspire Bradbury to write "[[The Pedestrian]]", a short story which would go on to become "The Fireman" and then ''Fahrenheit 451''. The rise of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s [[McCarthyism|hearings hostile to accused communists]], beginning in 1950, deepened Bradbury's contempt for government overreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beley|first=Gene|title=Ray Bradbury Uncensored!: The Unauthorized Biography|date=2006|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595373642|pages=130–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eller|first1=Jonathan R.|last2=Touponce|first2=William F.|title=Ray Bradbury: The Life of Fiction|date=2004|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=9780873387798|pages=164–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year&lt;!--1947--&gt; HUAC began investigating Hollywood is often considered the beginning of the [[Cold War]], as in March 1947, the [[Truman Doctrine]] was announced. By about 1950, the Cold War was in full swing, and the American public's fear of [[nuclear warfare]] and communist influence was at a feverish level. The stage was set for Bradbury to write the dramatic [[nuclear holocaust]] ending of ''Fahrenheit 451'', exemplifying the type of scenario feared by many Americans of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendershot|first=Cynthia|title=Paranoia, the Bomb, and 1950s Science Fiction Films|date=1999|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=9780879727994|page=127|quote=Even if many 1950s [[Science fiction film|sf films]] seem comic to us today, they register the immediacy of the nuclear threat for their original audiences.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury's early life witnessed the [[Golden Age of Radio]], while the transition to the [[Golden Age of Television]] began right around the time he started to work on the stories that would eventually lead to ''Fahrenheit 451''. Bradbury saw these forms of media as a threat to the reading of books, indeed as a threat to society, as he believed they could act as a distraction from important affairs. This contempt for [[mass media]] and technology would express itself through Mildred and her friends and is an important theme in the book.&lt;ref name=reidmildred&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Robin Anne|title=Ray Bradbury: A Critical Companion|series=Critical Companions to Popular Contemporary Writers|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-313-30901-9|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvMEoM8gu74C&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=Fahrenheit%20451%20%20mildred&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and development==

''Fahrenheit 451'' developed out of a series of ideas Bradbury had visited in previously written stories. For many years, he tended to single out "The Pedestrian" in interviews and lectures as sort of a proto-''Fahrenheit 451''. In the Preface of his 2006 anthology ''Match to Flame: The Fictional Paths to Fahrenheit 451'' he states that this is an oversimplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Ray|authorlink=Ray Bradbury|editor1-last=Albright|editor1-first=Donn|editor2-last=Eller|editor2-first=Jon|title=Match to Flame: The Fictional Paths to Fahrenheit 451|year=2006|publisher=Gauntlet Publications|location=Colorado Springs, CO|isbn=1-887368-86-8|edition=1st|chapter=Preface|page=9|quote=For many years I've told people that ''Fahrenheit 451'' was the result of my story 'The Pedestrian' continuing itself in my life.

In ''The Pedestrian'', Leonard Mead is harassed and detained by the city's remotely operated police cruiser (there's only one) for taking nighttime walks, something that has become extremely rare in this future-based setting: everybody else stays inside and watches television ("viewing screens"). Alone and without an [[alibi]], Mead is taken to the "Psychiatric Center for Research on Regressive Tendencies" for his peculiar habit.

==Reception==

In 1954, ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' reviewer [[Groff Conklin]] placed the novel "among the great works of the imagination written in English in the last decade or more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conklin|first=Groff|authorlink=Groff Conklin|date=February 1954|title=Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf|journal=Galaxy Science Fiction|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chicago Sunday Tribune]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[August Derleth]] described the book as "a savage and shockingly prophetic view of one possible future way of life", calling it "compelling" and praising Bradbury for his "brilliant imagination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Derleth|first=August|authorlink=August Derleth|title=Vivid Prophecy of Book Burning|newspaper=Chicago Sunday Tribune|date=October 25, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half a century later, [[Sam Weller (journalist)|Sam Weller]] wrote, "upon its publication, ''Fahrenheit 451'' was hailed as a visionary work of social commentary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weller|first=Sam|authorlink=Sam Weller (journalist)|title=Listen to the Echoes: The Ray Bradbury Interviews|year=2010|publisher=Melville House|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, ''Fahrenheit 451'' is still viewed as an important [[cautionary tale]] about [[conformity]] and the evils of government censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNamee|first=Gregory|title=Appreciations: Fahrenheit 451|journal=Kirkus Reviews|date=September 15, 2010|volume=78|issue=18|page=882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the novel was first published, there were those who did not find merit in the tale. [[Anthony Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas]] were less enthusiastic, faulting the book for being "simply padded, occasionally with startlingly ingenious gimmickry,&amp;nbsp;... often with coruscating cascades of verbal brilliance [but] too often merely with words."&lt;ref&gt;"Recommended Reading", ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction|F&amp;SF]]'', December 1953, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the book for ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', [[P. Schuyler Miller]] characterized the title piece as "one of Bradbury's bitter, almost hysterical diatribes," while praising its "emotional drive and compelling, nagging detail."&lt;ref&gt;"The Reference Library", ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', April 1954, pp. 145–46&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''The New York Times'' was unimpressed with the novel and further accused Bradbury of developing a "virulent hatred for many aspects of present-day culture, namely, such monstrosities as radio, TV, most movies, amateur and professional sports, automobiles, and other similar aberrations which he feels debase the bright simplicity of the thinking man's existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nothing but TV|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 14, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship/banning incidents===

In the years since its publication, ''Fahrenheit 451'' has occasionally been banned, censored, or redacted in some schools by parents and teaching staff either unaware of or indifferent to the inherent irony in such censorship. The following are some notable incidents:
*In 1987, ''Fahrenheit 451'' was given "third tier" status by the [[Bay District Schools|Bay County School Board]] in [[Panama City, Florida|Panama City]], [[Florida]] under then-superintendent Leonard Hall's new three-tier classification system.&lt;ref name=karolides2011_p501_502&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karolides|first1=Nicholas J.|last2=Bald|first2=Margaret|last3=Sova|first3=Dawn B.|title=120 Banned Books: Censorship Histories of World Literature|edition=Second|year=2011|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=978-0-8160-8232-2|pages=501–02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third tier was meant for books to be removed from the classroom for "a lot of vulgarity".&lt;ref name=karolides2011_p501_502/&gt; After a resident class-action lawsuit, a media stir, and student protests, the school board abandoned their tier-based censorship system and approved all the currently used books.&lt;ref name=karolides2011_p501_502/&gt;
*In 1992, [[Venado Middle School]] in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], [[California]] gave copies of ''Fahrenheit 451'' to students with all "obscene" words blacked out.&lt;ref name=karolides2011_p489&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karolides|first1=Nicholas J.|last2=Bald|first2=Margaret|last3=Sova|first3=Dawn B.|title=120 Banned Books: Censorship Histories of World Literature|edition=Second|year=2011|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=978-0-8160-8232-2|page=489|quote=In 1992, students of Venado Middle School in Irvine, California, were issued copies of the novel with numerous words blacked out. School officials had ordered teachers to use black markers to obliterate all of the 'hells', 'damns', and other words deemed 'obscene' in the books before giving them to students as required reading. Parents complained to the school and contacted local newspapers, who sent reporters to write stories about the irony of a book that condemns bookburning and censorship being expurgated. Faced with such an outcry, school officials announced that the censored copies would no longer be used.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents contacted the local media and succeeded in reinstalling the uncensored copies.&lt;ref name=karolides2011_p489/&gt;
*In 2006, parents of a 10th-grade high school student in [[Montgomery County, Texas|Montgomery County]], [[Texas]] demanded the book be banned from their daughter's English class reading list.&lt;ref name=wrigley&gt;{{cite news|last=Wrigley|first=Deborah|title=Parent files complaint about book assigned as student reading|date=October 3, 2006|newspaper=ABC News|url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=4625303|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter was assigned the book during [[Banned Books Week]], but stopped reading several pages in due to the offensive language and description of the burning of the [[Bible]]. In addition, the parents protested the violence, portrayal of Christians, and depictions of firemen in the novel.&lt;ref name=wrigley/&gt;

==Themes==

Discussions about ''Fahrenheit 451'' often center on its story foremost as a warning against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]], he was concerned about [[censorship in the United States]]. During a radio interview in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |others=Narrated by Norman Rose |title=Ticket to the Moon (tribute to SciFi) |date=December 4, 1956 |website=Biography in Sound |publisher=NBC Radio News |url=https://oldradioprograms.us/My%20Old%20Radio%20Shows/B/Biographies%20In%20Sound/Biographies%20In%20Sound%20(NBC)-1956-12-04-Ticket%20To%20The%20Moon%20-%20Tribute%20To%20Scifi.mp3 |format=mp3 |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |at=27:10–27:57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Definitive Biography in Sound Radio Log|url=http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Biography-In-Sound.html|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As time went by, Bradbury tended to dismiss censorship as a chief motivating factor for writing the story. Instead he usually claimed that the real messages of ''Fahrenheit 451'' were about the dangers of an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. In the late 1950s, Bradbury recounted:&lt;blockquote&gt;In writing the short novel ''Fahrenheit 451'', I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was ''not'' fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by [[Kingsley Amis]] in ''New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction'' (1960). Bradbury directly foretells this incident early in the work: "And in her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talking coming in." p.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This story echoes Mildred's "Seashell ear-thimbles" (i.e., a brand of in-ear headphones) that act as an emotional barrier between her and Montag. In a 2007 interview, Bradbury maintained that people misinterpret his book and that ''Fahrenheit 451'' is really a statement on how mass media like television marginalizes the reading of literature.&lt;ref name=LAweekly&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Bradbury: Fahrenheit 451 Misinterpreted|last=Johnston|first=Amy E. Boyle|date=May 30, 2007|work=LA Weekly website|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2007-05-31/news/ray-bradbury-fahrenheit-451-misinterpreted/full|accessdate=August 3, 2013|quote=Bradbury still has a lot to say, especially about how people do not understand his most famous literary work, ''Fahrenheit 451'', published in 1953&amp;nbsp;... Bradbury, a man living in the creative and industrial center of reality TV and one-hour dramas, says it is, in fact, a story about how television destroys interest in reading literature.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding minorities, he wrote in his 1979 Coda:&lt;blockquote&gt;There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority, be it Baptist/Unitarian, Irish/Italian/Octogenarian/Zen Buddhist, Zionist/Seventh-day Adventist, Women's Lib/Republican, [[Mattachine]]/[[Four Square Gospel]] feels it has the will, the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse.&amp;nbsp;[...] Fire-Captain Beatty, in my novel ''Fahrenheit 451'', described how the books were burned first by minorities, each ripping a page or a paragraph from this book, then that, until the day came when the books were empty and the minds shut and the libraries closed forever.&amp;nbsp;[...] Only six weeks ago, I discovered that, over the years, some cubby-hole editors at [[Ballantine Books]], fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some seventy-five separate sections from the novel. Students, reading the novel, which, after all, deals with censorship and book-burning in the future, wrote to tell me of this exquisite irony. [[Judy-Lynn del Rey]], one of the new Ballantine editors, is having the entire book reset and republished this summer with all the damns and hells back in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Ray|authorlink=Ray Bradbury|date=2003|title=Fahrenheit 451|edition=50th anniversary|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-345-34296-8|pages=175–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Book-burning censorship, Bradbury would argue, was a side-effect of these two primary factors; this is consistent with Captain Beatty's speech to Montag about the history of the firemen. According to Bradbury, it is the people, not the state, who are the culprit in ''Fahrenheit 451''.&lt;ref name=LAweekly/&gt; Nevertheless, the role of censorship, state-based or otherwise, is still perhaps the most frequent theme explored in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eller|first1=Jonathan R.|last2=Touponce|first2=William F.|title=Ray Bradbury: The Life of Fiction|date=2004|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=9780873387798|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rnWY_tjp9WgC&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=%22The%20main%20target%20of%20%27%27Fahrenheit%20451%27%27%20is%20not%20censorship%2C%20as%20is%20often%20supposed%2C%20but%20rather%20mass%20culture%22&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20main%20target%20of%20%27%27Fahrenheit%20451%27%27%20is%20not%20censorship%2C%20as%20is%20often%20supposed%2C%20but%20rather%20mass%20culture%22|page=91|quote=The main target of ''Fahrenheit 451'' is not censorship, as is often supposed, but rather mass culture...}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Literature suppressed on social grounds|last=Sova|first=Dawn B.|publisher=Facts On File|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=133–135|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of other themes in the novel besides censorship have been suggested. Two major themes are resistance to conformity and control of individuals via technology and mass media. Bradbury explores how the government is able to use mass media to influence society and suppress individualism through book burning. The characters Beatty and Faber point out that the American population is to blame. Due to their constant desire for a simplistic, positive image, books must be suppressed. Beatty blames the minority groups, who would take offense to published works that displayed them in an unfavorable light. Faber went further to state that the American population simply stopped reading on their own. He notes that the book burnings themselves became a form of entertainment for the general public.&lt;ref name="reid_p59-60"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Robin Anne|title=Ray Bradbury: A Critical Companion|series=Critical Companions to Popular Contemporary Writers|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-313-30901-9|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predictions for the future==

Bradbury described himself as "a ''preventor'' of futures, not a predictor of them."&lt;ref name=aggelis_p99&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Aggelis|editor-first=Steven L.|others=Interview by Shel Dorf|title=Conversations with Ray Bradbury|year=2004|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson, MS|isbn=1-57806-640-9|page=99|quote=I am a ''preventor'' of futures, not a predictor of them. I wrote ''Fahrenheit 451'' to prevent book-burnings, not to induce that future into happening, or even to say that it was inevitable.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not believe that book burning was an inevitable part of the future; he wanted to warn against its development.&lt;ref name=aggelis_p99/&gt; In a later interview, when asked if he believes that teaching ''Fahrenheit 451'' in schools will prevent his totalitarian&lt;ref name=gerall/&gt; vision of the future, Bradbury replied in the negative. Rather, he states that education must be at the kindergarten and first-grade level. If students are unable to read then, they will be unable to read ''Fahrenheit 451''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Aggelis|editor-first=Steven L.|title=Conversations with Ray Bradbury|year=2004|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson, MS|isbn=1-57806-640-9|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of technology, Sam Weller notes that Bradbury "predicted everything from flat-panel televisions to earbud headphones and twenty-four-hour banking machines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weller|first=Sam|authorlink=Sam Weller (journalist)|title=Listen to the Echoes: The Ray Bradbury Interviews|year=2010|publisher=Melville House|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
===Television===

''[[Playhouse 90]]'' broadcast "A Sound of Different Drummers" on [[CBS]] in 1957, written by [[Robert Alan Aurthur]]. The play combined plot ideas from ''Fahrenheit 451'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Bradbury sued and eventually won on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nolan|first=William F.|authorlink=William F.

===Theater===

In the late 1970s Bradbury adapted his book into a play. At least part of it was performed at the Colony Theatre in [[Los Angeles]] in 1979, but it was not in print until 1986 and the official world premiere was only in November 1988 by the [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne, Indiana Civic Theatre]]. The stage adaptation diverges considerably from the book and seems influenced by Truffaut's movie. For example, fire chief Beatty's character is fleshed out and is the wordiest role in the play. As in the movie, Clarisse does not simply disappear but in the finale meets up with Montag as a book character (she as [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], he as [[Edgar Allan Poe]]).&lt;ref name=play&gt;[http://home.wlv.ac.uk/~in5379/books/451_play.htm Fahrenheit 451 (play)], BradburyMedia; accessed September 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK premiere of Bradbury's stage adaptation was not until 2003 in [[Nottingham]],&lt;ref name=play/&gt; while it took until 2006 before the Godlight Theatre Company produced and performed its [[New York City]] premiere at [[59E59 Theaters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|authorlink=Neil Genzlinger|title=Godlight Theater's 'Fahrenheit 451' Offers Hot Ideas for the Information Age|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2006/03/25/theater/reviews/25fahr.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1364390999-4fShVjfkzVUOVr8NqZtCcg|accessdate=March 2, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the completion of the New York run, the production then transferred to the [[Edinburgh Festival]] where it was a 2006 [[Edinburgh Festival]] ''Pick of the Fringe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Edinburgh festival 2006 – Reviews – Theatre 'F' – 8 out of 156|publisher=Edinburghguide.com|url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/festival/2006/fringe/review_theatre.php?page=f|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Browning''' is the process of food turning brown due to the chemical reactions that take place within. The process of browning is one of the chemical reactions that take place in food chemistry and represents an  interesting research topic regarding health, nutrition, and food technology. Though there are many different ways food chemically changes over time, browning in particular falls into 2 main categories.

Browning has many important implications on the food industry relating to nutrition, technology, and economic  cost.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118308035.ch4/summary|title=Food Biochemistry and Food Processing|last=Corzo-Martínez|first=Marta|last2=Corzo|first2=Nieves|last3=Villamiel|first3=Mar|last4=del Castillo|first4=M Dolores|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781118308035|editor-last=Ph.D|editor-first=Benjamin K.

== Enzymatic browning ==
Enzymatic browning is one of the most important reactions that takes place in most fruits and vegetables as well as in seafood.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/45/8/1150.full.pdf|title=Enzymatic Browning, Polyphenol Oxidase Activity, and Polyphenols in Four Apple Cultivars: Dynamics during Fruit Development|last=Holderbaum,|first=Daniel|date=2010|website=|publisher=HortScience|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes affect the taste, color, and value of such foods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Generally, it is a chemical reaction involving [[polyphenol oxidase]], [[catechol oxidase]], and other [[enzyme]]s that create [[melanin]]s and [[benzoquinone]] from [[natural phenol]]s. Enzymatic browning (also called oxidation of foods) requires exposure to [[oxygen]]. It begins with the oxidation of [[phenols]] by [[polyphenol oxidase]] into [[quinone]]s,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macheix|first=J. J.|last2=Sapis|first2=J.

== Control of enzymatic browning ==
A variety of methods are used to prevent or slow down enzymatic browning of foods, each method aimed at targeting specific steps of the chemical reaction. The control of enzymatic browning has always been a challenge for the food industry. In addition, the use of chemicals to inhibit browning, such as sulfite (a powerful antibrowning chemical) have been reconsidered due to the potential hazards{{clarify|date=February 2017}} it causes along with its activity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Much research has been conducted regarding the exact types of control mechanisms that take place when confronted with these enzymatic process. The different types of enzymatic browning control can be classified different groups.
* [[Lemon]] juice and other [[acid]]s lower the [[pH]] and remove the copper [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] necessary for the responsible enzymes to function
* [[Blanching (cooking)|Blanching]] or roasting of foods, to [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] the enzymes, and destroy to responsible [[reactants]], as used in the "kill green" phase of [[tea processing]].
* Low temperatures can also prevent enzymatic browning by reducing [[rate of reaction]].
* Use of [[ascorbic acid]] in certain pH's to control browning of apples under certain conditions by changing their phenolase activity. Different pH values affect phenolase activity of apples differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=el-Shimi|first=N. M.|date=1993-01-01|title=Control of enzymatic browning in apple slices by using ascorbic acid under different conditions|journal=Plant Foods for Human Nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)|volume=43|issue=1|pages=71–76|issn=0921-9668|pmid=8464847}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Proteins can exert an inhibitory effect on PPO activity by [[Chelation|Chelating]] the essential copper at the active site of PPO  through competitive inhibition, inhibiting its activity  &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* During wine synthesis, the use of [[Ion-exchange chromatography|Ion-exchange filtration]] is used to remove the brown color sediments in the solution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* [[Arctic Apples]] have been genetically modified to avoid expressing [[polyphenol oxidase]] and thus do not brown

== Non-enzymatic browning ==
[[File:Brioche.jpg|thumb|left|The crust of [[brioche]] bread, which is golden-brown due to the Maillard reaction|225x225px]]
The second type of browning, nonenzymatic browning, is a process that also produces the brown pigmentation in foods, but without the activity of enzymes. The two main forms of non-enzymatic browning are [[caramelization]] and the [[Maillard reaction]]. Both vary in the reaction rate as a function of [[water activity]] (in food chemistry, the standard state of water activity is most often defined as the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature.

[[Caramelization]] is a process involving the [[pyrolysis]] of [[sugar]]. It is used extensively in cooking for the desired nutty flavor and brown color. As the process occurs, [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] chemicals are released, producing the characteristic [[caramel]] flavor.

[[File:Caramelization (2).png|thumb|308x308px|Example caramelization of table sugar (sucrose) caramelizing to a brown nutty flavor substance (furan and maltol)]][[File:Maillard reaction asparagin.png|thumb|275x275px|Overview of the mechanism of non-enzymatic Maillard reaction in foods. The schiff base loses a CO2 molecule and adds to water. Notice the interaction between the amine group of the amino acid (asparagine here) and the carbonyl carbon of the sugar, (Glucose). The end product is [[acrylamide]]. For more information, visit [[Maillard reaction]]. ]]

The other non-enzymatic reaction is the [[Maillard reaction]]. This reaction is responsible for the production of the flavor when foods are cooked. Examples of foods that undergo Maillard reaction include breads, steaks, and potatoes. It is a chemical reaction that takes place between the [[amine group]] of a free [[amino acid]] and the [[carbonyl group]] of a [[reducing sugar]],&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; usually with the addition of heat. The sugar interacts with the amino acid, producing a variety of odors and flavors. The Maillard reaction is the basis for producing artificial flavors for processed foods in the flavoring industry,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijfs/2015/526762/|title=Food Processing and Maillard Reaction Products: Effect on Human Health and Nutrition|last=Tamanna|first=Nahid|date=2015|website=|publisher=Hindawa|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the type of amino acid involved determines the resulting flavor.

[[Melanoidin]]s are brown, high molecular weight heterogeneous polymers that are formed when sugars and amino acids combine through the Maillard reaction at high temperatures and low water activity. Melanoidins are commonly present in foods that have undergone some form of non-enzymatic browning, such as barley malts (Vienna and Munich), bread crust, bakery products and coffee. They are also present in the wastewater of sugar refineries, necessitating treatment in order to avoid contamination around the outflow of these refineries.

== Browning of grapes during winemaking ==
Like most fruit, grapes vary in the amount of phenolic compounds they have. This characteristic is used as a parameter in judging the quality of wine.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The general process of winemaking is initiated by the enzymatic oxidation of phenolic compounds by polyphenol oxidases.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Contact between the phenolic compounds in the [[Vacuole]] of the grape cell and the [[Polyphenol oxidase]] [[Enzyme]] (located in the cytoplasm) triggers the oxidation of the grape. Thus, the initial browning of grapes occurs as a result of "compartmentalization modification" in the cells of the grape.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Aged white wine with brown color.jpg|thumb|Aged [[white wine]] with brown color|216x216px]]

== Implications in food industry and technology ==
Enzymatic browning affects the color, flavor, and nutritional value of foods, causing huge economic loss when not sold to consumers on time.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It is estimated that more than 50% of produce is lost as a result of enzymatic browning.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The increase in human population and consequential depletion in our natural resources has prompted many biochemists and [[Food engineering|Food engineers]] alike to find new and improved techniques to preserve food longer, by using methods to inhibit the browning reaction, and effectively increase the shelf life of foods. A better understanding of the enzymatic browning mechanisms, specifically, understanding the properties of the enzymes and substrates that are involved in the reaction, may help food technologists to control certain stages in the mechanism and inhibit browning.

Apples are fruits commonly studied by researchers due to their high phenolic content, which make them highly susceptible to enzymatic browning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In accordance with other findings regarding apples and browning activity, a correlation has been found between high phenolic amount and enzymatic activity of apples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This provides a hope for food industries in an effort to genetically modify foods to decrease polyphenol oxidase activity and thus decrease browning. An example of such accomplishments in food engineering is in the production of [[Arctic Apples]]. These apples, engineered by ''Okanagan Specialty Fruits Inc,'' are a result of [[gene splicing]], a technique that has allowed for the reduction in polyphenol oxidase.

Another type of issue that is closely studied is the browning of seafood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Seafood]], in particular shrimp, is a delicacy consumed by people all over the world. The browning of shrimp which is actually referred to as [[Melanosis]], creates a great concern for food handlers and consumers. Melanosis mainly occurs during postmortem handling and refrigerated storage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Recent studies have found a plant extract that acts as an anti melatonin polyphenol oxidase inhibitor and serves the same function as sulfites but without the health risks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Forest Products Research Laboratory''' was a research institute in [[Buckinghamshire]].

==History==
It was founded by the Forest Products Research Board, established in 1923, overseen by the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (itself created in 1915). The Forest Products Research Board was mainly interested in the economic value of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical forests]] in the [[British Empire]].

The Forestry Conference had been held in 1923. An Empire Forestry Conference had been held earlier in 1920. There was an Empire Forestry Association. The Forest Products Research Laboratories were set up initially at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] in north-east [[Hampshire]] in 1925. In 1927, a new site was built at Princes Risborough. The site cost £80,000, and was officially opened on 31 July 1928. The first Director was Sir Ralph Pearson, who stayed until 1933. The site was conducting research into the [[Lyctus (beetle)]], a pest, and [[dry rot]], caused by [[Wood-decay fungus|fungi]].

Around the same time, the [[Imperial Forestry Institute]] (now part of the [[Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford]]) was established in [[Oxford]]. It was considered about setting up an Empire Forestry Bureau, to disseminate information about forestry research around the Empire. Also in Buckinghamshire was the [[Parasite Laboratory]], part of the [[Imperial Bureau of Entomology]] in London, later the Commonwealth Institute of Entomology&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBER%2FBER74_04%2FS0007485300013900a.pdf&amp;code=47fbb0c009e8e524417e3dfa463249ff Bulletin of Entomological Research 1984]&lt;/ref&gt; which produced the [[Bulletin of Entomological Research]], and is now represented by [[CABI (organisation)|CABI]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. From February to April 1928, an Empire Timber Exhibition was held at the [[Commonwealth Institute|Imperial Institute]] (now the site of [[Imperial College London]]). The Parasite Laboratory closed in 1940.

In 1928 research was carried out across the UK into [[Dutch elm disease]]. In 1931 it carried out work into the [[Deathwatch beetle]]; the first investigation into this pest had been by [[Harold Maxwell-Lefroy]] at Imperial College in 1914.

The [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] visited the site on 30 April 1952. The Director from 1945-60 was Prof Frank Henderson.

In August 1958, it was decided by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research that the government could not continue funding into the forestry products research, and that the timber industry should pay for it themselves, with funding being withdrawn from around 1963. The Forest Products Research Board closed in 1958, with some research passing to the [[Timber Development Association]] (now called TRADA). From 1960-62 the Director was Sir [[Alcon Copisarow]], who became the Chief Scientific Officer from 1962-64 at the Ministry of Technology. From the 1960s, the site was run under the Ministry of Technology.

===Absorption===
On 1 January 1971, the site was transferred to be overseen by the Department of the Environment. Even greater changes occurred in 1972, when it was absorbed into the [[Building Research Establishment|BRE]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bre.co.uk/history BRE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestry.oxfordjournals.org/content/70/4/337.full.pdf Seventy years of forest products research]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site at Princes Risborough continued with work into timber research until 1988, being known as Princes Risborougb Laboratory.

==Structure==
It was sited in [[Princes Risborough]] in [[Wycombe District]]. It was run by the [[Department of the Environment (United Kingdom)|Department of the Environment]].

==Function==
It conducted extensive and widespread research into the strength of wood and timber, and decay of wood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11256">'''Gene–environment correlation''' (or '''genotype–environment correlation''') is said to occur when exposure to environmental conditions depends on an individual's [[genotype]].

==Definition==
Gene–environment correlations (or rGE) is [[correlation]] of two [[Phenotypic trait|trait]]s, e.g. height and weight, which would mean that when one changes, so does the other. Gene–environment correlations can arise by both [[Causality|causal and non-causal]] mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Jaffee2007"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[:d:Q56061124|Jaffee SR]], [[:d:Q40284708|Price TS]]|journal= Molecular Psychiatry |title= Gene–environment correlations: a review of the evidence and implications for prevention of mental illness |year= 2007 |volume= 12 |issue= 5 |pages= 432–442 |pmid= 17453060 |doi= 10.1038/sj.mp.4001950 |pmc= 3703541 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of principal interest are those causal mechanisms which indicate genetic control over environmental exposure. Genetic variants influence environmental exposure indirectly via behavior. Three causal mechanisms giving rise to gene–environment correlations have been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Plomin R, DeFries JC, Loehlin JC |journal= Psychological Bulletin |volume= 84 |issue= 2 |pages= 309–322 |year= 1977 |title= Genotype–environment interaction and correlation in the analysis of human behavior |pmid = 557211 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.84.2.309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: (i) '''Passive''' gene–environment correlation refers to the association between the genotype a child inherits from his or her parents and the environment in which the child is raised. Parents create a home environment that is influenced by their own [[heritability|heritable]] characteristics. Biological parents also pass on genetic material to their children. When the children's genotype also influences their behavioral or cognitive outcomes, the result can be a [[spurious relationship]] between environment and outcome. For example, because parents who have histories of antisocial behavior (which is moderately [[heritability|heritable]]) are at elevated risk of abusing their children, a case can be made for saying that maltreatment may be a marker for genetic risk that parents transmit to children rather than a causal risk factor for children’s conduct problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DiLalla LF, Gottesman II|journal= Psychological Bulletin |volume= 109 |issue= 1 |pages= 125–129 |year= 1991 |title= Biological and genetic contributions to violence: Widom’s untold tale |pmid = 2006224 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.109.1.125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: (ii) '''Evocative''' (or reactive) gene–environment correlation happens when an individual's (heritable) behavior evokes an environmental response. For example, the association between marital conflict and depression may reflect the tensions that arise when engaging with a depressed spouse rather than a causal effect of marital conflict on risk for depression.

: (iii) '''Active''' gene–environment correlation occurs when an individual possesses a heritable inclination to select environmental exposure. For example, individuals who are characteristically extroverted may seek out very different social environments than those who are shy and withdrawn.

Gene–environment correlation can also arise from non-causal mechanisms, including evolutionary processes and behavioral 'contamination' of the environmental measure. Evolutionary processes, such as [[genetic drift]] and [[natural selection]], can cause allele frequencies to differ between populations. For example, exposure to malaria-bearing mosquitoes over many generations may have caused the higher allele frequency among certain ethnic groups for the sickle [[hemoglobin]] (HbS) allele, a [[recessive]] mutation that causes [[sickle-cell disease]] but confers resistance against [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aidoo M, Terlouw DJ, Kolczak MS, McElroy PD, ter Kuile FO, Kariuki S, Nahlen BL, Lal AA, Udhayakumar V |journal= Lancet |volume= 359 |issue= 9314 |pages= 1311–1312 |year= 2002 |title= Protective effects of the sickle cell gene against malaria morbidity and mortality |pmid = 11965279 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08273-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, HbS genotype has become associated with the malarial environment.

==Evidence==

=== Quantitative genetic studies ===
[[Twin studies|Twin and adoption studies]] have provided much of the evidence for gene–environment correlations by demonstrating that putative environmental measures are [[heritability|heritable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kendler KS, Baker JH|journal= Psychological Medicine |volume= 37 |issue= 5  |pages= 615–626 |year= 2007 |title= Genetic influences on measures of the environment: a systematic review |pmid = 17176502 |doi= 10.1017/S0033291706009524}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, studies of adult twins have shown that desirable and undesirable life events are moderately heritable as are specific life events and life circumstances, including divorce, the propensity to marry, marital quality and social support. Studies in which researchers have measured child-specific aspects of the environment have also shown that putative environmental factors, such as parental discipline or warmth, are moderately heritable. Television viewing, peer group orientations and social attitudes have all been shown to be moderately heritable. There is also a growing literature on the genetic factors influencing behaviors that constitute a risk to health, such as the consumption of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs, and risk-taking behaviors. Like parental discipline, these health related behaviors are genetically influenced, but are thought to have environmentally mediated effects on disease. To the extent that researchers have attempted to determine why genes and environments are correlated, most evidence has pointed to the intervening effects of personality and behavioral characteristics.

Environments are heritable because genotype influences the behaviours that evoke, select, and modify features of the environment. Thus, environments less amenable to behavioural modification tend to be less heritable.&lt;ref name="Jaffee2007"/&gt; For example, negative life events that are beyond the control of the individual (e.g., the death of a loved one, losing one’s home in a natural disaster) have lower heritability than negative life events that may be dependent on an individual’s behaviour (e.g., getting a divorce, getting fired from a job). Similarly, personal life events (i.e., events that occur directly to an individual) are more highly heritable than network life events (i.e., events that occur to someone within an individual’s social network, thus affecting the individual indirectly).

=== Molecular genetic studies ===
Evidence for the existence of gene–environment correlations has recently started to accrue from [[Molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] investigations. The [[Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism]] (COGA) group has reported that a single-nucleotide polymorphism in intron 7 of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A a2 receptor (rs279871; GABRA2) was associated with [[alcohol dependence]] and marital status. Individuals who had the high-risk GABRA2 variant (i.e., the variant associated with alcohol dependence) were less likely to be married, in part because they were at higher risk for [[antisocial personality disorder]] and were less likely to be motivated by a desire to please others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dick DM, Agrawal A, Schuckit MA, Bierut L, Hinrichs A, Fox L, Mullaney J, Cloninger CR, Hesselbrock V, ((Nurnberger JI Jr)), Almasy L, Foroud T, Porjesz B, Edenberg H, Begleiter H |journal= J Stud Alcohol |volume= 67 |issue= 2 |pages= 185–194 |year= 2006 |title= Marital status, alcohol dependence, and GABRA2: evidence for gene–environment correlation and interaction |pmid= 16562401 |doi=10.15288/jsa.2006.67.185}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also molecular evidence for passive gene–environment correlation. A recent study found that children were almost 2.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) if their mothers were divorced, separated, or never married. In this sample, however, mothers possessing the short allele of the [[dopamine receptor]] gene DRD2 were more likely to be divorced, separated, or never married. Moreover, their children were more likely to have ADHD. Therefore, part of the association between parental marital status and ADHD diagnosis among children in this sample is due to the [[confounding variable]] of maternal DRD2 genotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Waldman ID |journal= Development and Psychopathology |volume= 19 |pages= 1117–1128 |year= 2007 |title= Gene–environment interactions reexamined: Does mother’s marital stability interact with the dopamine receptor D2 gene in the etiology of childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder? |doi = 10.1017/S0954579407000570 |pmid = 17931438 |issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these studies also found evidence for [[gene–environment interaction]].

== Significance ==
Doctors want to know whether exposure to environmental risk causes disease. The fact that environmental exposures are heritable means that the relationship between environmental exposure and disease may be [[confounding|confounded]] by genotype. That is, the relationship may be [[Spurious relationship|spurious]] (not causal), because the same genetic factors might be influencing both exposure to environmental risk and disease. In such cases, measures aimed at reducing environmental exposure will not reduce the risk for disease. On the other hand, heritability of exposure to environmental conditions itself does not mean environmental factors are not responsible for disease and so exposure reduction would benefit individuals with genetic predisposition to risk behavior.

For example, a study of children born to twin sisters investigated whether the relationship between parental divorce and offspring alcohol and [[emotion]]al problems was causal or confounded by parental genotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=D'Onofrio BM, Turkheimer E, Emery RE, Maes HH, Silberg J, Eaves LJ | title= A children of twins study of parental divorce and offspring psychopathology | journal= Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | year= 2007 | volume= 48 | pages= 667–675 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01741.x | pmc= 2990346 | pmid= 17593147 | issue= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that the offspring of twin sisters who were discordant for divorce had equally high levels of emotional problems, suggesting that genetic factors which made twin siblings divorce-prone also increased their children’s risk for depression and anxiety. This finding suggests that preventing the parents’ divorce would have had little impact on offspring risk for emotional problems (although the findings for alcohol problems in the children were consistent with a causal role for divorce).

'''Gerontology'''  is the study of the [[social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[Psychology|psychological]], [[cognitive]], and [[Biology|biological]] aspects of [[ageing]]. The word was coined by [[Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov]] in 1903, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:γέρων|γέρων]], ''geron'', "old man" and -λογία, ''-logia'', "study of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aghe.org/resources/gerontology-geriatrics-descriptions|title=Gerontology/Geriatrics Definitions|last=Confluence|website=www.aghe.org|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is distinguished from [[geriatrics]], which is the branch of medicine that specializes in the treatment of existing disease in older adults. Gerontologists include researchers and practitioners in the fields of biology, nursing, medicine, criminology, dentistry, social work, physical and occupational therapy, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, economics, political science, architecture, geography, pharmacy, public health, housing, and anthropology.&lt;ref name=Hooyman&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hooyman |first1=N.R. |last2=Kiyak |first2=H.A. |title=Social gerontology: A multidisciplinary perspective |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston |year=2011 |isbn=978-0205763139 |edition=9th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multidisciplinary nature of gerontology means that there are a number of sub-fields which overlap with gerontology. There are policy issues, for example, involved in government planning and the operation of nursing homes, investigating the effects of an [[Population ageing|ageing population]] on society, and the design of residential spaces for older people that facilitate the development of a sense of place or home. Dr. Lawton, a behavioral psychologist at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center, was among the first to recognize the need for living spaces designed to accommodate the elderly, especially those with Alzheimer's disease. As an academic discipline the field is relatively new. The USC Leonard Davis School created the first PhD, master's and bachelor's degree programs in gerontology in 1975.

==History==
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], several physicians wrote on issues related to Gerontology. [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1025) offered instruction for the care of the aged, including [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and remedies for problems including [[constipation]].&lt;ref name=Howell87&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=Trevor H.|title=Avicenna and His Regimen of Old Age|journal=Age and Ageing|year=1987|volume=16|pages=58–59|doi=10.1093/ageing/16.1.58|pmid=3551552|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic physician [[Ibn Al-Jazzar]] Al-Qayrawani (Algizar, c. 898–980) wrote on the aches and conditions of the elderly (Ammar 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ammar |first1= S |year= 1998 |title= Vesalius |journal= Official Journal of the International Society for the History of Medicine |volume= 4 |page= 48 |url= http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/ishm/vesalius/VESx1998x04x01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarly work covers [[sleep disorder]]s, [[Forgetting|forgetfulness]], how to strengthen [[memory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/arabic/bioI.html#jazzar |title=Ibn al-Jazzār, Abū Ja'far Ahmad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Abī Khālid (d. 979/369) |work=Islamic Medical Manuscripts |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Geritt Bos, ''Ibn al-Jazzar'', ''Risala fi l-isyan'' (Treatise on forgetfulness), London, 1995 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and causes of [[Death|mortality]]&lt;ref name="Al Jazzar"&gt;[http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm Al Jazzar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706155736/http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ishaq ibn Hunayn]] (died 910) also wrote works on the treatments for forgetfulness (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_08.html |title=Specialized literature |work=Islamic culture and medical arts |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of aged humans, and the [[life expectancy]], tended to increase in every century since the 14th, society tended to consider caring for an elderly relative as a family issue. It was not until the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] that ideas shifted in favor of a societal care-system. Some early pioneers, such as [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], who himself lived to be 102, believed that aging itself should be a science to be studied. [[Élie Metchnikoff]] coined the term "gerontology" {{circa}} 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gerontology Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern pioneers like [[James Birren]] began organizing gerontology as its own field in the 1940s, later being involved in starting a US government agency on aging &amp;ndash; the [[National Institute on Aging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the National Institute on Aging|url=https://www.nia.nih.gov/about|publisher=National Institute on Aging, US National Institutes of Health|accessdate=5 March 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; programs in gerontology at the [[University of Southern California]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and as past president of the [[Gerontological Society of America]] (founded in 1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newcomb|first1=Beth|title=In memoriam: James E.

With the population of people over 60 years old expected to be some 22% of the world's population by 2050, assessment and treatment methods for age-related disease burden &amp;ndash; the term ''geroscience'' emerged in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4036419|year=2014|author1=Burch|first1=J.

==Aging demographics==
The world is forecast to undergo rapid [[aging population|population aging]] in the next several decades.  In 1900, there were 3.1 million people aged 65 years and older living in the [[United States]].  However, this population continued to grow throughout the 20th century and reached 31.2, 35, and 40.3 million people in 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively.  Notably, in the United States and across the world, the [[Baby boomers|"baby boomer"]] generation began to turn 65 in 2011.  Recently, the population aged 65 years and older has grown at a faster rate than the total population in the United States.  The total population increased by 9.7%, from 281.4 million to 308.7 million, between 2000 and 2010.  However, the population aged 65 years and older increased by 15.1% during the same period.&lt;ref name="census.gov"&gt;{{cite web |author=Carrie A. Werner |title=The Older Population: 2010 |year=2010 |work=2010 Census Briefs |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-09.pdf |id=C2010BR-09 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been estimated that 25% of the population in the United States and [[Canada]] will be aged 65 years and older by 2025.  Moreover, by 2050, it is predicted that, for the first time in United States history, the number of individuals aged 60 years and older will be greater than the number of children aged 0 to 14 years.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt;  Those aged 85 years and older (oldest-old) are projected to increase from 5.3 million to 21 million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Population |chapterurl=http://www.agingstats.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main_Site/Data/2008_Documents/Population.aspx |title=2008 Older Americans : Key indicators of Well-Being |year=2008 |url=http://www.agingstats.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main_Site/Data/Data_2008.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adults aged 85–89 years constituted the greatest segment of the oldest-old in 1990, 2000, and 2010.  However, the largest percentage point increase among the oldest-old occurred in the 90- to 94-year-old age group, which increased from 25.0% in 1990 to 26.4% in 2010.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

With the rapid growth of the aging population, social work education and training specialized in older adults and practitioners interested in working with older adults are increasingly in demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Institute for Geriatric Social Work |publisher=Boston University |url=http://www.bu.edu/igsw/who-we-are/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711073154/http://www.bu.edu/igsw/who-we-are/ |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geriatric Social Work Initiative |url=http://www.gswi.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences with age ===

There has been a considerable disparity between the number of men and women in the older population in the United States.  In both 2000 and 2010, women outnumbered men in the older population at every single year of age (e.g., 65 to 100 years and over).  The [[sex ratio]], which is a measure used to indicate the balance of males to females in a population, is calculated by taking the number of males divided by the number of females, and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the sex ratio is the number of males per 100 females.  In 2010, there were 90.5 males per 100 females in the 65-year-old population.  However, this represented an increase from 1990 when there were 82.7 males per 100 females, and from 2000 when the sex ratio was 88.1. Although the gender gap between men and women has narrowed, women continue to have a greater life expectancy and lower mortality rates at older ages relative to men. For example, the [[2010 United States Census|Census 2010]] reported that there were approximately twice as many women as men living in the United States at 89 years of age (361,309 versus 176,689, respectively).&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

=== Geographic distribution of older adults ===
The number and percentage of older adults living in the United States vary across the four different regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South) defined by the United States census.  In 2010, the South contained the greatest number of people aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older.  However, proportionately, the Northeast contains the largest percentage of adults aged 65 years and older (14.1%), followed by the Midwest (13.5%), the South (13.0%), and the West (11.9%). Relative to the [[Census 2000]], all geographic regions demonstrated positive growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older. The most rapid growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older was evident in the West (23.5%), which showed an increase from 6.9 million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2010.  Likewise, in the population aged 85 years and older, the West (42.8%) also showed the fastest growth and increased from 806,000 in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2010. It is worth highlighting that [[Rhode Island]] was the only state that experienced a reduction in the number of people aged 65 years and older, and declined from 152,402 in 2000 to 151,881 in 2010.  Conversely, all states exhibited an increase in the population of adults aged 85 years and older from 2000 to 2010.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

== Biogerontology ==
[[File:Altenpflege 02.jpg|thumb|The hand of an older adult]]
{{Main|Theories of aging}}
Biogerontology is the sub-field of gerontology concerned with the [[Senescence|biological aging process]], its evolutionary origins, and potential means to intervene in the process. It involves interdisciplinary research on biological aging's causes, effects, and mechanisms.  Conservative biogerontologists such as [[Leonard Hayflick]] have predicted that the human life expectancy will peak at about 92 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watts G |title=Leonard Hayflick and the limits of ageing |journal=Lancet |volume=377 |issue=9783 |page=2075 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21684371 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60908-2 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(11)60908-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others such as [[James Vaupel]] have predicted that in industrialized countries, life expectancies will reach 100 for children born after the year 2000.&lt;ref name=Christensen2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christensen|first1=L|last2=Doblhammer|first2=K|last3=Rau|first3=G|last4=Vaupel|first4=JW|title=Ageing populations: the challenges ahead|journal=Lancet|date=2009|volume=374|issue=9696|pages=1196–1208|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)61460-4|pmid=19801098|pmc=2810516}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some surveyed biogerontologists have predicted life expectancies of two or more centuries.&lt;ref name=Richel2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richel|first1=Theo|title=Will human life expectancy quadruple in the next hundred years?

[[Biomedical gerontology]], also known as experimental gerontology and [[life extension]], is a sub-discipline of biogerontology that endeavors to slow, prevent, and even reverse aging in both humans and animals. Most "[[Anti-aging movement|life extensionists]]" believe the human life span can be increased within the next century, if not sooner. Biogerontologists vary in the degree to which they focus on the study of the aging process as a means of mitigating the [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] or extending lifespan, although most agree that extension of lifespan will necessarily flow from reductions in age-related disease and frailty, although some argue that [[maximum life span]] cannot be altered or that it is undesirable to try. Geroscience is a recently formulated interdisciplinary field that embraces biomedical gerontology as the center of preventing [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] through science.&lt;ref name="Lithgow2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lithgow|first1=Gordon J.|authorlink1=Gordon J. Lithgow|title=Origins of Geroscience|journal=Public Policy &amp; Aging Report|date=1 September 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=10–11|doi=10.1093/ppar/23.4.10|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with biogerontology, which aims to prevent age-related disease by intervening in aging processes, geriatrics is a field of medicine that studies the treatment of existing disease in aging people.

There are numerous theories of aging, and no one theory has been accepted. There is a wide spectrum of the types of theories for the causes of aging with programmed theories on one extreme and error theories on the other. Regardless of the theory, a commonality is that as humans age, functions of the body decline.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |first1=Albert W. |last1=Taylor |first2=Michel J. |last2=Johnson |title=Physiology of Exercise and Healthy Aging |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcGtzfxkFhwC |year=2008 |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=978-0-7360-5838-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stochastic theories ===
Stochastic theories of aging is the suggestion that aging is caused by small changes in the body over time and the body's failure to restore the system and mend the damages to the body. The cells and tissues are eventually injured due to the damage gathered over time. This causes the diminishes in an organ's function related to age. The notion of accumulated damage was first introduced by Weisman as the "wear and tear" theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipsky|first1=Martin S.|last2=King|first2=Mitch|title=Biological theories of aging|journal=Disease-a-Month|date=2015|volume=61|issue=11|pages=460–466|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2015.09.005|pmid=26490576|url=http://www.diseaseamonth.com/article/S0011-5029(15)00146-7/abstract|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wear and tear theory====

Wear and tear theories of aging suggest that as an individual ages, body parts such as cells and organs wear out from continued use. Wearing of the body can be attributable to internal or external causes that eventually lead to an accumulation of [[Insult (medical)|insults]] which surpasses the capacity for repair. Due to these internal and external insults, cells lose their ability to regenerate, which ultimately leads to mechanical and chemical exhaustion. Some insults include chemicals in the air, food, or smoke. Other insults may be things such as viruses, trauma, free radicals, cross-linking, and high body temperature.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

==== Accumulation ====
Accumulation theories of aging suggest that aging is bodily decline that results from an accumulation of elements, whether introduced to the body from the environment or resulting from cell metabolism.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt; An example of an accumulation theory is the Free Radical Theory of Aging.

==== Free radical theory ====
[[Free radicals]] are reactive molecules produced by cellular and environmental processes, and can damage the elements of the cell such as the [[cell membrane]] and [[DNA]] and cause irreversible damage. The [[free-radical theory of aging]] proposes that this damage cumulatively degrades the biological function of cells and impacts the process of aging.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boniewska-Bernacka|first=Ewa|date=2016|title=Selected Theories of Ageing|url=https://depot.ceon.pl/bitstream/handle/123456789/11286/Boniewska.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Higher School's Pulse|volume=10|pages=36–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that free radicals are toxic agents was first proposed by Rebeca Gerschman and colleagues in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenn|first=Rebecca|author2=Gilbert, DL, Nye, SW, Dwyer, P, and Fenn WO|title=Oxygen poisoning and x-irradiation: a mechanism in common|journal=Science|date=7 May 1954|volume=119|issue=3097|pages=623–626|pmid=13156638|bibcode=1954Sci...119..623G|doi=10.1126/science.119.3097.623 |last3=Nye|first3=Sylvanus W.|last4=Dwyer|first4=Peter|last5=Fenn|first5=Wallace O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but came to prominence in 1956, when [[Denham Harman]] proposed the free-radical theory of aging and even demonstrated that free radical reactions contribute to the degradation of biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harman|first=D|title=The aging process|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|date=November 1981|volume=78|issue=11|pages=7124–7128|pmid=6947277 |pmc=349208|doi=10.1073/pnas.78.11.7124 |bibcode=1981PNAS...78.7124H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxidative damage of many types accumulate with age, such as oxidative stress that oxygen-free radicals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hagen|first=Bruce N|author2=MK Shigenaga |author3=TM Hagen |title=Oxidants, antioxidants, and the degenerative diseases of aging |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |date=September 1993 |volume=90 |issue=17|pages=7915–7922 |pmid=8367443|pmc=47258|bibcode=1993PNAS...90.7915A|doi=10.1073/pnas.90.17.7915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the free radical theory of aging argues that aging results from the damage generated by [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckman|first=KB|author2=Ames BN|title=The free radial theory of aging matures|journal=Physiol Rev|date=April 1998|volume=78|issue=2|pages=547–581|pmid=9562038 |doi=10.1152/physrev.1998.78.2.547}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROS are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that can damage a complex of cellular components such as fat, proteins, or from DNA, they are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions. These conditions become more common as humans grow older and include diseases related to aging, such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.

==== DNA damage theory ====

DNA damage has been one of the many causes in diseases related to aging. The stability of the genome is defined by the cells machinery of repair, damage tolerance, and checkpoint pathways that counteracts DNA damage. One hypothesis proposed by [[Gioacchino Failla]] in 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Failla|first=G|title=The aging process and cancerogenesis|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=30 September 1958|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1124–1140|pmid=13583876|bibcode=1958NYASA..71.1124F|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1958.tb46828.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that damage accumulation to the DNA causes aging. The hypothesis was developed soon by physicist [[Leó Szilárd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szilard|first=Leo|title=On the nature of the aging process|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|date=January 1959|volume=45|issue=1|pages=30–45|pmid=16590351|pmc=222509|doi=10.1073/pnas.45.1.30|bibcode=1959PNAS...45...30S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has changed over the years as new research has discovered new types of DNA damage and mutations, and several theories of aging argue that DNA damage with or without mutations causes aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freitas|first=AA|author2=de Magalhaes, JP|title=A review and appraisal of the DNA damage theory of ageing|journal=Mutat Res|date=Jul–Oct 2011|volume=728|issue=1–2|pages=12–22|pmid=21600302|doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2011.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cross-linking theory====

The cross-linking theory proposes that [[advanced glycation end-product]]s (stable bonds formed by the binding of glucose to proteins) and other aberrant [[cross-links]] accumulating in aging tissues is the cause of aging. The crosslinking of proteins disables their biological functions. The hardening of the connective tissue, kidney diseases, and enlargement of the heart are connected to the cross-linking of proteins. [[Crosslinking of DNA]] can induce replication errors, and this leads to deformed cells and increases the risk of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Genetic ===
Genetic theories of aging propose that aging is programmed within each individual's genes. According to this theory, genes dictate cellular longevity. Programmed cell death, or [[apoptosis]], is determined by a "biological clock" via genetic information in the nucleus of the cell. Genes responsible for apoptosis provide an explanation for cell death, but are less applicable to death of an entire organism. An increase in cellular apoptosis may correlate to aging, but is not a 'cause of death'. Environmental factors and genetic mutations can influence gene expression and accelerate aging. More recently epigenetics have been explored as a contributing factor. The [[Biological clock (aging)|epigenetic clock]], which objectively measures the biological age of cells and tissues, may become useful for testing different biological aging theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Horvath S |title=

=== General imbalance ===
General imbalance theories of aging suggest that body systems, such as the [[Endocrine system|endocrine]], [[Nervous system|nervous]], and immune systems, gradually decline and ultimately fail to function. The rate of failure varies system by system.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt;

====Immunological theory====

The immunological theory of aging suggests that the immune system weakens as an organism ages. This makes the organism unable to fight infections and less able to destroy old and [[Neoplasm|neoplastic cells]]. This leads to aging and will eventually lead to death. This theory of aging was developed by Ray Walford, an American gerontologist. According to Walford, incorrect immunological procedures are the cause of the process of aging.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Social gerontology ==
Social gerontology is a multi-disciplinary sub-field that specializes in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in [[social work]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[demography]], [[public health]], or other [[social science]] disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for educating, researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people.

Because issues of life span and life extension need numbers to quantify them, there is an overlap with [[demography]]. Those who study the demography of the human life span differ from those who study the social demographics of aging.

=== Social theories of aging ===
Several theories of aging are developed to observe the aging process of older adults in society as well as how these processes are interpreted by men and women as they age.&lt;ref name=Phillipson&gt;{{cite book |first1=C. |last1=Phillipson |first2=J. |last2=Baars |chapter=Ch. 4: Social theory and social ageing |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C&amp;pg=PA68 |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=J. |editor2-last=Peace |editor2-first=S. M. |editor3-last=Dittmann-Kohli |editor3-first=F. |editor4-last=Westerhof |editor4-first=G. |title=Ageing in Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C |year=2007 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-4129-0020-1 |pages=68–84 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Activity theory ====
[[Activity theory (aging)|Activity theory]] was developed and elaborated by Cavan, Havighurst, and Albrecht. According to this theory, older adults' self-concept depends on social interactions. In order for older adults to maintain morale in old age, substitutions must be made for lost roles. Examples of lost roles include retirement from a job or loss of a spouse.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Activity is preferable to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, [[post-industrial society]], which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack of a desire to do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.&lt;ref name="allnurses-breakroom.com"&gt;VickyRN. (August 2, '09). Theories of Aging (Part 3) - Sociological Theories. Retrieved Friday, April 20, 2012, from http://allnurses-breakroom.com/showthread.php?t=412760&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disengagement theory ====
[[Disengagement theory]] was developed by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other. An example of mutual separation is retirement from the workforce. A key assumption of this theory is that older adults lose "ego-energy" and become increasingly self-absorbed. Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an escape clause - namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful adjusters to old age.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Gradual withdrawal from society and relationships preserves social equilibrium and promotes self-reflection for elders who are freed from societal roles. It furnishes an orderly means for the transfer of knowledge, capital, and power from the older generation to the young. It makes it possible for society to continue functioning after valuable older members die.

==== Continuity theory ====
[[Continuity theory]] is an elusive concept. On one hand,
to exhibit continuity can mean to remain the same, to
be uniform, homogeneous, unchanging, even humdrum.
This static view of continuity is not very applicable
to human aging. On the other hand, a dynamic
view of continuity starts with the idea of a basic
structure which persists over time, but it allows for a
variety of changes to occur within the context provided
by the basic structure. The basic structure is
coherent: It has an orderly or logical relation of parts
that is recognizably unique and that allows us to
differentiate that structure from others. With the
introduction of the concept of time, ideas such as
direction, sequence, character development, and
story line enter into the concept of continuity as it is
applied to the evolution of a human being. In this
theory, a dynamic concept of continuity is developed
and applied to the issue of adaptation to normal
aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Blalock, H.M. |title=Conceptualization and measurement in the social sciences |publisher=Sage |location=Beverly Hills |year=1982 |isbn=978-0803918047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central premise of continuity theory is that, in
making adaptive choices, middle-aged and older
adults attempt to preserve and maintain existing internal
and external structures and that they prefer to
accomplish this objective by using continuity (i.e.,
applying familiar strategies in familiar arenas of life).
In middle and later life, adults are drawn by the
weight of past experience to use continuity as a
primary adaptive strategy for dealing with changes
associated with normal aging. To the extent that
change builds upon, and has links to, the person's
past, change is a part of continuity. As a result of both
their own perceptions and pressures from the social
environment, individuals who are adapting to normal
aging are both predisposed and motivated
toward inner psychological continuity as well as outward
continuity of social behavior and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hage, J. |title=Techniques and problems of theory construction in sociology |publisher=Wiley Interscience |location=New York |year=1972 |isbn=978-0471338604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuity theory views both internal and
external continuity as robust adaptive strategies that
are supported by both individual preference and
social sanctions. Continuity theory consists of general
adaptive principles that people who are normally 
aging could be expected to follow, explanations of
how these principles work, and a specification of
general areas of life in which these principles could
be expected to apply. Accordingly, continuity theory
has enormous potential as a general theory of
adaptation to individual aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Abraham |last=Kaplan |title=The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ks8wuZHSKs8C |year=1964 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-7658-0448-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age stratification theory ====
According to this theory, older adults born during different time periods form [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]s that define "age strata". There are two differences among strata: chronological age and historical experience. This theory makes two arguments. 1. Age is a mechanism for regulating behavior and as a result determines access to positions of power. 2. Birth cohorts play an influential role in the process of social change.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

==== Life course theory ====
According to this theory, which stems from the Life Course Perspective (Bengston and Allen, 1993),&lt;ref name=life&gt;Life Course Theory-Historical Development, Key Principles and Concepts, Selected Research Applications:http://family.jrank.org/pages/1074/Life-Course-Theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; aging occurs from birth to death. Aging involves social, psychological, and biological processes. Additionally, aging experiences are shaped by cohort and period effects.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Also reflecting the life course focus,
consider the implications for how societies might function when age-based
norms vanish—a consequence of the deinstitutionalization of the life course—
and suggest that these implications pose new challenges for theorizing aging
and the life course in postindustrial societies. Dramatic reductions in mortality,
morbidity, and fertility over the past several decades have so shaken up the
organization of the life course and the nature of educational, work, family, and
leisure experiences that it is now possible for individuals to become old in new
ways. The configurations and content of other life stages are being altered as
well, especially for women. In consequence, theories of age and aging will need
to be reconceptualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rowe, J.W. |author2=Kahn, R.L. |title=Successful aging |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=978-0375400452 }}&lt;br&gt;Webster, N. (2003). Webster's new American dictionary. New York: HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cumulative advantage/disadvantage theory ====
According to this theory, which was developed beginning in the 1960s by Derek Price and Robert Merton and elaborated on by several researchers such as Dale Dannefer,&lt;ref name=Dennefer&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dannefer D |title=Cumulative advantage/disadvantage and the life course: cross-fertilizing age and social science theory |journal=J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=S327–37 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14614120 |doi=10.1093/geronb/58.6.S327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; inequalities have a tendency to become more pronounced throughout the aging process. A paradigm of this theory can be expressed in the adage "[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]". Advantages and disadvantages in early life stages have a profound effect throughout the life span. However, advantages and disadvantages in middle adulthood have a direct influence on economic and health status in later life.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

== Environmental gerontology ==
Environmental gerontology is a specialization within gerontology that seeks an understanding and interventions to optimize the relationship between aging persons and their physical and social environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sanchez-Gonzalez, D. |author2=Rodriguez-Rodriguez, V. |title=Environmental Gerontology in Europe and Latin America. Policies and perspectives on environment and aging|year=2016|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-3-319-21418-4|page=284|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rowles, Graham D. |author2=Bernard, Miriam|title=Environmental Gerontology: Making Meaningful Places in Old Age|year=2013|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0826108135|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scheidt, Rick J. |author2=Schwarz, Benyamin|title=Environmental Gerontology. What Now?|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-62616-3|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field emerged in the 1930s during the first studies on behavioral and social gerontology. In the 1970s and 1980s, research confirmed the importance of the physical and social environment in understanding the aging population and improved the quality of life in old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wahl, H-W. |author2=Scheidt, R.J. |author3=Windley, P.G. |title=Annual Review of Gerontology and Geriatrics. Focus on Aging context: Socio-Physical Environments|year=2004|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0826117342|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies of environmental gerontology indicate that older people prefer to age in their immediate environment, whereas spatial experience and place attachment are important for understanding the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrews, GJ.  |author2=Phillips, DR.|title=Ageing and Place: Perspectives, Policy, Practice|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415481656|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research indicates that the physical-social environment is related to the [[longevity]] and [[quality of life]] of the [[elderly]]. Precisely, the [[natural environment]] (such as natural therapeutic [[landscapes]], [[therapeutic garden]]) contributes to active and healthy aging in the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2015 |volume=60 |issue=60 | title=Physical-social environments and aging population from environmental gerontology and geography.

== Jurisprudential gerontology ==
Jurisprudential gerontology (sometimes referred to as "geriatric jurisprudence") is a specialization within gerontology that looks into the ways laws and legal structures interact with the aging experience. The field started from legal scholars in the field of [[elder law]], which found that looking into legal issues of older persons without a broader inter-disciplinary perspective does not provide the ideal legal outcome. Using theories such as [[therapeutic jurisprudence]], jurisprudential scholars critically examined existing legal institutions (e.g. adult guardianship, [[End-of-life care|end of life]] care, or [[Nursing home residents' rights|nursing homes]] regulations) and showed how law should look more closely to the social and psychological aspects of its real-life operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mlv15&amp;div=27&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Therapeutic Jurisprudence and End-of-Life Medical Care: Physician Perceptions of a Statute's Impact Medical Law 15 Medicine and Law 1996|pages=201–17|journal=Medicine and Law|volume=15|issue=2|access-date=2018-03-20|year=1996|last1=Kapp|first1=Marshall B.|pmid=8908972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other streams within jurisprudential gerontology also encouraged physicians and lawyers to try to improve their cooperation and better understand how laws and regulatory institutions affect health and well being of older persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doron|first=Israel|last2=Meenan|first2=Helen|date=2012|title=Time for Geriatric Jurisprudence|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/335324|journal=Gerontology|language=english|volume=58|issue=3|pages=193–6|doi=10.1159/000335324|pmid=22538767|issn=0304-324X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ICRANet''', the '''International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics Network''', is an [[international organization]] which promotes research activities in relativistic astrophysics and related areas. Its members are four countries and three Universities and Research Centers: the [[Armenia|Republic of Armenia]], the [[Brazil|Federative Republic of Brazil]], [[Italy|Italian Republic]], the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]], the [[University of Arizona]] (USA), [[Stanford University]] (USA) and [[International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics|ICRA]].

ICRANet headquarters are located in [[Pescara]], Italy.

== History of ICRANet foundation: ICRA and ICRANet ==

=== ICRA and ICRANet ===

In 1985, the International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICRA|url=http://www.icra.it/|website=ICRA|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223074040/http://www.icra.it/|archive-date=2008-02-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics|ICRA]] was founded by [[Remo Ruffini]] ([[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome "La Sapienza"]]) together with [[Riccardo Giacconi]] ([[Nobel Prize]] for Physics 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2002|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2002/summary/|publisher=[[Nobel Committee]]|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008225757/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2002/summary/|archive-date=2018-10-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Abdus Salam]] (Nobel Prize for Physics 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/summary/|publisher=[[Nobel Committee]]|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914132820/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/summary|archive-date=2018-09-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Paul Boynton ([[University of Washington]]), [[George Coyne]] (former director of the [[Vatican Observatory|Vatican observatory]]), [[Francis Everitt]] ([[Stanford University]]) and [[Fang Lizhi|Fang Li-Zhi]] ([[University of Science and Technology of China]]).

The Statute and the Agreement establishing of ICRANet were signed on March 19, 2003, and they were recognized in the same year by the [[Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] and the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]]. ICRANet has been created in 2005 by a law of the Italian Government, ratified by the Italian Parliament and signed by the President of the Italian Republic [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] on February 10, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEGGE 10 febbraio 2005, n. 31|url=http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/vediMenuHTML?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2005-03-05&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=005G0050&amp;tipoSerie=serie_generale&amp;tipoVigenza=originario|publisher=Gazzetta Ufficiale dell Repubblica Italiana|access-date=2015-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126185845/http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/vediMenuHTML?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2005-03-05&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=005G0050&amp;tipoSerie=serie_generale&amp;tipoVigenza=originario|archive-date=2015-11-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Republic of Armenia, [[Italy|Italian Republic]], the Vatican City State, ICRA, the [[University of Arizona]] and the [[Stanford University]] are the founding members.

On September 12, 2005, ICRANet Steering Committee was established and had its first meeting: Remo Ruffini and Fang Li-Zhi were appointed respectively Director and Chairman of the Steering Committee. On December 19, 2006 ICRANet Scientific Committee was established and had its first meeting in Washington DC. Riccardo Giacconi was appointed Chairman and John Mester Co-Chairman.

On September 21, 2005 the Director of ICRANet signed, together with the then Ambassador of Brazil in Rome Dante Coelho De Lima the adhesion of the [[Brazil|Federative Republic of Brazil]] to ICRANet. The entrance of Brazil, requested by the then President of Brazil [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Luiz Ignácio Lula Da Silva]] has been unanimously ratified by the Brazilian Parliament. On August 12, 2011, the then President of Brazil [[Dilma Rousseff]] signed the entrance of Brazil in ICRANet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DECRETO Nº 7.552, DE 12 DE AGOSTO DE 2011.|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2011-2014/2011/Decreto/D7552.htm|website=Presidência da República|publisher=Presidência da República|access-date=2015-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126173536/http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2011-2014/2011/Decreto/D7552.htm|archive-date=2015-11-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marcel Grossmann meetings ===

By the beginning of the twentieth century the new branch of mathematics, tensor calculus, was developed in the works of [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro|Gregorio Ricci Curbastro]] and [[Tullio Levi-Civita|Tullio Levi Civita]] of the [[University of Padua]] and the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome "La Sapienza"]]. [[Marcel Grossmann]] of the [[University of Zurich]] who had a deep knowledge of the Italian school of geometry and who was close to Einstein introduced to him these concepts. The collaboration between Einstein and Grossmann was [[History of general relativity|essential]] for the development of General Relativity.

Remo Ruffini and Abdus Salam in 1975 established the Marcel Grossmann meetings (MG) on Recent Developments in Theoretical and Experimental General Relativity, Gravitation, and Relativistic Field Theories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcel Grossmann Meetings|url=http://www.icranet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=258|website=icranet.org|publisher=ICRANet|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126165119/http://www.icranet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=258|archive-date=2015-11-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which take place every three years in different countries, gathering more then 1000 researchers. MG1 and MG2 were held in 1975 and in 1979 in [[Trieste]]; MG3 in 1982 in [[Shanghai]]; MG4 in 1985 in Rome; MG5 in 1988 in [[Perth]]; MG6 in 1991 in [[Kyoto]]; MG7 in 1994 at [[Stanford, California|Stanford]]; MG8 in 1997 in [[Jerusalem]]; MG9 in 2000 in Rome; MG10 in 2003 in [[Rio de Janeiro]]; MG11 in 2006 in [[Berlin]]; MG12 in 2009 in [[Paris]]; MG13 in 2012 in [[Stockholm]]; MG14 in 2015 and MG15 in 2018 both in Rome. Since its foundation, ICRANet has always played a leading role in the organization of those meetings.

=== Brazilian Science Data Center ===
The main objective of the Brazilian Science Data Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BSDC|url=http://bsdc.icranet.org/|publisher=ICRANet|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208073146/http://bsdc.icranet.org/|archive-date=2015-12-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (BSDC) is to provide data of all international space missions existing on the wavelength of X- and gamma rays, and later on the whole electromagnetic spectrum, for all the galactic and extragalactic sources of the Universe. A special attention will be paid to the achievement and the complete respect of the levels defined by the [[International Virtual Observatory Alliance]] (IVOA). In addition to these specific objectives, BSDC will promote technical seminars, annual workshops and it will assure a plan of scientific divulgation and popularization of science with the aim of the understanding of the Universe.

The BSDC is currently being implemented at CBPF, and at the [[Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul]] (UFRGS), and will be expanded to all other ICRANet centers in Brazil as well as to the other Latin-American ICRANet Centers in [[Argentina]], [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]]: a unique coordinated continental research network planned for Latin America.

'''Incremental reading''' is a software-assisted method for learning and retaining information from reading, helping with the creation of [[flashcard|flashcards]] out of electronic articles read in portions inside a prioritized reading list.

It is particularly targeted to people who are trying to [[lifelong learning|learn for life]] a large amount of information, particularly if that information comes from various sources.

"Incremental reading" means "reading in portions". Instead of a linear reading of articles one at a time, the method works by keeping a large reading list of electronic articles or books (often dozens or hundreds of them) and reading parts of several articles in each session. Articles in the reading list are prioritized by the user.

In the course of reading, key points of articles are broken up into [[flashcard|flashcards]], which are then learned and reviewed over an extended period of time with the help of a [[spaced repetition]] algorithm.

This use of flashcards at later stages of the process is based on psychological principles of [[long-term memory]] storage and retrieval, in particular the [[spacing effect]] (the phenomenon whereby learning is greater when studying is spread out over time) and the [[testing effect]] (the finding that long-term memory is increased when some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving the to-be-remembered information through testing).

Current implementations include [[spaced repetition]] software [[Anki (software)|Anki]] – through an add-on&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1081195335|title=Incremental Reading Add-on|publisher=AnkiWeb|date=2017-11-10|accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and [[SuperMemo]]. There is also incremental reading support for the text editors [[Emacs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IncrementalReading |title=Incremental Reading |publisher=EmacsWiki |date=2007-03-06 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yi (editor)|Yi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://code.haskell.org/yi/src/Yi/Mode/IReader.hs&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The method itself is often credited to the Polish software developer [[Piotr Woźniak (researcher)|Piotr Wozniak]]. He implemented the first version of incremental reading in 1999 in [[SuperMemo|SuperMemo 99]], providing the essential tools of the method: a prioritized reading list, and the possibility to extract portions of articles and to create [[Cloze test|cloze deletions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#History_of_incremental_learning|title=History of incremental reading|quote=SuperMemo 99 made the first step towards efficient reading of electronic articles by introducing reading lists and the first primitive reading tools: extracts and clozes. Reading lists are prioritized lists of articles to read. Extracts make it possible to split larger articles into smaller portions. Clozes make it possible to convert short sentences into question-answer format by means of cloze deletions.|accessdate=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "incremental reading" itself appeared the next year with [[SuperMemo|SuperMemo 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#History_of_incremental_learning|title=History of incremental reading|quote=SuperMemo 2000 greatly increased the efficiency of reading by introducing the concept of incremental reading.|accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later SuperMemo programmes subsequently enhanced the tools and techniques involved, such as webpage imports, material overload handling, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#History_of_incremental_learning|title=History of incremental reading|accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited incremental reading support for the text editor [[Emacs]] appeared in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rc;all=1;from=1;showedit=1;rcidonly=IncrementalReading|title=Emacs Wiki: recent changes to "Incremental Reading"|date=2007-02-25|accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Anki (software)|Anki]] add-on for incremental reading was later published in 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frankraiser.de/drupal/AnkiIR|title=Anki Incremental reading|author=Frank Raiser|date=2011-03-15|accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Anki 2.0 and 2.1, another add-on is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1081195335|title=Incremental Reading Add-on|publisher=AnkiWeb|date=2017-11-10|accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incremental reading was the first of a series of related concepts invented by [[Piotr Wozniak (researcher)|Piotr Wozniak]]: incremental image learning, incremental video, incremental audio, incremental mail processing, incremental problem solving, and incremental writing. "Incremental learning" is the term Wozniak uses to refer to those concepts as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#Components_of_incremental_learning|title=Components of incremental learning|accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==

When reading an electronic article, the user extracts the most important parts (similar to underlining or highlighting a paper article) and gradually distills them into [[flashcards]]. Flashcards are information presented in a question-answer format (making [[active recall]] possible). [[Cloze deletions]] are often used in incremental reading, as they are easy to create out of text. Both extracts and flashcards are scheduled independently from the original article.

With time and reviews, articles are supposed to be gradually converted into extracts, and extracts into flashcards. Hence, incremental reading is a method of breaking down information from electronic articles into sets of flashcards.

Contrary to extracts, flashcards are reviewed with [[active recall]]. This means that extracts such as "George Washington was the first U.S. President" must ultimately be converted into questions such as "Who was the first U.S. President?" (Answer: George Washington), or "Who was George Washington?" (Answer: the first U.S. President), etc, or [[cloze deletion|cloze deletions]] such as "[BLANK] was the first U.S. President", "George Washington was [BLANK]", etc.

This flashcard creation process is semi-automated – the reader chooses which material to learn and edits the precise wording of the questions, while the software assists in prioritizing articles and making the flashcards, and does the scheduling: it calculates the ideal time for the reader to review each chunk, according to the rules of [[spaced repetition]]. This means that all processed pieces of information are presented at increasing intervals.

Individual articles are read in portions proportional to the [[attention span]], which depends on the user, their mood, the article, etc. This allows for a substantial gain in attention, according to [[Piotr Wozniak (researcher)|Piotr Wozniak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Piotr Wozniak |url= https://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm#Attention|title=Advantages of incremental reading: attention|accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the use of spaced repetition, the reader would quickly get lost in the glut of information when studying dozens of subjects in parallel. However, spaced repetition makes it possible to retain traces of the processed material in memory.

In [[linguistics]], '''information structure''', also called information packaging, describes the way in which information is formally packaged within a sentence.&lt;ref name="lambrecht"&gt;Lambrecht, Knud. 1994. ''Information structure and sentence form.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This generally includes only those aspects of information that “respond to the temporary state of the addressee’s mind”, and excludes other aspects of linguistic information such as references to background (encyclopedic/common) knowledge, choice of style, [[politeness]], and so forth.&lt;ref name="krifka"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krifka|first=Manfred|authorlink=Manfred Krifka|title=Basic notions of information structure|journal=Acta Linguistica Hungarica|volume=55|issue=3–4|pages=243–276|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|location=Budapest|year=2008|issn=1216-8076|doi=10.1556/ALing.55.2008.3-4.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the difference between an active clause (e.g., ''the police want him'') and a corresponding passive (e.g., ''he is wanted by police'') is a syntactic difference, but one motivated by information structuring considerations. Other structures motivated by information structure include preposing (e.g., ''that one I don't like'') and inversion (e.g., ''"the end", said the man'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huddleston|first1=Rodney|last2=Pullum|first2=Geoff K|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic notions of information structure are [[focus (linguistics)|focus]], [[givenness]], and [[topic-comment|topic]],&lt;ref name="krifka"/&gt; as well as their complementary notions of background, newness, and comment respectively.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kučerová|first1=Ivona|last2=Neeleman|first2=Ad|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|title=Contrasts and positions in information structure|location=[[Cambridge]]|year=2012|pages=1–23|isbn=978-1-107-00198-5|url=http://www.cambridge.org/9781107001985}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Focus''' “indicates the presence of alternatives that are relevant for the interpretation of linguistic expressions”, '''givenness''' indicates that “the denotation of an expression is present” in the immediate context of the utterance, and '''topic''' is “the entity that a speaker identifies, about which then information, the comment, is given”.&lt;ref name="krifka"/&gt; Additional notions in information structure may include contrast and exhaustivity, but there is no general agreement in the linguistic literature about extensions of the basic three notions.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman"/&gt; There are many different approaches, such as generative or functional architectures, to information structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Mechanisms in various languages ==
Information structure can be realized through a wide variety of linguistic mechanisms.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman" /&gt; In the spoken form of [[English language|English Language]], one of the primary methods of indicating information structure is through [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], whereby [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is modified from some default pattern. Other languages use syntactic mechanisms like [[dislocation (syntax)|dislocation]], [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]], and [[gapping]]; morphological mechanisms like specialized focus or topic-marking [[affix]]es; and specialized [[discourse particle]]s. English in fact uses more than intonation for expressing information structure, so that [[cleft sentence|clefts]] are used for exhaustive focus, and [[grammatical particle]]s like ''only'' also induce contrastive focus readings.

Cross-linguistically, there are clear tendencies that relate notions of information structure to particular linguistic phenomena. For instance, focus tends to be [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodically]] prominent, and there do not seem to be any languages that express focus by [[metrical phonology|deaccenting]] or destressing.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman" /&gt;

The following German sentences exhibit three different kinds of syntactic ‘fronting’ that correlate with topic.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman"/&gt;

: a. _Diesen Mann_ habe ich noch nie gesehen.
: ‘This man have I not yet seen.’ '''(movement)'''
b. _Diesen Mann_, den habe ich noch nie gesehen.
: ‘This man, that I have not yet seen.’ '''(left dislocation)'''
: c. _Diesen Mann_, ich habe ihn noch nie gesehen.
: ‘This man, I have not yet seen him.’ '''(hanging topic)'''

It is often assumed that answers to questions are focused elements. Question and answer pairs are often used as diagnostics for focus, as in the following English examples.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman"/&gt;

:Q: What did John do with the book yesterday?
:A: He SOLD the book yesterday.
:A: *He sold the book YESTERDAY.

:Q: When did Jane sell the book?
:A: She sold the book YESTERDAY.
:A: *She SOLD the book yesterday.

== Concepts ==

=== Focus and background ===
{{Main|Focus (linguistics)}}
''Focus'' is a grammatical category or attribute that determines indicating that part of an utterance contributes new, non-derivable, or contrastive information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Notes on transitivity and theme in English: Part 2|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022226700016613|accessdate = 2015-07-08|last = Halliday|first = M. A. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some theories (in line with work by Mats Rooth) link focus to the presence of ''alternatives'' (see [[Focus (linguistics)#Alternative semantics|Focus: Alternative Semantics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A theory of focus interpretation|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02342617|journal = Natural Language Semantics|date = 1992|issn = 0925-854X|pages = 75–116|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/BF02342617|first = Mats|last = Rooth}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternatives theory of focus would account for the stress pattern in the example from the previous section (When did Jane sell the book? She sold the book YESTERDAY), saying that YESTERDAY receives focus because it could be substituted with alternative time periods (TODAY or LAST WEEK) and still serve to answer the question the first speaker asked.

''Background'' is a more difficult concept to define; it's not simply the complement of focus. Daniel P. Hole gives the following framework: "‘Focus’ is a relational notion, and the entity a focus relates to is called its background, or presupposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Focus and Background Marking in Mandarin Chinese: System and theory behind cái, jiù, dōu and ye.|url = http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/ilg/institut/mitarbeiter/hole/schriften/Hole2004a.pdf|website = www.uni-stuttgart.de|accessdate = 2015-07-15|last = Hole|first = Daniel P.|date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''topic'' (or theme) of a sentence is what is being talked about, and the ''comment'' (or rheme, or sometimes focus) is what is being said about the topic. That the information structure of a clause is divided in this way is generally agreed on, but the boundary between topic/theme depends on grammatical theory. Topic is grammaticized in languages like Japanese and Korean, which have a designated [[Topic marker|topic-marker]] morpheme affixed to the topic.

Some diagnostics have been proposed for languages that lack grammatical topic-markers, like English; they attempt to distinguish between different kinds of topics (such as "aboutness" topics and "contrastive" topics).&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Craige (2001). "Topics". In ''Semantics: An international handbook of natural language meaning''. Vol. 33. (Eds. Claudia Maienborn, Klaus von Heusinger, and Paul Portner). Walter de Gruyter. pp.1908-1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnostics consist of judging how felicitous it is to follow a discourse with either questions (''What about x?'') or sentences beginning with certain phrases (''About x, ... Speaking of x,'' ... ''As for x'', ...) to determine how "topical" ''x'' is in that context.

=== Given and new ===
Intuitively, ''givenness'' classifies words and information in a discourse that are already known (or given) by virtue of being common knowledge, or by having been discussed previously in the same discourse ("anaphorically recoverable").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Certain theories (such as Roger Schwarzschild's GIVENness Constraint) require all non-focus-marked constituents to be given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = GIVENNESS, AVOIDF AND OTHER CONSTRAINTS ON THE PLACEMENT OF ACCENT*|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1008370902407|journal = Natural Language Semantics|date = 1999|issn = 0925-854X|pages = 141–177|volume = 7|issue = 2|doi = 10.1023/A:1008370902407|first = Roger|last = Schwarzschild}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Words/information that are not given, or are "textually and situationally non-derivable"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; are by definition ''new''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4936">'''K correction''' is a correction to an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] object's [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] (or equivalently, its [[flux]]) that allows a measurement of a quantity of light from an object at a [[redshift]] ''z'' to be converted to an equivalent measurement in the [[rest frame]] of the object. If one could measure all the light from an object at all [[wavelength]]s (a bolometric flux), a K correction would not be required. If one measures the light emitted in an [[emission line]], a K-correction is not required. The need for a K-correction arises because an astronomical measurement through a single [[filter (optics)|filter]] or a single bandpass only sees a fraction of the total [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], redshifted into the frame of the observer. So if the observer wants to compare the measurements through a red filter of objects at different redshifts, the observer will have to apply estimates of the K corrections to these measurements to make a comparison.

One claim for the origin of the term "K correction" is [[Edwin Hubble]], who supposedly arbitrarily chose &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; to represent the reduction factor in magnitude due to this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Effects of Red Shifts on the Distribution of Nebulae | authorlink=Edwin Hubble | first=Edwin | last=Hubble | date=1936 | journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] | volume=84 | pages=517–554 | doi=10.1086/143782 | bibcode=1936ApJ....84..517H| pmc=1076828 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Kinney et al., in footnote 7 on page 48 of their article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Template ultraviolet spectra to near-infrared spectra of star-forming galaxies and their application to K-corrections | first1=Anne | last1=Kinney | date=1996 | journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] | volume=467 | pages=38–60 | doi=10.1086/177583 | last2=Calzetti | first2=Daniela | last3=Bohlin | first3=Ralph C. | last4=McQuade | first4=Kerry | last5=Storchi-Bergmann | first5=Thaisa | last6=Schmitt | first6=Henrique R. | bibcode=1996ApJ...467...38K}}&lt;/ref&gt; note an earlier origin from [[Carl Wilhelm Wirtz]] (1918),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/asna.19182061302 | first=V.C. | last=Wirtz | title=Über die Bewegungen der Nebelflecke | date=1918 | journal=[[Astronomische Nachrichten]] | volume=206 | issue=13 | pages=109|bibcode = 1918AN....206..109W }}&lt;/ref&gt; who referred to the correction as a ''Konstante'' (German for "constant"), hence K-correction.

The K-correction can be defined as follows

:&lt;math&gt; M = m - 5 (\log_{10}{D_L} - 1) - K_{Corr}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

I.E. the adjustment to the standard relationship between [[Absolute magnitude|absolute]] and [[Apparent magnitude|apparent]] magnitude required to correct for the redshift effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogg|first=David|title=The K Correction|url=http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[luminosity distance]] measured in [[parsecs]].

The exact nature of the calculation that needs to be applied in order to perform a K correction depends upon the type of filter used to make the observation and the shape of the object's spectrum. If multi-color [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] measurements are available for a given object thus defining its spectral energy distribution ([[Spectral Energy Distribution|SED]]), K corrections then can be computed by [[Curve fitting|fitting]] it against a theoretical or empirical [[Spectral Energy Distribution|SED]] template.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0606170|title=K-corrections and filter transformations in the ultraviolet, optical, and near infrared|journal=[[The Astronomical Journal]]|volume=133|issue=2|pages=734|bibcode=2007AJ....133..734B|author1=Blanton|first1=Michael R.|last2=Roweis|first2=Sam|date=2007|doi=10.1086/510127}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that K corrections in many frequently used broad-band filters for low-redshift [[Galaxy|galaxies]] can be precisely approximated using two-dimensional [[polynomial]]s as functions of a [[redshift]] and one observed [[Color index|color]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1002.2360|title=Analytical approximations of K-corrections in optical and near-infrared bands|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=405|pages=1409|bibcode=2010MNRAS.405.1409C|author1=Chilingarian|first1=Igor V.|last2=Melchior|first2=Anne-Laure|last3=Zolotukhin|first3=Ivan Yu.|date=2010|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16506.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is implemented in the K corrections calculator web-service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kcor.sai.msu.ru|title=K-corrections calculator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kebony''' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] wood producer. The company has its roots in Wood Polymer Technologies (WPT), which was founded in 1996 and changed its name to Kebony in 2007. Kebony has a factory in [[Skien, Norway|Skien]] (Norway) and offices in [[Oslo, Norway|Oslo]] (Norway).

==Technology==

Kebony has developed an environmental technology which provides an alternative to threatened and endangered tropical hardwoods, and traditional impregnated wood. In the process, a liquid byproduct of the sugar industry, [[furfuryl alcohol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of the Kebony Technology |url=http://www.martenshout.be/assets/pdf/Kebony_tech-EXT_Jan14.pdf |publisher=martenshout.be |accessdate=11 Jan 2015 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to treat the wood. Using pressure, vacuum and heat treatment, the liquid transforms to [[furan resin]] and is tied together with the cell structure of the wood in order to improve the wood's abilities permanently. The woods used are [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]-certified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Stewardship Council|url=http://www.fsc.org/|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification|PEFC]]-certified and carry the [[Nordic Ecolabel]] "the Swan".

The technology has been described in multiple articles in media such as CNN,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whiteman|first=Hilary|title=From Norway, an eco-alternative to teak|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/BUSINESS/07/05/kebony.wood.deforestation/index.html|publisher=CNN.com|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kebony CEO Christian Jebsen tells CNN's Jim Boulden about the company's eco-friendly alternative to tropical hardwood. |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/business/2009/07/05/going.green.kebony.wood.cnn.html |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=31 May 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Eco-yacht' in Round the Island Race|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-12478847|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Economist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hard act to follow  Environment: Making softwoods more durable could reduce the demand for unsustainably logged tropical hardwoods|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14299540|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Financial Times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Timber, but not as we know it|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/f6e5b004-84ae-11df-9cbb-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1NvUkqggq|accessdate=31 May 2011|newspaper=Financial Times|date=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''kill chain''' was originally used as a [[military]] concept related to the structure of an [[Offensive (military)|attack]]; consisting of target identification, force dispatch to target, decision and order to attack the target, and finally the destruction of the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cno.navylive.dodlive.mil/2013/04/23/kill-chain-approach-4/ | title=Kill Chain Approach | work=Chief of Naval Operations | date=April 23, 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613233413/http://cno.navylive.dodlive.mil/2013/04/23/kill-chain-approach-4/ | archivedate=June 13, 2013 | deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the idea of "breaking" an opponent's kill chain is a method of [[defense (military)|defense]] or preemptive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/17/breaking-the-kill-chain/ | title=Breaking the Kill Chain | work=Foreign Policy | date=May 17, 2013 | accessdate=June 30, 2016 | author=Jonathan Greenert | author2=Mark Welsh}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Lockheed Martin]] adapted this concept to [[information security]], using it as a method for modeling intrusions on a [[computer network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How Lockheed Martin's 'Kill Chain' Stopped SecurID Attack | work=DARKReading | date=January 12, 2013 | accessdate=June 30, 2016 | author=Higgins, Kelly Jackson | url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/how-lockheed-martins-kill-chain-stopped-securid-attack/d/d-id/1139125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cyber kill chain model has seen some adoption in the information security community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/leveraging-the-kill-chain-for-awesome/a/d-id/1317810 | title=Leveraging The Kill Chain For Awesome | work=DARKReading | date=December 2, 2014 | accessdate=June 30, 2016 | author=Mason, Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, acceptance is not universal, with critics pointing to what they believe are fundamental flaws in the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/2134037/strategic-planning-erm/the-practicality-of-the-cyber-kill-chain-approach-to-security.html | title=The practicality of the Cyber Kill Chain approach to security | work=CSO Online | date=October 4, 2013 | accessdate=June 30, 2016 | author=Myers, Lysa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The military kill chain==
===F2T2EA===
One military kill chain model is the "F2T2EA", which includes the following phases:
*Find: Locate the target.
*Fix:  Fix their location; or make it difficult for them to move.
*Track: Monitor their movement.
*Target: Select an appropriate weapon or asset to use on the target to create desired effects.
*Engage: Apply the weapon to the target.
*Assess: Evaluate effects of the attack, including any intelligence gathered at the location.

This is an integrated, end-to-end process described as a "chain" because an interruption at any stage can interrupt the entire process.&lt;ref name=Lockheed&gt;[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf Lockheed-Martin Corporation-Hutchins, Cloppert, and Amin-Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains-2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous terminology===
The "Four Fs" is a military term used in the United States military, especially during World War II.

Designed to be easy to remember, the "Four Fs" are as follows:

*Find the enemy – Locate the enemy
*Fix the enemy – Pin them down with suppressing fire
*Fight the enemy – Engage the enemy in combat or flank the enemy – Send soldiers to the enemy's sides or rear
*Finish the enemy – Eliminate all enemy combatants

===North Korean nuclear capability===
A new American military contingency plan called "Kill Chain" is reportedly the first step in a new strategy to use satellite imagery to identify North Korean launch sites, nuclear facilities and manufacturing capability and destroy them pre-emptively if a conflict seems imminent.  The plan was mentioned in a joint statement by the United States and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/world/asia/pentagon-spy-satellites-north-korea-missiles.html|title=Tiny Satellites From Silicon Valley May Help Track North Korea Missiles|last=Sanger|first=David E.|date=July 6, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kr.usembassy.gov/063017-joint-statement-united-states-republic-korea/|title=06/30/17 - Joint Statement between the United States and the Republic of Korea {{!}} U.S. Embassy &amp; Consulate in Korea|date=2017-06-30|work=U.S. Embassy &amp; Consulate in Korea|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attack phases and countermeasures===
Computer scientists at Lockheed-Martin corporation described a new "intrusion kill chain" framework or model to defend computer networks in 2011.&lt;ref name=Lockheed/&gt; They wrote that attacks may occur in phases and can be disrupted through controls established at each phase. Since then, the "cyber kill chain™" has been adopted by data security organizations to define phases of cyber-attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/3104542/security/why-the-cyber-kill-chain-needs-an-upgradesecurity-pros-need-to-focus-more-on-catching-attackers-aft.html|title=Why the ‘cyber kill chain’ needs an upgrade|last=Greene|first=Tim|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cyber kill chain reveals the phases of a cyber attack:  from early reconnaissance to the goal of data exfiltration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.varonis.com/the-cyber-kill-chain-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-data-breaches/|title=The Cyber Kill Chain or: how I learned to stop worrying and love data breaches|date=2016-06-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kill chain can also be used as a management tool to help continuously improve network defense. According to Lockheed Martin, threats must progress through several phases in the model, including:

# Reconnaissance: Intruder selects target, researches it, and attempts to identify vulnerabilities in the target network.
# Weaponization: Intruder creates remote access malware weapon, such as a virus or worm, tailored to one or more vulnerabilities.
# Delivery: Intruder transmits weapon to target (e.g., via e-mail attachments, websites or USB drives)
# Exploitation: Malware weapon's program code triggers, which takes action on target network to exploit vulnerability.
# Installation: Malware weapon installs access point (e.g., "backdoor") usable by intruder.
# Command and Control:  Malware enables intruder to have "hands on the keyboard" persistent access to target network. 
# Actions on Objective: Intruder takes action to achieve their goals, such as data exfiltration, data destruction, or encryption for ransom.

Defensive courses of action can be taken against these phases:&lt;ref&gt;http://gauss.ececs.uc.edu/Courses/c6055/pdf/attackpatterns.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Detect: determine whether an attacker is poking around
# Deny: prevent information disclosure and unauthorized access
# Disrupt: stop or change outbound traffic (to attacker)
# Degrade: counter-attack command and control
# Deceive: interfere with command and control
# Contain: network segmentation changes

A U.S. Senate investigation of the 2013 Target Corporation data breach included analysis based on the Lockheed-Martin kill chain framework. It identified several stages where controls did not prevent or detect progression of the attack.&lt;ref name=Senate/&gt;

===Critiques of the cyber kill chain===
Among the critiques of Lockheed Martin's cyber kill chain model as threat assessment and prevention tool is that the first phases happen outside the defended network, making it difficult to identify or defend against actions in these phases. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/a-twist-onthe-cyber-kill-chain-defending-against-a-javascript-malware-attack/a/d-id/1326952 | title=A Twist On The Cyber Kill Chain: Defending Against A JavaScript Malware Attack | work=DARKReading | date=September 21, 2016 | author=Laliberte, Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, this methodology is said to reinforce traditional perimeter-based and malware-prevention based defensive strategies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/deconstructing-the-cyber-kill-chain/a/d-id/1317542 | title=Deconstructing The Cyber Kill Chain | work=DARKReading | date=November 18, 2014 | accessdate=June 30, 2016 | author=Engel, Giora}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have noted that the traditional cyber kill chain isn't suitable to model the insider threat. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Reidy-Combating-the-Insider-Threat-At-The-FBI-Slides.pdf | title=Combating the Insider Threat at the FBI | work=BlackHat USA 2013| author=Reidy, Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly troublesome given the likelihood of successful attacks that breach the internal network perimeter, which is why organizations "''need to develop a strategy for dealing with attackers inside the firewall. They need to think of every attacker as [a] potential insider''”. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.oodaloop.com/osint/cyber/2015/02/19/every-cyber-attacker-insider/ | title=Every Cyber Attacker is an Insider | work=OODA Loop| date=February 19, 2015| author=Devost, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Unified Kill Chain==
[[File:The Unified Kill Chain.png|thumb|The Unified Kill Chain consists of 18 unique attack phases that can occur in advanced cyber attacks.]]A unified version of the kill chain was developed to overcome common critiques against the traditional cyber kill chain, by uniting and extending Lockheed Martin’s Kill Chain and MITRE’s ATT&amp;CK framework. The Unified Kill Chain is an ordered arrangement of 18 unique attack phases that may occur in end-to-end cyber attacks, which covers activities that occur outside and within the defended network. As such, the Unified Kill Chain improves over the scope limitations of the traditional kill chain and the time-agnostic nature of tactics in MITRE’s ATT&amp;CK. The unified model can be used to analyze, compare and defend against end-to-end cyber attacks by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.csacademy.nl/images/scripties/2018/Paul_Pols_-_The_Unified_Kill_Chain_1.pdf | title=The Unified Kill Chain | date=December 7, 2017 | author=Pols, Paul | publisher=Cyber Security Academy|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lusterware''' or '''Lustreware''' (respectively the US and all other English spellings) is a type of [[pottery]] or [[porcelain]] with a [[metal]]lic glaze that gives the effect of [[iridescence]], produced by metallic [[oxide]]s in an [[ceramic glaze|overglaze]] finish, which is given a second firing at a lower temperature in a "[[Muffle furnace|muffle kiln]]", [[redox|reduction]] [[kiln]], which excludes oxygen.

Lustre decoration was first used as a [[glass]]-painting technique.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/l/lustre_painted_bowl.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  While some scholars see this as a purely Islamic invention originating in [[Fustat]],&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson, R. 1991. The Islamic Lands and China. In: H. Tait (ed.), Five Thousand Years of Glass. London: British Museum Press, 112-143; p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; others place the origins of lustre decoration in Roman and [[Coptic Egypt]] during the centuries preceding the rise of [[Islam]].  Staining glass vessels with copper and silver pigments was known from around the 3rd century AD,&lt;ref&gt;Carboni, S. 2001. Glass from Islamic Lands. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd., p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; although true [[lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] technology probably began sometime between the 4th and 8th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pradell, T., Molera, J., Smith, A.D., Tite, M.S. 2008.

Lustre glazes were applied to pottery in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 9th century; the technique later became popular in [[History of Iran|Persia]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ten thousand years of pottery'', Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, {{ISBN|0-8122-3554-1}}, pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]], the upper part of the [[mihrab]] is adorned with polychrome and monochrome lusterware tiles; dating from 862 to 863, these tiles were most probably imported from Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=szNMwUFyjbkC&amp;pg=PA40 Catherine Hess, Linda Komaroff and George Saliba (2004), ''The arts of fire: Islamic influences on glass and ceramics of the Italian Renaissance'', Getty Publications, p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=401&amp;lang=en Mihrab of the Great Mosque of Kairouan (Qantara mediterranean heritage)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184012/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=401&amp;lang=en |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam forbade the use of precious metal dishes and vessels for eating, which had been normal for pre-Islamic elites, and there was therefore a market for elaborate and expensive glass and ceramic equivalents.  The reminiscence of shining metal, especially gold, made lustreware especially attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 24-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Lusterware was produced in quantity in [[Egypt]] during the [[Fatimid dynasty]] in the 10th–12th centuries. While the production of lusterware continued in the [[Middle East]], it spread to [[Europe]] through [[Al-Andalus]]. [[Málaga]] was the first centre of [[Hispano-Moresque ware]], before it developed in the region of [[Valencia]], and then to [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Italy]], where it was used to enhance [[maiolica]]. In the 16th century lustred maiolica was a specialty of [[Gubbio]], noted for a rich ruby red, and at [[Deruta]].&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, Chapters 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

After a gap of several centuries in Persian production, it was revived in the [[Safavid]] period from about the 1630s, in a rather different style, typically producing small pieces with designs often in a dark copper colour over a dark blue (cobalt) background. Unlike other Persian wares of the period, these use traditional Middle Eastern shapes and decoration rather than Chinese-inspired ones, and also do not take their shapes from metalware. Designs featured plant forms and animals, and generally flowed freely over the whole surface, typically taking up over half the surface area.  Production, which was never large, appears to have mostly been from about 1650 to 1750, but with rather inferior wares produced into the 19th century.  It is often thought to have been centred in [[Kirman]], though firm evidence is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 80-84; Blair &amp; Bloom, 171&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern lustreware==
[[File:Clement massier.jpg|thumb|Lustreware vase by Clement [[:fr:Massier]], circa 1900]]
Metallic lustre of another sort produced English lustreware, which imparts to a piece of pottery the appearance of an object of silver, gold or copper. Silver lustre employed the new metal [[platinum]], whose chemical properties were analyzed towards the end of the 18th century, John Hancock of Hanley invented the application of a platinum technique, and "put it in practice at [[Josiah Spode|Mr Spode's manufactory]], for Messrs. Daniels and Brown",&lt;ref&gt;Hancock's memoir, quoted by Ross Taggart, ''The Frank P. and Harriet C. Burnap Collection of English Pottery in the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery'', rev. ed. (Kansas City) 1967, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; about 1800. Very dilute amounts of powdered gold or platinum were dissolved in [[aqua regia]]&lt;ref&gt;Aqua regia, a mixture of [[nitric acid|nitric]] and [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;/ref&gt;  and added to spirits of tar for platinum and a mixture of turpentine, flowers of sulfur and linseed oil for gold.  The mixture was applied to the glazed ware and fired in an enameling kiln, depositing a thin film of platinum or gold.&lt;ref&gt;Technical description from Taggart 1967:168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Platinum produced the appearance of solid silver, and was employed for the middle class in shapes identical to those uses for silver [[tea service]]s, ca. 1810-1840.  Depending on the concentration of gold in the lustring compound and the under slip on which it was applied, a range of colours could be achieved, from pale rose and lavender, to copper and gold. The gold lustre could be painted or stenciled on the ware, or it could be applied in the resist technique, in which the background was solidly lustred, and the design remained in the body color. In the resist technique, similar to [[batik]], the design was painted in glue and size in a glycerin or honey compound, the lustre applied by dipping, and the resist washed off before the piece was fired.

Lustreware became popular in [[Staffordshire pottery]] during the 19th century, where it was also used by [[Josiah Wedgwood]], who introduced pink and white lustreware simulating mother o' pearl effects in dishes and bowls cast in the shapes of shells, and silver lustre, introduced at Wedgwood in 1805. In 1810 Peter Warburton of [[New Hall, Cambridge|New Hall]] patented a method of [[transfer-printing]] in gold and silver lustre. [[Sunderland Lustreware]] in the [[North East England|North East]] is renowned for its mottled pink lustreware, and lustreware was also produced in [[Leeds, Yorkshire]], where the technique may have been introduced by Thomas Lakin.&lt;ref&gt;Taggart 1967:169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wedgwood's lusterware made in the 1820s spawned the production of mass quantities of copper and silver lustreware&lt;ref&gt;Silver was produced from platinum salts; fully lustred teasets imitating silver models were introduced in 1823 for middle-class households (L.G.G. Ramsey, ed. ''The Connoisseur New Guide to Antique English Pottery, Porcelain and Glass'' p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; in England and Wales. Cream pitchers with appliqué-detailed spouts and meticulously applied handles were most common, and often featured stylized decorative bands in dark blue, cream yellow, pink, and, most rare, dark green and purple. Raised, multicolored patterns depicting pastoral scenes were also created, and sand was sometimes incorporated into the glaze to add texture. Pitchers were produced in a range of sizes from cream pitchers to large milk pitchers, as well as small coffeepots and teapots. [[Tea set]]s came a bit later, usually featuring creamers, sugar bowls, and slop bowls.

Large pitchers with transfer printed commemorative scenes appear to have arrived around the middle of the 19th century. These were purely decorative and today command high prices because of their historical connections. Delicate lustre imitating [[mother-of-pearl]] was produced by Wedgwood and at [[Belleek Pottery|Belleek]] in the mid-century, derived from  [[bismuth nitrate]].&lt;ref&gt;John Fleming and Hugh Honour, ''Dictionary of the Decorative Arts'', 1977, ''s.v.'' "Lustre".&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the impetus of the [[Aesthetic Movement]], [[William de Morgan]] revived lustrewares in a manner drawing from lustred majolica and Hispano-Moresque wares, with fine, bold designs.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 168-170&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, copper lusterware became popular because of its lustrousness. Apparently, as gaslights became available to the rich, the fad was to place groupings of lusterware on mirror platforms to be used as centerpieces for dinner parties. Gaslights accentuated their lustrousness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

[[File:Great-plate-count-anomaly.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The great plate count anomaly. Counts of cells obtained via cultivation are orders of magnitude lower than those directly observed under the microscope. This is because microbiologists are able to cultivate only a minority of naturally occurring microbes using current laboratory techniques, depending on the environment.&lt;ref name="hugenholz2002" /&gt;]]
'''Microbial ecology''' (or '''environmental microbiology''') is the [[ecology]] of [[microorganism]]s: their relationship with one another and with their environment. It concerns the three major [[domain (biology)|domains]] of life—[[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]], [[Archaea]], and [[Bacteria]]—as well as [[virus]]es.&lt;ref name="BartonNorthup2011" /&gt;

Microorganisms, by their omnipresence, impact the entire [[biosphere]]. Microbial life plays a primary role in regulating [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] systems in virtually all of our planet's environments, including some of the most [[extremophiles|extreme]], from [[Antarctica|frozen environments]] and acidic lakes, to [[hydrothermal vents]] at the bottom of deepest oceans, and some of the most familiar, such as the human [[small intestine]].&lt;ref name="bowler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="konopka"/&gt;  As a consequence of the quantitative magnitude of microbial life (Whitman and coworkers calculated {{val|5.0|e=30}} cells, eight orders of magnitude greater than the number of stars in the observable universe&lt;ref name="whitman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wolfram"/&gt;) microbes, by virtue of their [[biomass]] alone, constitute a significant [[carbon sink]].&lt;ref name="ReddyDeLaune2004"/&gt; Aside from carbon fixation, microorganisms' key collective metabolic processes (including [[nitrogen fixation]], [[Methanogenesis|methane metabolism]], and [[sulfur metabolism]]) control global biogeochemical cycling.&lt;ref name="delong"/&gt; The immensity of microorganisms' production is such that, even in the total absence of eukaryotic life, these processes would likely continue unchanged.&lt;ref name="Lupp"/&gt;

== History ==
While microbes have been studied since the seventeenth-century, this research was from a primarily physiological perspective rather than an ecological one.&lt;ref name="konopka2009"/&gt; For instance, [[Louis Pasteur]] and his disciples were interested in the problem of microbial distribution both on land and in the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Antony|last2=Dücker|first2=Erik|date=2017-04-05|title=When Pasteurian Science Went to Sea: The Birth of Marine Microbiology|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10739-017-9477-8|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|language=en|pages=1–27|doi=10.1007/s10739-017-9477-8|issn=0022-5010|volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martinus Beijerinck]] invented the [[enrichment culture]], a fundamental method of studying [[microbe]]s from the environment.  He is often incorrectly credited with framing the [[microbial biogeography|microbial biogeographic]] idea that "everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects", which was stated by [[Lourens Baas Becking]].&lt;ref name="deWit2006"/&gt; [[Sergei Winogradsky]] was one of the first researchers to attempt to understand [[microorganisms]] outside of the medical context—making him among the first students of microbial ecology and environmental microbiology—discovering [[chemosynthesis]], and developing the [[Winogradsky column]] in the process.&lt;ref name="brock"/&gt;{{rp|644}}

Beijerinck and Windogradsky, however, were focused on the physiology of microorganisms, not the microbial [[habitat]] or their ecological interactions.&lt;ref name="konopka2009"/&gt; Modern microbial ecology was launched by [[Robert Hungate]] and coworkers, who investigated the [[rumen]] ecosystem. The study of the rumen required Hungate to develop techniques for culturing anaerobic microbes, and he also pioneered a quantitative approach to the study of microbes and their ecological activities that differentiated the relative contributions of species and [[catabolic pathway]]s.&lt;ref name="konopka2009"/&gt;

==Roles==
Microorganisms are the backbone of all [[ecosystem]]s, but even more so in the zones where photosynthesis is unable to take place because of the absence of light. In such zones, [[chemosynthetic]] microbes provide energy and [[carbon]] to the other organisms.

Other microbes are [[decomposer]]s, with the ability to recycle [[nutrient]]s from other organisms' waste products.  These microbes play a vital role in biogeochemical cycles.&lt;ref name="FenchelBlackburn2012" /&gt; The [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[phosphorus cycle]], the [[sulphur cycle]] and the [[carbon cycle]] all depend on microorganisms in one way or another. For example, the [[nitrogen gas]] which makes up 78% of the earth's atmosphere is unavailable to most organisms, until it is converted to a biologically available form by the microbial process of [[nitrogen fixation]].

Due to the high level of [[horizontal gene transfer]] among microbial communities,&lt;ref name="mcdaniel"/&gt; microbial ecology is also of importance to studies of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="smets"/&gt;

== Symbiosis ==
Microbes, especially bacteria, often engage in [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships (either [[Mutualism (biology)|positive]] or [[Parasitism|negative]]) with other microorganisms or larger organisms. Although physically small, symbiotic relationships amongst microbes are significant in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] processes and their evolution.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/777261246 |title=Processes in microbial ecology |last=L. |first=Kirchman, David |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199586936 |location=Oxford |oclc=777261246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=López-García |first=Purificación |last2=Eme |first2=Laura |last3=Moreira |first3=David |date=2017-12-07 |title=Symbiosis in eukaryotic evolution |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317300954 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |series=The origin of mitosing cells: 50th anniversary of a classic paper by Lynn Sagan (Margulis) |volume=434 |issue=Supplement C |pages=20–33 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.02.031}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of symbiotic relationship that microbes participate in include [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[commensalism]], [[parasitism]],&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/317664342 |title=The microbial challenge : science, disease, and public health |last=I. |first=Krasner, Robert |date=2010 |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |isbn=978-0763756895 |edition=2nd |location=Sudbury, Mass. |oclc=317664342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and amensalism,&lt;ref name="Microbial interactions2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Faust |first1=Karoline |last2=Raes |first2=Jeroen |date=16 July 2012 |title=Microbial interactions: from networks to models |journal=Nature Reviews. Microbiology |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=538–550 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro2832 |pmid=22796884}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these relationships affect the ecosystem in many ways.

=== Mutualism ===
Mutualism in microbial ecology is a relationship between microbial species and between microbial species and humans that allow for both sides to benefit.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53231924 |title=Understanding bacteria |last=Sheela. |first=Srivastava, |date=2003 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |others=Srivastava, P. S. (Prem S.) |isbn=1402016336 |location=Dordrecht |oclc=53231924}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such example would be [[syntrophy]], also known as cross-feeding,&lt;ref name="Microbial interactions2"/&gt; which is clearly shown in Methanobacterium omelianskii. Although initially thought of as one microbial species, this system is actually two species - an S organism and Methabacterium bryantii. The S organism provides the bacterium with the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which the bacterium needs in order to grow and produce methane.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=López-García |first=Purificación |last2=Eme |first2=Laura |last3=Moreira |first3=David |date=December 2017 |title=Symbiosis in eukaryotic evolution |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317300954 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |series=The origin of mitosing cells: 50th anniversary of a classic paper by Lynn Sagan (Margulis) |volume=434 |issue=Supplement C |pages=20–33 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.02.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reaction used by the S organism for the production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Endergonic reaction|endergonic]] (and so thermodynamically unfavored) however, when coupled to the reaction used by Methabacterium bryantii in its production of methane, the overall reaction becomes [[Exergonic process|exergonic]].&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; &amp;nbsp;Thus the two organisms are in a mutualistic relationship which allows them to grow and thrive in an environment, deadly for either species alone. [[Lichen]] is an example of a symbiotic organism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Amensalism ===
Amensalism (also commonly known as antagonism) is a type of symbiotic relationship where one species/organism is harmed while the other remains unaffected.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; One example of such a relationship that takes place in microbial ecology is between the microbial species [[Lactobacillus casei]] and [[Pseudomonas taetrolens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=García |first=Cristina |last2=Rendueles |first2=Manuel |last3=Díaz |first3=Mario |date=September 2017 |title=Synbiotic Fermentation for the Co-Production of Lactic and Lactobionic Acids from Residual Dairy Whey |journal=Biotechnology Progress |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=1250–1256 |doi=10.1002/btpr.2507 |pmid=28556559}}&lt;/ref&gt; When co-existing in an environment, ''Pseudomonas taetrolens'' shows inhibited growth and decreased production of lactobionic acid (its main product) most likely due to the byproducts created by Lactobacillus casei during its production of lactic acid.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/317664342 |title=The microbial challenge : science, disease, and public heatlh |last=I. |first=Krasner, Robert |date=2010 |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |isbn=9780763756895 |edition=2nd |location=Sudbury, Mass. |oclc=317664342}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lactobacillus casei shows no difference in its behaviour, and such this relationship can be defined as amensalism.

== Microbial resource management ==
[[Biotechnology]] may be used alongside microbial ecology to address a number of environmental and [[economic]] challenges. For example, molecular techniques such as [[Community Fingerprinting|community fingerprinting]] can be used to track changes in microbial communities over time or assess their [[biodiversity]]. Managing the carbon cycle to sequester [[carbon dioxide]] and prevent excess [[methanogenesis]] is important in mitigating [[global warming]], and the prospects of [[bioenergy]] are being expanded by the development of [[microbial fuel cell]]s. Microbial resource management advocates a more progressive attitude towards [[disease]], whereby [[biological control agent]]s are favoured over attempts at eradication. Fluxes in [[microbial communities]] has to be better characterized for this field's potential to be realised.&lt;ref name="verstraete"/&gt; In addition, there are also clinical implications, as marine microbial symbioses are a valuable source of existing and novel antimicrobial agents, and thus offer another line of inquiry in the evolutionary arms race of [[antibiotic resistance]], a pressing concern for researchers.&lt;ref name="Ott"/&gt;

== In built environment and human interaction ==
{{Main|Human microbiota}}
Microbes exist in all areas, including homes, offices, commercial centers, and hospitals. In 2016, the journal ''Microbiome'' published a collection of various works studying the microbial ecology of the [[built environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/builtenvironment|title=Microbiology of the Built Environment|website=www.biomedcentral.com|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study of pathogenic bacteria in hospitals found that their ability to survive varied by the type, with some surviving for only a few days while others survived for months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kramer |first=Axel |last2=Schwebke |first2=Ingeborg |last3=Kampf |first3=Günter |date=2006-08-16 |title=How long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? A systematic review |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-6-130 |journal=BMC Infectious Diseases |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1186/1471-2334-6-130 |pmc=1564025 |pmid=16914034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lifespan of microbes in the home varies similarly. Generally bacteria and viruses require a wet environment with a humidity of over 10 percent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2002-08/how-long-do-microbes-bacteria-and-viruses-live-surfaces-home-normal-room-tem|title=How long do microbes like bacteria and viruses live on surfaces in the home at normal room temperatures?|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[E. Coli|E. coli]]'' can survive for a few hours to a day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bacteria which form spores can survive longer, with ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' surviving potentially for weeks or, in the case of ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'', years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the home, pets can be carriers of bacteria; for example, reptiles are commonly carriers of salmonella.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/November-2012/Raw-Diets-Linked-To-Salmonella/|title=Raw Diets Linked To Salmonella|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''S. aureus'' is particularly common, and asymptomatically colonizes about 30% of the human population;&lt;ref name="Tong2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 2015|title=Staphylococcus aureus infections: epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=28|issue=3|pages=603–661 |doi=10.1128/CMR.00134-14 |pmc=4451395|pmid=26016486|author1=Tong SY|author2=Davis JS|author3=Eichenberger E |author4=Holland TL |author5=Fowler VG}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to decolonize carriers have met with limited success&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healio.com/pediatrics/emerging-diseases/news/print/infectious-diseases-in-children/%257B10db19d3-8aa4-4323-99ce-258fd81b609f%257D/many-factors-involved-in-decolonization-of-s-aureus|title=Many factors involved in decolonization of S. aureus |website=www.healio.com |access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally involve [[mupirocin]] nasally and [[chlorhexidine]] washing, potentially along with vancomycin and cotrimoxazole to address intestinal and urinary tract infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Buehlmann|first=M. |last2=Frei|first2=R. |last3=Fenner |first3=L. |last4=Dangel |first4=M. |last5=Fluckiger |first5=U. |last6=Widmer |first6=A.

=== Antimicrobials ===
Some metals, particularly copper and silver, have antimicrobial properties. Using [[antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces]] is a technique which has begun to be used in the 21st century to prevent transmission of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-bacteria-fighting-super-element-making-a-return-to-hospitals-copper/2015/09/20/19251704-5beb-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html|title=The bacteria-fighting super element making a return to hospitals: Copper|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silver nanoparticle]]s have also begun to be incorporated into building surfaces and fabrics, although concerns have been raised about the potential side-effects of the tiny particles on human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-02-16/health/ct-nanosilver-met-20140216_1_consumer-products-other-antibiotic-drugs-germs |title=Silver nanoparticles kill germs, raise health concerns |access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of biological systems, including [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems (such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s which comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s), to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tavassoly|first=Iman|last2=Goldfarb|first2=Joseph|last3=Iyengar|first3=Ravi|date=2018-10-04|title=Systems biology primer: the basic methods and approaches|url=http://essays.biochemistry.org/content/early/2018/10/02/EBC20180003|journal=Essays in Biochemistry|volume=62|issue=4|language=en|pages=487–500|doi=10.1042/EBC20180003|issn=0071-1365|pmid=30287586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Artificial life]] or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple (artificial) life forms.

An unexpected [[emergent property]] of a [[complex system]] may be a result of the interplay of the cause-and-effect among simpler, integrated parts (see [[biological organisation]]).  Biological systems manifest many important examples of emergent properties in the complex interplay of components. Traditional study of biological systems requires reductive methods in which quantities of data are gathered by category, such as concentration over time in response to a certain stimulus. Computers are critical to analysis and modelling of these data. The goal is to create accurate real-time models of a system's response to environmental and internal stimuli, such as a model of a cancer cell in order to find weaknesses in its signalling pathways, or modelling of ion channel mutations to see effects on cardiomyocytes and in turn, the function of a beating heart.

==Standards==
By far the most widely accepted standard format for storing and exchanging models in the field is the [[Systems Biology Markup Language| Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)]]&lt;ref&gt;Klipp, Liebermeister, Helbig, Kowald and Schaber. (2007). "Systems biology standards—the community speaks" (2007), Nature Biotechnology 25(4):390–391.&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://sbml.org/ SBML.org] website includes a guide to many important software packages used in computational systems biology.  A large number of models encoded in SBML can be retrieved from [[BioModels]]. Other markup languages with different emphases include [[BioPAX]] and [[CellML]].

==Particular tasks==

===Cellular model===
{{Main|Cellular model}}
[[File:Signal transduction pathways.svg|thumb|right|200px|Part of the [[Cell Cycle]]]]
[[File:EltonFW.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Summerhayes and Elton's 1923 food web of Bear Island (''Arrows represent an organism being consumed by another organism'').]]
[[File:Lotka Volterra dynamics.svg|thumb|300px|right|A sample [[Time series|time-series]] of the [[Lotka–Volterra equation|Lotka–Volterra model]].  Note that the two populations exhibit [[Limit cycle|cyclic behaviour]].]]
Creating a cellular model has been a particularly challenging task of [[systems biology]] and [[mathematical biology]]. It involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of the many [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s which comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes.

The complex network of biochemical reaction/transport processes and their spatial organization make the development of a [[predictive modelling|predictive model]] of a living cell a grand challenge for the 21st century, listed as such by the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5806/1696.full American Association for the Advancement of Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

A whole cell computational model for the bacterium ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'', including all its 525 genes, gene products, and their interactions, was built by scientists from Stanford University and the J. Craig Venter Institute and published on 20 July 2012 in Cell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2812%2900776-3 Karr, J. (2012) A Whole-Cell Computational Model Predicts Phenotype from Genotype Cell]&lt;/ref&gt;

A dynamic computer model of intracellular signaling was the basis for Merrimack Pharmaceuticals to discover the target for their cancer medicine MM-111.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2012/02/17/1535-7163.MCT-11-0820.short McDonagh, CF (2012) Antitumor Activity of a Novel Bispecific Antibody That Targets the ErbB2/ErbB3 Oncogenic Unit and Inhibits Heregulin-Induced Activation of ErbB3. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Membrane computing]] is the task of modelling specifically a [[cell membrane]].

===Multi-cellular organism simulation===
An open source simulation of C. elegans at the cellular level is being pursued by the [[OpenWorm]] community. So far the physics engine [https://github.com/openworm/OpenWorm/wiki/Geppetto--Overview Gepetto] has been built and models of the neural connectome and a muscle cell have been created in the NeuroML format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openworm.org/downloads.html OpenWorm Downloads&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein folding===
{{Main|Protein folding problem}}
Protein structure prediction is the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a [[protein]] from its [[amino acid]] sequence—that is, the prediction of a protein's [[tertiary structure]] from its [[primary structure]].  It is one of the most important goals pursued by [[bioinformatics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]]. [[Protein structure prediction]] is of high importance in [[medicine]] (for example, in [[drug design]]) and [[biotechnology]] (for example, in the design of novel [[enzymes]]). Every two years, the performance of current methods is assessed in the [[CASP]] experiment.

===Human biological systems===

====Brain model====
The [[Blue Brain Project]] is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineering]] the [[mammalian brain]] down to the molecular level. The aim of this project, founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of the ''[[Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|École Polytechnique]]'' in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, is to study the brain's architectural and functional principles. The project is headed by the Institute's director, Henry Markram. Using a [[Blue Gene]] [[supercomputer]] running Michael Hines's [[Neuron (software)|NEURON software]], the simulation does not consist simply of an [[artificial neural network]], but involves a partially biologically realistic model of [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name="Brainsim"&gt;Graham-Rowe, Duncan. [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7470--mission-to-build-a-simulated-brain-begins.html "Mission to build a simulated brain begins"], ''NewScientist'', June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Jason. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8012496.stm Simulated brain closer to thought], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped by its proponents that it will eventually shed light on the nature of [[consciousness]].
There are a number of sub-projects, including the [[Cajal Blue Brain]], coordinated by the [[Supercomputing and Visualization Center of Madrid]] (CeSViMa), and others run by universities and independent laboratories in the UK, U.S., and Israel. The Human Brain Project builds on the work of the Blue Brain Project.&lt;ref name="hbp_homepage"&gt;[http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/index.html The Human Brain Project.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705000755/http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/index.html |date=July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hbp_video"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4a-Om-1MrQ Video of Henry Markram presenting The Human Brain Project on 22 June 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of six pilot projects in the Future Emerging Technologies Research Program of the European Commission,&lt;ref name="FET_flagships_homepage"&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/programme/fet/flagship/home_en.html FET Flagships Initiative homepage.]&lt;/ref&gt; competing for a billion euro funding.

====Model of the immune system====
The last decade has seen the emergence of a growing number of simulations of the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/5qn66fvhu6cvlyvc/ Multi-criterion Evolutionary Algorithm with Model of the Immune System to Handle Constraints for Task Assignments - Springer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090518111729.htm|title=Computer Simulation Captures Immune Response To Flu|accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Virtual liver====
The [[virtual liver network|Virtual Liver]] project is a 43 million euro research program funded by the German Government, made up of seventy research group distributed across Germany. The goal is to produce a virtual liver, a dynamic mathematical model that represents human liver [[mathematical physiology|physiology]], morphology and function.&lt;ref name="virtual liver"&gt;[http://www.virtual-liver.de/ Virtual Liver Network.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tree model===
{{Main|Simulated growth of plants}}
Electronic trees (e-trees) usually use [[L-system]]s to simulate growth. L-systems are very important in the field of [[complexity science]] and [[A-life]].
A universally accepted system for describing changes in plant morphology at the cellular or modular level has yet to be devised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html |title=Simulating plant growth |accessdate=2009-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209022645/http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html |archivedate=2009-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most widely implemented tree generating algorithms are described in the papers [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=218427 "Creation and Rendering of Realistic Trees"], and [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0nacdyjpyvxnnef/ Real-Time Tree Rendering]

===Ecological models===
{{Main|Ecosystem model}}
Ecosystem models are [[mathematics|mathematical]] representations of [[ecosystem]]s.  Typically they simplify complex [[food web|foodwebs]] down to their major components or [[trophic level]]s, and quantify these as either numbers of [[organism]]s, [[biomass]] or the [[inventory]]/[[concentration]] of some pertinent [[chemical element]] (for instance, [[carbon]] or a [[nutrient]] [[chemical species|species]] such as [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]]).

===Models in ecotoxicology===
The purpose of models in [[ecotoxicology]] is the understanding, simulation and prediction of effects caused by toxicants in the environment. Most current models describe effects on one of many different levels of biological organization (e.g. organisms or populations). A challenge is the development of models that predict effects across biological scales. [http://www.ecotoxmodels.org/ Ecotoxicology and models] discusses some types of ecotoxicological models and provides links to many others.

===Modelling of infectious disease===
{{Main|Mathematical modelling of infectious disease|Epidemic model}}
It is possible to model the progress of most infectious diseases mathematically to discover the likely outcome of an [[epidemic]] or to help manage them by [[vaccination]]. This field tries to find [[parameter]]s for various [[infectious disease]]s and to use those parameters to make useful calculations about the effects of a mass [[vaccination]] programme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6307">'''Stellar molecules''' are [[molecule]]s that exist or form in [[star]]s. Such formations can take place when the [[temperature]] is low enough for molecules to form – typically around 6000&amp;nbsp;K or cooler.&lt;ref name=Masseron2015&gt;{{citation

==Background==
[[Matter]] is made up by [[atom]]s (formed by [[proton]]s and other [[subatomic particle]]s). When the environment is right, atoms can join together and form [[molecules]], which give rise to most materials studied in [[materials science]]. But certain environments, such as high temperatures, don't allow atoms to form molecules. Stars have very high temperatures, primarily in their interior, and therefore there are few molecules formed in stars. For this reason, a [[chemist]] (who studies atoms and molecules) would not have much to study in a star, so stars are better explained by [[physicist]]s. However, low abundance of molecules in stars is not equated with no molecules at all.&lt;ref name="smol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/stellar-molecules |title=Stellar Molecules » American Scientist |doi=10.1511/2013.105.403 |publisher=American Scientist |date= |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence and research==
Although the [[Sun]] is a star, its [[photosphere]] has a low enough temperature of 6,000 [[kelvin]]s, and therefore molecules can form.  [[Water]] has been found on the Sun, and there is evidence of [[molecular hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in [[white dwarf]] stellar atmospheres.&lt;ref name="smol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="XuJura2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=S. |last2=Jura |first2=M. |last3=Koester |first3=D. |last4=Klein |first4=B. |last5=Zuckerman |first5=B. |title=DISCOVERY OF MOLECULAR HYDROGEN IN WHITE DWARF ATMOSPHERES |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=766 |issue=2 |year=2013 |pages=L18 |issn=2041-8205 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/766/2/L18|arxiv = 1302.6619 |bibcode = 2013ApJ...766L..18X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooler stars include absorption band spectra that are characteristic of molecules.  Similar absorption bands are found in [[sun spot]]s which are cooler areas on the Sun. Molecules found in the Sun include [[magnesium monohydride|MgH]], [[calcium monohydride|CaH]], [[Iron monohydride|FeH]], [[Chromium monohydride|CrH]], [[NaH]], [[hydroxyl radical|OH]], [[Silicon monohydride|SiH]], [[vanadium monoxide|VO]], and [[titanium monoxide|TiO]]. Others include [[Cyanogen radical|CN]] [[Methylidyne|CH]], [[MgF]], [[Imidogen|NH]], [[dicarbon|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[SrF]], [[zirconium monoxide]], [[yttrium monoxide|YO]], [[Scandium monoxide|ScO]], [[borylene|BH]].&lt;ref name=pam/&gt;

Stars of most types can contain molecules, even the Ap category of [[A class star]]s. Only the hottest O, B and A class stars have no detectable molecules.  Also carbon rich white dwarfs, even though very hot, have spectral lines of  [[dicarbon|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Methylidyne|CH]].&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt;

===Laboratory measurements===
Measurements of simple molecules that may be found in stars are performed in laboratories to determine the wavelengths of the spectra lines. Also it is important to measure the [[dissociation energy]] and oscillator strengths (how strongly the molecule interacts with electromagnetic radiation). These measurements are inserted into formula that can calculate the spectrum under different conditions of pressure and temperature. However man-made conditions are often different to stars, because it is hard to achieve the temperatures, and also [[local thermal equilibrium]], as found in stars, is unlikely. Accuracy of oscillator strengths and actual measurement of dissociation energy is usually only approximate.&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt;

===Model atmosphere===
A numerical model of a star's atmosphere will calculate pressures and temperatures at different depths, and can predict the spectrum for different elemental concentrations.

==Application==
The molecules in stars can be used to determine some characteristics of the star. The isotopic composition can be determined if the lines in the molecular spectrum are observed. The different masses of different isotopes cause vibration and rotation frequencies to significantly vary. Secondly the temperature can be determined, as the temperature will change the numbers of molecules in the different vibrational and rotational states. Some molecules are sensitive to the ratio of elements, and so indicate elemental composition of the star.&lt;ref name=astroc&gt;{{cite book |last1=Symposium |first1=International Astronomical Union |last2=Union |first2=International Astronomical |title=Astrochemistry |date=1987 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9789027723604 |page=852 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nLFYEZyEVQgC&amp;pg=PA583 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different molecules are characteristic of different kinds of stars, and are used to classify them.&lt;ref name=pam&gt;{{cite journal |url=|bibcode=1951ASPL....6..114M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there can be numerous spectral lines of different strength, conditions at different depths in the star can be determined. These conditions include temperature and speed towards or away from the observer.&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt; 

The spectrum of molecules has advantages over atomic spectral lines, as atomic lines are often very strong, and therefore only come from high in the atmosphere. Also the profile of the atomic spectral line can be distorted due to isotopes or overlaying of other spectral lines.&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt; The molecular spectrum is much more sensitive to temperature than atomic lines.&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt;

The '''National Oceanography Centre Southampton''' (NOCS) is a centre for research, teaching, and technology development in Ocean and Earth science. NOCS was created in 1995 jointly between the [[University of Southampton]] and the UK [[Natural Environment Research Council]] and is located within the port of [[Southampton]] at a purpose-built dockside campus with modern facilities. In 2010 the University and NERC components demerged, and the NERC-managed component became the [[National Oceanography Centre]] (NOC – with the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory in Liverpool). The two components of NOCS continue close collaboration through the jointly run Graduate School, shared research facilities and laboratories, complementary research groups, and many joint research grants and publications. The University component “Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton” (OES) is part of the Faculty of Natural and Environmental Sciences, (FNES). It was ranked 30th in the world for Earth and Marine Sciences by the [[QS World University Rankings]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="University of Southampton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/news/2014/2/southampton_positioned_30_in_the_world_rankings_for_ocean_and_earth_science.page|title=Southampton positioned 30 in the world rankings for Earth and Marine Sciences|author=University of Southampton|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:AYool NOCS 2004-05-01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|National Oceanography Centre, Southampton at sunset]]

The centre can trace its origins back to the years immediately after [[Second World War]], when the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) was founded.&lt;ref name=NIO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noc.ac.uk/about-us/history/national-oceanography-centre-southampton/history-national-institute-oceanography|title=History of the National Institute of Oceanography|accessdate=1 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919061745/http://noc.ac.uk/about-us/history/national-oceanography-centre-southampton/history-national-institute-oceanography|archivedate=19 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan to create National Oceanography Centre Southampton as a centre of excellence in marine and earth science was formulated in the late 1980s to early 1990s by the Natural Environment Research Council in coordination with the University of Southampton. According to that plan a research and teaching complex was erected on the new Waterfront Campus dock-side location within the [[Port of Southampton]] to become the new home for the former National Institute of Oceanographic Science (from Wormley, Surrey), the Research Vessel Service (from Barry, Wales) and the former University of Southampton departments of Geology and Oceanography. NOCS was officially opened in 1996 as the Southampton Oceanography Centre by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] (he also renamed it the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, in 2005).

The Centre's inaugural director from 1994-99 was [[John Shepherd (scientist)|John Shepherd]], a former Deputy Director of the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] and an [[Earth system science|Earth system scientist]].&lt;ref name="director"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://noc.ac.uk/about-us/history/national-oceanography-centre-southampton/influential-scientists/professor-john-shep | title=Professor John Shepherd FRS | publisher=NOCS | accessdate=5 September 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208084855/http://noc.ac.uk/about-us/history/national-oceanography-centre-southampton/influential-scientists/professor-john-shep | archivedate=8 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart| title = Nonintrusive appliance load monitoring | doi = 10.1109/5.192069 | journal = [[Proceedings of the IEEE]]| volume = 80 | issue = 12 | pages = 1870 | year = 1992 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a process for analyzing changes in the voltage and current going into a house and deducing what appliances are used in the house as well as their individual energy consumption. [[Electric meter]]s with NILM technology are used by utility companies to survey the specific uses of electric power in different homes. NILM is considered a low-cost alternative to attaching individual monitors on each appliance. It does, however, present privacy concerns.

==Background and theory==
Nonintrusive load monitoring was invented by [[George W. Hart]], Ed Kern and Fred Schweppe of [[MIT]] in the early 1980s with funding from the [[Electric Power Research Institute]].&lt;ref name="hart"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = G. W. | authorlink = George W. Hart| title = Residential energy monitoring and computerized surveillance via utility power flows | doi = 10.1109/44.31557 | journal = IEEE Technology and Society Magazine | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 12–16 | year = 1989 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgehart.com/research/nalmrefs.html NALM bibliography 1980–1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NILM fig 1.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 1 from US patent 4858141 showing basic process for NILM]]
The basic process is described in {{US patent|4858141}}. As shown in figure 1 from the patent, a digital AC monitor is attached to the single-phase power going into a residence.  Changes in the voltage and current are measured (i.e. admittance measurement unit), normalized (scaler) and recorded (net change detector unit). A [[cluster analysis]] is then performed to identify when different appliances are turned on and off. If a 60-watt bulb is turned on, for example, followed by a 100-watt bulb being turned on, followed by the 60-watt bulb being turned off followed by the 100-watt bulb being turned off, the NIALM unit will match the on and off signals from the 60-watt bulb and the on and off signals from the 100-watt bulb to determine how much power was used by each bulb and when. The system is sufficiently sensitive that individual 60-watt bulbs can be discriminated due to the normal variations in actual power draw of bulbs with the same nominal rating (e.g. one bulb might draw 61 watts, another 62 watts).

[[Image:NILM fig 8.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 8 from US patent 4858141 showing how differences in reactive power can help distinguish one appliance from another]]
The system can measure both [[reactive power]] and [[real power]]. Hence two appliances with the same total power draw can be distinguished by differences in their [[complex impedance]]. As shown in figure 8 from the patent, for example, a refrigerator electric motor and a pure resistive heater can be distinguished in part because the electric motor has significant changes in reactive power when it turns on and off, whereas the heater has almost none.

NILM systems can also identify appliances with a series of individual changes in power draw.  These appliances are modeled as [[finite state machines]]. A dishwasher, for example, has heaters and motors that turn on and off during a typical dish washing cycle. These will be identified as clusters, and power draw for the entire cluster will be recorded. Hence “dishwasher” power draw can be identified as opposed to “resistor heating unit” and “electric motor”.

==Privacy concerns==
NILM can detect what types of appliances people have and their behavioral patterns. Patterns of energy use may indicate behavior patterns, such as routine times that nobody is at home, or embarrassing or illegal behavior of residents. It could, for example, reveal when the occupants of a house are using the shower, or when individual lights are turned on and off.&lt;ref name="hart" /&gt;

If the NILM is running remotely at a utility or by a third party, the homeowner may not know that their behavior is being monitored and recorded. 

A stand-alone in-home system, under the control of the user, can provide feedback about energy use, without revealing information to others. Drawing links between their behavior and energy consumption may help reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency, flatten peak loads, save money, or balance appliance use with green energy availability. However the use of a stand-alone system does not protect one from remote monitoring.

The accuracy and capability of this technology is still developing and is not 100% reliable in near-real-time, such that complete information is accumulated and analyzed over periods ranging from minutes to hours.

'''Polar seas''' is a collective term for the [[Arctic Ocean]] (about 4-5 percent of [[Earth|Earth's]] [[ocean]]s) and the southern part of the [[Southern Ocean]] (south of [[Antarctic Convergence]], about 10 percent of Earth's oceans). In the coldest years, sea ice can cover around 13 percent of the Earth's total surface at its maximum, but out of phase in the two hemispheres. The polar seas contain a huge [[biome]] with many [[organism]]s.

Among the species that inhabit various polar seas and surrounding land areas are [[polar bear]], [[reindeer]] (caribou), [[muskox]], [[wolverine]], [[ermine]], [[lemming]], [[Arctic hare]], [[Arctic ground squirrel]], [[whale]], [[harp seal]], and [[walrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ARCTIC WILDLIFE|url = http://www.saskschools.ca/~gregory/arctic/Awildlife.html|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090116064515/http://www.saskschools.ca/~gregory/arctic/Awildlife.html|archivedate = 2009-01-16|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These species have unique adaptations to the extreme conditions. Many might be endangered if they cannot adapt to changing conditions. Contrary to popular opinion, the World Wildlife Fund studies for polar bears show that this species has prospered since 1950, attaining five times the numbers found in 1950. In general, Arctic ecosystems are relatively fragile and slow to recover from serious damage.

A large amount of the land in the north polar region is part of Earth's [[tundra]] [[biome]]. South of the Arctic tundra, where temperatures are a little less cold, are the vast forests of conifer trees of the [[taiga|taiga biome]]. North of the Arctic tundra are polar bears and the unique marine life of the Arctic Ocean.&lt;ref name=polar-life&gt;{{cite web|title = Life in the Polar Regions: Animals, Plants, and Others in Extreme Environments|url = http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/polar/polar_life_intro.html&amp;edu=elem|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081208154932/http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link%3D/earth/polar/polar_life_intro.html%26edu%3Delem|archivedate = 2008-12-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arctic ocean]] has relatively abundant plant life. Nutrients from rivers along with mixing and upwelling from storms contribute mixed layer nutrients which are essential for Arctic [[phytoplankton]] development. During summer, nearly continuous solar [[insolation]] encourages [[phytoplankton bloom|phytoplankta blooms]].
The Arctic Ocean is surrounded by [[continent]]s and has a few narrow, relatively shallow connections to the large ocean basins to the south. Large amounts of [[river]]ine [[fresh water]] as well as abundant nutrients (gelbstoff) flow into the Arctic basin from Siberian rivers. The widest continental shelf on the planet is found in the Arctic Ocean, extending more than 1000 kilometers outward from Siberia and Alaska. Consequently, much of the basin is very shallow. On the other hand, the Arctic Ocean contains the deepest, slowest spreading [[mid-ocean ridge]] on the planet which, until 2003, was thought to be inactive volcanically. Since then, however, a dozen active volcanoes have been discovered, illustrating the limited information available for the difficult-to-study Arctic Ocean. The numerous Siberian rivers flowing onto the shallow continental shelf freshen the seawater. These rivers have shown increased flow recently, possibly due to increased global rainfall as a result of climate change. A flow increase may raise the level of riverine nutrients. Severe Siberian drought, as experienced in 2010, could, however, decrease flows.
There is an interest in a potential release of methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas, from methane clathrates present in the Arctic continental shelf sediments, if sufficient ocean warming were to occur.
As much as 80% of the ocean surface is covered by ice in winter, declining to about 60% in summer; ice cover has been declining at a steady and rapid pace.
A large fraction of the ice is multi-year ice, and in the far North the thickness can be more than 2m. In summer, ice tends to melt at the air-sea interface. Surface melt ponds are formed, increasing the [[albedo]].

==Antarctic==
{{see also|Antarctic}}
Most of [[Antarctica]] is covered with a thick layer of [[ice]], with few species permanently living in the ice-covered areas. There are many species of [[penguin]]s in the south polar region. Almost all animals in Antarctica find their food in the Southern Ocean surrounding the continent, and there is abundant marine life in the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref name=polar-life/&gt;

Because of the extreme but constant habitats, small disruption or damage could alter the polar systems. Although they are remote from human world, polar seas are not 'pristine' environments. Compared with the Antarctic region, the Arctic has long history of interaction with man. The polar food web structure can be sensitive to man's 'top-down' control especially with the development and growth of industrial fishing.
Climate change is a natural phenomenon that influences life in polar areas. There is observational evidence that the Antarctica climate is a bellwether for climate change in the northern hemisphere, leading by about 1000 years. The study of Antarctic ice, its distribution, changes in ice volume, and other indicators of the continental climate in Antarctica are at an early stage of development and even earlier stage of understanding. Techniques for studying the terrain beneath the ice are just being explored. Lake Vostok, buried under miles of ice, has not been penetrated to date. There is evidence that it has been out of contact with the atmosphere for millions of years, making it a possible treasure trove of information.

Relatively, the Antarctic seas and [[Southern ocean]] surround the highest, driest, coldest and windiest continent on the earth - [[Antarctica]]. Due to the low mean temperature, there is no riverine input into the Antarctic seas. And little input DOM, POC from land. In addition to relatively thin sea ice, thick and extensive ice shelves (floating glaciers) are present in the Antarctic region. More than 90% of the sea ice is first year (annual) ice and less than 2m thick. The first confirmed sighting of [[Antarctica]] can date back to the 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 10 years of Antarctic protection!|url = http://weblog.greenpeace.org/whales/2008/01/10_years_of_antarctic_protecti.html|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081222121544/http://weblog.greenpeace.org/whales/2008/01/10_years_of_antarctic_protecti.html|archivedate = 2008-12-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in global climate ==
{{See also|Climate of the Arctic|Global warming in the Arctic}}

The polar seas play an important role in the [[global climate]]:
* Carbon export/[[carbon sequestration]]: Effects concentration of [[carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere]].
* [[Dimethylsulfoniopropionate]] (DMSP/DMS) production: DMSP/DMS serves as the nucleus in [[cloud formation]] and changes the regional [[albedo]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].
* [[Earth's energy budget]]: clouds increase albedo, sea-ice increases albedo, ice shelves increase albedo etc.
* Formation of deep and bottom waters: the polar areas are the source of ocean deep and bottom cold waters. Due to the sinking of cold and dense saline waters near Greenland, and at the Antarctic Convergence, among other sites, the global ocean circulation is maintained.

Models predict a latitudinal effect in response to climate change. These would be expected to be first obvious in polar and subpolar regions. The decline of arctic ocean summer ice coverage was assumed to be one such sign, however, the reversal of that trend leaves the question open as the origins of the now reversed 30 year trend. In 1979, the cover of Time magazine was illustrated with an image of arctic ice covering and expanding BEYOND the arctic basin, opinion seems to have little value. Real data reveal the trend of ice coverage to be on the increase. If this increase will continue, only time will tell.  Developed nations ceased the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons and the atmospheric abundance and consequent ozone depletion are generally on the decrease. [[Ozone depletion|ozone hole]] Breaking-off of polar ice shelves is a continuing process with increases in Western Antarctica balanced by decreases in Eastern Antarctica. Careful study has revealed that the volume of ice in Western Antarctica was incorrectly estimated and shows no significant change attributable to climate change over the observation period.

== Characteristics ==
Extreme oscillations in irradiance occur in these regions, for months it may be totally dark (in winter) or light (in summer). Because of the existence of polar ice, surface reflectance of sunlight is very high. In addition the solar angle are relatively quite low. So less light can penetrate into water and becomes bio available to the plants in polar water under the ice cover. Water temperatures are low, but do not change much seasonally. The low temperature and low available high irradiance together limit [[primary production]]. Major nutrients (N, P, Si) are often not limiting [[primary production]]. Blooming of [[Phytoplankton]] happens in summer, because of the decreased salinity (sea ice melt-water), lower mixing, higher stratification, higher temperature and more bio available light.

Ice is very important in structuring environment. It regulates the physics, chemistry and biology of the water column, air-sea exchange, and is also an important habitat.

== Development ==
There is an expected rise in the exploration and development of the Polar Seas due to an increasing demand for fuel and commodities. The emergence of China and India's economy is considered one of the main drivers of this phenomenon due to an unprecedented appetite for raw materials and fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arctic Doom, Arctic Boom: The Geopolitics of Climate Change in the Arctic|last=Zellen|first=Barry|publisher=ABC CLIO|year=2009|isbn=9780313380129|location=Santa Barbara|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Presently, there are still no exact figures that define the oil and gas reserves in the Polar Seas. Initial explorations, however, have resulted in the identification of its potential. For example, Canada's explorations discovered gas and oil in several Arctic locations such as Beaufort, High Arctic (Arctic Islands), Labrador, and Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antarctic Treaty System: An Assessment : Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Beardmore South Field Camp, Antarctica, January 7-13, 1985|last=Polar Research Board|first=|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1986|isbn=0309036402|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arctic Islands alone has an estimated 4.3 billion barrels of oil reserve while those locations that fall within the Alaskan continental shelf have potential recoverable reserves worth $18 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Polar Research Board, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are now 46 nations that are parties to cooperation and treaties covering the polar regions. Several of these, either individually or with partners, conduct research and explorations in the Arctic and Antarctic seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Environment Outlook: Environment for Development, GEO 4|last=United Nations Environmental Programme|first=|publisher=UNEP/Progress Press|year=2007|isbn=9789280728729|location=Valetta|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities are governed by international environmental protocols. However, countries like China, which faces a future oil shortage, are aggressively exploring the region for the purpose of oil extraction despite an international ban on such activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Emerging Politics of Antarctica|last=Brady|first=Anne-Marie|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415531399|location=London|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14302">'''Reinforcement theory''' is a limited effects media model applicable within the realm of communication. The theory generally states that people seek out and remember information that provides cognitive support for their pre-existing attitudes and beliefs. The main assumption that guides this theory is that people do not like to be wrong and often feel uncomfortable when their beliefs are challenged.

Additionally, this theory focuses on the behavior to consequence connection within the ABC model.  This theory, in management, can also be referred to as [[operant conditioning]] or the [[law of effect]].  Quite simply, this theory notes that a behavior will continue with a certain level of frequency based on pleasant or unpleasant results.

==Politics==
Politics provides an excellent setting for the study of reinforcement theory. The statistics on [[Swing vote|undecided voters]] indicate that most people have pre-existing beliefs when it comes to politics. Relatively few people remain undecided late into high-profile elections. For example, about a month prior to the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]], less than one-fifth of likely voters claimed to be undecided (Sidoti, 2008). Much [[Political campaign|political advertising]] is targeted at these individuals not only because of their importance in the overall result, but also because they are the most susceptible to political persuasion (Johnson-Cartee &amp; Copeland, 1997).

Part of the reason why undecided voters are frequent message targets can be found in reinforcement theory. Reinforcement theory predicts that people with already developed opinions will selectively attend to and cognitively incorporate information that supports their own views. Reinforcement theory has three primary mechanisms behind it: [[selective exposure theory|selective exposure]], [[selective perception]], and selective retention.

== Selective exposure ==

The primary basis for the [[selective exposure theory|selective exposure]] assumption can be located within [[cognitive dissonance]] theory, although contemporary work (Knobloch-Westerwick, 2014) draws on numerous theories. Basically, this theory states that people do not like to have previously-held beliefs challenged. When individuals encounter information that is discrepant from their own opinions, they seek to resolve the resultant disharmony somehow. People in general do not like to be wrong. A change or shift in attitude is sometimes interpreted as an admission that the original belief was inaccurate or inadequate. To avoid having their opinions challenged, research indicates that people tend to simply avoid information that might be discrepant in nature (Johnson-Cartee and Copeland, 1997). Support for this tendency to avoid dissonant messages can also be found in mood management theory. Basically, this theory states that people expose themselves to stimuli that are pleasurable and avoid stimuli that might induce a negative reaction (Zillman &amp; Bryant, 1985).

The selective exposure phenomenon focuses on how people manage to avoid incongruent information and primarily encounter information that supports predispositions. Obviously, most are not able to completely avoid all potentially challenging information. In these cases, message receivers may outright reject dissonant messages (Wheeless, 1974). The reasons for rejection are varied and plentiful. For example, the person might justify message rejection by attacking the source's credibility.

A topic as emotional and involving as political preference is especially subject to the selective exposure phenomenon. In fact, Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet (1948) found selective exposure early on to be a necessary link in their theory that campaigns primarily reinforce and activate preexisting political notions. The ever-increasing number of media options further facilitates the public's ability to selectively expose themselves to desired media messages. The explosion of the Internet has put the individual in the driver's seat with regard to what kind of information s/he will encounter. McLeod, Kosicki, and McLeod (2002) stated that information selection and "exposure is much more specialized and individualized" (p.&amp;nbsp;221) in the era of the World Wide Web. Furthermore, [[Cable television|cable channel]] options continue to multiply with specific, niche target audiences in mind. Some researchers worry that this increased level of fragmentation makes it possible for people to effectively avoid diverse viewpoints and perspectives (McLeod, Kosicki, &amp; McLeod, 2002). If a person limits his/her information acquisition to that which is only consistent with a personal point of view, s/he will surely not contribute to a fully informed electorate.

== Selective perception ==
It is not possible to completely avoid all discrepant messages. When exposure to a dissonant message has occurred, the phenomenon of selective perception often follows. This process simply means that people skew their perceptions to coincide with what they desire (Johnson-Cartee &amp; Copeland, 1997). Perception is subjective and dependent on several factors; one factor, for example, is [[MIME|media type]]. Prior research indicates that people who actively process television news tend to engage in more individualized explanations of an event as opposed to those active processors of newspapers (McLeod, Kosicki, &amp; McLeod, 2002). The selective perception discussed here, however, is done in order to reduce dissonance with previously held beliefs (Wheeless, 1974). Several communication theories use this assumption of skewed perception as their basis (i.e., [[Hostile media effect|hostile media phenomenon]], third-person effect).

In the political realm, selective perception often occurs when a voter is presented with a candidate position that he or she does not agree with but supports the candidate otherwise. Sherrod (1971) found that "voters preferring a particular candidate do selectively perceive that candidate's position on an issue in such a way as to make it consistent with their own" (p.&amp;nbsp;554). He pinpointed three primary reasons why the initial disagreement happens. First, the candidate and voter may share political party affiliation, but may not agree on all of the issues. Second, the voter may simply be unaware of the candidate's actual position. Third, [[Peer pressure|social pressure]] to take a particular stand on an issue may exist that causes the voter to be incongruent with his or her preferred candidate (Sherrod, 1971). Selective Perception is not only associated with the voter and the candidate they affiliate with. Selective perception is also seen when someone attacks a political opponent by focusing on a particular issue they disagree with. Voters will ignore any common stances on issues with the opposition, and thus scorch the opponent on one main idea (Falcon, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poliscinewsreview.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/selective-perception-among-voters/|title=Selective Perception Among Voters|date=March 2, 2012|work=PoliSci News Review|accessdate=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of political selective perception can be seen in Barry Ritholtz's Politics and Selective Perception chart. In this chart, we are given the unemployment numbers at specific points in time under different House Majorities. Selective perception allows the user to view this chart in any way they feel is deemed correct, though the chart doesn't reveal really anything about politics or unemployment (Ritholtz, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/11/politics-and-selective-perception/|title=Politics and Selective Perception|date=November 6, 2010|author=Barry Ritholtz|accessdate=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sherrod (1971), there are three potential actions the voter may take to reduce dissonance in this situation. First, the voter may learn about the candidate's stand on the issue and then change either his or her opinion of the candidate or alter his or her own position on the issue in question to bring them in line. Second, the voter may still choose to disagree with the preferred candidate's position and instead will lessen the issue's personal importance. Last, the voter may engage in selective perception and actually misperceive the candidate's position to align better with the voter's own stand than it actually does. This does not require any change in attitude regarding either the candidate or the issue on the part of the voter. Sherrod's (1971) research found the third option to occur with the greatest frequency: he found that voters most often selectively misperceive a candidate's position on an issue rather than either change one's own view or relegate the issue to a status of lesser importance.

== Selective retention ==

The final mechanism behind reinforcement theory has to do with selective retention and recall. This phenomenon occurs when "people remember only those items that are in agreement with their predispositions" (Johnson-Cartee &amp; Copeland, 1997, 94). The ease with which a person can recall information impacts the level and intensity of judgment related to the topic. For example, people who can easily recall an example related to the message are more likely to make an intense judgment about it (Shrum, 2002).

In general, most people are unable to accurately recall current event information presented on the news. Gunter (1991) found that only about 5% of television news viewers could accurately recall details of what they saw a short time after the newscast. Audience factors such as education and [[Social status|socio-economic status]] also affect recall ability (Surlin &amp; Gordon, 1976). Although additional variables such as news presentation and format affect information retention, people generally can better remember messages that are consistent with their own attitudes and beliefs (Wheeless, 1974). Surlin and Gordon (1976) found that political information in particular is more readily retained and summoned up when it supports preexisting beliefs and political opinions. Information that threatens such beliefs is more easily forgotten or lost. This phenomenon also extends to political advertising. Prior research found that a candidate's supporters could more easily bring to mind his/her [[Campaign advertising|political ad]] than the opponent's.

== Organizational Behavior ==
Moving away from politics and toward business organizational management, Stajkovic and Luthans (1997) ''"A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Organizational Behavior Modification on Task Performance 1975-1995".
illustrates that the classical behaviors that Watson(1913) and Pavlov (1927) and reinforcement theory (Ferster &amp; Skinner (1957), Skinner (1938,1966, 1969) and how behavior modification techniques can be applied to the human resources management within corporate organizational settings.  The below model provides a five-step application framework identifying, measuring, analyzing, contingently intervening in, and evaluating employee's task-related behaviors aimed at performance improvement.(Luthens &amp; Krietner (1975, 1985)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5799">'''Rich Donovan''' is a global expert in business development issues surrounding disability and accessibility. He is best known for creating financial instruments that track the intersection of corporate profitability with corporate commitment to disability hiring and best practices. His Return On Disability Index is reported on Bloomberg and has been used as the basis of an Exchange Traded Note (ETN) by [[Barclay’s Bank]] on the [[NYSE Arca]] Stock Exchange.

==Accessibility and Finance Work==

===Development of the Return on Disability Index===

Rich Donovan is a founder of several research and advisory companies that have foregrounded the business case for companies and governments to act on the disability market. In 2008, he founded what is now called '''The Return on Disability Group''' to build metric and models that allow for analysis of corporate activity which help assess how well businesses engage customers and employees with disabilities. The organization’s "Return on Disability Reports" and other models helps companies understand their performance across disability factors that are linked directly to profitability. As well they produce the Return on Disability Indices for the U.S. and Canada markets. These financial tools "recognize public companies that are outperforming in the disability market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rod-group.com/rod-report/companies |title=The RoD Report |publisher=The Return on Disability Group |access-date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RoD US 100 and the RoD Canada 50, are published daily by Bloomberg LP. The indices track the shares of the 100 firms that deal best with disabled people. The Economist notes that in the five years to 2012 the US index had outperformed the broader stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562229 |date=September 8, 2012|title=Disability and business: The new green |publisher=[[The Economist]] |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LIME===
In 2006, Rich Donovan founded Lime Connect.   Lime Connect is an organization whose goal is to find employment for people with disabilities.   The idea with Lime Connect is: “to connect with the brightest people with disabilities from all disciplines.

===Fundamental Concepts===

As one of the early progenitors of the business case for accessibility, Donovan has focused on the following:

* Strategic road maps for companies to do accessibility well. What works within their strategic frameworks.
* What accessibility practices drive value at specific companies that, in turn, drive investor returns
* the notion of Shared value so that the next ten years of growth will come from non-traditional markets such as people with disabilities

Since the 1960s, Roy Ascott has been a practitioner of [[interactive]] [[computer art]], [[electronic art]], [[cybernetic art]] and [[telematic art]].


The historian of art and technology [[Frank Popper]] writes of Roy Ascott:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Frank|title=From Technological to Virtual Art|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-262-16230-2|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Roy Ascott was among the first artists to launch an appeal for total spectator participation ... At present, Ascott is one of the most outstanding artists and theoreticians in the field of telematics.
}}

In his first show (1964) at the Molton Gallery, London [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], he exhibited ''Analogue Structures and Diagram Boxes'', comprising change-paintings and other works in wood, perspex and glass. In 1964 Ascott published "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in ''Cybernetica: journal of the International Association for Cybernetics'' (Namur). In 1968,  he was elected Associate Member of the Institution of Computer Science, London (proposed by [[Gordon Pask]]). In 1972, he became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]].

Ascott has shown at the [[Venice Biennale]], [[Shanghai Biennale]], Electra Paris, [[Ars Electronica]], [[V2 Institute for the Unstable Media]]  [http://framework.v2.nl/archive/archive/leaf/other/default.xslt/nodenr-143122], Milan Triennale, Biennale do Mercosul, [[Brazil]], European Media Festival, and gr2000az at [[Graz]], Austria. His first telematic project was ''La Plissure du Texte'' (1983),  [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_ascott.html]  an online work of "distributed authorship" involving artists around the world. The second was his "gesamtdatenwerk" ''Aspects of Gaia: Digital Pathways across the Whole Earth'' (1989), an installation for the [[Ars Electronica]] Festival in Linz, discussed by  (inter alia) Matthew Wilson Smith in ''The Total Work of Art: from Bayreuth to Cyberspace'', New York: Routledge, 2007. Retrospective exhibitions of his work were shown in May 2009 at Plymouth Arts Centre, England,  then in the Incheon International Digital Arts Festival, Incheon, South Korea in September 2010, and at [[SPACE (studios)]] in Hackney, London in 2011. ''Syncretic Cybernetics'', a comprehensive exhibition of his work, was featured in the 9th [[Shanghai Biennale]] 2012. ''Roy Ascott: The Analogues'' (featuring his work of the 1960s) was shown at the Plug-in Institute ofContemporary Arts [http://www.plugin.org/exhibitions/2013/roy-ascott-analogues], Winnipeg, July-Sept 2013. In September 2014, a mini retrospective of his work was shown in Linz, at the time of his Ars Electronica Golden Nica award [http://www.art-in-berlin.de/royascott2.mp4]. He discussed his work on Geran TV [http://www.art-in-tv.de/videoplaytv.php?id=1525].
The seminal work of 1962, "Video-Roget" [http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/ascott-video-roget-t13977] was acquired in 2014, by the Tate Gallery, London for its permanent collection. Two key works were included in "Electronic Superhighway", at the Whitechapel Gallery, London in 2016 [http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/about/press/press-release-electronic-superhighway/].

== Interactive computer art ==
Since the 1960s, Ascott has been a working with interactive [[computer art]], [[telematic art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmuseum.net/w2vr/timeline/Ascott.html artmuseum.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems art]]. Ascott built a theoretical framework for approaching interactive artworks, which brought together certain characteristics of [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]], [[Fluxus]], [[Happenings]], and [[Pop Art]] with the science of [[cybernetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouthartscentre.org/art/royascott.html|title=Plymouth Arts Centre Blog|work=Plymouth Arts Centre Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also influenced by the writings of [[Gordon Pask]], [[Anthony Stafford Beer]], [[William Ross Ashby]], and [[Frank Honywill George|F.H. George]].&lt;ref&gt;A critical survey of Ascott's work is provided by [[Edward A. Shanken]] in his introductory essay "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott" in Ascott, R. 2003.

'''''Science in Action''''' is a long-running weekly radio programme produced by the [[BBC World Service]] and currently hosted by British journalists Roland Pease&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://journalisted.com/roland-pease |title=Roland Pease |publisher=Media Standards Trust|website=journa''listed'' |language=en |access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marnie Chesterton, and scientist and broadcaster Professor [[Adam Hart]]. It is broadcast on Thursdays at 18.32 [[GMT]] and repeated twice the following day, at 01.32 and 08.32.

A programme with the title ''Science in Action'' is believed to have begun life in 1964, when it replaced an earlier series, dating from the 1950s, called ''Science and Industry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

According to the [[American Psychological Association]], sexualization occurs when "individuals are regarded as sex objects and evaluated in terms of their physical characteristics and sexiness."&lt;ref name=Dewar&gt;{{cite web | last = Dewar | first = Gwen | title = The sexualization of girls: Is the popular culture harming our kids? | url = http://www.parentingscience.com/sexualization-of-girls.html | website = parentingscience.com | publisher = Parenting Science | date = October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "In study after study, findings have indicated that women more often than men are portrayed in a sexual manner (e.g., dressed in revealing clothing, with bodily postures or facial expressions that imply sexual readiness) and are objectified (e.g., used as a decorative object, or as body parts rather than a whole person). In addition, a narrow (and unrealistic) standard of physical beauty is heavily emphasized.

Reports have found that sexualization of younger children is becoming increasingly more common in advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = O'Donohue | first1 = William | last2 = Gold | first2 = Steven R. | last3 = McKay | first3 = J.

Medical and social science researchers generally deployed "sexualization" to refer to a liminal zone between sexual abuse and normal family life, in which the child's relationship with their parents was characterized by an "excessive", improper sexuality, though without recognizable forms of abuse having occurred.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite book | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 | oclc = 123130352 }} [http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; American Psychological Association also argues that the sexualization of young girls contributes to sexist attitudes within society, and a societal tolerance of sexual violence.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

From 2003 to 2005, "sexualization" began to ascend to the status of an issue in the public eye. The cause of this rise was that it became positioned by a number of discursive actors as a feminist issue. This is not to say that a single "feminist perspective on sexualization" emerged in this period; among discursive actors mobilizing feminist discourses, or identifying themselves explicitly with feminism, there were a host of different views. Yet a particular, relatively cohesive position emerged after 2003 among a number of media discourses: these discourses tended to emphasize that, in the context of a commercialized and sexist culture, young women are unable to exercise meaningful choice even when they experience themselves as doing so. These media actors, in their problematization of sexualization, positioned themselves as the true heirs to the feminist tradition and its critical insights, in contrast to contemporary youth.

[[Consumerism]] and [[globalization]] has led to sexualization of girls occurring across all [[advanced economies]], in media and advertisements, to clothing and toys marketed for young girls.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "sexualization" itself only emerged in Anglophone discourse in recent decades. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, the term was infrequently drawn upon by English writers to refer the assignation of a gendered frame to a particular object, such as the gendering of nouns (e.g., de Quincey [1839]1909, 195).&lt;ref name="de Quincey"&gt;{{citation | author-last = de Quincey | author-first = Thomas | author-link = Thomas De Quincey | contribution = Style and language | editor-last1 = de Quincey | editor-first1 = Thomas | editor-last2 = Darbishire | editor-first2 = Helen | editor-link1 = Thomas De Quincey | editor-link2 = Helen Darbishire | title = De Quincey's literary criticism | pages = 181&amp;ndash;196 | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Digital Library | location = New York, NY | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781411457836 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the term "asexualization" saw greater use, as a synonym for sterilization in eugenics discourse from around the turn of the twentieth century (e.g., Lydston 1904).&lt;ref name="Lydston"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lydston | first = G.

== Effects on children ==

In 2006, an Australian report called ''Corporate paedophilia: sexualisation of children in Australia''&lt;ref name=Australia /&gt; was published. The Australian report summarises its conclusion as follows:

:Images of sexualised children are becoming increasingly common in advertising and marketing material. Children who appear aged 12 years and under are dressed, posed and made up in the same way as sexy adult models. Children that appear on magazines are seen older than they really are because of the sexualised clothes they are given to pose in.  "Corporate paedophilia" is a metaphor used to describe advertising and marketing that sexualises children in these ways.

In 2007, the [[American Psychological Association]] published a report titled ''Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls'', discussed below.

In 2010, the [[American Psychological Association]] published an additional report titled " Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls", which performed a study where college students were asked to try on and evaluate either a swimsuit or a sweater. While they waited for 10 minutes wearing the garment, they completed a math test. The results revealed that young women in swimsuits performed significantly worse on the math problems than did those wearing sweaters.The hypothesis is that individuals about to try on the sweaters had less pressure to look beautiful because they were not wearing revealing clothing therefore they performed better.

In 2012, an American study found that self-sexualization was common among 6–9-year old girls. Girls overwhelmingly chose the sexualized doll over the non-sexualized doll for their ideal self and as popular. However other factors, such as how often mothers talked to their children about what is going on in TV shows and maternal religiosity, reduced those odds. Surprisingly, the mere quantity of girls' [[media consumption]] (TV and movies) was unrelated to their self-sexualization for the most part; rather, maternal self-objectification and maternal religiosity moderated its effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = Christine | last2 = Ferguson | first2 = Gail | title = Sexy dolls, sexy grade-schoolers? Media &amp; maternal influences on young girls' self-sexualization | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 67 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 463–476 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-012-0183-x | date = October 2012 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232686658 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2010 the [[Scottish Executive]] released a report titled ''External research on sexualised goods aimed at children''.&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; The report considers the drawbacks of the United States and Australian reviews, concluding:

{{Quote|[T]here is no indication [in the APA report] that the media might contain any positive images about human relationships, or that children might critically evaluate what they see.}}

The Scottish review also notes that:

{{Quote|[s]uch accounts often present the sexualisation of children as a relatively recent development, but it is by no means a new issue …  While the public visibility of the issue, and the terms in which it is defined, may have changed, sexualised representations of children cannot be seen merely as a consequence of contemporary consumerism.}}

It also notes that previous coverage "rests on moral assumptions … that are not adequately explained or justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mayo | first1 = Ed | last2 = Nairn | first2 = Agnes | author-link1 = Ed Mayo | title = Consumer kids: how big business is grooming our children for profit | publisher = Constable | location = London | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781845298807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letting Children be Children: Report of an Independent Review of the Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood (UK)'''
The report 'Letting Children Be Children',&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; also known as the Bailey Report, is a report commissioned by the UK government on the subject of the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood. The report was published in June 2011 and was commissioned as a result of concerns raised as to whether children's lives are negatively affected by the effects of commercialisation and sexualisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=NSPCC | author-link1 =NSPCC |title= Premature sexualisation: understanding the risks: outcomes of the NSPCC's expert seminar series |date= 2011 | publisher= NSPCC | location= London }} [https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/information-service/seminars-premature-sexualisation-understanding-risks.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailey Report is so-called as it was researched and compiled by Reg Bailey, the Chief Executive of the Mothers' Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.mothersunion.org/ | website = mothersunion.org | publisher = Mothers' Union | accessdate = 6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "charity supporting parents and children in 83 countries in the world".&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; The report asked for contributions from parents; children; organisations; businesses and the general public in order to consider their views and inform their recommendations and identified four themes that were of particular concern to parents and the wider public. These themes were:
*1) the "wallpaper" of children's lives
*2) clothing, products and services for children
*3) children as consumers
*4) making parents' voices heard

The report returned recommendations based on the research from interested parties, on each of the key themes, in the form of "what we would like to see". On the theme of "the wallpaper of children's lives" it said that it would like to see that sexualised images used in public places should be more in line with what parents find acceptable, to ensure that images in public spaces becomes more child friendly. On theme two "clothing, products and services for children" the Bailey report said that it would like to see retailers no longer selling or marketing inappropriate clothing, products or services for children. What they would like to see on theme three "children as consumers" is comprehensive regulation protecting children from excessive commercial pressures across all media in-line with parental expectations; that marketers are ethical and do not attempt to exploit gaps in the market to influence children into becoming consumers and to ensure that parents and children have an awareness of marketing techniques and regulations. Finally in terms of "making parents voices heard" it would like to see parents finding it easier to voice their concerns to, and be listened to by, businesses and regulators.&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt;

There is a motion for a [[European Parliament]] resolution going through which gives the following definition of sexualization: {{Quotation|[S]exualization consists of an instrumental approach to a person by perceiving that person as an object for sexual use disregarding the person's dignity and personality traits, with the person's worth being measured in terms of the level of sexual attractiveness; sexualization also involves the imposition of the sexuality of adult persons on girls, who are emotionally, psychologically and physically unprepared for this at their particular stage of development; sexualization&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As opposed to its meaning in relation to [[human sexuality]].&lt;/ref&gt;  not being the normal, healthy, biological development of the sexuality of a person, conditioned by the individual process of development and taking place at the appropriate time for each particular individual.&lt;ref name=draft&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skrzydlewska|first=Joanna|authorlink=Joanna Skrzydlewska|title=Draft report on the sexualization of girls (2012/2047 (INI)) | journal = European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.

== Effects on women of color ==
The sexualization of women of color is different than the sexualization of white women.  The media plays a significant role in this sexualization.

=== Black women ===
In an NPR interview with Professor Herbert Samuels at LaGuardia Community College in New York and Mireille Miller-Young a professor at UC Santa Barbara they talk about sexual stereotypes of black bodies in America and how even in sex work, already a dangerous job, black women are treated much worse than their counterparts due to the effects of their oversexualization and objectification in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= [[Farai Chideya]] (host/producer), Herbert Samuels (guest) and Mireille Miller-Young (guest) |date= 7 May 2007 |title= Sex stereotypes of African Americans have long history |medium= Radio program |series= [[NPR|NPR news]] |language= English |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 |access-date= 9 December 2015 |publisher= [[NPR]] }} [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 Transcript.]&lt;/ref&gt; Black women's bodies are either invisible or hypervisible. In the 1800s, a South African woman named [[Sarah Baartman]] was known as "Hottentot Venus" and her body was paraded around in London and Paris where they looked at her exotic features such as large breasts and behind. Her features were deemed lesser and oversexual. There is also the ''Jezebel'' stereotype that portrays black women as "hypersexual, manipulative, animalistic and promiscuous females who cannot be controlled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mowatt | first1 = Rasul A. | title = Black/female/body hypervisibility and invisibility: a Black feminist augmentation of feminist leisure research | journal = Journal of Leisure Research, Special Issue: Feminist Leisure Research in the Contemporary Era | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 644–660 | doi = 10.18666/JLR-2013-V45-I5-4367 | date = 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominican Women ===
In the Dominican Republic, women are frequently stereotyped as sultry and sexual as the reputation of Dominican sex workers grows.&lt;ref name="Race_class"&gt;Brennan, Denise (2004), "[https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/brennan_selling-sex-for-visas.pdf Selling sex for visas: sex tourism as a stepping-stone to international migration]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Pauline | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 243&amp;ndash;248 | publisher = Wadsworth/Thomson Learning | location = Belmont, California | edition = 9th | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780534609030 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many poor women have resorted to sex work because the demand is high and the hours and pay are often dictated by the workers themselves.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; White European and American men "exoticize dark-skinned 'native' bodies" because "they can buy sex for cut-rate prices".&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; This overgeneralizing of the sexuality of Dominican women can also carries back to the women's homes.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; Even "women who...worked in Europe have become suspect..." even if they had a legal job.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; They have become "exports" instead of people because of their sexualization.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt;

=== Asian women ===
The image of Asian women in Hollywood cinema is directly linked to sexuality as essential to any imagining about the roles they play as well as her actual appearance in popular culture. Asian female fatale's hypersexualized subjection is derived from her sexual behaviour that is considered as natural to her particular race and culture. Two types of Asian stereotypes that are commonly found in media are the Lotus Flower and the Dragon Lady. The Lotus Flower archetype is the "self-sacrificing, servile, and suicidal Asian women." The dragon lady archetype is the opposite of the lotus flower, a "self-abnegating Asian woman…[who] uses her 'Oriental' femininity, associated with seduction and danger to trap white men on behalf of conniving Asian males." According to film-maker and film scholar, Celine Shimizu, "The figure of the Asian American femme fatale signifies a particular deathly seduction. She attracts with her soft, unthreatening, and servile femininity while concealing her hard, dangerous, and domineering nature."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Native American women ===
Starting from the time of white colonization of Native American land, some Native American women have been referred to as "squaw," an Algonquin word for vagina. "The 'squaw' [stereotype] is the dirty, subservient, and abused tribal female who is also haggard, violent, and eager to torture tribal captives."  Another stereotype is the beautiful Indian princess who leaves her tribe and culture behind to marry a white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Mihesuah | first = Devon Abbott | contribution = Finding a modern American indigenous female identity | editor-last = Mihesuah | editor-first = Devon Abbott | title = Indigenous American women: decolonization, empowerment, activism | page = 102 | publisher = [[University of Nebraska Press]] | location = Lincoln, Nebraska and London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780803282865 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Señorita, in an attempt to save her Anglo love interest, utilizes her body to protect him from violence. The Vamp representation "uses her intellectual and devious sexual wiles to get what she wants." The media represents Latinas "as either [a] hot-blooded spitfire" or "[a] dutiful mother".&lt;ref name="Vargas 1993"&gt;{{citation | last = Vargas | first = Deborah R. | contribution = Representations of Latina/o sexuality in popular culture | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Patricia | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 188&amp;ndash;192 | publisher = Cengage Learning | location = Boston, Massachusetts | edition = 9th | year = 2016 | origyear = 1993 | isbn = 9781305093614 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual implications of the "hot-blooded" Latina has become an overgeneralized representation of Latin people.

== American Psychological Association view ==

=== Definition ===
The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in its 2007 Report looked at the cognitive and emotional consequences of sexualization and the consequences for mental and physical health, and impact on development of a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt; The report considers that a person is sexualized in the following situations:
*a person's value comes only from his or her [[Sexual attraction|sexual appeal]] or [[Human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], to the exclusion of other characteristics;
*a person is held to a standard that equates [[physical attractiveness]] (narrowly defined) with being sexy;
*a person is [[sexual objectification|sexually objectified]]—that is, made into a thing for others' sexual use, rather than seen as a person with the capacity for independent action and decision making; and/or
*sexuality is inappropriately imposed upon a person.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

=== Children ===
Some [[cultural critic]]s have postulated that over recent decades children have evidenced a level of sexual knowledge or sexual behaviour inappropriate for their age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaeser | first = Fred | title = Towards a better understanding of children's sexual behavior | url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/74965/towardsabetterunderstandingofchildrenssexualbehavior.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = NYU Child Study Center | date = 30 October 2001 | quote = We know that exposure to sexualized messages, particularly those that are incomprehensible, can have several effects on children. }} ''Fred Kaeser Ed.D. is the Director of Health Services for Community School District Two, NYC.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of this premature sexualization that have been cited include portrayals in the media of sex and related issues, especially in media aimed at children; the marketing of products with sexual connotations to children, including clothing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chambers | first = Suzanna | title = Outrage as Argos sells G-strings for children | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=109621&amp;in_page_id=1770) | work = [[The Mail on Sunday|Mail on Sunday]] | publisher = [[DMG Media]] | date = 14 April 2002 | accessdate = 22 February 2007 | quote = High Street chain Argos has been branded irresponsible for promoting a range of sexually provocative lingerie designed for primary schoolgirls. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of parental oversight and [[discipline]]; access to adult culture via the internet; and the lack of comprehensive school [[sex education]] programs.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamb_Therapy&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Sharon | author-link1 = Sharon Lamb | title = Sex, therapy, and kids: addressing their concerns through talk and play | publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Co | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780393704792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For girls and young women in particular, the APA reports that studies have found that sexualization has a negative impact on their "[[self-image]] and healthy development".&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

The APA cites the following as advertising techniques that contribute to the sexualization of girls:&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;
*Including girls in ads with sexualized women wearing matching clothing or posed seductively.
*Dressing girls up to look like adult women.
*Dressing women down to look like young girls.
*The employment of youthful celebrity adolescents in highly sexual ways to promote or endorse products.
The APA additionally further references the teen magazine market by citing a study by [[Donald F. Roberts|Roberts]] ''et al'' that found that "47% of 8- to 18-year-old [girls] reported having read at least 5 minutes of a magazine the previous day."&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1= Roberts |first1= Donald F. |last2= Foehr |first2= Ulla G. |last3= Rideout |first3= Victoria | author-link1 = Donald F.

==== Cognitive and emotional consequences ====
Studies have found that thinking about the body and comparing it to sexualized cultural ideals may disrupt a girl's mental concentration, and a girl's sexualization or objectification may undermine her confidence in and comfort with her own body, leading to emotional and self-image problems, such as shame and anxiety.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research has linked sexualization with three of the most common mental health problems diagnosed in girls and women: eating disorders, low self-esteem, and depression or depressed mood.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research suggests that the sexualization of girls has negative consequences on girls' ability to develop a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

A result of the sexualization of girls in the media is that young girls are "learning how to view themselves as sex objects".&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; When girls fail to meet the [[thin ideal]] and dominant culture's standard of beauty they can develop anxieties.&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; Sexualization is problematic for young children who are developing their sexual identity as they may think that turning themselves into sex objects is empowering and related to having sexual agency.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

== Products for children ==

Some commercial products seen as promoting the sexualization of children have drawn considerable media attention:
* ''[[Bratz]] Baby'' Dolls marketed at 6-year-old girls that feature sexualized clothing, like fishnet stockings, feather boas, and miniskirts&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt;   
* Highly sexualized and gendered Halloween costumes marketed at young girls, such as the "sexy firefighter", a costume that consists of a tight fitted mini dress and high heeled boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Delisle | first = Riana | title = Halloween costumes are sexualizing our youngest trick-or-treaters | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/raina-delisle/halloween-costumes-sexy-inappropriate_b_6006922.html | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | publisher = [[AOL]] | location = Canada | date = 18 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Girls aged 10 and 11 wearing thongs in primary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Pupils warned not to wear thongs | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2943874.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = [[BBC]] | location = UK | date = 28 May 2003 | accessdate = 22 February 2007 | quote = Parents have been urged by a head teacher to stop their daughters wearing thongs to a primary school. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Clothing such T-shirts being marketed for young children in preschool and elementary school with printed slogans like "So Many Boys So Little Time"&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; 
* Padded bras on bikinis aimed at seven-year-old girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barr | first = Robert (in London) | title = Outrage at girls' padded bikinis | url = http://www.theage.com.au/world/outrage-at-girls-padded-bikinis-20100415-shjf.html | work = [[The Age]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | date = 16 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people regard [[training bra]]s similarly. However, there is also evidence that with the mean age of puberty declining in Western cultures, functional brassieres are required by a higher percentage of preteen girls than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aksglaede | first1 = Lise | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = Kaspar | last3 = Petersen | first3 = Jørgen H. | last4 = Skakkebæk | first4 = Niels E. | last5 = Juul | first5 = Anders | title = Recent decline in age at breast development: the Copenhagen Puberty Study | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 123 | issue = 5 | pages = e932–e939 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2008-2491 | pmid = 19403485 | date = May 2009| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Executive]] report&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; surveyed 32 High street UK retailers and found that many of the larger chains, including [[Tesco]], Debenhams, JJ Sports, and [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] did not offer sexualized goods aimed at children. The report noted that overall prevalence was limited but this was based on a very narrow research brief. Whilst this shows that not all High street retailers were aiming products deemed sexualized by the researchers, the research cannot be taken out of context and used to say that there is not an issue of sexualization.{{original research inline|date=September 2015}}

== Culture and media ==
{{For2|more on the mainstreaming of sex in media and culture|[[pornographication]]}}
Sexualization has also been a subject of debate for academics who work in media and [[cultural studies]]. Here, the term has not been used to simply to label what is seen as a social problem, but to indicate the much broader and varied set of ways in which sex has become more visible in media and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Attenborough | first1 = Frederick T. | author-link1 = Frederick T.

the growth of sexual media of all kinds; for example, erotica, slash fiction, sexual self-help books and the many genres of pornography; 
the emergence of new forms of sexual experience, for example instant message or avatar sex made possible by developments in technology; 
a public concern with the breakdown of consensus about regulations for defining and dealing with obscenity; 
the prevalence of scandals, controversies and panics around sex in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Attwood | first = Feona | title = Sexed up: theorizing the sexualization of culture | journal = [[Sexualities (journal)|Sexualities]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 77–94 | doi = 10.1177/1363460706053336 | date = February 2006 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.452.7825 }} [http://shura.shu.ac.uk/50/1/fulltext.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Attwood | first = Feona | title = Mainstreaming sex the sexualization of Western culture | publisher = I.B.

The terms "[[pornographication|pornification]]" and "[[pornographication]]" have also been used to describe the way that aesthetics that were previously associated with pornography have become part of popular culture, and that mainstream media texts and other cultural practices "citing pornographic styles, gestures and aesthetics" have become more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Paasonen | first1 = Susanna | last2 = Nikunen | first2 = Kaarina |last3 = Saarenmaa | first3 = Laura | authorlink1 = Susanna Paasonen | title = Pornification: sex and sexuality in media culture | publisher = Berg | location = Oxford New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781845207045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, which Brian McNair has described as a "pornographication of the mainstream".&lt;ref name=McNair&gt;{{cite book | last = McNair | first = Brian | title = Striptease culture sex, media and the democratization of desire | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415237345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed alongside an expansion of the cultural realm of pornography or "pornosphere" which itself has become more accessible to a much wider variety of audiences. According to McNair, both developments can be set in the context of a wider shift towards a "striptease culture" which has disrupted the boundaries between public and private discourse in late modern Western culture, and which is evident more generally in cultural trends which privilege lifestyle, reality, interactivity, self-revelation and public intimacy.&lt;ref name=McNair /&gt;

Children and adolescents spend more time engaging with media than any other age group. This is a time in their life that they are more susceptible to information that they receive. Children are getting sex education from the media, little kids are exposed to sexualized images and more information than ever before in human history but are not able to process the information, they are not developmentally ready to process it, and this impacts their development and behavior.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

Sexualization of young girls in the media and infantilization of women creates an environment where it becomes more acceptable to view children as "seductive and sexy".&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; It makes having healthy sexual relationships more difficult for people and creates sexist attitudes. Sexualization also contributes to sexual violence and childhood sexual abuse "where 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys are sexually abused during childhood".&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

The Australian writers, [[Catharine Lumby]] and Kath Albury (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lumby | first1 = Catharine | last2 = Albury | first2 = Kath | title = Introduction: children, young people, sexuality and the media | journal = Media International Australia | volume = 135 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–60 | doi = 10.1177/1329878X1013500108 | date = May 2010 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that sexualization is "a debate that has been simmering for almost a decade" and concerns about sex and the media are far from new.

A tactical decision game is a [[decision game]] that puts students in the role of the commander of a tactical unit who is faced with a challenging problem.  While most tactical decision games depict problems faced by the commanders of military units, &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The tactical decision game is known by a variety of names.  These include ''map problem'', ''tactical problem'', ''one-step [[Military simulation|war game]]'', and ''tactical decision exercise''.

Like other types of decision games, tactical decision games may either be historical or fictional.  If the scenario is based entirely upon a reliable historical narrative, a tactical decision game is also a ''decision-forcing case''.  (Such an exercise may also be called an ''historical map problem''.)  However, if any of the elements in the scenario of a tactical decision game is fictional, then the exercise is a kind of ''fictional decision game''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Tactical Decision Games Before 1800==

In Chapter 14 of ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] tells the story of the Greek general [[Philopoemon]], who made extensive use of tactical decision games.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Philopoemon, Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: “If the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to re-treat, how ought we to set about it? If they should retreat, how ought we to pursue?” And he would set forth to them, as he went, all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected circumstances that he could deal with.”

==Tactical Decision Games in Prussia and Germany==

[[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]], who served as chief of the [[Prussian General Staff]] from 1857 to 1888, made extensive use of tactical decision games to train his subordinates and inform contingency planning.  Called "tactical assignments" (''taktische Aufgaben''), these problems employed fictional scenarios in which ideal units were employed on actual terrain.  Some of these games were gathered into a book, ''Moltkes taktische Aufgaben aus den Jahren 1858 bis 1882'', which was published in 1892 as the second volume of a multi-volume set of Moltke's collected works.  Two years later, an English translation of this book came out under the title ''Moltke's Tactical Problems from 1858 to 1882''.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| url=https://archive.org/details/moltkestactical00armegoog 
| postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sharp contrast to Moltke's tactical decision games, which had no direct connection to actual engagements, those published by [[Julius von Verdy du Vernois]] often made explicit use of real-world events.  The problems contained in the first volume of Verdy's ''Kriegsgeschichtliche Studien nach der applikatorischen Methode'' (''Military Historical Studies by means of the Applicatory Method'') were all based on incidents of the battle that took place between Austrian and Italian forces on 24 June 1866. However, in an attempt to make the games more useful to German officers, he replaced the actual (Austrian and Italian) formations engaged in the battle with an imaginary German infantry division, thereby converting what would have been decision-forcing cases into fictional decision games.  (Originally published in 1876, this work was later translated into English as ''A Tactical Study Based on the Battle of [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Custozza]]''.)

In his earlier (and more famous) work, the four volume ''Studien über Truppen-Führung''), Verdy also used historical events as the starting point for his games.  However, in addition to fictionalizing orders of battle, he also changed the outcomes of particular engagements.  (The word [[Truppenführung | ''Truppen-Führung'']], which is often translated as "troop leading" or "the leading of troops",  refers to the art of handling of combined arms formations:  infantry divisions, cavalry divisions, and army corps.)

==Tactical Decision Games in the United States Armed Forces==

In 1975, the Simulation Center of the [[9th Infantry Division (United States) | 9th Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] published a training package for junior leaders called ''What Now, Lieutenant?''.  Designed to be used in conjunction with a war game of the same name, this package consisted of scenarios that described situations faced by the commanders of battalions, companies, and platoons.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| last= United States Army, 9th Infantry Division 
| year=1975 
| title=What Now, Lieutenant?
| publisher=9th Infantry Division, Fort Lewis, Washington   
| postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, the [[United States Marine Corps Training and Education Command |Education Center]] of the United States [[Marine Corps Combat Development Command|Marine Corps Development and Education Command]] used this package as the starting point for a series of three "instructional pamphlets": ''Tactical Problems for Battalion Commanders'', ''Tactical Problems for Platoon Leaders/Company Commanders'', and ''Tactical Problems for Squad Leaders''.  In addition to twelve problems taken from ''What Now, Lieutenant?'', the ''Tactical Problems ...'' series contained sixteen games that were written expressly for the series by Chief Warrant Officer Bryan N. Lavender, USMC.

Like the scenarios in ''What Now, Lieutenant?'', the games in the ''Tactical Problems ...'' series were based them on descriptions of actual engagements that took place between 1914 and 1953.  Some of these were first-hand accounts written by [[S.L.A. Marshall]], [[Erwin Rommel]],and [[Friedrich von Mellenthin]].  Others were secondary works composed by military historians.) Regardless of the actual events that inspired them, all of the problems were modified to reflect the organization and equipment of the 1980s.  Thus, none of these historically-inspired games can be classified as [[case method | decision-forcing cases]].)

[[File:Anthomyiidae sp. 1 (aka).jpg|thumb|Arthropods (such as flies) are the most abundant terrestrial animals by species count.]]
''' Terrestrial animals''' are [[animal]]s that live predominantly or entirely on land (e.g., [[cat]]s, [[ant]]s, [[spider]]s), as compared with [[aquatic animal]]s, which live predominantly or entirely in the water (e.g., [[fish]], [[lobster]]s, [[octopus]]es), or [[amphibian]]s, which rely on a combination of aquatic and terrestrial [[habitat]]s (e.g., [[frog]]s, or  [[newt]]s). Terrestrial invertebrates include [[ants]], [[Fly|flies]], crickets, grasshoppers and spiders.

==Terrestrial Classes==

The term terrestrial is typically applied for species that live primarily on the ground, in contrast to [[arboreal]] species, which live primarily in trees.

There are other less common terms that apply to specific groups of terrestrial animals:
*'''[[wiktionary:saxicolous|Saxicolous]]''' creatures are rock dwelling. Saxicolous is derived from the Latin word "saxum," meaning a rock. 
*'''[[wiktionary:arenicolous|Arenicolous]]''' creatures live in the sand.
*'''[[Troglofauna]]''' predominantly live in caves.

==Taxonomy==
Terrestrial invasion is one of the most important events in the [[history of life]].&lt;ref&gt;Shear WA: The early development of terrestrial ecosystems. Nature 1991, 351:283-289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vermeij GJ, Dudley R, ''Why are there so few evolutionary transitions between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems?'' Biol J Linn Soc, 2000, 70:541-554.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garwood"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garwood |first1=Russell J. |last2=Edgecombe |first2=Gregory D. |date=September 2011 |title=Early Terrestrial Animals, Evolution, and Uncertainty |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=489–501 |doi=10.1007/s12052-011-0357-y |url=https://www.academia.edu/891357/ |issn=1936-6426 |accessdate=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial lineages evolved in several&lt;!--refers to "seven" phyla, but see below--&gt; animal phyla, among which vertebrates, arthropods, and mollusks are representatives of more successful groups of terrestrial animals.

Terrestrial animals do not form a unified [[clade]]; rather, they share only the fact that they live on land. The transition from an aquatic to terrestrial life has evolved independently and successfully many times by various groups of animals.&lt;ref name="Garwood" /&gt; Most terrestrial lineages originated under a mild or [[tropical climate]] during the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]], whereas few animals became fully terrestrial during the [[Cenozoic]].

When excluding internal [[parasite]]s, free living species in terrestrial environments are represented by the following ten phyla:  [[flatworm]]s ([[planarian]]s), [[Nemertea|nemerteans]] (ribbon worms), [[Nematoda|nematodes]] (roundworms), [[rotifer]]s, [[tardigrade]]s (water bears), [[Onychophora]] (velvet worms), [[arthropod]]s, [[mollusks]] ([[gastropods]]: [[land snail]]s and [[slug]]s), [[annelid]]s and [[chordate]]s ([[tetrapods]]). Roundworms, tardigrades, and rotifers are microscopic animals that require a film of water to live in, and are not considered truly terrestrial. Flatworms, ribbon worms, velvet worms and annelids all depend on more or less moist habitats, as do the arthropods [[centipede]]s and [[millipede]]s. The three remaining phyla, arthropods, mollusks, and chordates, all contain species that have adapted totally to dry terrestrial environments, and contain species that have no aquatic phase in their life cycles.

===Difficulties===
[[File:Pygoscelis papua -Nagasaki Penguin Aquarium -swimming underwater-8a.jpg|thumb| Animals do not fall neatly into terrestrial or aquatic classification but lie along a continuum: e.g., penguins spend much of their time under water.]]
Labeling an animal species "terrestrial" or "aquatic" is often obscure and becomes a matter of judgment. Many animals considered terrestrial have a life-cycle that is partly dependent on being in water. [[Penguins]], [[Pinniped|seals]], and [[walruses]] sleep on land and feed in the ocean, yet they are all considered terrestrial. Many insects, e.g. [[mosquito]]s, and all [[terrestrial crab]]s, as well as other clades, have an aquatic life cycle stage: their eggs need to be laid in and to hatch in water; after hatching, there is an early aquatic form, either a [[nymph]] or [[larva]].

There are crab species that are completely aquatic, crab species that are amphibious, and crab species that are terrestrial. [[Fiddler crabs]] are called "semi-terrestrial" since they make burrows in the muddy substrate, to which they retreat during high tides. When the tide is out, fiddler crabs search the beach for food. The same is true in the [[mollusca]]. Many hundreds of [[gastropod]] genera and species live in intermediate situations, such as for example, [[Truncatella (gastropod)|''Truncatella'']]. Some gastropods with gills live on land, and others with a lung live in the water.

As well as the purely terrestrial and the purely aquatic animals, there are many borderline species. There are no universally accepted criteria for deciding how to label these species, thus some assignments are disputed.

==Terrestrialization==
{{main|Vertebrate land invasion}}
Fossil evidence has shown that sea creatures, likely related to arthropods, first began to make forays on to land around 530 million years ago. There is little reason to believe, however, that animals first began living reliably on land around this same time period. A more likely hypothesis is that these early arthropods' motivation for venturing on to dry land was to mate (as modern horseshoe crabs do) or lay eggs out of the reach of predators.&lt;ref&gt;MacNaughton, R. B et al. First steps on land: Arthropod trackways in Cambrian-Ordovician eolian sandstone, southeastern Ontario, Canada. Geology, 30, 391 - 394, (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; As time went on, evidence suggests that by approximately 375 million years ago&lt;ref name="Garwood" /&gt; the bony fish best adapted to life in shallow coastal/swampy waters (such as ''Tiktaalik roseae''), were much more viable as amphibians than were their arthropod predecessors. Thanks to relatively strong, muscular limbs (which were likely weight-bearing, thus making them a preferable alternative to traditional fins in extremely shallow water),&lt;ref&gt;Hohn-Schulte, Bianca, Holger Preuschoft, Ulrich Witzel, and Claudia Distler-Hoffman. "Biomechanics and Functional Preconditions for Terrestrial Lifestyle in Basal Tetrapods, with Special Consideration of ''Tiktaalik Roseae''." Historical Biology 25.2 (2013): 167-81. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; and lungs which existed in conjunction with gills, ''Tiktaalik'' and animals like it were able to establish a strong foothold on land by the end of the Devonian period. As such, they are likely the most recent common ancestor of all modern tetrapods.

== Terrestrial gastropods ==
{{main|land snail|semi-slug|slug}}
[[Gastropod]] mollusks are one of the most successful animals that have diversified in the fully terrestrial habitat.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; They have evolved terrestrial taxa in more than nine lineages.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; They are commonly referred to as [[land snail]]s and [[slug]]s.

Terrestrial invasion of gastropod mollusks has occurred in [[Neritopsina]], [[Cyclophoroidea]], [[Littorinoidea]], [[Rissooidea]], [[Ellobioidea]], [[Onchidioidea]], [[Veronicelloidea]]&lt;!--listed as Rathouisioidea that consist of the same two families--&gt;, [[Succineoidea]], and [[Stylommatophora]], and in particular, each of Neritopsina, Rissooidea and Ellobioidea has likely achieved land invasion more than once.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt;

Most terrestrialization events have occurred during the [[Paleozoic]] or [[Mesozoic]].&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Gastropods are especially unique due to several fully terrestrial and epifaunal lineages that evolved during the [[Cenozoic]].&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Some members of rissooidean families [[Truncatellidae]], [[Assimineidae]], and [[Pomatiopsidae]] are considered to have colonized to land during the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Most truncatellid and assimineid snails amphibiously live in [[intertidal]] and [[supratidal]] zones from [[brackish water]] to pelagic areas.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Terrestrial lineages likely evolved from such ancestors.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; The [[rissooidea]]n gastropod family [[Pomatiopsidae]] is one of the few groups that have evolved fully terrestrial taxa during the late Cenozoic in the [[Japanese Archipelago]] only.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Shifts from aquatic to terrestrial life occurred at least twice within two Japanese endemic lineages in Japanese Pomatiopsidae and it started in the [[Late Miocene]].&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt;

About one-third of gastropod species is terrestrial.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; In terrestrial habitats they are subjected to daily and seasonal variation in temperature and water availability.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; Their success in colonizing different habitats is due to physiological, behavioral, and morphological adaptations to water availability, as well as ionic and thermal balance.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; They are adapted to most of the habitats on Earth.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; The shell of a snail is constructed of [[calcium carbonate]], but even in acidic soils one can find various species of shell-less slugs.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; Land-snails also live in deserts, where they must contend with heat and aridity.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; Terrestrial gastropods are primarily herbivores and only a few groups are carnivorous.&lt;ref name="Siriboon 2013"/&gt; Carnivorous gastropods usually feed on other gastropod species or on weak individuals of the same species; some feed on insect larvae or earthworms.&lt;ref name="Siriboon 2013"/&gt;

'''The Architect and his Office''' was a landmark report about the state of the British architectural profession in the early 1960s. It was commissioned by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1960 and the report was published in February 1962 with an introduction by [[William Holford, Baron Holford|William Holford]], then President of the Institute. Running to more than 250 pages, the report examined architectural education, fees and salaries, and management and technical competence. It was based on extensive fieldwork including a questionnaire survey and visits to nearly 70 architects' offices of various kinds. Funding of slightly more than £11,000 was provided for the study by the [[Leverhulme Trust]]. 

According to [[Frank Duffy (architect)|Frank Duffy]], in his book ''Architectural Knowledge: the Idea of a Profession'', the study stands as one of the best studies of a profession ever carried out anywhere in the world (page 173). Duffy considers that the study did much to reform architectural practices in Britain, particularly by contributing to the development of the RIBA Plan of Work, a set of discrete stages of the architect's work from inception to completion. As well as each stage being precisely described, the stages also had a precise fraction of the total architect's fee associated with them. However, as Duffy also comments, the identification of the usual work pattern as 'normal services' also implied that many activities known as 'other services' (management, surveying, engineering) lay outside the work of the architect, and architects lost market share as a consequence of such exclusivity (page 179).

[[File:Giambologna sabine.jpg|thumb|''The Kidnapping of the Sabine Women'' by [[Giambologna]], in the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in Florence]]
{{Campaignbox Apocryphal Roman Wars}}

'''The Rape of the Sabine Women''' was an incident in [[Roman mythology]] in which the men of Rome committed a [[Bride kidnapping|mass abduction]] of young women from the other cities in the region.  It has been a frequent subject of artists, particularly during the [[Renaissance]] and post-Renaissance eras.

The word "rape" is the conventional translation of the [[Latin]] word ''[[raptio]]'' used in the ancient accounts of the incident. Modern scholars tend to interpret the word as "abduction" or "kidnapping" as opposed to a [[rape|sexual assault]].  Controversy remains, however, as to how the acts committed against the women should be judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Packman ZM |url=http://journals.co.za/docserver/fulltext/scholia/8/1/scholia_v8_a3.pdf?expires=1480217427&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=4ABED64BF8B19FE8D2E3E99593E3DC0D |title=Rape and consequences in the Latin declamations |journal=Scholia: Studies in Classical Antiquity vol. 8 |date=January 1999 |page=34|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
[[File:Cortona Rape of the Sabine Women 01.jpg|thumb|''Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Pietro da Cortona]], 1627–1629.]]
The Rape occurred in the early history of Rome, shortly after its founding by [[Romulus]] and his mostly male followers. Seeking wives in order to establish families, the Romans negotiated unsuccessfully with the [[Sabines]], who populated the surrounding area. The Sabines feared the emergence of a rival society and refused to allow their women to marry the Romans.  Consequently, the Romans planned to abduct Sabine women during a festival of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune Equester]]. They planned and announced a marvelous festival to attract people from all nearby towns. According to Livy, many people from Rome's neighboring towns attended, including folk from the [[Caenina (Town)|Caeninenses]], [[Crustumerium|Crustumini]], and [[Antemnae|Antemnates]], and many of the Sabines.  At the festival, Romulus gave a signal, at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men.  The indignant abductees were soon implored by Romulus to accept Roman husbands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a10 Livy, Ab Urbe Condita Book 1 Ch. 9, p.15].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Livy]] claims that no direct sexual assault took place, albeit the fuller evidence, when compared with the later history, suggests a seduction based on promises by the Romans and then betrayal of those promises. Livy says that Romulus offered them free choice and promised civic and property rights to women. According to Livy, Romulus spoke to them each in person, declaring "that what was done was owing to the pride of their fathers, who had refused to grant the privilege of marriage to their neighbours; but notwithstanding, they should be joined in lawful wedlock, participate in all their possessions and civil privileges, and, than which nothing can be dearer to the human heart, in their common children."&lt;ref name="Livy"&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a9 1.9].&lt;/ref&gt;

==War with Sabines and other tribes==

[[File:Stella, Jacques, The Rape of the Sabines, mid 17th century.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques Stella]], ''The Rape of the Sabines'', mid 17th century, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]

Outraged at the occurrence, the king of the Caeninenses entered upon Roman territory with his army.  Romulus and the Romans met the Caeninenses in battle, killed their king, and routed their army. Romulus later attacked Caenina and took it upon the first assault. Returning to Rome, he dedicated a temple to [[Feretrius|Jupiter Feretrius]] (according to Livy, the first temple dedicated in Rome) and offered the spoils of the enemy king as ''[[spolia opima]]''. According to the [[Roman triumph#The Fasti Triumphales|Fasti Triumphales]], Romulus celebrated a triumph over the Caeninenses on 1 March 752 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a10 1.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the army of the Antemnates invaded Roman territory. The Romans retaliated, and the Antemnates were defeated in battle and their town captured. According to the ''Fasti Triumphales,'' Romulus celebrated a second triumph in 752 BC over the Antemnates.

The Crustumini also started a war, but they too were defeated and their town captured.

Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonists]] subsequently were sent to Antemnae and Crustumerium by Romulus, and many citizens of those towns also migrated to Rome (particularly the families of the captured women).

The Sabines themselves finally declared war, led into battle by their king, [[Titus Tatius]]. Tatius almost succeeded in capturing Rome, thanks to the treason of [[Tarpeia]], daughter of [[Spurius Tarpeius]], Roman governor of the citadel on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. She opened the city gates for the Sabines in return for "what they bore on their arms", thinking she would receive their golden bracelets. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death with their shields, and her body was thrown from a rock known ever since by her name, the [[Tarpeian Rock]].

The Romans [[Battle of the Lacus Curtius|attacked]] the Sabines, who now held the citadel. The Roman advance was led by [[Hostus Hostilius]], the Sabine defence by Mettus Curtius. Hostus fell in battle, and the Roman line gave way. They retreated to the gate of the Palatium. Romulus rallied his men by promising to build a temple to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Stator]] on the site. He then led them back into battle. Mettus Curtius was unhorsed and fled on foot, and the Romans appeared to be winning.

At this point, however, the Sabine women intervened:

{{bquote|[They], from the outrage on whom the war originated, with hair dishevelled and garments rent, the timidity of their sex being overcome by such dreadful scenes, had the courage to throw themselves amid the flying weapons, and making a rush across, to part the incensed armies, and assuage their fury; imploring their fathers on the one side, their husbands on the other, "that as fathers-in-law and sons-in-law they would not contaminate each other with impious blood, nor stain their offspring with parricide, the one their grandchildren, the other their children. If you are dissatisfied with the affinity between you, if with our marriages, turn your resentment against us; we are the cause of war, we of wounds and of bloodshed to our husbands and parents. It were better that we perish than live widowed or fatherless without one or other of you."&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a13 1.13]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The battle came to an end, and the Sabines agreed to unite in one nation with the Romans. Titus Tatius jointly ruled with Romulus until Tatius's death five years later.

The new Sabine residents of Rome settled on the Capitoline Hill, which they had captured in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a33 1:33]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic representations==
Many treatments of the incident combined a suitably inspiring example of the hardiness and courage of ancient Romans with the opportunity to depict multiple figures, including heroically semi-[[Nude (art)|nude figures]], in intensely passionate struggle.

[[File:Johann Heinrich Schönfeld 004.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Johann Heinrich Schönfeld]]]]

The subject was popular during the Renaissance as symbolising the importance of marriage for the continuity of families and cultures. It was also an example of a battle subject in which the artist could demonstrate his skill in depicting female as well as male figures in extreme poses, with the added advantage of a sexual theme.  It was depicted regularly on 15th-century Italian ''[[cassone|cassoni]]'' and later in larger paintings. A comparable opportunity from the [[New Testament]] was afforded by the theme of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]].

"The masters must be copied over and over again," Degas said, "and it is only after proving yourself a good copyist that you should reasonably be permitted to draw a radish from nature." Degas first received permission to copy paintings at the Louvre in 1853 when he was eighteen. He was most interested in the great works of the Italian Renaissance and of his own classical French heritage, hence this detailed copy of Poussin's painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nortonsimon.org/collections/browse_title.php?id=F.1983.06.P|title=The Rape of the Sabines (after Poussin) - Browse by Title - Norton Simon Museum|website=www.nortonsimon.org|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giambologna===
[[File:Florence Rape of the Sabine Women 3.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Giambologna]] at the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]]]]
16th-century Italo-Flemish sculptor [[Giambologna]] sculpted a representation of this theme with three figures (a man lifting a woman into the air while a second man crouches), carved from a single block of [[marble]]. This sculpture is considered Giambologna's masterpiece&lt;ref&gt;Liam E. Semler, ''The English Mannerist Poets and the Visual Arts'' 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-8386-3759-3}}, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended as nothing more than a demonstration of the artist's ability to create a complex sculptural group, its subject matter, the legendary rape of the Sabines, had to be invented after [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], decreed that it be put on public display in the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in [[Piazza della Signoria]], Florence.

The proposed site for the sculpture, opposite [[Benvenuto Cellini]]'s statue of [[Perseus]], prompted suggestions that the group should illustrate a theme related to the former work, such as the rape of [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] by [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]]. The respective rapes of [[Proserpina]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] were also mooted as possible themes. It was eventually decided that the sculpture was to be identified as one of the Sabine virgins.

The work is signed &lt;small&gt;OPVS IOANNIS BOLONII FLANDRI MDLXXXII&lt;/small&gt; ("The work of Johannes of Boulogne of [[Flanders]], 1582"). An early preparatory [[bronze]] featuring only two figures is in the [[Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]]. Giambologna then revised the scheme, this time with a third figure, in two wax models now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. The artist's full-scale [[gesso]] for the finished sculpture, executed in 1582, is on display at the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]] in [[Florence]].

Bronze reductions of the sculpture, produced in Giambologna's own studio and imitated by others, were a staple of connoisseurs' collections into the 19th century.

===Nicolas Poussin===
[[Nicolas Poussin]] produced two major versions of this subject, which enabled him to display to the full his unsurpassed antiquarian knowledge, together with his mastery of complicated relations of figures in dramatic encounter. One, now at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], was executed in Rome in 1634–35. It depicts Romulus at the left giving the signal for the abduction.

The second version, of 1636–37, now at the [[Louvre Museum]], shows that, though some of the principal figures are similar, he had not exhausted the subject. The architectural setting is more developed.

===Peter Paul Rubens===
{{main|The Rape of the Sabine Women (Rubens)}}
[[Peter Paul Rubens]] painted a version of the subject about 1635–40. It is at the [[National Gallery, London]].

===Jacques-Louis David===
[[File:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|''The Intervention of the Sabine Women'' ([[1799 in art|1799]]).]]
[[Jacques-Louis David]] painted the other end of the story, when the women intervene to reconcile the warring parties. ''The Sabine Women Enforcing Peace by Running Between the Combatants'' (also known as ''[[The Intervention of the Sabine Women]]'') was completed in 1799. It is in the [[Louvre Museum]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

David had worked on it from 1796, when France was at war with other European nations, after a period of civil conflict culminating in the [[Reign of Terror]] and the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], during which David himself had been imprisoned as a supporter of [[Robespierre]]. After David's estranged wife visited him in jail, he conceived the idea of telling the story, to honor his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict. The painting was also seen as a plea for the people to reunite after the bloodshed of the revolution.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The painting depicts Romulus's wife Hersilia — the daughter of [[Titus Tatius]], leader of the Sabines — rushing between her husband and her father and placing her babies between them. A vigorous Romulus prepares to strike a half-retreating Tatius with his spear, but hesitates. Other soldiers are already sheathing their swords.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===John Leech===
[[File:Comic History of Rome p 010 The Romans walking off with the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|[[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]'s satirical version of The Rape of the Sabine Women]]

The English 19th-century satirical painter [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] included in his ''Comic History of Rome'' a depiction of the Rape of the Sabine Women, where the women are portrayed, with a deliberate anachronism, in Victorian costume and being carried off from the "Corona et Ancora" ("Crown and Anchor", a common English pub sign in seafaring towns).

===Pablo Picasso===
[[Pablo Picasso]] visited this theme in his several versions of the ''Rape of the Sabine Women'' (1962–63), one of which is in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. These are based on David's version. These conflate the beginning and end of the story, depicting the brutish Romulus and Tatius ignoring and trampling on the exposed figure of Hersilia and her child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.principisabini.it/glossario/zoom.php?id=23 La tomba del principe sabino — Glossario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102053759/http://www.principisabini.it/glossario/zoom.php?id=23 |date=2011-01-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Christian Nahl===
[[Charles Christian Nahl]] painted the subject in a trio of works entitled ''The Abduction'', ''The Captivity'', and ''The Invasion''.

==Literature and performing arts==
[[Stephen Vincent Benét]] wrote a short story called "The Sobbin' Women" that parodied the legend. Later adapted into the musical ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]'', it tells the story of seven gauche but sincere backwoodsmen, one of whom gets married, encouraging the others to seek partners. After a social where they meet girls they are attracted to, they are denied the chance to pursue their courtship by the latter's menfolk. Following the Roman example, they abduct the girls. As in the original tale, the women are at first indignant but are eventually won over.

The story was parodied by Lady Carlotta, the mischief-making character in [[Saki]]'s short story "The Schartz-Metterklume Method".&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Munro (Saki), ''Beasts and Super-Beasts: Beasts'', available at [http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ Read book online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106102640/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |date=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[midrash]] ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]'' (first attested AD 1624) portrays the story as part of a war between the [[Sabines]], descended from [[Tubal]], and the Roman [[Kittim]] ([[s:Book of Jasher/Chapter 17|Jasher 17:1–15]]). A more detailed version of this narrative is found in the earlier mediaeval rabbinic work ''[[Yosippon]]''.

In 1962, a Spanish "[[sword and sandal]]" film based on the story was made, directed by [[Alberto Gout]]. Titled ''El Rapto de las Sabinas,'' the film was released in the USA under the titles ''[[The Rape of the Sabine Women (1962 film)|The Rape of the Sabine Women]]'' and ''The Shame of the Sabine Women.''

The latest adaptation is a [[The Rape of the Sabine Women (film)|video film, ''The Rape of the Sabine Women'']] without dialogue, which was produced in 2005 by [[Eve Sussman]] and the Rufus Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Rape of the Sabine Women: Present at an Empire’s Corrupted Birth|publisher=[[New York Times]]|author=Roberta Smith|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/arts/design/21sabi.html|date=February 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' features a group of all-male players offering to put on a performance of The Rape of the Sabine Women, to the disgust of the title characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/rosencrantz-and-guildenstern-are-dead/summary.html|title=Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead|work=Shmoop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bambini, Niccolo - Der Raub der Sabinerinnen - 18th c.jpg|thumb|The 18th-century artist [[Niccolò Bambini]] painted the subject at least twice.]]
Scholars have cited parallels between the Rape of the Sabine Women, the [[Æsir–Vanir War]] in [[Norse mythology]], and the [[Mahabharata]] from [[Hindu mythology]], providing support for a [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European]] "war of the functions". Regarding these parallels, [[J. P. Mallory]] states:
{{quote|Basically, the parallels concern the presence of first-(magico-juridical) and second-(warrior) function representatives on the victorious side of a war that ultimately subdues and incorporates third function characters, for example, the Sabine women or the Norse Vanir. Indeed, the ''[[Iliad]]'' itself has also been examined in a similar light. The ultimate structure of the myth, then, is that the three estates of [[Proto-Indo-European society]] were fused only after a war between the first two against the third.&lt;ref name=MALLORY139&gt;Mallory (2005:139).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center (TBRC)''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to seeking out, preserving, organizing, and disseminating [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] texts and [[Tibetan literature]]. Founded in 1999 by [[E. Gene Smith]], TBRC is located in [[Cambridge, MA|Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and hosts a digital library of the largest collection of digitized Tibetan texts in the world.&lt;ref name="Economist obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary- Gene Smith|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17899572/|publisher=The Economist | date=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TBRC's [[Harvard Square]] headquarters facilitates its ongoing cooperative relationships with [[Harvard University]]. TBRC also has international offices in [[New Delhi|New Delhi, India]] and [[Kathmandu|Kathmandu, Nepal]], and a newly opened scanning and text-preservation center located within the E. Gene Smith Library at [[Southwest University for Nationalities]] in [[Chengdu|Chengdu, China]].&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobs|first=Andrew|title=After Winding Odyssey, Tibetan Texts Find Home in China|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/world/asia/after-winding-odyssey-tibetan-texts-find-home-in-china.html|publisher=New York Times|date=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==

To preserve and share the Tibetan literary heritage through the union of technology and scholarship.

== History ==
[[File:Traditional Tibetan Texts.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Traditional Tibetan Texts]]
In the early 1960s, while working on his PhD. at the [[University of Washington]], [[E. Gene Smith]] studied with the Venerable [[Dezhung Rinpoche]]. In 1964, Dezhung Rinpoche encouraged Smith to move to India in order to seek out and study Tibetan books more directly. He gave Smith letters of introduction to show to the lamas living among the [[Tibetan diaspora]].&lt;ref name="Patron Kings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patron Kings Part IX: Gene Smith and TBRC|url=http://khyentsefoundation.org/2010/12/part-ix-gene-smith-and-tbrc/|publisher=Khyentse Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 the [[U.S. Library of Congress]] hired Smith as a field director in [[New Delhi]] where he worked on the Food for Peace humanitarian effort [[Public Law 480]]. Through the program, Smith began to copy and print thousands of Tibetan texts while keeping a version of each one for his own collection. He moved from India to Indonesia in 1985 and then Egypt, along with his collection of 12,000 volumes of texts.&lt;ref name="Patron Kings"/&gt;

In 1997 Smith retired from the Library of Congress and began working to implement his vision of making the preserved texts accessible using the new scanning and digitization technologies that were, at that time, just beginning to become available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Noa|title=Take Note|url=http://www.tricycle.com/-life/take-note|publisher=Tricycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 with friends including [[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor and fellow [[Tibetology|Tibetologist]] [[Leonard van der Kuijp]], he founded the '''Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center''' in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Smith's texts from India that were digitized at TBRC became the foundation for Tibetan studies in the United States.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Religion Journal; War Resister Becomes Savior of Tibet's Literature|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/15/nyregion/religion-journal-war-resister-becomes-savior-of-tibet-s-literature.html?src=pm/|last=Stewart|first=Barbara|publisher=New York Times|date=June 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 with the support of Shelley and Donald Rubin, TBRC moved to [[New York City]] where Smith became an advisor to the [[Rubin Museum of Art]].  Major grants from the Patricia and Peter Gruber Foundation, Khyentse Foundation, and the Shelley and Donald Rubin Foundation allowed TBRC to acquire a significant number of texts, develop its archiving system, and add more professional staff. Starting as Technical Director in 2001, Jeff Wallman was personally selected by Smith to be Executive Director and was appointed by the Board of Directors in 2009.&lt;ref name="Spotlight"/&gt;

Gene Smith died on December 16, 2010. TBRC had scanned 7 million pages of Tibetan texts at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Economist obituary"/&gt;

== TBRC's Work ==
[[File:Tibetan texts and a planetary book scanner; microfilm scanner on the bottom.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Tibetan texts on a planetary book scanner next to a  microfilm scanner]]
TBRC seeks out and preserves undiscovered texts, organizes them into a library catalog system, and disseminates the library online and to remote locations on hard drives so anyone can read, print, or share the texts. Tibetan language texts are cataloged by work, genre, subject, person, and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center Digital Library|url=http://library.hds.harvard.edu/key-e-resources/tibetan-buddhist-resource-center-digital-library|publisher=Andover-Harvard Theological Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the collection contains more than 7,000 works (17,000 volumes, totaling nearly 9 million pages) of Tibetan texts.&lt;ref name="Suber"&gt;{{cite web|title=Suber and Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center Collaborate to Provide Open Access to Tibetan Literature|url=http://library.harvard.edu/08192013-1108/suber-and-tibetan-buddhist-resource-center-collaborate-provide-open-access-tibetan/|publisher=Harvard Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars and students are able to study the physical qualities of the texts since the scans are searchable and zoomable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knafl|first=Anne|title=Library purchases access to important digitized Tibetan texts|url=http://news.lib.uchicago.edu/blog/2013/06/06/library-purchases-access-to-important-digitized-tibetan-texts/|publisher=University of Chicago Library News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 5,000 users from 66 countries currently access the website per day, up from 815 per day in 2006. Between 500,000 and 1,000,000 pages are added every year.&lt;ref name="Spotlight"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spotlight on the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center|url=http://khyentsefoundation.org/2010/02/spotlight-on-the-tibetan-buddhist-resource-center|publisher=Khyentse Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TBRC's work was recognized by the [[Orgyen Trinley Dorje|17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje]] in a letter offering his support, gratitude, and prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Elizabeth|title=BIFF 2013: Find, save, copy, paste 'Digital Dharma' tells of one scholar’s work to save thousands of Tibetan texts|url=http://www.boulderweekly.com/article-10645-biff-2013-find-save-copy-paste.html/|publisher=Boulder Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene Smith's life and TBRC were the subject of the 2012 [[documentary]] [[Digital Dharma]], directed by Dafna Yachin of Lunchbox Communications. [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] film critic John Anderson described the film as, "A divinely inspired gift... also an affectionate tribute to the late E. Gene Smith, the scholar, librarian and ex-Mormon who waged a 50-year struggle to save the endangered texts of Tibetan Buddhism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=John|title=Review: "Digital Dharma"|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/reviews/digital-dharma-1117948104/|publisher=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== TBRC and Harvard ==
In summer 2012 TBRC relocated back to [[Harvard Square]] in Cambridge, MA, where the staff hand-picked by Smith continues its ongoing mission to preserve and provide access to Tibetan literature.

In cooperation with the Harvard University Open Access Project (HOAP), TBRC is currently working to make its entire library completely open access.&lt;ref name="Suber"/&gt; TBRC also coordinates internships with graduate students from [[Harvard Divinity School]] and the Department of South Asian Studies at Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center moves US office to Cambridge, MA|url=http://shambhalasun.com/news/?p=34921|publisher=Buddhadharma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scanning and Text-Preservation in China ==
In 2007, Gene Smith bequeathed his personal collection of 12,000 Tibetan texts to the [[Southwest University for Nationalities]] in [[Chengdu|Chengdu, China]]. These texts are now housed in a newly constructed library that bears Smith's name, and which is now China's pre-eminent center for Tibetan literature.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt;

In October 2013, TBRC opened a scanning and text-preservation center at SWUN's E. Gene Smith Library, where four full-time archivists scan, catalog, and digitize Tibetan manuscripts, some centuries old, that are being brought to the library from around the region as news of its existence spreads. Some of these recent additions, now preserved and accessible in TBRC's digital archive, represent the only known versions of ancient texts.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt;

==Buddhist Digital Resource Center==
TBRC announced the expansion of institutional mission to include the preservation of texts in languages beyond Tibetan, including Sanskrit, Pali and Chinese. To reflect this expansion, they have officially changed organizational name from Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center (TBRC) to [[Buddhist Digital Resource Center]] (BDRC). In 2017, BDRC will begin preserving and making accessible texts in languages beyond Tibetan, starting with Pali, Sanskrit, and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tbrc.org/?locale=bo#!footer/news/20170210 Introducing Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for [[social research|Social Research]]''' ({{lang-de|Institut für Sozialforschung}}, '''IfS''') is a research organization for [[sociology]] and [[continental philosophy]], best known as the institutional home of the [[Frankfurt School]] and [[critical theory]].

==History==
[[Image:InstitutfuerSozialforschung3.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The current building of the Institute for Social Research, at Senckenberganlage 26 in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] {{coord|50.118414|8.65385|type:landmark_region:DE_source:enwiki| display=inline}}]]
The Institute was founded in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1923, where it was (and {{As of|2005|lc=on}} once again is) affiliated with the [[University of Frankfurt am Main]]. It was founded by [[Felix Weil]], a student of the [[Marxist philosopher]] [[Karl Korsch]], with an endowment provided by Weil's wealthy father [[Hermann Weil]]. Its first director, [[Kurt Albert Gerlach]], died before making his mark, and was swiftly followed by [[Carl Grünberg]], a Marxist historian who gathered together fellow "orthodox" [[Marxist]]s at the Institute, including his former pupil [[Henryk Grossman]].   Grünberg was followed by co-founder [[Friedrich Pollock]].

Following a non-fatal heart attack, Grünberg was succeeded in 1930 by [[Max Horkheimer]].  Horkheimer rapidly became the guiding spirit of the Frankfurt School, a group of thinkers that was born under his directorship at the Institute. Horkheimer edited the group's journal ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' (Journal for Social Research) and wrote essays defining a [[critical theory of society]].

The growing influence of the Nazis led the founders to decide in September 1930 to prepare to move the Institute out of Germany, by establishing a branch in Geneva and moving the funds to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;"The Origins of Critical Theory: An interview with Leo Lowenthal" by {{Interlanguage link multi|Helmut Dubiel|de}} in ''Telos'' 49&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, after the rise of [[Hitler]], the Institute left [[Germany]] for [[Geneva]] and then in 1934 moved to [[New York City]].  In New York it became affiliated with [[Columbia University]], and its journal ''[[Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung]]'' was renamed ''[[Studies in Philosophy and Social Science]]''.  It was there that much of the important work of the Frankfurt School thinkers began to emerge, and the Institute's residence in New York was likely partly accountable for its work's favorable reception in American and English [[academia]].

The Institute re-opened in Frankfurt in 1951 under the direction of Pollock.

The Institute has been both a research enterprise and, during its Frankfurt periods, a provider of instruction in sociology at the university there. The current director is [[Axel Honneth]].

'''''Views of the Biblical World''''' (Library of Congress Catalogue Number 59-7767) is a five-volume set of reference books published in 1959 by the International Publishing Company J-M, of Israel.&lt;ref name=IPC&gt;International Publishing Company J-M:  http://www.mbendi.com/orgs/1416/e846.htm  http://www.jewishusedbooks.com/prodview.asp?idProduct=42239&lt;/ref&gt; Also published under the name ''World of the Bible'', the series was acclaimed at the time as a landmark. It was the first publication dedicated exclusively to the correlation of archaeological and historical discoveries in Palestine with biblical texts.

The volumes included contributions from biblical scholars and archaeologists including [[Benjamin Mazar]], [[William F. Albright|William Albright]], [[Yigael Yadin]] and [[Michael Avi-Yonah]]. The books' Editorial Manager was biblical historian Prof. Ory Mazar.

==Landmark publication==
"''Views of the Biblical World''... was the first reference book series to take each chapter, and in some cases even each verse, of the biblical narrative and publish a detailed commentary on the geographical, historical and archaeological discoveries in the Bible Lands related to those passages,” says Jerusalem historian Michael Leon. “The last volume, number 5, was dedicated exclusively to discoveries related to the New Testament.” 

According to a commentary by Ivan Caine, the book series included, “pictures and text [which are even today] invaluable for personal enrichment and... for teachers and preachers in college or clerical classes.” Indeed, some fifty years after its release, the series is still found in most major libraries, Universities and Bible schools.

[[Martin Buber]] wrote that the book series was the first to show, “a comprehensive view of the countries and civilizations amid which the people of the Bible lived and developed.”  Israel's president, [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] wrote that the volumes, “provide students of the Bible throughout the world with a clear picture, based on the most recent scientific conclusions, of the physical, ethnic and historical surroundings in which... the biblical stories [took place].”  &lt;ref name=VBW&gt;Views of the Biblical World: http://www.onenewspage.com/news/Press+Releases/20110722/24229970/Dan-Mazar-Named-To-Chair-Reprint-of-Historic.htm  https://www.amazon.com/Views-Biblical-World-Editorial-Avi-Yonah/product-reviews/B0014NFES0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Updated edition==
Jerusalem historian Dan Mazar has been named by the publishers as the head of the editorial board for the book's reprint.  Mazar has authored numerous works on Christian-Israel relations and Second Temple archaeology and is a former Chairman of the political action group, the Christian Mid-East Conference.  He is the third generation in his family to be involved in this book series: his grandfather [[Benjamin Mazar]] was the original Chairman of the Editorial Board of ''Views of the Biblical World'' in 1959, and his father Ory was the Editorial Manager of the publication.&lt;ref name=Mazars&gt;Benjamin Mazar and Dan Mazar:  https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/11/obituaries/benjamin-mazar-89-israeli-biblical-archaeologist.html http://www.briefingwire.com/pr/dan-mazar-named-to-head-historic-bible-book-release&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wreck Racing''' is a [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] automotive competition team, based in the [[George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering|Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering]].  The team is composed of undergraduate and graduate students from the various schools within GA Tech and is based in the [[Student Competition Center]] on the North edge of Tech's Atlanta campus.  The team's main focus is in the design, fabrication, testing, and racing of production-based sports cars.  Wreck Racing primarily competes in the [[Grassroots Motorsports#Grassroots Motorsports .2420XX Challenge|Grassroots Motorsports Annual Challenge]], but also has competed in local [[SCCA]] and [[BMWCCA]] events.

==History==
The Wreck Racing team was founded by Andrew Sullivan and Andy Powell, both Tech Alumni, and has been an officially chartered student organization since 2005.&lt;ref name="Grassroots Motorsports"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate = 4 May 2011|newspaper = Grassroots Motorsports|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120312083923/http://grassrootsmotorsports.com/articles/extracarricular-activities/|archive-date = 12 March 2012|dead-url = yes|url = http://grassrootsmotorsports.com/articles/extracarricular-activities/|title = Extra-car-ricular Activities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tech Organization - WR"&gt;{{cite web|title = GA Tech Chartered Organizations - Wreck Racing|url = http://jacketpages.gatech.edu/organizations/view/27932|work = GA Tech Database|accessdate = 13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the team was founded, membership has grown rapidly, and the team currently has approximately 50 active members.

==Competition==

Since 2005 Wreck Racing has competed in twelve annual GRM $20XX events and has competed with six separate vehicles including a 1980s VW GTI, a turbocharged E30 chassis BMW, a V8-powered Mazda Miata, a 2JZ MG Midget, a mid-engine Honda Insight, and a V8 swapped BMW E28. 

$2010 Challenge: In 2010 Wreck Racing won the GRM $2010 Challenge, placing 1st overall, 1st in autocross, and 1st in concours, placing above many veteran teams and entries by several professional race shops.&lt;ref name="GA Tech WR Win"&gt;{{cite web|title = Woodruff School News - Wreck Racing|url = http://www.me.gatech.edu/news/news_grm_challenge.shtml|work = GA Tech ME Website|publisher = GA Tech|accessdate = 4 May 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110929153819/http://www.me.gatech.edu/news/news_grm_challenge.shtml|archivedate = 29 September 2011|dead-url = y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Technique WR Win"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nique.net/focus/2010/11/05/tech-races-to-first-place/|accessdate=4 May 2011|newspaper=The Technique}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

$2017 Challenge: Wreck Racing won 1st place in autocross, 1st place in concours, and 1st place overall in the Grassroot Motorsports $2017 Challenge with their 2001 Honda Insight powered by a mid-mounted Subaru EG33 engine. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Higginbotham |first1=Ed |title=$2017 Challenge: Celebrating the Country’s Top Low-Buck Builders |url=https://grassrootsmotorsports.com/news/who-won-the-grassroots-motorsports-2017-challenge/ |website=Grassroots Motorsports |publisher=Grassroots Motorsports Magazine |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Another primary focus of Wreck Racing is to fortify scientific design and analysis methods taught in the GA Tech classrooms through practical application.  The team frequently utilizes finite element and signal analysis, circuit design, CAD modeling and drawing, thermodynamic and fluid dynamic analysis, along with advanced fabrication techniques, such as state-of-the-art CNC milling, radiator fin augmentation, waterjet and plasma cutting, lathe operation, welding, and precision measuring with the goal of producing exceptional vehicle performance while remaining within the severe budget and time restrictions mandated by the competition rules.&lt;ref name="GA Tech WR Win" /&gt;
